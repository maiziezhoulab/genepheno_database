<abstract>
<p>The proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor lay the foundation for brain development. In neural progenitors, activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) has been found to promote proliferation and astrocytogenesis while suppressing neurogenesis. However, our study found that <italic>Stat3</italic> conditional knockout in neural progenitors (<italic>Stat3</italic> cKO) also results in increased proliferation and suppressed neurogenesis. To investigate how STAT3 regulates these processes, we attempted to identify potential STAT3 target genes by RNA-seq profiling of the control (CTL) and <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors. We found that STAT3 promotes the expression of genes involved in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and thereby promotes mitochondrial respiration and negatively regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition, we demonstrated that <italic>Stat3</italic> loss-of-function promotes proliferation via regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and downstream signaling pathways. Our study provides novel insights into the relation between STAT3, mitochondrial metabolism and the process of embryonic neurogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neural development is a complex, orchestrated process consists of multiple elements, including the self-renewal and differentiation of neural progenitors. Neural progenitors divide to self-renew and give rise to neurons in the early embryonic stage, and they become gliogenic in the later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bayer and Altman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>). The self-renewal and differentiation of neural progenitors are fine-tuned by transcriptional factors and other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Martynoga et al., 2012</xref>). Dysregulation of these processes could lead to severe developmental defects such as microcephaly and lissencephaly (reduced neurogenesis), or megalocephaly and autism spectrum disorder (overproduction of neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mochida, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Fang et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays an important role in neural progenitor self-renewal and differentiation. As a member of the STAT family, STAT3 responds to cytokines and growth factors, and is then phosphorylated at tyrosine 705 residue by gp130/LIFR-associated JAK kinase, translocates into the nucleus and activates transcription of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Fu et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Schindler et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Darnell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Levy and Darnell, 2002</xref>). In addition, STAT3 also promotes gene expression in a tyrosine-phosphorylation-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Yang et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In embryonic neural progenitors, STAT3 has been found to be sufficient and necessary for astrocytogenesis: activation of STAT3 by IL6 family cytokines promotes the astrocyte marker GFAP expression, which is diminished in the Stat3 conditional knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bonni et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Nakashima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hong and Song, 2014</xref>). Mechanistically, activated STAT3 form a complex with SMAD1 and p300 and bind to the GFAP promoter to induce its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Nakashima et al., 1999</xref>). During the neurogenesis phase, activation of STAT3 also promotes cell proliferation and negatively regulates neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Gu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Yoshimatsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hong and Song, 2015</xref>). However, knockout of STAT3 in astrocytes also resulted in a decreased proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">de la Iglesia et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>STAT3 has been shown to be involved in mitochondrial metabolism in the central nervous system, which might play an important role in cell survival and axon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Sarafian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Luo et al., 2016</xref>), but the causal mechanism remained unclear. It has also been shown that STAT3 could be translocated into mitochondria, and then promotes respiration by binding to protein complexes such as Complex I, or by regulating mitochondrial transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Wegrzyn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Macias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Carbognin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). However, whether mitochondrial STAT3 could regulate mitochondrial metabolism was still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Phillips et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, our previous report found that STAT3 does not localize in mitochondria, but in the mitochondria associated membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Su et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, STAT3 might regulate mitochondrial metabolism via other pathways.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that conditional knockout of STAT3 in neural progenitors also leads to increased proliferation and deteriorated neurogenesis. In addition, we found that STAT3 is not necessary for astrocyte differentiation, but instead only required for the expression of GFAP. To investigate the role of STAT3 in neural progenitor, we used RNA-seq analysis to uncover STAT3-dependent genes. We demonstrated that STAT3 promotes expression of genes that involve in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and thereby promotes mitochondrial respiration. We demonstrated that this regulation is critical for <italic>Stat3</italic>-mediated neurogenesis. Our findings provide novel insights into the link between mitochondrial metabolism and the process of neurogenesis in brain development.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>The generation of mice with a conditional KO of <italic>Stat3</italic> has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Welte et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Moh et al., 2007</xref>). Exons 18â20, which contain the SH2 domain of STAT3, were flanked by two lox P sites. Nestin-Cre transgenic mice [The Jackson Laboratory mice database: B6.Cg(SJL)-TgN(Nes-cre)1Kln] expressing Cre under the control of a rat Nestin promoter/enhancer were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Tronche et al., 1999</xref>). The Nestin-Cre <italic>Stat3-flox/flox</italic> (<italic>Stat3-f/f</italic>) mutant mice, designated as <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO, were generated by mating Nestin-Cre <italic>Stat3-f/</italic>+ mice with <italic>Stat3-f/f</italic> mice. The genotype was determined by PCR as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Welte et al., 2003</xref>). The genotyping primers sequence is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. The sample result of genotyping is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. As the transgenic Nestin-Cre expression has been reported to cause metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Harno et al., 2013</xref>), here we use Nestin-cre; <italic>Stat3</italic>-flox/+ embryos as control (C; F/+) to account for the possible confounding effects. In addition, the control (C; F/+) mice are born in Mendelian ratios without observable growth defects. All experiments were done in a C57BL6 background. All procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and under the approval of the NUS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<title>The Cell Culture of Primary Embryonic Neural Progenitors</title>
<p>The primary neural progenitor culture was achieved according to an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Pacey et al., 2006</xref>) with some adjustment. In brief, pregnant mice were sacrificed by CO<sub>2</sub> overdose at the designated pregnancy stage. Embryonic brains were dissected and subjected to digestion with Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to isolate neural progenitors. The cells were then subjected to suspension culture in serum-free medium (SFM) supplemented with EGF and FGF at the density of 2 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml. Fresh medium was replenished every other day. Cells grown into neurospheres were collected on the 3rd day for RNA/protein sample preparation. For differentiation assay in attachment culture, neurospheres were dissociated and cells were seeded onto poly-<sc>D</sc>-lysine and laminin (Sigma-Aldrich) coated coverslip at the density of 1 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in SFM with EGF/FGF (Sigma-Aldrich) supplement. To differentiate neural progenitors into neurons and glial cells, EGF and FGF were withdrawn on the 1st day after attachment. Half of the SFM was changed every other day, and the cells were collected for immunostaining or RNA/protein sample preparation. The detailed components of SFM and their source can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>.</p>

<p>Cells were collected by trypsinization and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at 4Â°C overnight and washed once with intracellular staining buffer (ICSB, 1% FBS in PBS with 0.01% sodium azide). Cells were then permeabilized by 90% ice-cold methanol and washed once with ICSB. (For staining of BrdU, cells were then treated with DNase for 1 h at 37Â°C to expose the antigen, and washed once with ICSB.) Subsequently, cells were incubated with primary antibody diluted in ICSB for 1hr at room temperature, washed once, followed by fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody incubation for 30 min. cells were then stained with DAPI or TO-PRO, washed once and subjected to flow cytometry analysis.</p>

<title>Stat3 Deletion in Neural Progenitors Resulted in Faster Proliferation and Reduced Neurogenesis</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the function of STAT3 in neural progenitors using the Nestin-cre; Stat3-flox mice, which achieves <italic>Stat3</italic> conditional KO in neural progenitors by E14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Tronche et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Moh et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). To determine the effect of STAT3 on neural progenitor proliferation, we carried out the primary neurosphere growth assay on neural progenitors isolated from E15.5 embryos. Intriguingly, we found that deletion of <italic>Stat3</italic> in neural progenitor cells leads to an increase of neurosphere size compared to the control (CTL), indicating a faster cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, the CFSE proliferation assay further confirmed an accelerated mitosis pace in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) compare to control neural progenitors, suggesting a potential role of STAT3 as a negative regulator of neural progenitor proliferation. Consistently, we found that the developing cortex of <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO contains higher numbers of Sox2+ and Ki-67+ cells compared to the CTL, indicating that <italic>Stat3</italic> deletion promotes self-renewal and proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F,I,J</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine how <italic>Stat3</italic> deletion affects the differentiation potential of neural progenitors, we quantified the MAP2<sup>+</sup> neurons and the GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes in the differentiated CTL and <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors. We found that conditional deletion of Stat3 resulted in fewer MAP2<sup>+</sup> neuron generation and abolished astrocyte differentiation associated GFAP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C,D</xref>). Immunostaining experiment of postnatal day 1 brain slices also demonstrated that <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO leads to decreased neuronal differentiation, as was shown by the decreased NeuN+ cell percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G,K</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine if astrogenesis is indeed inhibited in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO, we analyzed the expression of the pan-astrocyte marker ALDH1L1, along with GFAP, in differentiated neural progenitors. Interestingly, ALDH1L1 expression was not affected by <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO, while that of GFAP was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, we found that <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO generated a higher percentage of ALDH1L1+ cells compared to the CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1H,L</xref>).

<title>Expression Profile Analysis of Stat3 cKO in Neural Progenitor Cells</title>
<p>To gain insight into the downstream pathway of STAT3 in neural progenitors, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on the CTL and <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors isolated from E11 or E14 embryos. For the expression analysis, the RNA-seq data were processed using the Tophat-Cufflinks workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>), then clustered according to their expression level differential in the CTL and <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO populations at the E11 and E14 stages. To filter for potential direct target genes of STAT3, the genes that were differentially expressed were cross-referenced with the DECODE database to identify those with the potential STAT3 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A,B</xref>). Genes that were uniquely upregulated in control cells from E11 to E14 compare to that of <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO cells are potentially STAT3 target genes, which were further analyzed using the gene-set enrichment tool, DAVID, for gene annotation and pathway enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Huang da et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Functional annotation of the potential STAT3 target genes by cellular compartment (GO_CC) localized a significant set of enriched genes to the mitochondria. Consistent with this finding, annotation with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway revealed that the putative STAT3 target genes are mainly enriched in the Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, and to a lesser extent in other pathways such as purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and one carbon pool by folate. These genes were also enriched in pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntingtonâs disease, Parkinsonâs disease and Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Given our findings that STAT3 is required for the differentiation of neurons and astrocytes, we next examined the expression of marker genes of different cell types, such as radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), neurons and astrocytes. We found that compared to the CTL, <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors showed increased expression of radial glia markers such as <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Pax6</italic>, and <italic>Sfrp2</italic>, and decreased expression of most IPC and neuronal markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figures S2AâC</xref>). The majority of glial markers such as <italic>Aqp4</italic>, <italic>Aldh1l1</italic>, and <italic>Mfge8</italic> were upregulated in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO progenitors, while <italic>Gfap</italic> expression was suppressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>). These results support our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings that <italic>Stat3</italic> loss-of-function led to decreased neuron differentiation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO also resulted in the increased expression of upper layer (layer II-III) neuron markers such as <italic>Cux1</italic>, <italic>Cux2</italic>, but decreased expression of deeper layer (layer IV-VII) markers such as <italic>Ctip2</italic> and <italic>Tbr1</italic>. This result is consistent with previous reports by Hong et al. that <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO resulted in a larger number of upper layer neuron generation, suggesting a possibility that STAT3 might function to regulate layer specification during cortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hong and Song, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S2E</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate our RNA-seq results showing differential expression of OXPHOS genes, we performed quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) to compare expression of selected genes, including complex I genes (<italic>Ndufa1</italic>, <italic>Ndufb5</italic>, <italic>Ndufb7</italic>, <italic>Ndufc1</italic> and <italic>Ndufs1</italic>), complex III genes (<italic>Cyc1</italic> and <italic>Uqcrh</italic>), as well as complex V genes (<italic>Atp5b</italic>, <italic>Atp5g1</italic>, <italic>Atp5h</italic>, and <italic>Atp5o</italic>), in CTL and <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors at E12 and E14. In agreement with the RNA-seq analysis, we found that the expression of these putative STAT3 target OXPHOS genes was significantly upregulated in E14 CTL neural progenitors, and significantly downregulated in E14 <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the protein level of OXPHOS genes was not altered in Stat3 cKO neural progenitors at E14. We speculated that the change in the protein level might become evident in the later stage due to delayed response of protein turnover. Indeed, the OXPHOS protein level was downregulated in Stat3 cKO neural progenitors at E17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To further confirm that STAT3 regulate the OXPHOS gene expression, we examined the expression of OXPHOS genes in neural cells with drug/genetic-modulated STAT3 activity. Expression of these OXPHOS genes was downregulated under treatment of STA-21 in E14 neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). In addition, the deletion of <italic>Stat3</italic> with CRISPR in ESC-derived mouse neural stem cells led to the downregulation of OXPHOS genes, while overexpression of STAT3 in Neuro2A cells upregulated OXPHOS gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figures S3C,D</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly support that STAT3 is indispensable for the transcription regulation of OXPHOS genes during neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether STAT3 directly regulates the expression of the OXPHOS genes. By performing ChIP-qPCR assays using E14 WT neural progenitors, we found that STAT3 bound to the promoter or enhancer loci of a significant proportion of the target OXPHOS genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, unphosphorylated STAT3 has a higher affinity to some of these loci and promotes gene expression, compared to the tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Luciferase reporter assays with selected promoter/enhancer regions in Neuro2A cells further demonstrated that treatment of STAT3 inhibitor Static or mutation of the putative STAT3 binding sites in those regions significantly attenuates the reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that STAT3 promotes the expression of OXPHOS gene via direct transcriptional regulation.</p>

<p>As several of the candidate STAT3 target OXPHOS genes are components of complex I, we examined the complex I activity and found that <italic>Stat3</italic> loss-of-function decreased the activity of complex I at E17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). In addition, we found that this impaired complex I activity was associated with a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4G,H</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the decrease of mitochondrial complex I activity was due to mitochondrial functional alternation, we examined the mitochondrial copy number by qPCR, and found that there were no significant differences between the CTL and <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p>
<p>As mitochondrial respiration is crucial for cellular energy balance, we next examined the ADP/ATP ratio and the related signaling pathways in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO and control neural progenitors. We found that <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO cells had an elevated ADP/ATP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>), which correlated with increased activation of AMPK, the energy balance sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4O</xref>).

To determine whether the defects in mitochondrial respiration in STAT3 cKO neural progenitors are mediated primarily by the downregulation of OXPHOS gene expression, we attempted to knockdown several of the target genes (including <italic>Ndufc1</italic>, <italic>Ndufb5</italic>, <italic>Ndufb7</italic>, <italic>Ndufs1</italic>, and <italic>Atp5b</italic>) in E15 neural progenitors using a lentiviral shRNA system. We found that knockdown of the selected target genes led to decreased mitochondrial OCR and increased mitochondrial ROS production, suggesting that downregulation of the target OXPHOS genes primarily mediates the mitochondrial metabolic change observed in Stat3 loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5AâC</xref>). Consistently, knockdown of the OXPHOS genes led to the activation of the AMPK pathway and increased autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<p>The results above demonstrate that STAT3 is necessary to promote nuclear-encoded OXPHOS gene expression and thereby mitochondria respiration in neural progenitors. To examine another possibility of whether STAT3 regulates the OXPHOS genes expression via mitochondria metabolism, we used 2DG or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> intervention to mimic the metabolic stress in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO cells. We found that the OXPHOS genes expression was increased as a result of the drug treatment, in contrast to that in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). This suggested that in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors, downregulation of the OXPHOS genes expression leads to the disruption of mitochondrial metabolism, not <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p>
<p>We next sought to determine whether the downregulation of OXPHOS genes mediates the proliferation and differentiation phenotype of <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors. We found that knockdown of these OXPHOS genes led to increased cell proliferation, suggesting that the proliferative phenotype of <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors could be directly mediated by decreased expression of OXPHOS genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5E,F</xref>). In addition, we found that knockdown of the OXPHOS genes in neural progenitor cells led to significantly lower neuronal differentiation, except that of <italic>Atp5b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5G,H</xref>). However, knockdown of the selected OXPHOS genes other than <italic>Ndufs1</italic> did not alter the astrogenesis of neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5G,I</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, knockdown of OXPHOS genes was able to reproduce several phenotypes of <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitor cells, including reduced OCR, increased ROS production, and activation of the AMPK pathway. In addition, the knockdown of OXPHOS genes resulted in an increased proliferation rate and reduced neurogenesis, similar to the <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors. These findings support the hypothesis that the regulation of OXPHOS genes mediates the phenotypic changes observed in <italic>Stat3</italic> loss-of-function neural progenitors.</p>

<title>Activation of AMPK and ROS Pathways Promotes Neural Progenitor Proliferation</title>
<p>As mitochondria dysfunction in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO activated the AMPK and ROS pathway, we wondered if these pathways mediated the hyperproliferative phenotype of <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of AMPK in neural progenitor proliferation, we treated E15 neural progenitors with AMPK agonists 2DG and Metformin as well as AMPK suppressors Compound C and inhibitor of downstream autophagy 3 mA. Treatment of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and Metformin in CTL neural progenitors induced a starvation state similar to that of <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO, as was dictated by the ADP/ATP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). 2DG and Metformin treatment resulted in increased neurosphere size and BrdU incorporation in CTL neural progenitor, while treatment of Compound C and 3mA decreased the neurosphere size and BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6B,C</xref>), suggesting that AMPK pathway activation is both sufficient and necessary for neural progenitor proliferation. To investigate whether ROS signaling regulates neural progenitor proliferation, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ROS scavenger <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine (NAC) was added to the CTL neural progenitors. Treatment of H2O2 led to increased BrdU incorporation and neurosphere growth, while NAC treatment decreased them, suggesting that ROS signaling is also sufficient and necessary for neural progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Modulation of AMPK pathway and ROS downstream pathway AKT by drug treatment was verified by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6E,F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>STAT3 has been shown to play an important role in neural progenitor development, but its function and downstream pathways are not fully understood. Our study discovers a new role of STAT3 and sheds light on the downstream regulatory network. We found that STAT3 is necessary for controlling the proliferation rate and promoting neurogenesis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway.</p>
<p>Previous studies found activation of STAT3 by cytokines promotes neural progenitor proliferation and negatively regulates neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hong and Song, 2015</xref>). However, the effect of cytokines could be independent of the JAK-STAT3 pathway. For instance, CNTF treatment induced neural progenitor proliferation and suppressed neurogenesis in both CTL and <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors (data not shown). Our study showed that loss of STAT3 also results in increased proliferation and reduced neurogenesis. This is consistent with previous report that <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO astrocytes resulted in increased proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">de la Iglesia et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, we found that STAT3 is not necessary for astrocytogenesis. Previous studies showed that STAT3 is necessary for astrocyte marker GFAP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hong and Song, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Kanski et al., 2014</xref>). Several STAT3 binding sites were found in <italic>Gfap</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bonni et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Nakashima et al., 1999</xref>), and their interaction with STAT3 is critical for <italic>Gfap</italic> expression. However, GFAP is merely a marker of a subset of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). Lack of GFAP+ cells in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO suggests that it leads to potentially functional tampered astrocytes, but not the reduction of the astrocyte cell number. On the contrary, expression of other astrocyte markers was even increased in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO, which might due to increased proliferation of astrocyte precursors.</p>
<p>Our RNA-seq data showed that expression of upper layer neuronal marker was increased in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors, which was concomitant with the observation in previous study that <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO yielded significantly increased number of upper layer (layer IIâIII) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hong and Song, 2015</xref>). Upper layer neurons are generated after E14, when <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors start to show defect of mitochondrial respiration and increased proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, increased upper layer neuron generation might result from the increased proliferation of neural progenitors. In addition, whether mitochondria respiration correlates with different layer neuron specification remains to be studied. Electron microscopic study suggested that layer IIâIII neurons contain less volume of mitochondria compared to layer IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Santuy et al., 2018</xref>), implying that neurons in different cortical layers might have different mitochondrial metabolism requirement.</p>
<p>In the canonical JAK-STAT pathway, STAT3 is tyrosine phosphorylated, undergoes nucleus import and activates gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Fu et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Schindler et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Darnell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Levy and Darnell, 2002</xref>). However, STAT3 without tyrosine-phosphorylation (U-STAT3) could also promote gene expression. It has been reported that U-STAT3 could be imported into nucleus by Importin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cimica et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, U-STAT3 could accumulate in the nucleus after prolonged IL6 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). U-STAT3 could interact with DNA and promote gene expression by forming homodimer, or in a complex with RELA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Timofeeva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Nkansah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Okada et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, our data showed that overexpression of STAT3-CYF, a dominant negative mutant of STAT3 that mimic U-STAT3, could bind to the regulatory element of Ndufc1 and promote its expression, while the overexpression of STAT3-CA, a constitutive active form of STAT3, could not. However, it remains unclear if other post-translational modifications of STAT3 regulate these genes expression. Furthermore, it was speculated that U-STAT3 might also function as a chromatin scaffold protein due to the long distance of their adjacent binding sites. Indeed, bisulfite sequencing revealed that the global DNA methylation level was decreased in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors at E14. STAT3 activation could promote cell proliferation and suppress neurogenesis, while absence of STAT3 also leads to similar outcome, suggesting that the STAT3 activation or inactivation might be one of the molecular switch of neural progenitor fate.</p>
<p>It has been shown that STAT3 could be translocated into mitochondria, and that mitochondrial STAT3 promotes respiration by binding to protein complexes such as Complex I, or by regulating mitochondrial transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Wegrzyn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Macias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Carbognin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). However, we have previously reported that STAT3 does not locate within mitochondria, but in mitochondria-associated ER membrane instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Su et al., 2019</xref>), which is neglected by prior studies. Even if STAT3 is present in mitochondria, it is unlikely to directly regulate mitochondrial respiration, due to the stoichiometric difference between STAT3 and the OXPHOS complexes or the mitochondrial genome (the molecular ratio of Complex I and STAT3 is â¼10<sup>5</sup> by estimation; and that of the mitochondrial genome and STAT3 is â¼10<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bogenhagen and Clayton, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Shmookler Reis and Goldstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Phillips et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, STAT3 might regulate mitochondrial respiration via other pathways. Our study showed STAT3 can promote mitochondrial respiration and limit ROS production by regulating the expression of nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes during neural progenitor development. Similarly, it was shown that STAT3 regulates citrate synthase expression so as to promote mitochondrial metabolism in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">MacPherson et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest a STAT3-regulated nuclear-transcription-dependent pathway that modulates mitochondrial metabolism.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial metabolism is closely associated with neural progenitor self-renewal and differentiation. Our data showed downregulation of OXPHOS genes in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO leads to a disruption of mitochondrial metabolism, which promotes the proliferation of neural progenitors while negatively regulates neurogenesis, consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bartesaghi et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, mitochondrial metabolism could regulate neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation via activation of AMPK signaling or ROS-AKT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Dasgupta and Milbrandt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Le Belle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, we found overactivation of both AMPK and AKT pathways in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors. Though both are necessary for promoting neural progenitor proliferation, the AMPK and AKT signaling has an antagonistic effect on mTOR activation and the downstream response. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Gwinn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). The downregulated mTOR pathway in <italic>Stat3</italic> cKO neural progenitors we show here suggests the negative regulation by AMPK pathway might play a dominant role which is consistent with the proliferation phenotype, given that activation of mTOR complex 1 pathway negatively regulates neural progenitor self-renewal and promotes differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Magri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hartman et al., 2013</xref>). However, further study is required to understand how these metabolic-related pathways converge onto the neural progenitor cell fate.</p>
<p>In summary, we discovered a STAT3-mitochondria metabolism axis that regulates neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation.</p>
