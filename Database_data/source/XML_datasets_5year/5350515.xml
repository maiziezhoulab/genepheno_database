<abstract>
<p>Fragile X syndrome, the most common known monogenic cause of autism, results from the loss of FMR1, a conserved, ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein. Recent evidence suggests that Fragile X syndrome and other types of autism are associated with immune system defects. We found that <italic>Drosophila melanogaster Fmr1</italic> mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to bacterial infection and decreased phagocytosis of bacteria by systemic immune cells. Using tissue-specific RNAi-mediated knockdown, we showed that Fmr1 plays a cell-autonomous role in the phagocytosis of bacteria. <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants also exhibit delays in two processes that require phagocytosis by glial cells, the immune cells in the brain: neuronal clearance after injury in adults and the development of the mushroom body, a brain structure required for learning and memory. Delayed neuronal clearance is associated with reduced recruitment of activated glia to the site of injury. These results suggest a previously unrecognized role for Fmr1 in regulating the activation of phagocytic immune cells both in the body and the brain.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The most common known monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism in humans is Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelleher and Bear, 2008</xref>). In Fragile X syndrome, expansion of repeating DNA sequences in the genome induces transcriptional silencing of the highly conserved <italic>FMR1</italic> gene and leads to the loss of FMR1 protein, an mRNA-binding protein and translational inhibitor that is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body with a strong enrichment in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin and Warren, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). Loss of FMR1 function in human and animal models is associated with the excessive growth of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comery et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irwin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan et al., 2004</xref>) and defects in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bear et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McBride et al., 2005</xref>), symptoms also associated with other forms of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hutsler and Zhang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tang et al., 2014</xref>). Although the defects in animal models of Fragile X syndrome are typically attributed to functions of FMR1 in neurons, the functions of other cell types, such as circulating immune cells in the body or in glia, immune cells in the brain that could also play a role in neurological function, are less well understood.</p><p>It is increasingly appreciated that elevated incidences of autism are strikingly correlated with maternal autoimmune diseases and infection during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gesundheit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Estes and McAllister, 2015</xref>). As a result, neurological symptoms of autism have been proposed to arise from defects in immune system function, perhaps because of prenatal immune challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mead and Ashwood, 2015</xref>). Consistent with this idea, Fragile X syndrome is also associated with altered immune system functions, including elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels in the blood and gastrointestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Samsam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Estes and McAllister, 2015</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether defects in immune system functions actively contribute to the progression of Fragile X syndrome or whether they arise independently of the neuronal defects in this disorder. Moreover, the precise defects in other cellular immune functions in Fragile X syndrome models have not been widely investigated.</p><p>An essential conserved function of specialized immune cells in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and mammals is phagocytosis, or the engulfment of extracellular material generated by foreign pathogens and dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freeman and Grinstein, 2014</xref>). Phagocytosis by immune cells is a multistep process that requires an external signal (e.g., pathogenic bacteria), activation of phagocytic receptors at the cell surface (e.g., CED-1/Draper), rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, and internalization of target material into a subcellular vesicle called the phagosome. Phagosomes undergo subsequent maturation through fusion with endosomes and lysosomes to become acidic phagolysosomes, which degrades the engulfed material. <italic>Drosophila</italic> have several types of phagocytic cells, including primitive macrophages (or hemocytes) in the circulatory system and phagocytic glia in the brain, which play critical roles in defense against bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, the scavenging of dead cellular debris, and the active pruning of neuronal axons and dendrites during development.</p><p>Recent research has implicated the misregulation of astrocytes, a type of vertebrate glia, in mouse models of Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobs and Doering, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pacey et al., 2015</xref>) and Rett syndrome, another cause of autism spectrum disorder in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lioy et al., 2011</xref>). For example, astrocytes from <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutant mice cocultured in vitro with neurons from either wild-type or <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutant mice caused excessive dendritic branching, a pathological morphology observed in Fragile X syndrome patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobs and Doering, 2010</xref>). Wild-type astrocytes cocultured in vitro with neurons from wild-type or <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutant mice did not cause this phenotype. Other common neuroanatomical features of Fragile X syndrome patients and animal models include increased dendritic spine density and decreased axonal pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comery et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irwin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tessier and Broadie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pfeiffer and Huber, 2009</xref>). Both of these defects are also associated with defects in glia-mediated phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schafer and Stevens, 2013</xref>). Though glia-mediated phagocytosis is required for neuronal structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blank and Prinz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung and Barres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Logan et al., 2012</xref>), defects in phagocytosis by glia or other immune cells have not previously been demonstrated in any model of Fragile X syndrome.</p><p>In this study, we set out to examine immune system function in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants, a well-established <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coffee et al., 2010</xref>). We found that <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants are highly sensitive to infection by two specific bacterial pathogens, <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, defense against which requires phagocytosis by hemocytes. We found that hemocytes in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants exhibit reduced bacterial engulfment, an early step in phagocytosis. Using tissue-specific RNAi-mediated knockdown, we further show that Fmr1 plays a cell-autonomous role in phagocytosis by hemocytes. In addition, we demonstrate that <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants exhibited delays in two different processes dependent on phagocytosis by immune cells in the brain: axonal clearance after neuronal wounding in the adult brain and pruning of neurons during development of the mushroom body, a brain structure required for learning and memory. We further found that delayed axonal clearance in the adult was associated with a delay in recruitment of activated, phagocytic glia to the site of wounded neurons. Because glia-mediated phagocytosis is critical in shaping neuronal structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blank and Prinz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung and Barres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Logan et al., 2012</xref>), these results raise the possibility that delayed phagocytosis by glia may contribute to the neurological symptoms of Fragile X syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To investigate immune system function in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants, we first analyzed animal survival in response to infection with bacterial pathogens. Defense against bacterial pathogens can be divided into resistance and tolerance mechanisms: resistance mechanisms are conventional immune mechanisms that extend survival by controlling microbial growth, whereas tolerance mechanisms are thought to be physiologies such as metabolic effects that ameliorate the pathogenic effects of infection and do not necessarily alter bacterial loads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2016</xref>). We found that <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants had resistance phenotypes during infection with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> or <italic>S. marcescens</italic> compared with wild types. In both cases, <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants died more quickly (P &lt; 0.0001 for both; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>) and had significantly higher bacterial loads relative to wild types 18 h after infection (P &lt; 0.01 for both; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). This result suggests that <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants are less able to control microbial growth of these two bacterial pathogens. <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants also exhibited wild-type immunity against <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and sensitivity to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection (Fig. S1, A–D). In contrast to <italic>S. pneumonia</italic> or <italic>S. marcescens</italic> infection, we found no differences in bacterial load after infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Fig. S1, A–D), suggesting that <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants have a tolerance, not a resistance, phenotype against this infection. These results suggest that Fmr1 affects a resistance mechanism specific to the defense against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, rather than a general immunity defect. To test this, we asked whether <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants have defects in the Toll and imd pathways, which are well-characterized general mechanisms of immune defense in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We tested whether the antimicrobial peptides Drosomycin and Diptericin, canonical outputs of the immune signaling Toll and imd pathways, are disrupted in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants. Whereas basal expression of these antimicrobial peptides was increased in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants, consistent with basal levels of hyperactivated immune function, levels of <italic>Drosomycin</italic> and <italic>Diptericin</italic> expression induced by infection were similar to wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). Thus, <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants do not display defects in Toll and imd signaling pathways. These results collectively suggest that <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants are defective in an immune mechanism that specifically compromises the clearance of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. marcescens</italic>.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Immunity against infection is defective in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants.</bold> (A and B) Relative to wild-type controls, <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants are highly sensitive to infection by two bacterial pathogens: <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (A; wild type, <italic>n</italic> = 59; <italic>Fmr1</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 53) and <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (B; wild type, <italic>n</italic> = 60; <italic>Fmr1</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 61).

Phagocytosis involves bacterial engulfment into a vesicle called the phagosome, which fuses with endosomes and eventually with the acidic lysosome. To directly assay the acidic lysosome step of phagocytosis, we performed an in vivo phagocytosis assay by injecting live <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants and isogenic controls with a well-characterized, commercially available bacterial substrate: heat-inactivated <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteria labeled with a pH-sensitive dye (pHrodo). pHrodo fluorescence increases in acidic environments, and quantification of this signal in phagocytic hemocytes allows quantification of the number of bacteria incorporated into the lysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stone et al., 2012</xref>). We found that <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants exhibited reduced pHrodo fluorescence in hemocytes compared with wild-type controls, indicating decreased phagocytic activity (P &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). To determine whether this decrease in bacterial engulfment results from a decreased phagocytic activity per phagocyte or from a decrease in the number of phagocytes, we genetically labeled hemocytes with GFP using a hemocyte-specific expression driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants again had lower levels of phagocytosis than control flies (P &lt; 0.01) but had similar levels of hemocyte GFP expression in the field of view (P &gt; 0.05). Thus, when pHrodo fluorescence was normalized to hemocyte GFP expression, <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants had significantly lower phagocytic activity per hemocyte than did controls (P &lt; 0.01). To distinguish whether phagocytosis is disrupted in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants at a late step of lysosome acidification or at an earlier step, we performed the in vivo phagocytosis assay with Alexa Fluor 594–labeled <italic>S. aureus.</italic> This fluorescence probe tests engulfment, an early step of phagocytosis, and the fluorescence signal from extracellular, nonengulfed bacteria was quenched with Trypan blue, resulting in fluorescence emission only from intracellular, engulfed bacteria. We found that <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants exhibited decreased intracellular Alexa Fluor 594 fluorescence relative to wild-type controls, indicating that the loss of Fmr1 results in a defect in bacterial engulfment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2 D</xref> and S2, A and B).

We used a neuronal severing (or axotomy) assay to monitor the glia-mediated clearance of neuronal debris in adult animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>). In this assay, the cell-type specific OR85e::GFP marker was used to label a subset of olfactory receptor neurons that extend axons deep into the brain and synapse on olfactory glomeruli (Fig. S3 A). When these axons are severed, the axonal remnants emit an “eat me” signal that activates a subset of phagocytic glia, termed ensheathing glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>). Activated glia up-regulate expression of the conserved phagocytic receptor Draper and extend membranous processes to the glomeruli to phagocytose neuronal debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ziegenfuss et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2012</xref>). Clearance of the GFP-labeled neuronal remnants can be quantitatively monitored by loss of GFP signal in the glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>).

To determine whether there is a defect in the recruitment of phagocytic glial extensions, we examined the localization of Draper-expressing glia in the region of the glomeruli. Draper, a transmembrane receptor protein of the CED-1 family, is a marker for activated glia that is up-regulated in response to neuronal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ziegenfuss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doherty et al., 2014</xref>). Both <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants and controls exhibited low levels of Draper protein in the glomeruli of unwounded animals (Fig. S3 C). In control animals, a robust up-regulation of the number of <italic>Draper</italic>-expressing glia in the glomeruli was observed 18 h after axotomy. In contrast, <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants exhibited significantly lower levels of <italic>Draper</italic>-expressing glia in the glomeruli at this time point (P &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). To extend these results, we then performed experiments to examine the full time course of neuronal clearance (neurons marked by GFP) and <italic>Draper</italic> expression in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants and control animals at 0, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h after axotomy. Both neuronal clearance and levels of Draper protein were significantly delayed but not completely inhibited in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Though activation of Draper expression is thought to be required for the recruitment of activated glial extensions to the site of wounding, it is possible that glial recruitment is normal but that these glia do not express Draper normally in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants. To test this, we quantified the ratio of Draper protein per glia by genetically labeling the subset of glia required for clearance of olfactory neurons with RFP. The ratio of Draper to RFP fluorescence was similar between <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants and control animals after axotomy, indicating that <italic>Draper</italic> expression is not impaired in these glia of <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4 D</xref> and S3, D and E). That is, the decrease in Draper levels at the glomeruli in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants is not caused by decreased <italic>Draper</italic> expression per glia but by decreased numbers of activated phagocytic glia at the glomeruli. Collectively, these results demonstrate that <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutant adults exhibit defects in the recruitment of activated phagocytic glia that lead to delayed neuronal clearance after axotomy.</p><p>Because Fragile X syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disease, we investigated whether <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants exhibit delays in glia-mediated pruning of neurons during development. One stage of neurodevelopment dependent on glia-mediated phagocytosis is the pruning of γ neurons of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body (γ-MB; Fig. S4), a brain structure important for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tasdemir-Yilmaz and Freeman, 2014</xref>). Consistent with previous work, we observed a stereotyped developmental pattern in wild-type animals by immunostaining with anti-FasII antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). FasII-positive γ-MB neurons of the dorsal lobe are rapidly pruned in wild-type animals after pupation, with a peak in advanced pruning typically occurring ∼12 h after pupal formation. Advanced pruning is followed by the appearance of FasII-positive α lobe neurons in the same plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fushima and Tsujimura, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tasdemir-Yilmaz and Freeman, 2014</xref>). We compared the pruning of FasII-positive γ-MB axons in wild types and <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). After images were blinded using custom software, the extent of pruning was graded by assignment to one of four morphological classes (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> and described in the Developmental glial phagocytosis assay section of Materials and methods). Although <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants showed similar morphology of FasII-positive γ-MB neurons at 6 h after pupal formation, we found that <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants exhibited a delay in pruning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). At 12 h after pupal formation, ∼75% of wild-type brains exhibited advanced pruning (class III morphology) of FasII-positive γ-MB neurons. In contrast, only ∼30% of <italic>Fmr1</italic> brains exhibited advanced pruning (P = 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). By 24 h after pupal formation, both wild types and <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants exhibited similar levels of FasII-positive γ-MB neuronal pruning and FasII-positive α lobe formation. These results suggest that, similar to neuronal clearance after axotomy in adults, development of the mushroom body, a second process that is dependent on glia-mediated phagocytosis, may be delayed in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants. Note that overall development is delayed in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants, so the delay at this specific stage of mushroom body development may simply reflect a more general delay. Alternatively, delays in glia-mediated phagocytosis may contribute to an overall developmental delay in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants exhibit delayed pruning by glia during development.</bold> (A) Images of anti-FasII staining of the developing mushroom body in wild-type (gray) and <italic>Fmr1</italic> (blue) mutants at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after pupation show the delayed pruning of FasII-positive γ-MB neurons in the dorsal lobe in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants relative to wild types.

These results provide the first in vivo demonstration of altered immune cell–mediated phagocytosis in a model of Fragile X syndrome. Our results indicate that, in hemocytes, Fmr1 has a cell-autonomous function, but this does not rule out additional nonautonomous roles. <italic>Fmr1</italic> is a broadly expressed translational regulator, with hundreds of known mRNA targets controlling multiple functions, such as cytoskeletal function, cytokine production, and extracellular matrix structure that could regulate phagocytic immune cells. For example, Fmr1 could act cell-autonomously in hemocytes to regulate the expression of specific mRNAs required for the rearrangement of the actin and/or microtubule cytoskeleton; Fmr1 could also play a nonautonomous role in the processing of bacterial products or immune signaling. In glia, Fmr1 could act cell-autonomously as it does in hemocytes, or it could act nonautonomously. Although mRNA targets of Fmr1 specific to glia have not been identified, targets of Fmr1 in whole-brain extracts include small GTPase regulators, microtubule binding proteins, receptor kinase signaling components, and actin itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). Fmr1 could also act in neurons to regulate signals that promote phagocytosis by glia or in nonphagocytic glia to modulate the extracellular matrix and to inhibit recruitment of activated glia to severed axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suh and Jackson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson and Haydon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel et al., 2013</xref>). Extension of glial processes is known to be dependent on changes in the extracellular matrix such as those stimulated by the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases which have been implicated in Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siller and Broadie, 2012</xref>). Fmr1 might also act either at the time of phagocytic activation or much earlier during development. Both the timing and tissue-specific location of Fmr1 activities required for phagocytosis by immune cells, particularly glia, remain important questions for future investigation.</p><p>It remains to be investigated whether phagocytic defects could also contribute to the neurological and immunological symptoms associated with Fragile X syndrome in human patients and whether phagocytic defects exist in other types of autism spectrum disorder. Although early detection of autism spectrum disorder has been shown to be critical for effective therapeutic intervention, autism spectrum disorders that are not attributed to monogenic causes such as Fragile X syndrome or Rett syndrome can be extremely difficult to diagnose at a young age. If the neuroanatomical pruning defects common to many types of autism spectrum disorder are caused in part by defects that manifest both in phagocytic immune cells of the brain and blood, these shared features could provide a strategy to screen for phagocytic biomarkers or bioactivities in easily obtainable blood immune cells from young patients at risk.</p></sec><sec id="s03" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s04"><title>Fly lines</title><p><italic>Fmr1</italic> trans-heterozygous null mutants were generated by crossing two heterozygous mutant lines, and each contained a well-characterized <italic>Fmr1</italic>-null mutation. <italic>Fmr1<sup>Δ50M</sup></italic> was from D.

Freeman; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>), chicken anti-GFP (1:1,000; 13970; Abcam), and mouse anti-RFP (1:500; 65856; Abcam). Brains were then washed five times over the course of 1 h at room temperature in PTX and incubated in secondary antibodies at 4°C overnight. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PTX with 2% NDS. The following secondary antibodies and dilutions were used: Rhodamine red-X–conjugated donkey anti–rabbit IgG (1:200; 711-295-152), Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated donkey anti–chicken IgY (IgG; 1:200; 703-545-155), Rhodamine red-X–conjugated donkey anti–mouse IgG (1:200; 715-295-151), and Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated donkey anti–rabbit (1:200; 711-605-152; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Brains were washed and mounted onto coverslips that had been coated with poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine (5048; Advanced BioMatrix) and Photo Flo 200 (0.36%; 1464510; Kodak), were dehydrated by incubation in increasing concentrations of ethanol for 5 min (30, 50, 75, 95, and 100%), and then were incubated in two different solutions of 100% xylenes for 10 min each. Coverslips were mounted onto slides with distyrene plasticizer xylene (DPX) and dried overnight before imaging. Brains were imaged using an LSM 510 Meta upright confocal microscope (ZEISS) using 488-, 561-, and 633-nm lasers. Images were taken with a PlanNeoFL 40×/1.3 NA lens, and the LSM confocal software was used for 3D reconstruction. FIJI was used to quantify the total fluorescence intensity of the three middle slices in a region traced around each glomerulus, normalizing to background fluorescence for each sample. For the glial extension assay, fluorescence of ensheathing glia and Draper was quantified using a standard circular region of interest placed over the glomerulus, normalizing to background fluorescence for each sample. All experiments were performed at least three times and yielded similar results. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Developmental glial phagocytosis assay</title><p><italic>Fmr1<sup>3/Δ50M</sup></italic> mutants and wild-type controls were raised as described in the Fly lines and Fly rearing conditions sections and were collected at various time points after pupal formation. The pupae were fixed in two 15-min washes in 4% PFA in PTX. They were then washed, stained, and imaged as described in the Glial phagocytosis and immunohistochemistry section. Antibodies used were mouse anti-FasII (1:5; DSHB 1D4) and Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated donkey anti–mouse IgG (1:200; 715–545-151; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Maximum intensity projections were generated, and images were blinded with a randomized numbering system using a custom-built blinding script developed by T. Khan (Columbia University, New York, NY) and then scored based on the following criteria: no pruning (class I), partial pruning (class II), advanced pruning (class III), and α lobe growth (class IV). Examples for each class are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> as the wild-type images for the 6 h (class I), 12 h (class III), and 18 h (class IV) after pupation, as well as the <italic>Fmr1</italic> image for 12 h (class II). Samples were unblinded and results recorded. The percentages in each category were calculated for each genotype at each time point; mean percentages were then calculated with three independent trials.
