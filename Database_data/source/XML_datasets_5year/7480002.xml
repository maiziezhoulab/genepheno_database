<p id="Par1">Recent advances in identification and characterization of human-specific regulatory DNA sequences set the stage for the assessment of their global impact on physiology and pathology of modern humans. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of 8405 genes linked with 35,074 human-specific neuro-regulatory single-nucleotide changes (hsSNCs) revealed numerous significant associations with morphological structures, physiological processes, and pathological conditions of modern humans. Significantly enriched traits include more than 1000 anatomically distinct regions of the adult human brain, many different types of cells and tissues, more than 200 common human disorders, and more than 1000 records of rare diseases. Thousands of genes connected with neuro-regulatory hsSNCs have been identified, which represent essential genetic elements of the autosomal inheritance and offspring survival phenotypes. A total of 1494 hsSNC-linked genes are associated with either autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance, and 2273 hsSNC-linked genes have been associated with premature death, embryonic lethality, as well as pre-, peri-, neo-, and post-natal lethality phenotypes of both complete and incomplete penetrance. Differential GSEA implemented on hsSNC-linked loci and associated genes identify a set of 7990 hsSNC-target genes linked to evolutionary distinct classes of human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS). Notably, the expression of a majority of these genes (5389 genes; 67%) is regulated by stem cell–associated retroviral sequences (SCARS) and SCARS-regulated genes captured a dominant fraction (91%) of significant phenotypic associations linked with hsSNCs. Interrogations of the MGI database revealed readily available mouse models tailored for precise experimental definitions of functional effects of hsSNCs and SCARS on genes causally affecting thousands of mammalian phenotypes and implicated in hundreds of common and rare human disorders. These observations suggest that a preponderance of human-specific traits evolved under a combinatorial regulatory control of distinct classes of HSRS and neuro-regulatory loci harboring hsSNCs that are fixed in humans, distinct from other primates, and located in differentially accessible chromatin regions during brain development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par15">DNA sequences of coding genes defining the structure of macromolecules comprising the essential building blocks of life at the cellular and organismal levels remain highly conserved during the evolution of humans and other Great Apes (Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>; Kronenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>). In contrast, a compendium of nearly hundred thousand candidate human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS) has been assembled in recent years (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>; Glinsky and Barakat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>; Kanton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>), thus providing further genetic and molecular evidence supporting the idea that unique to human phenotypes may result from human-specific changes to genomic regulatory sequences defined as “regulatory mutations” (King and Wilson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1975</xref>). Structurally, functionally, and evolutionary distinct classes of HSRS appear to cooperate in shaping developmentally and physiologically diverse human-specific genomic regulatory networks (GRNs) impacting preimplantation embryogenesis, pluripotency, and development and functions of the human brain (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>). The best evidence of the exquisite degree of accuracy of the contemporary molecular definition of human-specific regulatory sequences is exemplified by the identification of 35,074 single nucleotide changes (SNCs) that are fixed in humans, distinct from other primates, and located within differentially accessible (DA) chromatin regions during the human brain development in cerebral organoids (Kanton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>). Therefore, this type of mutations could be defined as fixed neuro-regulatory human-specific single nucleotide changes (hsSNCs). However, only a small fraction of identified DA chromatin peaks (600 of 17,935 DA peaks; 3.3%) manifest associations with differential expression in human versus chimpanzee cerebral organoids model of brain development, consistent with the hypothesis that regulatory effects on gene expression of these DA chromatin regions are not restricted to the early stages of brain development. Annotation of SNCs derived and fixed in modern humans that overlap DA chromatin regions during brain development revealed that essentially all candidate neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs are shared with the archaic humans (35,010 SNCs; 99.8%), and only 64 SNCs are unique to modern humans (Kanton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>). This remarkable conservation on the human lineage of human-specific SNCs associated with human brain development sows the seed of interest for in-depth exploration of coding gene expression of which may be affected by genetic regulatory loci harboring human-specific SNCs.</p>
<p id="Par16">Recently, a catalogue of 59,732 genomic loci harboring evolutionary distinct candidate HSRS has been assembled which facilitated the systematic analyses of HSRS that were either inherited from extinct common ancestors (ECAs) or created <italic>de novo</italic> in human genomes (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>). It has been concluded that manifestations of human-specific phenotypes are controlled by the unique-to-human mosaic of human-specific mutations and highly conserved genomic regulatory sequences inherited from extinct common ancestors (ECAs), which is supplemented with 12,486 HSRS created <italic>de novo</italic> in human genomes after divergence from ECAs (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>). Notably, human-specific gene expression signatures (GES) of brain development and pluripotency phenotypes appear to manifest significant patterns of associations with HSRS assembled during evolution into human-specific regulatory pathways designed to govern various transcriptional networks in human cells. Targeted interrogations of 4433 genes encoding human virus–interacting proteins (hVIPs) revealed that 95.9% of hVIPs represent components of human-specific regulatory networks (GRNs) operating in markedly distinct types of human cells from preimplantation embryos to adult dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>). It has been proposed that hVIP-encoding genes may represent a principal genomic target during evolution of human-specific GRNs, which contribute to fitness of modern humans and affect a functionally diverse spectrum of biological and cellular processes controlled by VIP-containing liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates.</p>
<p id="Par17">Neuro-regulatory hsSNCs were discovered using the unique methodological approach combining a panel of advanced single-cell analytical techniques applied to cerebral organoid models of human and non-human primates (Kanton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>). Hence, neuro-regulatory hsSNCs represent a structurally and functionally related family of genomic regulatory sequences which are markedly distinct from previously reported and analyzed HSRS. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether inferred regulatory actions of hsSNCs and other HSRS would likely to affect different or common sets of downstream target genes. Furthermore, of considerable importance would be to find out whether expression and functions of genes associated with hsSNCs and/or other HSRS are known to contribute to distinct and/or common physiological functions and pathological phenotypes of modern humans, in particular, aging as well as common and rare human disorders.</p>
<p id="Par18">In this contribution, the GREAT algorithm (McLean et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>) was utilized to identify 8405 hsSNC-linked genes associated with 35,074 neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs located in DA chromatin regions during brain development. Comprehensive gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of these genes revealed the large scale of significant associations with physiological processes and pathological conditions of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, including more than 1000 anatomically distinct regions of the adult human brain, many human tissues and cell types, more than 200 common human disorders, and more than 1000 rare diseases. It has been concluded that hsSNC-linked genes appear contributing to development and functions of the adult human brain and other components of the central nervous system; they were defined as genetic markers of many tissues across human body and were implicated in the extensive range of human physiological and pathological conditions, thus supporting the hypothesis that phenotype-altering effects of neuro-regulatory hsSNCs are not restricted to the early stages of human brain development. Differential GSEA implemented on hsSNC-linked loci and associated genes identify 7990 genes linked to evolutionary distinct classes of human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS). Notably, the expression of a majority of this common set of genes (5389 genes; 67%) is regulated by stem cell–associated retroviral sequences (SCARS). Collectively, observations reported in this contribution indicate that structurally, functionally, and evolutionary diverse classes of HSRS, neuro-regulatory hsSNCs, and associated elite set of 7990 genes affect wide spectra of traits defining both physiology and pathology of modern humans by asserting human-specific regulatory impacts on thousands essential mammalian phenotypes.</p>

<title>Identification and characterization of putative genetic regulatory targets associated with human-specific SNCs in DA chromatin regions during brain development</title>
<p id="Par19">To identify and characterize human genes associated with 35,074 human-specific single nucleotide changes (SNCs) in differentially accessible (DA) chromatin regions defined by ATAC-seq during human and chimpanzee neurogenesis in cerebral organoids (Kanton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>), the GREAT algorithm (McLean et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>) have been employed. These analyses identified 8405 genes with putative regulatory connections to human-specific SNCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) and revealed a large scale of highly significant associations with a multitude of biological processes, molecular functions, genetic and metabolic pathways, cellular compartments, and gene expression perturbations (Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">S1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>GREAT analysis identifies 8405 human genes associated with 35,074 neuro-regulatory human-specific single nucleotide changes (hsSNCs) identified in differentially accessible (DA) chromatin regions during human and chimpanzee brain development in cerebral organoids. <bold>a</bold> Patterns of genomic associations between neuro-regulatory hsSNCs and putative target genes defined at different single nearest gene maximum extensions.

GREAT algorithm version 3.0.0</p></caption><graphic id="MO1" xlink:href="10577_2020_9639_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par20">To ascertain patterns of genomic associations between neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs and putative target genes, the GREAT analyses were performed at different proximity placement distances defined by the single nearest gene maximum extension ranging from 10 kb to 1 Mb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). It has been observed that from 92% of all hsSNC-linked genes are located within 200 kb distances from their putative regulatory loci (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Since the size of more than 99% of topologically associating domains (TADs) in human genomes is 200 kb or more (Dixon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>), these findings indicate that a marked majority of neuro-regulatory hsSNCs and their putative target genes would be located in human genomes within the boundaries of the same TAD.</p>
<p id="Par21">Using the GREAT algorithm, particularly large numbers of significant associations were discovered during the analyses of the following two databases:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par22">The Human Phenotype Ontology containing over 13,000 terms describing clinical phenotypic abnormalities that have been observed in human diseases, including hereditary disorders (326 significant records with binominal FDR <italic>Q</italic> value &lt; 0.05)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">The MGI Expression Detected ontology referencing genes expressed in specific anatomical structures at specific developmental stages (Theiler stages) in the mouse (370 significant records with binominal FDR Q value &lt; 0.05)</p></list-item></list></p>
<p id="Par24">These observations support the hypothesis that biological functions of genes under the putative regulatory control of human-specific SNCs in DA chromatin regions during brain development are not limited to the contribution to the early stages of neuro- and corticogenesis. Collectively, findings reported in Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">S1</xref> argue that genes associated with neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs may represent a genomic dominion of putative regulatory dependency from HSRS that is likely to play an important role in a broad spectrum of physiological processes and pathological conditions of modern humans.</p>

<title>Identification of hsSNC-linked genes distinguishing thousands of anatomically distinct areas of the adult human brain, various regions of the central nervous system, and many different cell types and tissues in the human body</title>
<p id="Par25">To validate and extend these observations, next, the comprehensive gene set enrichment analyses were performed employing the web-based Enrichr API bioinformatics platform (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>; Kuleshov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>), which interrogated nearly 200,000 gene sets from more than 100 gene set libraries. The results of these analyses are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref> and reported in details in Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>.

<p id="Par26">Of particular interest is the apparent significant enrichment of human-specific SNC-associated genes among both upregulated and downregulated genes, expression of which discriminates thousands of anatomically distinct areas of the adult human brain defined in the Allen Brain Atlas. Detailed results of these analyses are depicted in the Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> and reported in Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>. Notably, genes expressed in various thalamus regions appear frequently among the top-scored anatomical areas of the human brain (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>). These findings were further corroborated by the identification of hsSNC-linked genes among genetic markers of 26 human brain regions retrieved from the Allen Human Brain Atlas database (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Anatomical structures implicated in consciousness and higher cognitive functions (cerebral cortex; temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes; limbic system); information integration, communication, connectivity, and processing functions (insula; claustrum; corpus callosum); and thalamic and hypothalamic structures (including thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei; subiculum; dentate gyrus) were considered among human brain regions interrogated in these analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Notably, a significant majority of hsSNC-linked genes (6640 of 8405 genes; 79%) represents genetic markers of 26 human brain regions examined in this study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A dominant majority (6640 of 8405 genes; 79%) of genes linked to 35,074 human-specific single nucleotide changes (hsSNCs) in chromatin’s differentially accessible (DA) regions during human and chimpanzee brain development in cerebral organoids represents genetic markers of 26 human brain regions. <bold>a</bold> Number of brain regions’ marker genes linked to 35,074 neuro-regulatory hsSNCs in specified human brain regions (the normalized values calculated per 1000 region-specific marker genes are shown).

<p id="Par27">In agreement with the hypothesis that neuro-regulatory hsSNCs may exert the human-specific regulatory effects on target genes, a notable fraction of hsSNC-linked genes (3212 genes; 38%) manifests significant expression changes in human versus chimpanzee adult brains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). A dominant majority of hsSNC-linked genes manifesting differential expression in human versus chimpanzee adult brains represents genetic markers of human brain regions (2780 of 3212 genes; 87%). The fraction of hsSNC-linked genes differentially expressed in human versus chimpanzee brains is significantly higher among human brain regions’ marker genes compared with non-markers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 1535E−42; 2-tailed Fisher’s exact test). These observations support the hypothesis that genetic loci harboring human-specific neuro-regulatory SNCs not only contribute to the early development of human brain but also may exert regulatory effects on structural and functional features of the adult human brain, thus likely affecting both the development and functions of the central nervous system in modern humans.</p>
<p id="Par28">Consistent with this idea, the examination of the enrichment patterns of human-specific SNC-associated genes in the ARCHS4 Human Tissues gene expression database revealed that top 10 most significantly enriched records overlapping a majority of region-specific marker genes constitute various anatomically distinct regions of the central nervous system (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>). However, the results of gene set enrichment analyses convincingly demonstrate that inferred regulatory effects of genetic loci harboring human-specific SNCs are not restricted only to the various regions of the central nervous system; they appear to affect gene expression profiles of many different cell types and tissues in the human body (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification and characterization of hsSNC-linked genes manifesting altered expression during aging of humans, rats, and mice</title>
<p id="Par29">Genes altered expression of which is implicated in the aging of various tissues and organs of humans, rats, and mice are significantly enriched among 8405 genes associated with human-specific regulatory SNCs (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par30">Aging of the hippocampus was implicated most frequently among genes manifesting increased expression with age, while among genes exhibiting aging-associated decreased expression, the hippocampus and frontal cortex were identified repeatedly (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref>). Overall, twice as many significant association records were observed among aging-associated downregulated genes compared with upregulated genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). While these observations clearly indicate that altered expression of hsSNC-linked genes may contribute to both up- and downregulation of genes in many anatomical regions of aging brains, they also suggest that diminished expression of hsSNC-linked genes in various brain regions may represent one of the important molecular determinants of human aging. Interestingly, the results of follow-up analyses have shown that the phenomenon of decreased expression of hsSNC-linked genes in human brain regions during aging appears connected with activated expression of stem cell–associated retroviral sequences (SCARS). These conclusions are supported by findings that SCARS exert the predominantly inhibitory effect on the expression of genes associated with human-specific neuro-regulatory SNCs, and SCARS-regulated genes represent a vast majority of hsSNC-linked genes manifesting significant associations with brain aging. Collectively, these observations indicate that gene changes in expression of which were associated with aging in mammals, in particular, hippocampal and frontal cortex aging, represent important elements of a genomic dominion that was placed under regulatory control of genetic loci harboring human-specific neuro-regulatory SNCs.</p>

<title>Identification of hsSNC-linked genes implicated in development and manifestations of hundreds physiological and pathological phenotypes and autosomal inheritance in modern humans</title>
<p id="Par31">The Interrogations of the Human Phenotype Ontology database (298 significantly enriched records identified), the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Catalogue (241 significantly enriched records identified), and the database of Human Genotypes and Phenotypes (136 significantly enriched records identified) revealed several hundred physiological and pathological phenotypes and thousands of genes manifesting significant enrichment patterns defined at the adjusted <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05 (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S3</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>). Interestingly, 645 and 849 genes implicated in the autosomal dominant (HP:0000006) and recessive (HP:0000007) inheritance were identified among genes associated with human-specific regulatory SNCs (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S3</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>). Notable pathological conditions among top-scored records identified in the database of Human Genotypes and Phenotypes are stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and heart failure (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S3</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par32">A total of 241 significantly enriched records (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>) were documented by gene set enrichment analyses of the GWAS catalogue (2019), among which a highly diverse spectrum of pathological conditions linked to genes associated with human-specific regulatory SNCs was identified, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, malignant melanoma, diverticular disease, asthma, coronary artery disease, glaucoma, as well as breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S3</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>).

<title>Identification of hsSNC-linked genes manifesting altered expression in several hundred common human disorders</title>
<p id="Par33">Gene set enrichment analysis–guided interrogation of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database revealed the highly diverse spectrum of human diseases with the etiologic origins in multiple organs and tissues and highly heterogeneous pathophysiological trajectories of their pathogenesis (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S4</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>). Overlapping gene sets between disease-associated genes and human-specific SNC-linked genes compose of hundreds of genes that were either upregulated (204 significant disease records) or downregulated (240 significant disease records) in specific pathological conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, various types of malignant tumors, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, Down syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, spinal muscular atrophy, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorders, type 2 diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, and cardiomyopathy (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S4</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>).

<p id="Par34">Viral infections caused by persisting and novel viruses and manifesting sporadic, endemic, epidemic, or pandemic patterns of disease in human populations are regarded as a major contemporary public health threat. Clinical dynamics and outcomes of virus-host encounters are determined to a significant extend by interactions of viral and host proteins. Importantly, genes encoding virus-interacting proteins (VIPs) represent one of important regulatory targets of different families of HSRS, which collectively may exert regulatory effects on more than 95% of all known VIP-encoding genes in human genome (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>). These findings suggest that human-specific genomic regulatory networks (GRNs) play important roles in governing virus-host interactions and affecting the outcomes of viral infections. It was of interest to evaluate the validity of this concept in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="Par35">A recent proteomics study of the SARS-CoV-2 interactome in human cells identified 332 high-confidence human protein targets of the 27 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins (Gordon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). This knowledge has been exploited for identification of medicinal substances manifesting genomic profiles of candidate pandemic mitigation agents (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020b</xref>). In agreement with the concept of regulatory effects of HSRS on VIP-encoding genes, 229 of 332 genes (69%) encoding SARS-CoV-2 prey proteins in human cells represent regulatory targets of HSRS (Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM17">6</xref>). Similarly, nearly half of human genes (162 of 332 genes; 49%) encoding prey proteins for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus are genes associated with neuro-regulatory hsSNCs. In total, a significant majority of genes encoding protein targets of novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in human cells (250 of 332; 75%) appears associated with HSRS and/or neuro-regulatory hsSNCs (Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM17">6</xref>). Collectively, observations reported in present study appear consistent with the hypothesis that genes linked to human-specific neuro-regulatory SNCs represent a network of essential genetic loci implicated in a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological traits of modern humans, including genes implicated in pathogenesis of viral infections.</p>

<p id="Par36">Present analyses demonstrate that thousands of genes associated with human-specific regulatory SNCs have been previously identified as genetic elements affecting the likelihood of development a multitude of common human disorders. Similarly, thousands of genes with altered expression during development and manifestation of multiple common human disorders appear linked to genetic regulatory loci harboring human-specific SNCs. Interestingly, interrogations of the Enrichr’s libraries of genes associated with modern humans’ rare diseases identified 473, 603, 641, and 1116 significantly enriched records of various rare disorders employing the Rare Diseases GeneRIF gene lists library, the Rare Diseases GeneRIF ARCHS4 predictions library, the Rare Diseases AutoRIF ARCHS4 predictions library, and the Rare Diseases AutoRIF Gene lists library, respectively (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">S5</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">S2</xref>).

<p id="Par37">Gene Ontology (GO) analyses identified a constellation of biological processes (GO Biological Process 308 significant records) supplemented with a multitude of molecular functions (GO Molecular Function 81 significant records) that appear under the regulatory control of human-specific SNCs (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">S6</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">2</xref>). Consistently, both databases identified frequently the components of transcriptional regulation and protein kinase activities among most significant records. Other significantly enriched records of interest are regulation of apoptosis, cell proliferation, migration, and various binding properties (cadherin binding; sequence-specific DNA binding; protein-kinase binding; amyloid-beta binding; actin binding; tubulin binding; microtubule binding; PDZ domain binding) which are often supplemented by references to the corresponding activity among the enriched records, for example, enriched records of both binding and activity of protein kinases.</p>
<p id="Par38">Interrogation of GO Cellular Component database identified 29 significantly enriched records, among which nuclear chromatin as well as various cytoskeleton and membrane components appear noteworthy (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">S6</xref>). Both GO Biological Process and GO Cellular Component databases identified significantly enriched records associated with the central nervous system development and functions such as axonogenesis and axon guidance; generation of neurons, neuron differentiation, and neuron projection morphogenesis; cellular components of dendrites and dendrite’s membrane; and ionotropic glutamate receptor complex. In several instances, biologically highly consistent enrichment records have been identified in different GO databases: cadherin binding (GO Molecular Function) and catenin complex (GO Cellular Component); actin binding (GO Molecular Function) and actin cytoskeleton, cortical actin cytoskeleton, and actin-based cell projections (GO Cellular Component); microtubule motor activity, tubulin binding, and microtubule binding (GO Molecular Function); and microtubule organizing center and microtubule cytoskeleton (GO Cellular Component).</p>
<p id="Par39">Analyses of human and mouse databases of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">S7</xref>) identified more than 100 significantly enriched records in each database (KEGG 2019 Human 129 significant records; KEGG 2019 Mouse 106 significant records).

Genes under putative regulatory control of human-specific SNCs include hundreds of genes contributing to specific functions of specialized differentiated cells (gastric acid secretion; insulin secretion; aldosterone synthesis and secretion), multiple receptor/ligand-specific signaling pathways, as well as genetic constituents of pathways commonly deregulated in cancer and linked to the organ-specific malignancies, for example, breast, colorectal, and small cell lung cancers (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">S7</xref>).

A significant fraction of these 2273 genes, which collectively could be defined based on patterns of phenotypes caused by their mutations as an offspring survival genomic dominion, was implicated in the autosomal dominant (389 genes) and recessive (426 genes) inheritance in modern humans.

<title>Structurally, functionally, and evolutionary distinct classes of HSRS share the relatively restricted elite set of common genetic targets</title>
<p id="Par42">It has been suggested that unified activities of thousands candidate HSRS comprising a coherent compendium of genomic regulatory elements markedly distinct in their structure, function, and evolutionary origin may have contributed to development and manifestation of human-specific phenotypic traits (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>). It was of interest to determine whether genes previously linked to other classes of HSRS, which were identified without considerations of neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs, overlap with genes associated in this contribution with genomic regulatory loci harboring human-specific SNCs. To this end, genes associated with different classes of HSRS were identified using the GREAT algorithm, subjected to the GSEA, and compared with the set of 8405 genes linked with neuro-regulatory hsSNCs.

<p id="Par43">To determine whether the patterns of significant phenotypic associations observed for genes linked with HSRS are specific and not related to the size effects of relatively large gene sets subjected to the GSEA, 42,847 human genes not linked by the GREAT algorithm with HSRS were randomly split into 21 control gene sets of various sizes ranging from 2847 to 6847 genes and subjected to the GSEA (Supplemental Notes <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM11">2</xref>).

<p id="Par44">In agreement with this conclusion, it was observed that the common gene set of putative regulatory targets shared by HSRS and neuro-regulatory hsSNCs composes of 7406 coding genes (88% of all human-specific SNC-associated genes), indicating that structurally and functionally diverse HSRS, the evolutionary origin of which has been driven by mechanistically distinct processes, appear to favor the genomic regulatory alignment with the relatively restricted elite set of genetic targets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>; Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">S9</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM14">S3</xref>). The estimated timeline of the evolutionary origin of 59,089 HSRS is likely to encompass many thousands, perhaps, hundred thousand years.

<p id="Par45">Previous studies have identified stem cell–associated retroviral sequences (SCARS) encoded by human endogenous retroviruses LTR7/HERVH and LTR5_Hs/HERVK as one of the significant sources of the evolutionary origin of HSRS (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016a</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">b</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">c</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">b</xref>), including human-specific transcription factor–binding sites (TFBS) for NANOG, OCT4, and CTCF (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016a</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">b</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par46">Next, the common sets of genetic regulatory targets were identified for SCARS-regulated genes and genes associated in this study with human-specific regulatory SNCs (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">S9</xref>). It has been determined that each of the structurally distinct families of SCARS appears to share a common set of genetic regulatory targets with human-specific SNCs (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">S8</xref>). Overall, the expression of nearly two-thirds (5389 genes; 64%) of all genes identified as putative regulatory targets of human-specific SNCs is regulated by SCARS (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">S9</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM14">S3</xref>). Consistent with the idea that structurally diverse HSRS may favor the relatively restricted elite set of genetic targets, the combined gene set of regulatory targets for HSRS, SCARS, and SNCs composes of 7990 coding genes or 95% of all genes associated in this contribution with human-specific neuro-regulatory SNCs (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">S9</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM14">S3</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par47">To gain insights into mechanisms of SCARS-mediated effects on expression of 5389 genes linked to human-specific regulatory SNCs, the numbers of genes manifesting either activated (downregulated following SCARS silencing) or inhibited (upregulated following SCARS silencing) expression have been determined. It was observed that SCARS exert the predominantly inhibitory effect on expression of genes associated with human-specific regulatory SNCs, which is exemplified by activated expression of as many as 87% of genes affected by SCARS silencing (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">S9</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM14">S3</xref>). These findings indicate that when SCARS-associated networks are active during the human preimplantation embryogenesis, they exert a dominant effect on gene expression, whereas when SCARS are silenced during the postimplantation embryonic development and in the adulthood, regulatory impact of human-specific neuro-regulatory SNCs may be prevalent.</p>

<title>Genes linked with neuro-regulatory hsSNCs represent intrinsic genetic elements of developmentally and physiologically distinct human-specific GRNs</title>
<p id="Par48">Since distinct families of HSRS, including neuro-regulatory hsSNCs, share common sets of genetic targets, it was of interest to determine whether hsSNC-linked genes are represented among genes previously identified as components of human-specific GRNs operating in developmentally and physiologically distinct human tissues and cells. Importantly, human-specific GRNs selected for these analyses were defined employing vastly different experimental, analytical, and computational approaches that were applied within the broad range of experimental settings (Glinsky, 2019). Specifically, the interrogated human-specific GRNs include the following datasets: (i) Great Apes’ whole-genome sequencing–guided human-specific insertions and deletions (Kronenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>); (ii) genome-wide analysis of retrotransposon’s transcriptome in postmortem samples of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Guffanti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>); (iii) shRNA-mediated silencing of LTR7/HERVH retrovirus–derived long non-coding RNAs in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2014</xref>); (iv) single-cell expression profiling analyses of human preimplantation embryos (Glinsky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>); (v) network of genes associated with regulatory transposable elements (TE) operating in naïve and primed hESC (Theunissen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>; Pontis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>; Barakat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>; Glinsky and Barakat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>); (vi) pluripotency-related network of genes manifesting concordant expression changes in human fetal brain and adult neocortex (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>); (vii) network of genes governing human neurogenesis in vivo (Nowakowski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>); (viii) network of genes differentially expressed during human corticogenesis in vitro (van de Leemput et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>).

<title>SCARS-regulated genes linked with neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs manifest dominant patterns of significant associations to physiological and pathological phenotypes of modern humans</title>
<p id="Par50">A putative regulatory nexus of human-specific neuro-regulatory SNCs and target genes has been inferred based on their genomic proximity to each other taking into account genome-wide folding patterns of linear chromatin fibers in human cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). This approach narrows the list of putative regulatory targets to 8405 genes manifesting marked enrichment patterns to thousands of physiological and pathological phenotypes of modern humans. However, this relatively large set of hsSNC-linked genes appears to represent a highly diverse biologically and structurally collection of genetic loci, which makes design and execution of follow-up functional validation experiments very challenging. Therefore, it was of interest to ascertain whether the elite list of high priority genetic targets for follow-up functional validation studies could be refined further by performing additional differential GSEA on smaller sets of genes segregated from a parent set of 8405 hsSNC-linked genes.</p>
<p id="Par51">Present analyses identified 5389 hsSNC-linked genes, the expression of which in hESC is regulated by stem cell–associated retroviral sequences (SCARS). It was of interest to ascertain the contribution of SCARS-regulated genes to a global scale of significant associations of hsSNC-linked genes to phenotypes of modern humans. To this end, the set of 8405 hsSNC-regulated genes was segregated into a set of 5389 hsSNC-linked SCARS-regulated genes and a set of 3016 hsSNC-linked non-SCARS-regulated genes. Next, the differential GSEA were carried separately on these two sets of genes using 29 genomic databases and numbers of significantly enriched records were recorded for each interrogated database (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). It has been observed that SCARS-regulated genes consistently scored markedly higher numbers of significantly enriched records compared with non-SCARS-regulated genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). Overall, SCARS-regulated hsSNC-linked genes scored 9.8-fold greater number of significantly enriched records compared with hsSNC-linked genes that are not regulated by SCARS (10,645 versus 1089 records, respectfully; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). Two exceptions form this pattern have been noted: the ARCHS4 Human Tissues database and the Allen Brain Atlas database of upregulated genes. In these instances, numbers of identified significantly enriched records were similar for both SCARS-regulated and non-SCARS-regulated hsSNC-linked genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). Consistently, differential GSEA of multiple databases attributed all statistically significant phenotypic associations to SCARS-regulated genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>SCARS-regulated genes associated with neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs manifest prominent patterns of significant associations with physiological and pathological phenotypes of modern humans.

These two categories of hsSNC-linked genes were subjected to gene set enrichment analyses to identify statistically significant associations with morphological features and physiological and pathological phenotypes of modern humans.

<p id="Par52">Based on results of the above analyses, it has been concluded that 5389 SCARS-regulated genes linked to fixed neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs appear to drive the associations with a preponderance of physiological processes, morphological features, and pathological conditions of modern humans.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par54">In recent years, the elucidation of genetic and molecular mechanisms defining the phenotypic uniqueness of modern humans attained a significant progress in illuminating the potentially broad role of thousands human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS) in contrast to the relatively modest impact of human-specific changes of a limited number of coding genes (Kronenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>; Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016a</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>; Kanton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>). Previous reports reflect this progress by focusing on analyses of sub-sets of human-specific structural variations to highlight mechanistically distinct pathways of their evolutionary origins (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016a</xref>) or their potential impacts on evolution of defined human-specific traits (reviewed in Levchenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>). For example, a recent review of Levchenko et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>) was primarily focused on human accelerated regions (HARs) and their regulatory impacts on specific target genes of potential relevance to development of human brain. Major limitations of the previous reports were a lack of considerations of 35,074 neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs discovered by Kanton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>) and the absence of analyses of potential contributions of SCARS as well as SCARS-regulated genes to human-specific genomic regulatory networks.</p>
<p id="Par55">Observations reported in this contribution are in agreement with the previous reports (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>; Levchenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>), emphasizing the significant contributions of human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS) to development and functions of human brain. However, results of the present analyses revealed unexpectedly broad impacts of HSRS, including neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs, and downstream target genes on morphological structures, physiological functions, aging, and pathological phenotypes of modern humans. Collectively, reported herein findings argue that a preponderance of anatomical features, physiological functions, and pathological phenotypes of modern humans appear to evolve within genomic regulatory frameworks controlled by HSRS, including neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs.</p>
<p id="Par56">Macromolecules comprising the essential building blocks of life at the cellular and organismal levels remain highly conserved during the evolution of humans and other Great Apes. Identification and initial structural-functional characterization of nearly hundred thousand candidate HSRS (Kronenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>; Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>; Kanton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>; this contribution) validate the idea that unique to human phenotypes may result from human-specific changes to genomic regulatory sequences defined as regulatory mutations (King and Wilson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1975</xref>). Technological advances enabled the exquisite degree of accuracy of molecular definition of 35,074 SNCs that are fixed in humans, distinct from other primates, and located in DA chromatin regions during human brain development (Kanton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>). Notably, 99.8% of candidate regulatory hsSNCs that overlap DA chromatin regions during brain development are shared with the archaic humans while only 64 hsSNCs are unique to modern humans. The conservation on the human lineage of a vast majority of neuro-regulatory hsSNCs associated with early stages of human brain development suggests that coding genes associated with hsSNCs may have a broad effect on human-specific traits beyond embryonic development. This concept has been substantiated by the multiple lines of evidence acquired and reported in the present contribution.</p>
<p id="Par57">Employing the GREAT algorithm (McLean et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>), 8405 genes have been identified that are linked to 35,074 hsSNCs via genomic proximity co-localization analysis, indicating that the expression of these hsSNC-linked genes might be affected by hsSNCs located in DA chromatin regions during brain development. Comprehensive gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of these 8405 genes revealed the large scale of associations with physiological processes, morphological features, and pathological conditions of <italic>H. sapiens</italic>. Significantly enriched records include more than 1000 anatomically distinct regions of the adult human brain, many human tissues and cell types, more than 200 common human disorders, and more than 1000 rare diseases. Notably, similar patterns of phenotypic associations have been observed for genes linked to 59,089 previously defined structurally, functionally, and evolutionary distinct classes of HSRS.</p>
<p id="Par58">One of main conclusions of this work is that structurally and functionally diverse HSRS appear to display the genomic regulatory alignment with the relatively restricted elite set of genetic targets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>; Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">S9</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM14">S3</xref>). The estimated timeline of the evolutionary origin of HSRS and neuro-regulatory hsSNCs is likely to span hundred thousand years, and their creation has been driven by stochastic events and mechanistically distinct processes. Therefore, these seemingly apparent functional redundancy in building human-specific GRNs is likely to have biologically meaningful implications contributing to manifestations of human-specific phenotypes. The common patterns of the genomic placement of HSRS appear uniformly associated with sub-sets of genes comprising the putative regulatory targets of neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>; Supplemental Table Set <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM14">S3</xref>), perhaps, implying that imposing of human-specific elements of genomic regulatory control on this elite set of genes may reflect their importance for the emergence and refinement of human-specific traits. Impacts of HSRS span from multi-lineage markers expressing (MLME) cells of human preimplantation embryos (Glinsky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>) to cells engaged in the early stages of human brain development (Kanton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>) and functions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the adult human brain (Guffanti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). Therefore, combinatorial contributions of distinct families of HSRS may be necessary to facilitate human-specific patterns of expression of the elite set of target genes in different types of human cells at distinct developmental stages and in the adulthood.</p>
<p id="Par59">Based on the reported above observations, it has been concluded that genes linked to neuro-regulatory hsSNCs appear contributing to development, morphological architecture, and biological functions of the adult human brain, other components of the central nervous system, and many tissues and organs across human body. They were implicated in the extensive range of human physiological and pathological conditions, thus supporting the hypothesis that phenotype-altering effects of neuro-regulatory hsSNCs are not restricted to the early stages of human brain development. Results of the analyses utilizing the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">http://www.informatics.jax.org/</ext-link>) revealed that neuro-regulatory hsSNC-associated genes affect wide spectra of traits defining both physiology and pathology of modern humans, perhaps reflecting the global scale of human-specific regulatory impacts on thousands essential mammalian phenotypes. Significantly, outlined herein analytical approaches and reported end points provide readily available access to mouse models for precise molecular definitions of unique to humans regulatory effects of neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs and other types of HSRS on genes causally affecting thousands of defined mammalian phenotypes and hundreds of common and rare human disorders.</p>

<title>Candidate human-specific regulatory sequences and African apes–specific retroviral insertions</title>
<p id="Par60">A total of 94,806 candidate HSRS, including 35,074 neuro-regulatory human-specific SNCs, detailed descriptions of which, and corresponding references of primary original contributions, are reported elsewhere (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>; Glinsky and Barakat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>; Kanton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>). Solely publicly available datasets and resources were used in this contribution. The significance of the differences in the expected and observed numbers of events was calculated using two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Additional placement enrichment tests were performed for individual classes of HSRS taking into account the size in base pair of corresponding genomic regions.</p>

<title>Categories of DNA sequence conservation</title>
<p id="Par61">Identification of highly conserved in primates (pan-primate), primate-specific, and human-specific sequences was performed as previously described (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">b</xref>). In brief, all categories were defined by direct and reciprocal mapping using LiftOver. Specifically, the following categories of candidate regulatory sequences were distinguished:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par62">Highly conserved in primates’ sequences: DNA sequences that have at least 95% of bases remapped during conversion from/to human (Homo sapiens, hg38), chimp (Pan troglodytes, v5), and bonobo (Pan paniscus, v2; in specifically designated instances, Pan paniscus, v1 was utilized for comparisons). Similarly, highly conserved sequences were defined for hg38 and latest releases of genomes of Gorilla, Orangutan, Gibbon, and Rhesus.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par63">Primate-specific: DNA sequences that failed to map to the mouse genome (mm10).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par64">Human-specific: DNA sequences that failed to map at least 10% of bases from human to both chimpanzee and bonobo. All candidate HSRS identified based on the sequence alignments failures to genomes of both chimpanzee and bonobo were subjected to more stringent additional analyses requiring the mapping failures to genomes of Gorilla, Orangutan, Gibbon, and Rhesus. These loci were considered created <italic>de novo</italic> human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS).</p></list-item></list></p>
<p id="Par65">To infer the putative evolutionary origins, each evolutionary classification was defined independently by running the corresponding analyses on all candidate HSRS representing the specific category. For example, human-rodent conversion identify sequences that are absent in the mouse genome based on the sequence identity threshold of 10%. Additional comparisons were performed using the same methodology and exactly as stated in the manuscript text. Human brain regions’ marker genes were identified among genes linked to hsSNCs by analyzing genes significantly upregulated in specified human brain regions using the Allen Brain Atlas database. Brain region–specific records manifesting significantly increased expression at 1.5-fold cutoff were selected for analyses. Genes differentially expressed in human versus chimpanzee adult brains were identified among hsSNC-linked genes by analyzing genes differentially expressed in eight regions of human versus chimpanzee adult brains (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Gene set enrichment and genome-wide proximity placement analyses</title>
<p id="Par66">Gene set enrichment analyses were carried out using the Enrichr bioinformatics platform, which enables the interrogation of nearly 200,000 gene sets from more than 100 gene set libraries. The Enrichr API (January 2018 through January 2020 releases) (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>; Kuleshov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>) was used to test genes linked to HSRS of interest for significant enrichment in numerous functional categories. In all tables and plots (unless stated otherwise), in addition to the nominal <italic>p</italic> values and adjusted <italic>p</italic> values, the “combined score” calculated by Enrichr is reported, which is a product of the significance estimate and the magnitude of enrichment (combined score <italic>c =</italic> log(<italic>p</italic>) <italic>× z</italic>, where <italic>p</italic> is the Fisher’s exact test <italic>p</italic> value and <italic>z</italic> is the z-score deviation from the expected rank). When technically feasible, larger sets of genes comprising several thousand entries were analyzed. Regulatory connectivity maps between HSRS and coding genes and additional functional enrichment analyses were performed with the GREAT algorithm (McLean et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>) at default settings. The reproducibility of the results was validated by implementing two releases of the GREAT algorithm: GREAT version 3.0.0 (February 15, 2015 to August 18, 2019) and GREAT version 4.0.4 (August 19, 2019). The GREAT algorithm allows investigators to identify and annotate the genome-wide connectivity networks of user-defined distal regulatory loci and their putative target genes. Concurrently, the GREAT algorithm performs functional annotations and analyses of statistical enrichment of annotations of identified genes, thus enabling the inference of potential biological significance of interrogated genomic regulatory networks. Genome-wide proximity placement analysis (GPPA) of distinct genomic features co-localizing with HSRS was carried out as described previously and originally implemented for human-specific transcription factor binding sites (Glinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>).</p>

<p id="Par68">All statistical analyses of the publicly available genomic datasets, including error rate estimates, background and technical noise measurements and filtering, feature peak calling, feature selection, assignments of genomic coordinates to the corresponding builds of the reference human genome, and data visualization, were performed exactly as reported in the original publications and associated references linked to the corresponding data visualization tracks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>). Any modifications or new elements of statistical analyses are described in the corresponding sections of the Results. Statistical significance of the Pearson correlation coefficients was determined using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 software. Both nominal and Bonferroni adjusted <italic>p</italic> values were estimated. The significance of the differences in the numbers of events between the groups was calculated using two-sided Fisher’s exact and chi-square test, and the significance of the overlap between the events was determined using the hypergeometric distribution test (Tavazoie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1999</xref>).</p>
