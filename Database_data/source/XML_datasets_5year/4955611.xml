<abstract>
<p id="P1">Focal malformations of cortical development (FMCD) account for the majority of drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy. Postzygotic somatic mutations activating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway are found in a wide range of brain diseases, including FMCD. It remains unclear how a mutation in a small fraction of cells can disrupt the architecture of the entire hemisphere. We show that, within human FMCD brain, cells showing activation of this pathway were enriched for the mutation. Introducing the FMCD mutation into mouse brain resulted in electrographic seizures and impaired hemispheric architecture. Mutation-expressing neural progenitors showed reelin misexpression, which led to a non-cell autonomous migration defect in neighboring cells, due at least in part to FOXG1-mediated de-repression of reelin transcription. Treatments aimed at blocking downstream AKT signaling or inactivating reelin restored migration. These findings suggest a central AKT-FOXG1-Reelin signaling pathway in FMCD, and support pathway inhibitors as potential treatments or therapies for some forms of focal epilepsy.</p>

<p id="P2">Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are increasingly recognized as an important cause of autism, neurodevelopmental delay and epilepsy, especially medically-intractable ‘catastrophic’ epilepsy. Disruption at various critical stages of cortical development – neuronal proliferation, migration, and organization – leads to characteristic MCD. Focal MCDs (FMCD) are characterized by localized cortical and subcortical lesions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. At the most severe end of the spectrum is hemimegalencephaly (HME), a clinically devastating pediatric FMCD characterized by enlargement of most or all of one entire cerebral hemisphere. Individuals with HME typically present with epilepsy, psychomotor disability and contralateral hemiparesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Most affected individuals display progressive and catastrophic epilepsy, which invariably requires radical hemispherectomy (i.e. removal of the affected cerebral hemisphere) as a surgical treatment to relieve epilepsy and to prevent further psychomotor disability.</p>
<p id="P3">FMCDs are characterized by cortical dyslamination and ectopic neurons in the subcortical white matter, and in the most severe form of disease, are associated with the presence of dysmorphic, cytomegalic neurons and ‘balloon cells’ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The lesions are consistent with recent models of brain mosaicism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Because some FMCD lesions show pathological features similar to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related cortical tubers (i.e. presence of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6), a downstream component of mTOR activation) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, mutations in the mTOR pathway were anticipated.</p>
<p id="P4">Recently, postzygotic brain-specific somatic mosaic mutations in <italic>PIK3CA, AKT3,</italic> and <italic>MTOR</italic> were identified in FMCDs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Mutations were found in 8–30% of cells and were some of the same gain-of-function activating mutations seen in solid malignancies including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Sequencing at the single-cell level identified a mutation burden both in neural and non-neural cells, indicating that mutations occur in progenitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms of disease and potential for treatment remain poorly defined. Moreover, how a relatively small percent of cells with mutation can disrupt the organization of the entire hemisphere is largely unknown <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<sec id="S1" sec-type="results">
<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Mosaic mutation is restricted to cells with mTOR activation</title>
<p id="P5">We focused on <italic>AKT3</italic>, a commonly mutated gene in FMCD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To test whether pS6<sup>+</sup> cells were enriched for the mosaic mutation, we studied a human brain tissue with a somatic gain-of-function mutation (c.49G&gt;A; p.E17K) which was present in 19.1% of the measured alleles based upon mass spectrometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a–c</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Laser-captured microdissection of pS6<sup>+</sup> vs. pS6<sup>−</sup> neural cells was followed by PCR, then capillary sequencing and single base-extension mass spectrometry to test for the mutant allele. Analysis of captured cells showed that the mutant allele was undetectable in pools of pS6<sup>−</sup> cells whereas pS6<sup>+</sup> cells of the same brain section were enriched for the mutation, detected in 36.8% of measured alleles. We conclude that pS6 is a sensitive but not specific marker for cells carrying the mutation, suggesting that activation of the pathway is relevant to the pathogenesis of disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Mouse model of focal malformations of cortical development</title>
<p id="P6">To test whether introduction of the FMCD mutation is sufficient to cause neurodevelopmental and neuropathological features, we electroporated a vector encoding the gain-of-function mutation of AKT3 (AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>), found in at least two persons with FMCD, into the right hemisphere of embryonic day (E) 14.5 mice. We chose this model because we could limit the expression of <italic>AKT3</italic> to the neural progenitors of a single hemisphere, mimicking the somatic postzygotic mosaicism found in the embryonic brain of FMCD cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Electroporations were timed to target predominantly neurons destined for upper cortical layer (II/III), the cells proposed most severely affected in FMCD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">Histological examinations at postnatal day (P) 20 revealed key features observed in FMCD, including neuronal heterotopias, dysmorphic neurons with enlarged soma, and neuronal crowding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d–g</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. While only 5.6% ± 3.9% of cells electroporated with control vector (i.e. GFP<sup>+</sup>) failed to reach upper cortical layers (uCP, layers II/III and IV), 16.3% ± 1.6% and 55.5% ± 7.0% of cells electroporated with human wildtype AKT3 (i.e. overexpression; AKT3<sup>OE</sup>) or AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>, respectively, were misplaced either in the middle cortical layer (mCP, layer V), the lower cortical layer (loCP, layer VI), or the subventricular zone (SVZ). Misplaced cells in the SVZ expressed neuronal (NeuN) but not glial markers (GFAP). No anatomical changes in the contralateral hemisphere were found.</p>
<p id="P8">The most devastating pathologies of FMCD are early onset seizures, which are often medically intractable <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Mice electroporated with wildtype AKT3<sup>OE</sup> or AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> showed higher perinatal lethality (11.9%, vector control, <italic>n</italic> = 42; 24.3%, AKT3<sup>OE</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 37 and 67.0%, AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 103), suggesting seizures might be a cause. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording showed recurrent and unprovoked excessive activity in AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h–j</xref>). Control mice in contrast showed no activity, whereas AKT3<sup>OE</sup> mice showed only occasional bursts of lesser duration. An inflammatory response in the form of activated microglia was not apparent, suggesting disrupted neuronal circuitry or activity as a cause.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Developmental neuropathology results from AKT3 activation</title>
<p id="P9">Although clinical epilepsy may have numerous underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, the investigation of epileptogenesis in FMCD has largely focused on intracortical and corticothalamic projections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Examination of axonal projections of electroporated neurons in mice showed only typical subcortical projections (data not shown). Further, we found no gross changes in overall inhibitory neurons evidenced by number or distribution of GAD1/2<sup>+</sup> cells in electroporated regions.</p>
<p id="P10">We next examined whether the cell fate was altered by AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> expression. We utilized layer-specific markers SATB2 and CTIP2 to examine cortical cell positioning in developing brains and confirmed defective migration at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b, c</xref>). We found no changes in radial glia integrity detected by BLBP expression in electroporated regions (data not shown). In control vector-electroporated brains, 96% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells showed SATB2<sup>+</sup> uCP identity, and were CTIP2<sup>−</sup>, a mCP marker. AKT3<sup>OE</sup>- or AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-electroporated neurons were also predominantly SATB2<sup>+</sup>CTIP2<sup>−</sup> (93% or 96%, respectively) but were localized in the loCP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d, e</xref>). These data suggest that despite the migration defect, birthdate-specified identity was not altered.</p>
<p id="P11">To test neuronal migration defects in human, we utilized human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) differentiated from healthy donor induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We selected these cells because they derive from human, they have been well studied and they express markers of both differentiating and migrating neurons depending upon the type of media used for culture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing either RFP alone or AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> with RFP, then fluorescence-assisted cell sorted (FACS) for similar fluorescent intensity. In propagation media, approximately 4.6% ± 1.1% of control hNPCs expressed the neuronal differentiation marker MAP2, while 10.3% ± 3.1% of AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-expressing hNPCs were MAP2<sup>+</sup>. When cultured in differentiation media, again about twice the AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> hNPCs were MAP2<sup>+</sup> compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>), suggesting the mutation leads to premature differentiation. This was confirmed in E18.5 mouse brains, where GFP<sup>+</sup>MAP2<sup>+</sup> neurons were found below the subplate in AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-electroporated brains but not in control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">In neurosphere migration assays, control neurons migrated 113.8 μm ± 29.0 μm from the neurosphere edge after two days whereas neurons of AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-expressing neurospheres were densely located near the edge, migrating 30.9 μm ± 5.1 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). Moreover, MAP2<sup>+</sup> neurons in AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-expressing neurospheres were often misoriented and failed to display typical migration morphology. Thus the premature differentiation may contribute to the migration defects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Requirement of AKT3 kinase activity</title>
<p id="P13">To investigate the requirement of AKT3 kinase activity in mediating neuronal migration deficits <italic>in vivo</italic>, we employed <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation of AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> constructs with additional p.K177M mutation in the same vector. This mutation renders AKT3 kinase null and thus the membrane localization-inducing p.E17K mutation has no effect on activating kinase activity. The kinase-deficient mutation abolished not only neuronal migration defects but also the hyperphosphorylation of the downstream target pS6, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a–c</xref>) suggesting a requirement for kinase activity. Furthermore introducing p.S472A mutation, a phosphorylation site critical for AKT3 activation, into the vector also prevented pathology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a, b</xref>). Conversely, a pseudo-phosphorylation mutation (p.S472E), which activates downstream signaling, caused migration defects similar to that of AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>. We additionally tested the effect of overexpression of human wildtype PIK3CA (PIK3CA<sup>OE</sup>) or PIK3CA<sup>E545K</sup> mutation, a gene we and others have reported mutated in FMCD and other segmental overgrowth syndromes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and observed similar neuronal migration defects, and dysmorphic neurons with enlarged soma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c–f</xref>). Activation of PI3K in developing cortex by inducing the expression of <italic>PIK3CA<sup>H1047R</sup></italic> germline knock-in allele <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> by <italic>in utero</italic> hemispheric electroporation of Cre plasmid also caused similar neurodevelopmental defects (data not shown). Importantly, the neuronal migration defect in brains electroporated with PIK3CA<sup>E545K</sup> was almost completely prevented by co-expression of the kinase-null AKT3<sup>K177M</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c–d</xref>), consistent with a linear signaling pathway in the etiology of FMCD. Therefore the migration defect is not allele or gene specific but rather due to a general pathway hyperactivation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Developmental rescue of neuronal defects</title>
<p id="P14">To test whether inhibition of the pathway could prevent the migration defect, we administered rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of mTOR signaling, to pregnant dams for four days following electroporation of AKT3 constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Rapamycin treatment effectively rescued AKT downstream activation in developing cortex as assessed by pS6 immunostaining. It also largely rescued the cortical dyslamination resulting from aberrant neuronal migration, assessed by MAP2 immunostaining, as well as enlarged soma size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b, c</xref>). However, postnatal treatment with rapamycin at P1 and P3 did not restore neuronal migration defect caused by AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> (data not shown), suggesting a specific developmental effectiveness window.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Non-cell autonomous effect on migration</title>
<p id="P15">In AKT<sup>OE</sup>- and AKT<sup>E17K</sup>-electroporated hemispheres, we noticed an ectopic layer of SATB2<sup>+</sup> neurons in the intermediate zone (IZ) or SVZ also included cells that were GFP<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b, e</xref>), suggesting an effect of the mutant cells on neighboring wild-type cells. To explore potential non-cell autonomous migration defects we performed sequential <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation experiments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Serial electroporation of RFP followed by AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> construct also expressing GFP showed that AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-expressing cells (i.e. RFP<sup>−</sup>GFP<sup>+</sup>) affected the migration of neighboring cells (i.e. RFP<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>−</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a, b</xref>). BrdU birthdate analysis from E14.5 injections demonstrated dual-labeled ectopic AKT3<sup>OE</sup> or AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> cells in mCP or loCP, suggesting that the misplaced cells underwent DNA synthesis concomitant with other cells destined for upper cortical layers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a, b</xref>), and no significant difference in proliferation or apoptosis rates were detected in migrating neurons (data not shown). Increased GFP<sup>−</sup> cells that were BrdU<sup>+</sup> in loCP in brains expressing either AKT3 or AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> was also observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>), together suggesting an effect of AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-expressing cells on the migration of neighboring cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Functional networks underlying FMCD</title>
<p id="P16">The non-cell autonomous migration defect may be due to physical blockade of wildtype cells trying to migrate past mutant cells, or may have more specific signaling mechanisms. The AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> mutation was introduced to hNPCs via lentiviral transduction using the pBOB/Switch vector, which allows Cre-mediated recombination of the cDNA cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). To obtain homogeneous AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-expressing hNPCs, we collected cells expressing RFP at similar intensity by FACS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>), and then immediately isolated RNA and performed RNA-seq expression profiling. We identified 835 genes whose expression was significantly altered (false-discovery-rate-corrected <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) in AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> compared with empty vector. These included several genes previously reported downstream of AKT signaling such as <italic>CDKN2A</italic> (encoding p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and p14<sup>ARF</sup>), <italic>CDKN2B</italic> (encoding p15<sup>INK4b</sup>) and <italic>CCND1</italic> (encoding cyclin D1), suggesting robust methodology. Network analysis of the 835 genes using gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed four major categories: 1] Neuronal development, 2] Migration 3] Signaling and homeostasis and 4] Cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S9">
<title>Genetic rescue identifies reversible FMCD network</title>
<p id="P17">To determine reversibility of molecular changes induced by FMCD mutations, Cre recombinase was introduced by adenoviral transduction into hNPCs, to remove the <italic>AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-viral 2A-RFP</italic> cassette. Cre recombination also removed the stop codon located 5′ of the GFP start site, enabling visualization of recombined cells by GFP expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). Upon Cre expression, AKT3 transcript level was restored to basal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>) suggesting efficient genetic recombination that correlated with color switching from red to green. Repeating the RNA-seq analysis identified 275 of the 835 genes (i.e. 1/3) persistently misexpresssed, whereas the majority 560 (i.e. 2/3) saw expression changes restored or moved in the opposite direction (i.e. reversed).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S10">
<title>Critical role of reelin in developmental pathogenesis</title>
<p id="P18">The rescue of the migration defect with rapamycin suggested that the relevant pathway disrupted by AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> expression was reversible, and thus we focused on the set of genes that restored expression following Cre recombination. Among these, <italic>RELN</italic>, encoding the reelin secreted glycoprotein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> essential for neuronal migration and lamination during cortical development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, was the most significantly changed gene (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.00005), and was dramatically upregulated.</p>
<p id="P19">Loss of <italic>RELN</italic> leads to profound defects in neuronal positioning and dendritogenesis in human and mouse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, whereas ectopic expression in migrating neurons induces neuronal ectopia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We confirmed increased expression of <italic>RELN</italic> in AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> hNPCs, increased about ten-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). In AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-expressing brains, reelin was detected in excessive amounts, localized to perisomal regions close to ectopic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Reelin misexpression by AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> was not detected at postnatal day 20, suggesting that the pathogenic mechanisms are limited to a specific developmental window (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). We also examined the expression of <italic>RELN</italic> in pS6<sup>+</sup> vs. pS6<sup>−</sup> cells microdissected from surgically resected FMCD human brain lesions tested for somatic AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> mutation and confirmed <italic>RELN</italic> expression in only one of four pool of the pS6<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). We conclude that reelin misexpression resulting from AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> is mostly limited to developing rather than mature neurons.</p>
<p id="P20">Reelin is initially expressed throughout in the cortical anlage at the preplate stage (E9.5), but after E11.5 expression is mainly restricted to the Cajal-Retzius cells of the marginal zone. Therefore, we tested the degree to which defective migration in AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-expressing cells and neighboring cells was due to the misexpression of reelin in ectopic regions by knockdown of <italic>Reln</italic> in AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-electroporated cells. <italic>In utero</italic> electroporation of <italic>Reln</italic> siRNA constructs into cortical progenitors alone produced no defect in migration, supporting its role in specialized Cajal-Retzius cells at this time point. However, the migration defect of AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-expressing neurons was partially but significantly restored (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) by the co-electroporation of siRNA targeting <italic>Reln</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c, d</xref>) suggesting its overexpression in AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> cells leads to an autocrine or paracrine effect. To test specifically for a paracrine effect of reelin on neuronal migration, sequential electroporation of RFP followed by a mixture of AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> and <italic>Reln</italic> siRNA was electroporated such that RFP-expressing cells should thus no longer be exposed to ectopic reelin (i.e. GFP<sup>+</sup>). This nearly fully rescued the non-cell autonomous migration defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e, f</xref>) suggests a central role for ectopic reelin expression in the etiology of the migration defect in AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> brains.</p>

<title>Reelin misregulation by activation of AKT3-FOXG1 pathway</title>
<p id="P21">To investigate the mechanism by which AKT3 regulates reelin expression, we looked for commonalities in genes altered by AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> but restored after Cre recombination. We found that among the genes meeting this criterion, there was over-representation of those with FOX-binding sites within 5kb upstream of the transcription start site (<italic>P</italic> = 1.3 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>). The forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors mediate downstream signaling from the AKT pathway. Despite the established role of the FOXO class mediating AKT downstream effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, expression of constitutively active FOXO1 or FOXO3A in hNPCs, did not repress <italic>RELN</italic> expression (data not shown).</p>
<p id="P22">In mice, <italic>Foxg1</italic> controls the morphogenesis of the telencephalon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and mutants show increased numbers of reelin-expressing Cajal-Retzius cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Under basal condition, FOX factors act as transcriptional repressors, but after phosphorylation by AKT, there is cytoplasmic translocation, inhibiting transcriptional repressor activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Thus, we searched for conserved FOX-binding sequences and identified four potential sites (R1–R4) upstream of <italic>RELN</italic>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that FOXG1 was significantly enriched (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in two of the sites that have two FOX-binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). Next, we confirmed cytoplasmic localization of FOXG1 in hNPCs expressing AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6d, e</xref>). In NIH 3T3 cells, Foxg1-GFP fusion protein predominantly localized to the nucleus, however, co-expression with AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> induced cytoplasmic translocation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6f, g</xref>). Mutation of the putative T271 phosphorylation site to non-phosphorylatable alanine (Foxg1<sup>T271A</sup>) abolished AKT3<sup>E17K</sup>-induced cytoplasmic translocation of Foxg1. Conversely, the phosphomimetic glutamic acid (Foxg1<sup>T271E</sup>) increased cytoplasmic localization. Furthermore, increased <italic>RELN</italic> transcription in AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> hNPCs was repressed by the expression of Foxg1<sup>T271A</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6h</xref>). Similar to <italic>Reln</italic> siRNA, co-electroporation of Foxg1<sup>T271A</sup> in developing brain partially rescued migration defects caused by AKT3<sup>E17K</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c, d</xref>).

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P23">A major focus in neuroscience is improved care for patients with intractable epilepsy. The fact that the vast majority of patients undergoing surgical resection of FMCDs become seizure-free and show cognitive stabilization or improvement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> indicates that the focus for the neurocognitive defects most frequently resides within the lesion.</p>
<p id="P24">Here we demonstrate that postzygotic mutations identified in FMCDs are restricted to cells reporting activation of the pathway, and are sufficient to recapitulate the disrupted neuronal migration, excessive neuronal size, altered differentiation, and epileptiform activity observed in FMCDs. The question became how somatic mutations in just a small percentage of cells could produce such severe and widespread defects in brain development. Profiling mRNAs pointed to reelin ectopic misexpression which was due at least in part to AKT3-mediated phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of Foxg1, leading to cytoplasmic localization and reelin derepression in developing brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6h</xref>).</p>
<p id="P25">A role for the mTOR pathway in brain development was first proposed from work in tuberous sclerosis complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and later demonstrated through conditional removal of key regulators like <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>TSC1/2</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The emerging consensus is that activation of the pathway leads to neuronal hypertrophy, excessive dendritic branching, with a cell-type specific effect on excitability, whereas inhibition shows opposite effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Recently focus has been on the mTOR pathway in autism, both because of the striking autistic features displayed by persons with monogenic syndromic mTORopathies, as well as evidence of mutations in the mTOR pathway in individuals with non-syndromic forms of autism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This connection is supported by animal models with forebrain-specific deletion of <italic>Pten</italic> or cerebellar-specific deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> resulting in marked abnormalities of social behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The data suggest that germline or widespread mutations may result in overt structural brain defects, whereas subtle, cell-type specific or mosaic mutations may result in restricted phenotypes.</p>
<p id="P26"><italic>De novo</italic> heterozygous mutations in <italic>FOXG1</italic> present with a congenital variant of Rett syndrome with a generalized cortical malformation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, suggesting haploinsufficiency as a disease mechanism, whereas complete deletion in mouse results in near absence of the telencephalon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Interestingly, whereas humans with homozygous <italic>RELN</italic> mutations present with a form of lissencephaly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, <italic>RELN</italic> genetic variants in the 5′ UTR predispose to autistic disorder <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. A conceptual advance in our data is that it was not so much reelin misexpression but rather ectopic misexpression in cortical zones not normally exposed to reelin that led to the migration defect during developmental stage. Knockdown of <italic>Reln</italic> rescued migration not just for the neighboring cells but also the cells expressing the AKT3 mutation, suggesting autocrine or paracrine effect of reelin on neuronal migration. Rapamycin rescued the non-cell autonomous migration defect probably because of its effect on cell autonomous migration defects, thus hindering accumulation of reelin in this ectopic location. The ectopic <italic>RELN</italic> misexpression was seen in developing brain but not in mature brain, suggesting that <italic>RELN</italic> expression will not be a sensitive marker for cells with mTOR pathway mutations in human cortical resections.</p>
<p id="P27">The results suggest two possible explanations for FMCD-related seizures in humans: a] cortical dyslamination due to disrupted migration or b] increased neuronal excitability related to morphological or signaling changes. Although cortical dyslamination can cause neuronal circuitry defects such as abnormal intracortical and corticothalamic projections linked to epilepsy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, epileptic seizures are traditionally characterized as the synchronous neural hyperactivity arising from imbalanced excitation and inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. While reelin signaling regulates dendrite growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and ion channel compartmentalization contributing to hyperpolarization-activated cation currents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, no epileptic phenotype has been reported in mice under- or over-expressing reelin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. On the other hand hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway can increase neuronal excitation. Thus, the data argue in favor of mTOR pathways as making a larger contribution to epilepsy in the mTORopathies.</p>
<p id="P28">Mutations in PI3K-AKT pathway have long been recognized in brain tumors, with somatic mutations found in upwards of 90% of GBMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Why then do persons with FMCD with the same mutation not develop tumors? One possibility is that PI3K-AKT pathway transformation is cell-cycle dependent. However, most neuroblasts are actively dividing during periods of migration, so this is unlikely to create a barrier to transformation. Another possibility is that activating mutations are not sufficient for cellular transformation in neural cells, and data certainly support cooperativity among signaling pathways such as p53 and Rb in the induction of high-grade astrocytomas in adults <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

After 7 days, cells were re-plated onto irradiated CF-1 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) feeder layer. The culture medium was replaced the next day with hESC/iPSC medium (DMEM:F12 supplemented with 20% KOSR and 20 ng/ml bFGF, 1X nonessential amino acids, 110 μM 2-mercaptoethanol). Healthy colonies were selected for further cultivation and evaluation. After 3 passages, iPSCs were transferred to MEFs free plates and cultured with mTeSr medium (Stem Cells Technologies). For the generation of human neural progenitors cells, embryoid bodies (EBs) were formed by mechanical dissociation of cell clusters and plated in suspension in differentiation medium (DMEM F12, 1X N2, 1 μM Dorsomorphin (Tocris), 2 μM A8301 (Tocris)) and kept shaking at 95 rpm for 7 days.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. For <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation, experiments were designed to include both littermate and non-littermate controls with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h–j</xref> where control and experimental groups were non-littermate. Because the animal groups were defined by electroporated DNA or RNA, no randomization was used. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h–j</xref>, the investigators were blinded to group allocation during the experiment and when assessing the outcome. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6g</xref>, upsteam5000.fa.gz and tfbsConsSites.txt.gz were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser database. These files contain the upsteam promoter sequence of all annotated genes in the human genome and binding sites for a number of transcription factors. The two data sets were intersected based on whether there was any overlap between the 5,000 bases upstream of each gene and the FOX-binding sites to decide for each gene whether its promoter region was associated with FOX. A given gene set is tested for enrichment of FOX-binding sites in its promoter by first counting the number of genes in the set whose 5′ UTRs overlap FOX-binding sites and as a null distribution counting the number of genes that overlap for randomly selected without replacement subsets of the matched number of genes in the human genome (10,000 iterations). By this process an empirical <italic>P-</italic>value is calculated for the significance of the enrichment for the gene list specified.</p>

Arrowheads: reelin immunostaining in pericellular area of ectopic neurons (intensity-per-pixel: 622.55 ± 45.80 compared to 4092.77 ± 9.46, marginal zone). (<bold>c</bold>) E14.5 embryos were co-electroporated with indicated constructs or RNAs.
