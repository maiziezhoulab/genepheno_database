Using mouse mutants, we identify a function for this isoform at photoreceptor-glial junctions and demonstrate that loss of this isoform accelerates photoreceptor death. Therefore, our isoform identification strategy enables discovery of new gene functions relevant to disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Most genes generate multiple mRNA isoforms. Mechanisms such as alternative splicing, intron retention, and alternative transcription start/stop sites serve to diversify mRNA sequences, yielding isoforms that often differ in their protein-coding capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These mechanisms are especially common in the central nervous system (CNS), where alternative isoform use is particularly prevalent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The diverse portfolio of CNS isoforms contributes in important ways to a wide range of neural functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, dysregulation of isoform expression is implicated in neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For these reasons, there is increasing awareness that genetic studies of CNS development, function, and disease will need to take isoform diversity into account.</p>
<p id="Par4">Despite this clear importance, information about the number and the identity of CNS mRNA isoforms remains surprisingly scarce—even within the major transcriptome annotation databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has led to an explosion of new information about alternative splicing; however, because typical RNA-seq read lengths are &lt;200 bp, the method is not able to resolve the full-length sequence of multi-kilobase transcripts. Therefore, by relying on RNA-seq alone, it is impossible to determine the number of isoforms produced by any given gene, or their full-length sequences.</p>
<p id="Par5">In the absence of reliable full-length transcript annotations, the design and interpretation of genetic experiments become exceedingly difficult. For example, unless transcript sequences are known, it is difficult to be certain that a “knockout” mouse allele has been properly designed to fully eliminate expression of all isoforms. Unannotated isoforms can also be problematic for understanding how mutations lead to pathology in human genetic disease. Hidden isoforms may possess uncharacterized protein-coding sequences or unexpected expression patterns, which could cause the molecular and cellular consequences of disease-linked mutations to be misinterpreted. Thus, lack of comprehensive isoform sequence information remains a major impediment to our understanding of both normal gene function and the phenotypic consequences of gene dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">Here we sought to address this deficiency by uncovering the isoform diversity of genes encoding CNS cell-surface molecules. We focused on this gene set for two reasons. First, some of the most striking examples of functionally significant isoform diversity are found among genes of this class. These include the Drosophila <italic>Dscam1</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the mammalian clustered protocadherins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and the neurexin gene family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Each of these genes produces hundreds of protein isoforms with distinct binding specificity, diversifying the molecular recognition events that mediate assembly of the nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. From these examples it seems clear that, to understand the molecular basis for neural circuit wiring, it will be necessary to define the precise repertoire of cell-surface protein isoforms expressed in the developing CNS. A second reason for focusing on cell-surface molecules is that genetic alterations affecting them have been implicated in numerous CNS disorders. These include autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, in the vast majority of these cases, it remains unclear why certain mutations increase disease risk. Comprehensive isoform identification has great potential to reveal how these genetic variants cause disease pathology.</p>
<p id="Par7">Here we devised a strategy that leverages Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequencing technology to generate comprehensive catalogs of CNS cell-surface molecules. Long-read sequencing is ideal for full-length transcript identification; however, sequencing depth is not yet sufficient to reveal the full scope of isoform diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. To overcome this limitation we adapted a strategy from short-read sequencing, in which targeted cDNAs are pulled down with biotinylated probes against known exons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This approach yielded major improvements in long-read coverage, revealing an unexpectedly rich diversity of isoforms encoded by the targeted genes. To make sense of these complex datasets, we developed bioinformatics tools for the classification and comparison of isoforms, and for determining their expression patterns using short-read RNA-seq data.</p>
<p id="Par8">To demonstrate how our approach can illuminate gene function, we analyzed one gene, <italic>Crb1</italic>, in detail. <italic>Crb1</italic> is a member of the evolutionarily conserved Crumbs gene family, which encode cell-surface proteins that mediate apico-basal epithelial polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In the retina, CRB1 localizes to the outer limiting membrane (OLM), a set of structurally important junctions between photoreceptors and neighboring glial cells known as Müller glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. OLM junctions form at precise subcellular domains within each cell type, suggesting a high degree of molecular specificity in the establishment of these intercellular contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. There is great interest in understanding the function of CRB1 at OLM junctions, because loss-of-function mutations in human <italic>CRB1</italic> cause a spectrum of retinal degenerative disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. It has been proposed that loss of OLM integrity might play a role in disease pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, but studies in mice have yet to convincingly support this model: Deletion of the known <italic>Crb1</italic> isoform neither disrupts the OLM nor causes significant photoreceptor degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Here we identify a new <italic>Crb1</italic> isoform that is far more abundant—in both mouse and human retina—than the canonical isoform. Using mutant mice, we show that this isoform is required for OLM integrity and that its removal is required to adequately phenocopy the human degenerative disease. These results call for a major revision to prevailing models of CRB1 disease genetics and pathobiology. Thus, our findings provide a striking example of how comprehensive isoform characterization can unveil important gene functions that were previously overlooked, enabling new insights into many biological questions including the biology of disease-associated genes.</p>

<title>Cataloging isoforms via long-read capture sequencing</title>
<p id="Par9">To define the isoform diversity of CNS cell surface molecules, we first manually screened RNA-seq data from mouse retina and brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> to identify genes that showed unannotated mRNA diversity. We focused on cell surface receptors of the epidermal growth factor (EGF), Immunoglobulin (Ig), and adhesion G-protein coupled receptor superfamilies, as these genes have known roles in cell-cell recognition. For each gene screened (<italic>n</italic> = 402), we assessed whether it was expressed during CNS development, and if so, whether RNA-seq reads supported existence of unannotated exons or splice junctions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). We found that ~15% of genes (60/402) showed strong evidence of multiple unannotated features. These genes were selected as candidates for long-read sequencing.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Strategy for identifying cell surface receptors that exhibit high isoform diversity.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Screening strategy for selecting genes for lrCaptureSeq. Members of EGF, Ig, and adhesion GPCR families were tested for (1) expression during neural development, using RNA-seq data from retina and cortex; and (2) unannotated transcript diversity, based on RNA-seq read alignments to the UCSC Genes public database, which revealed use of unannotated exons, transcriptional start sites, and alternative splice sites. Thirty genes showing strong evidence for unannotated events (asterisks) were selected for targeted sequencing of full length transcripts (<bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold>). <bold>b</bold> lrCaptureSeq workflow. cDNAs are 5′ tagged to enable identification of full-length reads.

<p id="Par10">To comprehensively identify these genes’ transcripts, we developed a method to improve PacBio sequencing depth for large (&gt;4 kb) and moderately expressed cDNAs, such as those on our candidate gene list. We term this strategy long-read capture sequencing (lrCaptureSeq), because we adapted prior CaptureSeq approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> to enable characterization of protein-coding cDNAs with the long-read PacBio platform. In lrCaptureSeq (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>), biotinylated probes are designed to tile known exons without crossing splice junctions, so as to avoid targeting particular isoforms. These probes are used to pull down cDNAs from libraries that have been size-selected to filter truncated cDNAs. This size selection was essential to obtaining full-length reads (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>), because shorter fragments tend to dominate the sequencing output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par11">To implement lrCaptureSeq, we first filtered the initial candidate list down to 30 that were predicted to encode cDNAs of similar length (4–8 kb). The final target list included genes involved in axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and neuron-glial interactions; it also included one gene, <italic>Crb1</italic>, which is implicated in inherited photoreceptor degeneration. Some targeted genes were known to generate many isoforms (<italic>Nrxn1, Nrxn3</italic>), but in most cases isoform diversity had not previously been characterized. When captured cDNAs were sequenced on the PacBio platform, ~132,000 full-length reads were generated per experiment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). These reads were strongly enriched for the targeted genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>), and the vast majority of reads were within the targeted length range (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Thus, lrCaptureSeq can achieve deep full-length coverage of larger cDNAs that are underrepresented in other long-read datasets.</p>

<sec id="Sec4">
<title>A comprehensive isoform catalog generated by lrCaptureSeq</title>
<p id="Par12">To catalog isoforms for all 30 genes across development and across CNS regions, we performed lrCaptureSeq at a variety of timepoints in mouse retina and brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). The number of isoforms, and reads comprising each, were determined using PacBio Iso-Seq software, together with custom software we developed for the analysis of <underline>iso</underline>form <underline>pop</underline>ulation<underline>s</underline> (IsoPops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>). After this processing pipeline, the lrCaptureSeq catalog contained 4116 isoforms of the 30 targeted genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a, b</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">2</xref>)—approximately one order of magnitude greater than the number of isoforms currently annotated for this gene set in public databases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). It was also far higher than the number of isoforms predicted by popular short-read transcriptome assembly software (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>).

<p id="Par13">To ensure that these unannotated isoforms are real, we used independent datasets to validate their transcription start sites and exon junctions.

Most lrCaptureSeq exon junctions (98.9%) occurred at canonical splice sites (<italic>n</italic> = 80,590 junctions), so we expected that this analysis would corroborate their validity. Indeed, we found that the independent datasets supported the vast majority (98.1%) of lrCaptureSeq junctions (<italic>n</italic> = 79,020). This included complete junction coverage for 71% of lrCaptureSeq isoforms (<italic>n</italic> = 2925). The unconfirmed junctions were likely absent from the RNA-seq data due to low expression levels, since the isoforms that did not show complete coverage were significantly less abundant (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, unconfirmed junctions could be detected by sequencing of RT-PCR products, suggesting that they were simply below RNA-seq detection threshold (<italic>n</italic> = 9/12 absent RNA-seq junctions in <italic>Megf11</italic> gene were detected by RT-PCR).

<title>Efficient isoform detection by lrCaptureSeq</title>
<p id="Par15">To probe the accuracy and sensitivity of isoform detection, we compared our lrCaptureSeq data to previous studies of the <italic>Nrxn1</italic> and <italic>Nrxn3</italic> genes. In these studies, the α and β classes of <italic>Nrxn</italic> transcripts were amplified by PCR and then characterized using PacBio sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The total number of <italic>Nrxn1</italic> and <italic>Nrxn3</italic> isoforms we identified was similar in scale to the previous studies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>), despite radically different library preparation and bioinformatic methods. Patterns of exon usage in alternative splice sites (AS)1-AS4 were also similar (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). For example, we confirmed a deterministic AS4 splicing event identified in the previous work, wherein <italic>Nrxn3</italic> exon 24 always splices to exon 25a (<italic>n</italic> = 76 exon 24-containing isoforms, all spliced to exon 25). These findings suggest that our <italic>Nrxn</italic> isoform catalog largely matches those generated by past studies. Nevertheless, we found features of the neurexin genes not noted in the previous catalogs. Because our method was not biased by PCR primer placement, we identified isoforms that did not contain canonical α or β transcript start/termination sites, one of which accounted for 64% of our <italic>Nrxn3α</italic> reads (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Further, we detected 7 unannotated transcription termination sites, used by 16 different <italic>Nrxn3</italic>α isoforms, that truncate the mRNA upstream of the transmembrane domain (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). All seven of these new sites were corroborated with junction coverage from RNA-seq data. Together, these findings demonstrate the utility of lrCaptureSeq in recovering isoform diversity with high efficiency.</p>

<title>Many isoforms contribute to overall gene expression</title>
<p id="Par16">Having identified a large number of isoforms within our lrCaptureSeq catalog, we next addressed whether this extensive isoform diversity is positioned to impact gene function. For diversity to be functionally significant, two conditions must be met: (1) multiple isoforms of individual genes should be expressed at meaningful levels; and (2) the sequences of the isoforms must differ enough to encode functional differences. To investigate isoform expression levels, we assessed how each gene’s overall expression was distributed across its isoform portfolio (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c, e</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). Some genes—for example, <italic>Egflam</italic> and <italic>Crb1</italic>—were dominated by a small number of isoforms. However, other genes distributed their expression far more equitably across isoforms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c, e</xref>). Indeed, the genes that produced the largest number of isoforms also tended to be the most equitable, with a high fraction of similarly-abundant isoforms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). Using the Shannon diversity index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, we rank-ordered genes based on the diversity of their expressed mRNA species. <italic>Nrnx3</italic> was the top-ranked gene; however, several others of the latrophilin and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor (PTPR) families scored nearly as high (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). Thus, <italic>Nrxn3</italic> is far from unique in expressing a large number of isoforms. We conclude that, for the genes in our dataset, much of the isoform diversity is expressed at appreciable levels.</p>

<title>Predicted functional diversity of lrCaptureSeq isoforms</title>
<p id="Par17">We next investigated the extent of sequence differences across the isoforms of each gene in our dataset. Most of the 30 genes encoded isoforms that varied widely in length and number of exons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2e, f</xref>), suggesting the potential for great functional diversity. To identify isoforms that are most likely to diverge functionally, unsupervised clustering methods were used to group isoforms based on their sequence similarity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f,g</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2g</xref>). For most genes, isoforms clustered into distinct groups of related isoforms that made similar choices among alternative mRNA elements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f, g</xref>). Thus, major sequence differences exist within the isoform portfolio of individual genes, which can be traced to the inclusion of specific exon sequences by families of related isoforms.</p>
<p id="Par18">To learn whether these sequence differences might diversify protein output, we analyzed predicted open reading frames (ORFs; Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">1</xref>). The 4116 RNA isoforms in our dataset were predicted to express 2247 unique ORFs. A small subset of genes expressed great mRNA diversity but no equivalent ORF diversity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>); this was largely due to variations in 5′ UTRs or systematic intron retention (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3c, d</xref>). Overall, however, there was a strong correlation between the number of isoforms and the number of predicted proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). The amount of expressed ORF diversity varied by gene; but similar to mRNAs, a large amount of this predicted protein diversity was expressed at appreciable levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b–d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a, b</xref>). Remarkably, the genes with the most ORF diversity tended to encode a specific type of cell-surface protein: The top genes by Shannon diversity index all encode trans-synaptic adhesion molecules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). Thus, a major function of mRNA diversity may be the generation of protein variants that are positioned to influence formation or stability of synaptic connections.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Transcript diversity contributes to a wealth of protein diversity.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Total number of transcripts and ORFs for each gene in the lrCaptureSeq dataset.

<p id="Par19">To understand how mRNA diversity alters protein sequences, we studied the predicted protein output of individual genes. In many cases, predicted proteins varied substantially in their inclusion of well-characterized features or functional domains. This phenomenon is exemplified by the <italic>Megf11</italic> gene, which encodes a transmembrane EGF repeat protein implicated in cell-cell recognition during retinal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. <italic>Megf11</italic> undergoes extensive alternative splicing: Out of 26 protein-coding exons, 21 are alternatively spliced (81%). In fact, we documented only ten constitutive splice junctions within the 234 <italic>Megf11</italic> isoforms identified in three independent long-read sequencing experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Examination of predicted proteins revealed a potential reason for such extensive splicing: Most of the EGF repeats comprising the extracellular domain are encoded by individual exons, such that alternative splicing causes them to be deployed in a modular fashion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a–d</xref>). As a result of this modularity, predicted MEGF11 proteins showed substantial variability in the number and/or identity of included EGF repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>). The most variable EGF repeats were encoded by exons 14-16b (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>); however, most of the EGF repeats were subject to alternative usage. Intracellular domain exons also showed potential for modularity in the use of ITAM or ITIM signaling motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a–d</xref>), similar to the situation in the Drosophila <italic>Megf11</italic> homolog Draper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Using BaseScope<sup>TM</sup> in situ hybridization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, we confirmed that each of the most variable exon junctions are expressed by retinal neurons in vivo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). Remarkably, individual <italic>Megf11</italic>-expressing cells used all of the exon junctions we tested, suggesting that extensive <italic>Megf11</italic> isoform diversity is present even within individual neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). Therefore, similar to insect <italic>Dscam1</italic>, <italic>Megf11</italic> uses alternative splicing of modular extracellular domain features to create a large family of isoforms encoding distinct cell-surface molecules. Together with our analysis of the full lrCaptureSeq dataset, these findings strongly suggest that isoform diversity serves to diversify the repertoire of neuronal cell-surface proteins.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Modular alternative splicing drives <italic>Megf11</italic> isoform diversity.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of MEGF11 protein, showing how domain features correspond to exon boundaries.

<title>lrCaptureSeq isoforms encode cell-surface proteins in vivo</title>
<p id="Par20">To determine whether lrCaptureSeq isoforms are translated into proteins, we surveyed the retinal cell-surface proteome using mass spectrometry. Cell-surface protein samples were obtained from developing retina using cell-impermeant reagents that either cleaved or biotinylated extracellular epitopes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e, f</xref>). To learn whether these samples contained protein isoforms identified by lrCaptureSeq, we generated a database of possible trypsin peptide products derived from the isoforms within the lrCaptureSeq catalog. This was essential because protein identification requires comparison of raw mass spectrometry data to a reference peptide database. On generation of this predicted peptide database, we found that it contained ~25% more putative peptides for our 30 genes than the UniProt Mouse Reference Database typically used in most proteomics experiments (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3e</xref>). The extra putative peptides represent the additional protein sequence complexity that is predicted by the lrCaptureSeq catalog.</p>
<p id="Par21">Using this database as a reference, our mass spectrometry experiment identified 686 total peptides corresponding to 28 of the genes. 35 of these peptides were absent from the UniProt standard reference database, and were present only in our lrCaptureSeq reference (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3g</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">3</xref>). This fraction represents unannotated peptides, predicted from our lrCaptureSeq isoform catalog, that would have gone undetected in a typical mass spectrometry experiment. Unannotated peptides were found for 14 of our 30 genes, validating predicted exonic sequences, splice junctions, and splice acceptor sites (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">3</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that at least some of the proteins predicted by lrCaptureSeq are expressed on the surface of retinal cells in vivo.</p>

<title>Identification of an abundant retina-specific <italic>Crb1</italic> isoform</title>
<p id="Par22">To investigate whether newly-discovered isoforms can provide insight into gene function, we focused on <italic>Crb1</italic>, a well-known retinal disease gene.

In mature retina, <italic>Crb1</italic> expression was dominated by a single isoform—but not the one that has been the subject of virtually all previous <italic>Crb1</italic> studies.

<title><italic>Crb1</italic> isoforms are expressed in different retinal cell types</title>

We therefore asked whether this protein is expressed and, if so, where the protein is localized. Western blotting with an antibody raised against the intracellular domain demonstrated that CRB1-B protein exists in vivo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>). Moreover, it exists in the configuration predicted by lrCaptureSeq (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>), because intracellular domain expression was absent in mice engineered to lack the <italic>Crb1-B</italic> promoter and 5′ exon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>; see below for mouse design).

<p id="Par25">To determine the expression patterns of <italic>Crb1-A</italic> and <italic>Crb1-B</italic>, we developed a strategy to evaluate expression of lrCaptureSeq isoforms within single-cell (sc) RNA-seq datasets. Applying this strategy to scRNA-seq data from developing mouse retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, we found distinct expression patterns for each isoform. <italic>Crb1-A</italic> was expressed largely by Müller glia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a, b</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6d</xref>), consistent with previous immunohistochemical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. <italic>Crb1-B</italic>, by contrast, was expressed by rod and cone photoreceptors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a, b</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6b, d</xref>).

<p id="Par26">To examine CRB1-B protein localization, we initially attempted immunohistochemistry but found that our antibody was not suitable. Therefore, we turned to a technique that combines serial tangential cryosectioning of the retina with Western blotting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Each tangential section contains a specific subset of cellular and subcellular structures that are recognized by representative protein markers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>). This approach confirmed expression of CRB1-B in the photoreceptor layer, predominantly within the inner and outer segments.

<title>CRB1-B is required for outer limiting membrane integrity</title>
<p id="Par27">We next investigated the function of the CRB1-B isoform. Photoreceptors and Müller glia, the two cell types that express the major CRB1 isoforms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>), engage in specialized cell-cell junctions that form the OLM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9b, c</xref>). It has been suggested that degenerative pathology in CRB1 disease may result from disruption of these junctions, but mouse studies have failed to clarify whether CRB1 is in fact required for OLM integrity. The two existing <italic>Crb1</italic> mutant strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a</xref>) have conflicting OLM phenotypes: Mice bearing a <italic>Crb1</italic> point mutation known as <italic>rd8</italic> show sporadic OLM disruptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, whereas a <italic>Crb1</italic> “knockout” allele, here denoted <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>ex1</italic></sup>, fails to disturb OLM junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Our lrCaptureSeq data revealed a key difference between these two alleles: <italic>rd8</italic> affects both <italic>Crb1-A</italic> and <italic>Crb1-B</italic> isoforms, whereas the “knockout” <italic>ex1</italic> allele leaves <italic>Crb1-B</italic> intact (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that <italic>Crb1-B</italic> influences the integrity of photoreceptor-Müller junctions at the OLM. To test this hypothesis, we generated two new mutant alleles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a, b</xref>).

<p id="Par28">Using electron microscopy to evaluate OLM integrity, we found that <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> mutants exhibit disruptions at the OLM whereby photoreceptor nuclei invaded the inner segment layer, disturbing the structure of the outer retina (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9b–e</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7d</xref>). Within the disrupted regions, photoreceptor inner segments lacked their characteristic electron-dense junctions with apical Müller processes, indicating that OLM gaps arose due to disruption of photoreceptor-Müller contacts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9f</xref>). A similar phenotype was also observed in <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>rd8</italic></sup> mutants, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9f, g, j</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7d–f</xref>). To explore the contribution of each isoform to the OLM phenotype, we examined mice bearing various combinations of the <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> and <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>delB</italic></sup> alleles. In <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>delB/delB</italic></sup> mice, which lack <italic>Crb1-B</italic> but retain two copies of <italic>Crb1-A</italic>, the OLM phenotype was still evident but was weaker than in <italic>rd8</italic> or <italic>null</italic> homozygotes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9h, j</xref>).

These findings indicate that both <italic>Crb1</italic> isoforms are needed for OLM junctional integrity, but the role of <italic>Crb1-B</italic> is particularly important, given that OLM disruptions can arise even when <italic>Crb1-A</italic> remains present.</p>

<title>Retinal degeneration in mice lacking all <italic>Crb1</italic> isoforms</title>
<p id="Par29">Finally, we asked whether insight into CRB1 isoforms could be used to improve animal models of CRB1 degenerative disease. Photoreceptor degeneration is absent or extremely slow in existing <italic>Crb1</italic> mutant mice, making them poor models of human degenerative phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that previously unannotated <italic>Crb1</italic> isoforms, such as <italic>Crb1-B</italic>, might help explain these mild phenotypes. Consistent with this possibility, we noted that neither <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>ex1</italic></sup> nor <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>rd8</italic></sup> completely eliminates all <italic>Crb1</italic> isoforms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a</xref>). To test the contribution of new <italic>Crb1</italic> isoforms to photoreceptor degeneration, we took advantage of our newly-generated <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>delB</italic></sup> and <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a</xref>). Quantification of photoreceptor numbers in young adult mice (P100) revealed that both <italic>Crb1-A</italic> and <italic>Crb1-B</italic> isoforms are required for photoreceptor survival. <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>delB</italic></sup> mutants had normal photoreceptor numbers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10a, d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7c</xref>), similar to the previously-reported <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>ex1</italic></sup> mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, removing either major isoform by itself has minimal degenerative effects. By contrast, deletion of all isoforms in <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> mice caused marked photoreceptor degeneration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10a–d</xref>). Thus, significant cell loss requires compromise of both <italic>Crb1-A</italic> and <italic>Crb1-B</italic>. No degeneration was evident yet at P100 in <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>rd8</italic></sup> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10b–d</xref>), consistent with previous reports that significant degeneration takes ~2 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Together, these genetic experiments support the conclusion that multiple <italic>Crb1</italic> isoforms contribute to photoreceptor survival—including <italic>Crb1-B</italic>. Thus, modeling of human disease can be achieved by rational design of mutant alleles guided by lrCaptureSeq isoform catalogs.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><title>Ablation of all <italic>Crb1</italic> isoforms causes retinal degeneration.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Retinal histology in <italic>Crb1</italic> mutant mice at P100.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par30">Despite recent advances in sequencing technology, the true diversity of the transcriptome remains murky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. For most genes, only a small subset of the full isoform portfolio has been documented. Here we show that lrCaptureSeq can unveil the rich diversity of the CNS transcriptome. LrCaptureSeq is accurate and efficient, with sufficient depth to reveal the full-length sequence of even low-abundance isoforms. To facilitate interpretation of lrCaptureSeq data we provide a companion R software package for analyzing and visualizing isoform catalogs. Applying these tools to the developing nervous system, we uncovered a vast diversity of isoforms encoding cell surface proteins, most of which were unannotated elsewhere. Many were predicted to alter functional protein domains. Further, we found that <italic>Crb1-B</italic>, the most abundant isoform in our entire dataset, has a distinct expression pattern and function from the canonical <italic>Crb1</italic> isoform, endowing it with disease-relevant functions. CRB1 therefore serves as a striking example of the value of comprehensive full-length isoform identification. Application of lrCaptureSeq to other cell types and tissues has great potential to unlock many new insights into gene function and dysfunction—both in the CNS and beyond.</p>
<p id="Par31">LrCaptureSeq is successful because it enables deep long-read sequencing for transcripts that would be poorly represented in existing PacBio transcriptomes, due to their cDNA size and expression levels. Even with short-read sequencing, it is challenging to achieve sufficient sequencing depth for isoform identification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Targeted CaptureSeq approaches improve short-read detection of low-abundance transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>; here we show the same is true for full-length sequencing of protein-coding mRNAs. It is clear from the distribution of isoform abundances (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>) that only the least abundant isoforms escaped detection. Therefore, we consider the lrCaptureSeq isoform catalogs to be largely complete. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that certain transcripts are missing from the catalogs. For example, some isoforms smaller than 4.5 kb may have evaded detection due to the size selection step of our library preparation protocol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). We suspect this is a small minority of transcripts because, even with size selection, we still cataloged numerous smaller isoforms (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2e</xref>)—including <italic>Crb1-B</italic> (3.0 kb). Thus, while the catalogs may lack certain short and/or rare transcripts, we conclude that we have detected most of the isoforms expressed in our targeted tissues. We achieved this depth by targeting 30 genes for parallel sequencing, but higher-throughput PacBio instruments are now available; these should allow substantially more targeted genes to be sequenced in parallel without sacrificing isoform coverage.</p>
<p id="Par32">Our results suggest many potential uses for lrCaptureSeq in transcriptome annotation. One particularly exciting use case is identification of cell-type-specific isoform expression patterns. We show that lrCaptureSeq data can be integrated with existing short-read RNA-seq datasets, including single-cell data, to reveal the time and place of isoform expression. As of now, this approach works best for isoforms that differ at their 3′ ends, due to 3′ bias inherent in most single-cell library preparation methods. As scRNA-seq methods are refined to improve depth and coverage, we expect that other types of isoforms will become amenable to mapping in this way. With this methodology, it will not be necessary to generate lrCaptureSeq catalogs for each cell type in the nervous system; rather, cell-type-specific isoform expression can be determined bioinformatically by combining different types of sequencing data.</p>
<p id="Par33">How many mRNA isoforms are produced by any given gene? While our 30 genes probably have more isoforms than the average gene, given that they were selected because they showed evidence of transcript diversity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>), our results suggest that the number is substantially higher than suggested by present database annotations. For the 30 genes in our dataset the median number of RefSeq isoforms was 11.5, and no gene had more than 51. By contrast, the median number of isoforms in our lrCaptureSeq catalog was 50, while the most diverse gene, <italic>Nrxn3</italic>, had nearly 900. A previous CaptureSeq study of long noncoding RNAs found only two-fold more isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, but this study was not focused on the nervous system. Thus, it remains to be determined whether the diversity we observed is a specific feature of CNS cell surface molecules, or if instead it is typical of other gene classes and tissues. Broader application of lrCaptureSeq should help resolve this question.</p>
<p id="Par34">It has long been suspected that extensive cell-surface protein diversity might mediate formation of precise neuronal connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. However, the need for numerous cell-surface cues has recently been called into question<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Here we show that extensive isoform diversity is widespread across many cell-surface receptor genes, and that individual neurons most likely express numerous of isoforms of certain genes (e.g., <italic>Megf11</italic>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). Furthermore, our <italic>Megf11</italic> results show that insect Dscam1 is not unique in using large-scale modular alternative splicing to swap extracellular domain motifs. The phenomenon of modular EGF-repeat swapping through alternative splicing has been observed before, albeit at smaller scale, for Netrin-G proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Therefore, other EGF-repeat genes may also generate large families of cell surface proteins using a similar strategy. Overall, our results establish the molecular prerequisite for models of CNS wiring that require numerous cell surface cues. Whether such models are correct remains to be determined; however, in this regard it is striking that the genes with the most predicted protein diversity share a common function as trans-synaptic, synaptogenic cell adhesion molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). Therefore, these diverse molecular cues are likely positioned in exactly the right place to influence the precision of synaptic connections.</p>
<p id="Par35">Our studies of CRB1 illustrate the value and importance of documenting the complete isoform output of individual genes. CRB1 is a major causal gene for inherited retinal degenerative diseases, including Leber’s congenital amaurosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and macular dystrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. As such, both mouse <italic>Crb1</italic> and human <italic>CRB1</italic> have been studied intensively. <italic>CRB1-B</italic> may have been overlooked because its 5′ and 3′ exons are the only parts of the transcript that distinguish it from <italic>CRB1-A</italic>. With short-read sequencing it is difficult to tell that these two distant exons are typically used together in the same transcript. By contrast, lrCaptureSeq clearly showed that the most abundant retinal <italic>CRB1</italic> isoform was a variant containing these unconventional 5′ and 3′ exons.</p>
<p id="Par36">Due to their distinct 5′ and 3′ ends (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>), <italic>Crb1-A</italic> and <italic>-B</italic> differ in crucial ways that likely endow them with distinct functions. Their 5′ exons have different promoters that drive expression in different cell types—<italic>Crb1-A</italic> in Müller glia and <italic>Crb1-B</italic> in photoreceptors—while their 3′ exons encode different intracellular domains. The CRB1-A intracellular domain, like other vertebrate homologs of Drosophila Crumbs, contains two highly-conserved motifs mediating interactions with polarity proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. These motifs localize Crumbs homologs to apical junctions, where they are required for maintaining epithelial structural integrity and apico-basal polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. CRB1-B lacks these conserved motifs, suggesting a model whereby CRB1-A and -B operate in different cell types through different intracellular interaction partners.</p>
<p id="Par37">Our findings have implications for the prevailing model of CRB1 disease, which posits that CRB1 is required for integrity of OLM junctions between Müller glia and photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. A major challenge for this model has been the absence of OLM phenotypes or photoreceptor degeneration in <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>ex1</italic></sup> mutants, which lack only <italic>Crb1-A</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a</xref>) but was thought to be a null allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. As such, the weak mutant phenotype suggested that CRB1 might be dispensable for photoreceptor survival in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Here we show that CRB1 is indeed required for OLM integrity and photoreceptor survival, but the mechanism involves the photoreceptor-specific CRB1-B isoform. Moreover, we show a genetic interaction between the two isoforms, revealing OLM integrity and pro-survival functions for CRB1-A that were obscured in <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>ex1</italic></sup>. We propose that the concerted action of CRB1-A in glia and CRB1-B in photoreceptors controls OLM integrity and photoreceptor health, perhaps through the assembly or maintenance of the junctional protein complex in each respective cell type.</p>
<p id="Par38">The notion of concerted <italic>Crb1-A</italic> and <italic>Crb1-B</italic> function is further supported by the fact that <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>rd8</italic></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a</xref>) has a more severe phenotype than <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>ex1</italic></sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear why <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>rd8</italic></sup> is less severe than <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10</xref>), even though <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> isoforms are affected in both mutants. One possible explanation is that <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>rd8</italic></sup> may not be a mRNA or protein null<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Another possibility is that the <italic>Crb1-C</italic> isoform may play a compensatory role, as it is unaffected by <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>rd8</italic></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a</xref>). Either way, our results show that the design of mouse disease models is significantly enhanced when a complete isoform catalog is available.</p>
<p id="Par39">Overall, our work highlights the value of building complete and accurate full-length isoform catalogs. Lack of such information can cause key gene functions to be overlooked and can lead to misinterpretation of genetic experiments and disease phenotypes. We expect the transcriptomic ground truth provided by deep long-read capture sequencing will be an important addition to the transcriptome annotation toolbox, enabling discovery of specific mRNA isoforms that contribute to a wide range of normal and disease processes.</p>

<title>Knockout mouse generation</title>
<p id="Par43">For the generation of <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>delB</italic></sup>, CRISPR guides were designed to target genomic coordinates chr1:139,256,486 and 139,254,837 and validated in vitro on genomic DNA prior to injection. A C57Bl6J/SJL F1 hybrid mouse line was used for injection; both strains are wild-type at the <italic>Crb1</italic> locus (i.e., they do not carry <italic>rd8</italic>). Founders were genotyped using PCR primers to distinguish the alleles (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> for primer sequences). Two founder lines with genomic deletions were maintained. One carrying the deletion 139,254,836–139,256,488 (Δ1652 bp) plus two additional cytosines, and the other 139,254,836–139,256,488 (Δ1652 bp). Both alleles effectively delete the entire first exon of <italic>Crb1-B</italic> and the promoter region and are currently phenotypically indistinguishable. For the generation of <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup>, CRISPR guides were designed to target genomic coordinates chr1:139,256,486–139,243,407 and validated in vitro on genomic DNA prior to injection. A C57Bl6J/SJL F1 hybrid mouse line was used for injection and founders were genotyped using PCR primers (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) to distinguish the alleles. Two founder lines with genomic deletions were maintained. One carrying the deletion chr1: 139,256,844–139,243,411 (Δ13,433 bp) and the other 139,257,194–139,243,411 (Δ13,783 bp). Both alleles effectively delete the entire first exon of <italic>Crb1-B</italic> and the promoter region in addition to exon 6 and part of exon 7 of <italic>Crb1-A</italic>. This deletion would eliminate the exon 7 splice acceptor and is predicted to exclude exon 7 altogether. Splicing from exons 5 to 8 (as in <italic>Crb1-A</italic>) and 4 to 8 (as in <italic>Crb1-A2</italic>) would result in frameshifts. The <italic>Crb1-C-</italic>specific retained intron after exon 6 is also entirely deleted. Founder animals were backcrossed with C57Bl6J mice for at least two generations before analysis and genotyped to ensure they were not carrying <italic>rd1</italic> mutation from the SJL background. Animals generated in this study will be made available to the research community for non-commercial use.</p>

<title>CRB1-B antibody</title>
<p id="Par44">We used Pierce Custom antibody service (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate a CRB1-B specific antibody. The antigen was the last 16 amino acids (RMNDEPVVEWGAQENY) of CRB1-B, which are predicted to be exclusive to this isoform at the protein level. Antibodies were made in rabbit according to their 90-day protocol with initial inoculation followed by 3 boosts. The antibody was affinity-purified and validated by western blot with a <italic>Crb1</italic><sup><italic>delB</italic></sup> knockout control. CRB1-B produces a band of ~150 kDa, larger than the predicted size of 110 kDa. This discrepancy in experimental vs predicted size is likely due to post translational modifications such as glycosylation, since addition of PNGase F lowered the band size. Antibodies generated in this study will be made available to the research community for non-commercial use.</p>

<title>Processing of PacBio raw data</title>
<p id="Par48">Iso-Seq software was used for initial post-processing of raw PacBio data. For lrCaptureSeq experiments, reads of insert were generated from PacBio raw reads using ConsensusTools.sh with the parameters–minFullPasses 1 –minPredictedAccuracy 80 –parameters /smrtanalysis/current/analysis/etc/algorithm_parameters/2014-09/. From the reads of insert full-length, non-chimeric reads (FLNC reads) were generated using pbtranscript.py classify with the parameters –min_seq_len 500 and presence of 5′ and 3′ Clontech primers in addition to a polyA tail preceding the 3′ primer. For <italic>Megf11</italic> PCR product sequencing, parameters were the same except that full-length reads were distinguished by the presence of <italic>Megf11-</italic>specific primer sequences (5′ GGCTCCGGGGTATAGGA; 3′ sequence CTGGCTGCATTGCATTGG for <italic>Megf11</italic> long or GGTGTCCAATAAAGTC for <italic>Megf11</italic> short).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec23">
<title>Isoform level clustering</title>
<p id="Par49">Clustering of FLNC reads into isoforms was performed using ToFU, which consists of two parts: (1) Isoform-level clustering algorithm ICE (Iterative Clustering for Error Correction), used to generate consensus isoforms; and (2) Quiver, used to polish consensus isoforms. Transcript isoforms were generated using the ToFU_wrap script with the parameters –bin_manual “(0,4,6,9,30)” –quiver –hq_quiver_min_accuracy 0.99 (0.98 for <italic>Megf11</italic> PCR data). This generated high-quality full-length transcripts with ≥ 99% post correction accuracy (≥ 98% for <italic>Megf11</italic> PCR data). Isoforms were aligned to the mouse genome mm10 using GMAP (version 1.3.3b) with default values of alignment accuracy (0.85) and coverage (0.99). To prevent over clustering based on 5′ end lengths, redundant clusters were removed by collapsing all transcripts that share exactly the same exon structure. To minimize the impact truncated mRNAs may have on inflating isoform numbers, we set a threshold of ≥ 2 independent full-length reads that must cluster together in order to define an isoform.</p>
<p id="Par50">To generate the entire isoform catalog, the complete dataset (all timepoints, retina and cortex) was analyzed using the cluster function of Iso-Seq (version 3), with default parameters. Only the highest-quality full-length reads (≥99% accuracy or QV ≥ 20) from each experiment were passed to this analysis. At the conclusion of Iso-Seq 8287 isoforms of our 30 genes were identified. HQ reads were mapped to the genome (mm10 for mouse, hg19 for human) Cupcake ToFU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> was used to further reduce overclustering of isoform subdivisions.</p>
<p id="Par51">Finally, additional filtering of putative spurious isoforms was performed with our IsoPops software. The goal of this filtering was to remove artifacts arising from cDNA truncations or poly-A mispriming within genomic DNA. Details of the filtering methodology are provided below in the section describing the software package. Applying these filters yielded the final catalog of 4116 isoforms. We did not exclude isoforms that contained non-canonical junctions, because many such isoforms were highly abundant; however, even if they were excluded, overall isoform counts would be only slightly reduced (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par52">The final isoform catalog specified not only the number of isoforms, but also the number of full-length reads obtained for each isoform. We have reported these read counts for some of our analyses (e.g., Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c, e</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b, d</xref>). These data aid in understanding how the overall expression of a particular gene is distributed across its isoform portfolio. We have avoided making conclusions about the expression level of particular isoforms, unless the PacBio data are supported by independent short-read RNA-seq data (e.g., Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a–d</xref>).</p>

<sec id="Sec24">
<title>IsoPops R package</title>
<p id="Par53">We developed a package of R software for convenient analysis and viewing of PacBio transcriptome sequence output. The IsoPops R package allows users to perform many of the analyses described in this study on their own long-read data.</p>
<p id="Par54">The package offers the following features. First, it permits filtering of truncated and spurious isoforms to facilitate downstream analysis. Second, it displays maps of exon usage enabling the user to visually compare how isoforms differ. Third, it generates plots summarizing expression levels of isoforms within an individual gene and across a dataset. These include tree plots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>) and a variant on the Lorenz plot that we have termed a jellyfish plot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). Fourth, it clusters similar isoforms and displays the data in various dimension-reducing plots such as dendrograms and 3-dimensional PCA plots. Fifth, it provides summary statistics such as the length distribution of a gene’s isoforms or the number of exons used in each isoform. Finally, it performs cross-correlations, enabling the user to ask if certain exons tend to appear together in the same transcripts. Methods relevant to these features are described below.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par55">Filtering: The IsoPops isoform filtering process consists of three steps: First, transcripts containing fewer than <italic>n</italic> exons are removed. For our study, <italic>n</italic> was set to 4, because we did not expect any such short isoforms for the genes in our dataset. To quantify exon number, we did not reference exon annotations, but instead defined the number of non-contiguous genomic segments (or the number of junctions plus one) as the exon count for each isoform. This filtering step removed most spurious transcripts arising from genomic poly-A mispriming, as these sequences typically contained only a single exon as defined by this mapping procedure. Second, the least abundant 5% of isoforms for each gene were filtered out, on the assumption that these extremely low-abundance isoforms might constitute experimental or biological noise.</p><p id="Par56">Finally, we filtered out truncation artifacts. To identify truncated isoforms, we developed an algorithm designed to filter as thoroughly as possible without discarding potentially valuable unique transcripts. In particular, we wanted to preserve all unique splicing events and tolerate unique transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription termination sites (TTS) modestly. The algorithm compares the set of exon boundaries (coordinates of acceptor and donor splice sites) for an isoform pair A and B and applies the following two rules. Rule 1: If all the exon boundaries in B form a contiguous subset of the exon boundaries in A, then B is a truncation of A. We required the subset to be contiguous to avoid filtering transcripts with retained introns. Rule 2<italic>:</italic> If all three of the following conditions are met, B is a truncation of A. (1) The TSS of B falls within an exon in A; (2) the TTS of B is either found in A or within/beyond the 3′-most exon of the gene; (3) internal exon boundaries of B (i.e., excluding the 5′- and 3′-most exon boundaries of B) are a contiguous subset of A.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par57">Pearson correlation: This function enables analysis of exon co-occurrence across isoforms. Each isoform in a given gene was labeled with a series of binary values representing the exons called within its cDNA sequence. Exon calls were determined by searching for exact matches of either the first 30 bp or last 30 bp of each exon within the transcript. Exon definitions were derived from PacBio isofom GFF file. Isoforms were weighted by their full-length read counts before pairwise Pearson correlations between exon calls were calculated.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par58">K-mer vectorization: IsoPops enables quantification of sequence differences between isoforms. To quantify relative differences between isoforms, we calculated the Euclidean distances between vectorizations of each isoform’s cDNA sequence (or their predicted ORF amino acid sequence). We used the text2vec R package to generate a vector for each isoform, where each element in the vector equals the number of times a certain k-mer (sequence fragment) appears within the isoform. We counted all possible 6-mers within isoforms, choosing <italic>k</italic> = 6 to maximize k-mer count uniqueness between isoforms without requiring excessive computational resources. Each isoform’s vector of k-mer counts was then normalized to sum to 1, so that isoform distances calculated from these vectors would not be dominated by differences in length between transcripts.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par59">Isoform clustering: To cluster isoforms, we calculated pairwise euclidean distances between isoforms’ k-mer count vectorizations. We then performed hierarchical agglomerative clustering using the R base algorithm hclust using default settings and the “complete” agglomeration method. Dendrogram plots of clusterings were generated by the dendextend R package.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par60">Dimension reduction: PCA and t-SNE were performed directly on the k-mer count vectorizations. We used the R base algorithm prcomp for PCA with default settings. For t-SNE, we ran the Rtsne package’s algorithm for exact t-SNE (theta = 0, maximum iterations = 1000, perplexity = 35), which includes a round of PCA for data pre-processing. t-SNE results are plotted in the same number of dimensions as output by the algorithm (i.e., 3D t-SNE plots were generated with ndim = 3).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par61">Lorenz (Jellyfish) plot: Cumulative percent abundance was calculated independently for the isoforms of each gene. First, full-length read counts were normalized across the gene and labeled percent abundance. Next, isoforms for a given gene were rank-ordered by percent abundance in descending order. Finally, a cumulative percent abundance was calculated for each isoform, via partial summation of percent abundances in descending order. Isoforms were then plotted in this order along the <italic>y</italic>-axis and positioned according to cumulative percent abundance along the <italic>x</italic>-axis.</p></list-item></list></p>

<title>Sashimi plots</title>
<p id="Par71">Sashimi plots were generated using Gviz (version 1.24.0) with the PacBio generated GFF file. The reads for the plot were generated by mapping the PacBio FLNC.fastq (≥ 85% accuracy) file to the genome (mm10, hg19) with GMAP (version 2014-09-30). Because the FLNC reads had relatively high error rates that had not been filtered out like in our final datasets, and because expression varied by gene, minimum junction coverage was variable for each plot. Minimum junction coverage was set to 60 for <italic>Crb1</italic> mouse retina, 4 for <italic>Crb1</italic> Cortex, 11 for human <italic>CRB1</italic>, and 4 for <italic>Megf11</italic>.</p>

<title>BaseScope in situ hybridization</title>
<p id="Par74">Eyes were enucleated and retinas were dissected from the eyecup, washed in PBS, and fixed at RT for 24 h in PBS supplemented with 4% formaldehyde. Retinas were cryoprotected by osmotic equilibrium overnight at 4 ° in PBS supplemented with 30% sucrose. Retinas were imbedded in Tissue Freezing Medium and flash frozen in 2-methyl butane chilled by dry ice. Retina tangential sections were cut to 18 μm on a Thermo Scientific Microm HM 550 Cryostat and adhered to Superfrost Plus slides.</p>
<p id="Par75">Probes were designed against splice junctions to detect various splicing events (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> for sequences). Probe detection was performed using the Red detection kit. BaseScope in situ hybridization was performed according to the manufacturers protocol with slight modifications. Fixed frozen retinas were baked in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h then proceeded with standard fixed frozen pretreatment conditions with the following exceptions: Incubation in Pretreatment 2 was reduced to 2 min and Pretreatment 3 was reduced to 13 min at RT. BaseScope probes were added to the tissue and hybridized for 2 h at 40 °C. Slides were washed with wash buffer and probes were detected using the Red Singleplex detection kit. Immunostaining was performed after probe detection by incubation with primary antibodies overnight. For <italic>Megf11</italic> BaseScope, α-Calbindin antibodies were used to label starburst amacrine cells and horizontal cells.

<title>Expression of CRB1 isoforms in K562 cells</title>
<p id="Par76">Tagged CRB1 constructs were built by cloning YFP in-frame at the C-terminus of CRB1-A and CRB1-B. The tagged constructs were cloned into the pCAG-YFP plasmid (Addgene #11180).</p>
<p id="Par77">K562 cells (ATCC® CCL-243™) were obtained from, validated by, and mycoplasma tested by ATCC. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 10% bovine growth serum, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 2.0 mM L-glutamine, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin in 10 cm cell culture dishes. Cells were passaged every 2–3 days before reaching 2 million cells/ml. Cells were transfected using the Amaxa<sup>®</sup> Cell Line Nucleofector<sup>®</sup> Kit V following instructions in the K562 nucleofection manual. Specifically, aliquots of 1 million cells were pelleted through centrifuging at 200 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at room temperature in Eppendorf tubes. Supernatant was completely and cell pellets were suspend in 100 ul Nucleofector<sup>®</sup> solution per sample. A total of 2 ug of plasmid DNA (pCAG:Crb1A-YFP, pCAG:Crb1B-YFP, or pCAG:YFP) were added and gently mixed with the suspended cells. Cell and DNA mixture were transfected into cuvettes, inserted into the Nucleofector® Cuvette Holder, and transfected with program T-016. Cuvettes were taken out of the holder after program is completed and immediately added with 500ul of pre-equilibrated cultured medium.

<title>Retina thin sectioning and electron microscopy</title>
<p id="Par78">Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane followed by decapitation. Superior retina was marked with a low-temperature cautery to track orientation. Eyes were enucleated and fixed overnight at RT in Glut Buffer (40 mM MOPS, 0.005% CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2% formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in H<sub>2</sub>O). The dorsal-ventral axis was marked at the time of dissection so that superior and inferior retina could subsequently be identified in thin sections. Eyes were transferred to a fresh tube containing PBS for storage 4 °C until prepped for embedding.</p>
<p id="Par79">For thin sections, the cornea was removed from the eyecup and the eyecup was immersed in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1% cacodylate buffer. The eyecup was then dehydrated and embedded in Epon 812 resin. Semi-thin sections of 0.5 µm were cut through the optic nerve head from superior to inferior retina. The sections were counterstained with 1% methylene blue and imaged on an Olympus IX81 bright-filed microscope.</p>
<p id="Par80">For electron microscopy, tissue was fixed and embedded as for thin sections. Far peripheral retina was trimmed and 65–75 µm sections were prepared on a Leica EM CU7 ultramicrotome. Sections were prepared separately from superior and inferior hemisections of each retina, and counterstained with a solution of 2% uranyl acetate + 3.5% lead citrate. Imaging was performed on a JEM-1400 electron microscope equipped with an Orius 1000 camera.</p>

<title>Retina nuclei counting</title>
<p id="Par81">Retina semi-thin sections were tile scanned on an Olympus IX81 bright-filed microscope with a 60X oil objective and stitched together with cellSens software. Using Fiji software, a segmented line was drawn from the optic nerve head to the periphery for both superior and inferior retina. At intervals of 500 μm, four boxes of 100 μm were drawn encapsulating the outer nuclear layer so that the center of the box was a factor of 500 μm from the optic nerve head. For each hemisphere of the retina, four boxes were made. Using the count function in ImageJ, the total number of nuclei encapsulated by each box were counted at each position. Counts were averaged across each position and plotted as well as total counts for all 8 measurements for each retina.</p>

<title>Assessment of OLM junctions by electron microscopy</title>
<p id="Par82">Each section, comprising ~90% of one retinal hemisection (far peripheral retina was trimmed during sectioning), was evaluated on the electron microscope for OLM gaps. Each potential gap was imaged and gaps were subsequently confirmed offline by evaluating the presence of electron-dense OLM junctions on the inner segments of imaged photoreceptors. The number of gaps per section was quantified, along with the size of each gap, using Fiji software. For quantification and statistics, wild-type and <italic>null/+</italic> heterozygous controls were grouped together, since neither genotype showed any OLM gaps.</p>

<title>Retina serial sectioning with Western blotting</title>
<p id="Par83">For the serial sectioning-Western blotting method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane followed by decapitation. Eyes were enucleated and dissected in ice-cold Ringer’s solution. A retina punch (2 mm diameter) was cut from the eyecup with a surgical trephine positioned adjacent next to the optic disc, transferred onto PVDF membrane with the photoreceptor layer facing up, flat mounted between two glass slides separated by plastic spacers (ca. 240 μm) and frozen on dry ice. The retina surface was aligned with the cutting plane of a cryostat and uneven edges were trimmed away. Progressive 10-μm or 20-μm tangential sections were collected—depending upon endpoint of sectioning (photoreceptors or inner retina, respectively). Blotting was performed with antibodies to CRB1-B, rhodopsin, and GAPDH (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> for antibody details).</p>

<title>Sample preparation for proteomics</title>
<p id="Par84">Juvenile (P14) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane followed by decapitation. Eyes were enucleated and dissected out of the eyecup in Ringers solution (154 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES). For trypsin release of ectodomains, retinas were placed in 100 μl Ringers solution containing 5 μg trypsin/lys-c. This preparation was incubated at RT for 10 min with periodic gentle mixing. Contents were then centrifuged at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 1.5 min and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Urea was added to protein mixture to 8 M then incubated at 50 °C. After 1 h incubation, DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mM and incubated for 15 min at 50 °C. Peptides were alkylated by adding 3.25 μl of 20 mM Iodoacetamide and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Reaction was quenched by adding DTT to 50 mM final concentration. Mixture was diluted 1:3 with ~270 μl of ammonium bicarbonate. Mixture was further digested overnight by adding 1 μg of trypsin/lys-c at 37 °C.</p>
<p id="Par85">For cell-surface biotin labeling of membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, retinas were dissected out of the eyecup into ice-cold HBSS. Retinas were washed with HBSS followed by incubation in HBSS supplemented with EZ-Link Sulfo_NHS-SS-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml in HBSS) for 45 min on ice. Retinas were then washed 3X with HBSS + 100μM lysine to quench remaining reactive esters. Retinas were then collected in 400 μl (200 μl/retina) lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA). Retinas were homogenized using short pulses on a sonicator. The lysate was centrifuged at 21,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4 °C and the soluble fraction was collected. For immunoprecipitation, 75 μg of protein lysate was mixed with 100 μl of Streptavidin Magnetic Beads (Pierce™) and incubated at room temperature while rotating. Streptavidin/biotin complex was sequestered using a magnet and washed with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation with elution buffer (PBS with 0.1% SDS 100 mM DTT) at 50 °C for 30 min. Experimental samples (input, biotin enriched, and non-biotin labeled negative control) were mixed with 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated on a heat block at 90 °C for 10 min. Samples were then loaded on a 4–15% mini PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free protein gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 65 V through the stacking gel then adjusted to 100 V until the dye front reached the end of the gel.</p>
<p id="Par86">After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with H<sub>2</sub>O, fixed with 50% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 20 min and stained with colloidal Coomassie based GelCode Blue Stain reagent (Thermo Fischer Scientific, cat # 24590) for 30 min. The gel was destained with distilled water at 4 °C for 2 h while rocking. Protein bands were imaged on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Touch imager. Using a clean razor blade, bands between 75 and 250 kDa were excised, cut into ~1 × 1 mm pieces and collected in 0.5 ml siliconized (low retention) centrifuge tube. Gel pieces were destained with 200 μl of Destaining Solution (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> in 50:50 acetonitrile:water) at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking. Solution was removed and replaced with 200 μl of Destaining Solution and incubated again at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking. Solution was removed from the gel pieces and peptides were reduced with 20 μl of 20 mM DTT in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.8)at 60 °C for 15 min. Cysteines were alkylated by adding 50 μl of the alkylation buffer (ammonium bicarbonate buffer with 50 mM Iodoacetamide) and incubated in the dark at room temparature for 1 h. Alkylation buffer was removed from tubes and replaced with 200 μl destaining buffer. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking, buffer removed, and washed again with destaining buffer. Gel pieces were dehydrated with 75 μl of acetonitrile and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Acetonitrile was removed from tubes and shrunken gel pieces were left to dry for 15 min. Trypsin/lys-c (5 ng/μl in 25 μl of ammonium bicarbonate buffer) was added to gel pieces and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. An additional 25 μl of ammonium bicarbonate buffer was added to the tubes and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Sample volume was brought to 125 μl with distilled water, and liquid containing trypsinized peptides was placed in a clean siliconized 0.5 ml tube.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title>
<p id="Par87">A total of 2 μl aliquots of tryptic digests were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a nanoAcquity UPLC system coupled to a Synapt G2 HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters Corp, Milford, MA). Peptides were initially trapped on a 180 μm × 20 mm Symmetry C18 column (at the 5 μl/min flow rate for 3 min in 99.9% water, 0.1% formic acid). Peptide separation was then performed on a 75 μm × 150 mm column filled with the 1.7 μm C18 BEH resin (Waters) using the 6–30% acetonitrile gradient with 0.1% formic acid for 90 min at the flow rate of 0.3 μl/min at 35 °C. Eluted peptides were sprayed into the ion source of Synapt G2 using the 10 μm PicoTip emitter (Waters) at the voltage of 3.0 kV.</p>
<p id="Par88">Each sample was subjected to a data-independent analysis (HDMSE) using ion mobility workflow for simultaneous peptide quantitation and identification. For robust peak detection and alignment of individual peptides across all HDMSE runs we performed automatic alignment of ion chromatography peaks representing the same mass/retention time features using Progenesis QI software. To perform peptide assignment to the ion features, ProteinLynx Global Server version 2.5.1 (Waters) was used to generate searchable files that were submitted to the IdentityE search engine incorporated into Progenesis QI for Proteomics (version 4.1). Precursor mass tolerance for the database search was 5 parts per million; fragment mass tolerance was 0.50 Da. For peptide identification we searched against the Iso-Seq/lrCaptureSeq custom database described above (see ORF Prediction subsection), as well as the UniProtKb mouse database. Post-processing using Protein and Peptide Prophet software (Scaffold 4.4) was used to evaluate confidence in peptide matches and to control false discovery rates (FDRs). Spectrum-peptide matches with &lt;50% confidence score were excluded from further analysis. FDR cutoffs for accepting peptide and protein identifications were 1%. In addition, a target-decoy analysis was performed by searching a decoy database—reversed mouse UniProt 2016 database. The FDR measured in this way was 0.16%.</p>
<p id="Par89">Using these procedures we identified unannotated peptides (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">3</xref>) as those that were detected in the custom Iso-Seq database but not in the UniProt database. To distinguish newly discovered peptides from known annotated peptides containing posttranslational modifications, we conducted additional UniProt database searches using the most common protein modifications, including phosphorylation at S,T and Y; glutamylation at E; acetylation at K; methylation at D and E. Each of these modifications was tested individually via a separate database search. No potential false identifications were found. Upon identification of spectra matching unannotated peptides, we took additional quality control steps to ensure the reliability of these matches. First, spectra were inspected manually to confirm alignment of measured and predicted peaks. Second, we compared search engine scores for spectra matching unannotated peptides to those matching known peptides. Both groups had similar search engine scores (Score range: Unannotated = 15–150; Known = 15–130. Mean score: Unannotated = 42.2; Known = 49.9. Median score: Unannotated 38.3; Known = 41.3. Match confidence for median score: Unannotated = 91.8; Known = 91.2).</p>

Equal volumes of the lysates, each containing 15 µg total protein, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in the Odyssey blocking buffer (LiCor Bioscience) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies (anti-CRB1-B, anti-Phosducin, and anti-ABCA4) and Alexa Fluor 680 or 800 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen).

<title>Statistics and reproducibility</title>
<p id="Par92">The lrCaptureSeq experiments were performed once for each condition/age (four mouse retina timepoints; one mouse brain timepoint; one human retina condition). Mouse experiments used one C57Bl6/J animal for each condition. Human experiments used tissue from a single donor (male, age 59). Each proteomics strategy (i.e., cell surface biotinylation and trypsin ectodomain release) was performed once, although the biotinylation and pull-down conditions were worked out in pilot experiments. The gel shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref> is the same one used for the proteomics experiment and was representative of the pilot experiments using similar conditions. For each proteomics strategy, P14 mouse retinal tissue was pooled from multiple littermates.
