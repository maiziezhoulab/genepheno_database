<p>Incomplete annotation has the greatest impact on brain-specific genes and consequently, brain-related disorders.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Growing evidence suggests that human gene annotation remains incomplete; however, it is unclear how this affects different tissues and our understanding of different disorders. Here, we detect previously unannotated transcription from Genotype-Tissue Expression RNA sequencing data across 41 human tissues. We connect this unannotated transcription to known genes, confirming that human gene annotation remains incomplete, even among well-studied genes including 63% of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man–morbid catalog and 317 neurodegeneration-associated genes. We find the greatest abundance of unannotated transcription in brain and genes highly expressed in brain are more likely to be reannotated. We explore examples of reannotated disease genes, such as <italic>SNCA</italic>, for which we experimentally validate a previously unidentified, brain-specific, potentially protein-coding exon. We release all tissue-specific transcriptomes through vizER: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rytenlab.com/browser/app/vizER">http://rytenlab.com/browser/app/vizER</ext-link>. We anticipate that this resource will facilitate more accurate genetic analysis, with the greatest impact on our understanding of Mendelian and complex neurogenetic disorders.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Genetic and transcriptomic studies are fundamentally reliant on accurate and complete human gene annotation, being defined as the genetic coordinates of all transcripts of a given gene. Among other analyses, this is required for the quantification of expression or splicing from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments, interpretation of significant genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, and variant interpretation from genetic tests. As our understanding of transcriptomic complexity improves, it is apparent that existing gene annotation principally originating from four sources (RefSeq, GENCODE, Ensembl, AceView) remains incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Comparison of these different existing gene annotation databases reveals that more than 17,000 Ensembl genes fall into intronic or intergenic regions according to the AceView database, and the choice of reference annotation greatly influences the performance of variant interpretation software, such as VEP and ANNOVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Thus, this evidence suggests that incomplete annotation may cause pathogenic variants to be overlooked within exonic regions that are yet to be annotated as well as limiting our understanding of risk loci.</p><p>Despite accumulating evidence that the map of the human transcriptome remains incomplete, it is not yet fully understood which tissues and consequently diseases are most affected. The extent to which this poses an issue is unlikely to be equal across all types of tissues or cells. In particular, the fact that the human brain harbors longer transcripts, higher transcript diversity, and higher cellular heterogeneity than other tissues might be expected to make identifying all transcripts from this tissue more challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Moreover, the difficulties of accessing brain tissue and dependence on postmortem tissue may also limit the quantity of high-quality, brain-specific data inputted into gene annotation pipelines to date. Several analyses of bulk RNA-seq data derived from human brain tissues have discovered transcription originating from intronic or intergenic regions (henceforth termed unannotated) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). For example, Jaffe and colleagues found that as much as 41% of transcription in the human frontal cortex was unannotated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>) . In combination, these factors lead to specific challenges in fully capturing the transcriptome of the human brain and suggest that improvements to gene annotation may have a disproportionate impact on the understanding of neurological diseases.</p><p>In this study, we address this issue by leveraging transcriptomic data available through the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium to identify previously unannotated exons of known genes. Distinct from existing de novo assembly approaches, such as that implemented by Pertea and colleagues leading to the development of the CHESS database, our analytic approach was focused on the detection of unannotated exons among known genes rather than the assembly of previously unidentified transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). This conservative approach was adopted because of the well-recognized challenges in accurately calling transcripts from short-read sequencing data and because the major aim of this study was to improve the annotation of genes already known to contribute to neurological disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>). With this in mind, we defined transcription in an annotation-agnostic manner using RNA-seq data from 13 regions of the human central nervous system (CNS) and a further 28 nonbrain tissues. Specifically, we defined unannotated transcription in a tissue-specific manner to allow comparison between tissues. We found that this unannotated transcription although widespread is most prevalent in human brain. We provide evidence to suggest that the exons that we discover are likely to be functionally important on the basis of their tissue and cell-type specific expression, the significant depletion of genetic variation within humans, and their protein coding potential. Last, by combining unannotated transcription with junction read data, defined as reads that have a gapped alignment to the genome, we link these regions to known genes, focusing on those associated with Mendelian and complex neurological disorders. Overall, we improve the annotation of 13,429 genes, encompassing 1831 (63%) Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) genes and a further 317 genes associated with complex neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease. We release our findings in an online platform vizER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rytenlab.com/browser/app/vizER">www.rytenlab.com/browser/app/vizER</ext-link>), which allows individual genes to be queried and visualized for reannotation as well as the download of all exons we discover. We anticipate that this resource will facilitate basic and translational research targeted at Mendelian and complex neurogenetic disorders.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Optimizing the tissue-specific, annotation-agnostic detection of transcription</title><p>Pervasive transcription of the human genome, the presence of pre-mRNA even within polyA-selected RNA-seq libraries and variability in read depth complicates the identification of exons and transcripts using RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). With this in mind, we used a set of exons with the most reliable boundaries [namely, all exons from Ensembl v92 that did not overlap with any other exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>)] to calibrate the detection of transcription from 41 GTEx tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. Of available annotation databases, Ensembl was selected as it is one of the most commonly used and comprehensive annotation providers. We used the tool derfinder to perform this analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). However, we noted that while derfinder enables the detection of continuous blocks of transcribed bases termed expressed regions (ERs) in an annotation-agnostic manner, the mean coverage cutoff (MCC) applied to determine transcribed bases is difficult to define and variability in read depth even across an individual exon can result in false segmentation of blocks of expressed sequence. Therefore, to improve our analysis and more accurately define ERs, we applied derfinder, but with the inclusion of an additional parameter we term the max region gap (MRG), which merges adjacent ERs (see detailed Materials and Methods). Next, we sought to identify the optimal values for MCC and MRG using our learning set of known, nonoverlapping exons.</p><p>This process involved generating 506 transcriptome definitions for each tissue using unique pairs of MCCs and MRGs, resulting in a total of 20,746 transcriptome definitions across all 41 tissues. For each of the 20,746 transcriptome definitions, all ERs that intersected nonoverlapping exons were extracted, and the absolute difference between the ER definition and the corresponding exon boundaries, termed the exon delta, was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We summarized the exon delta for each transcriptome using two metrics, the median exon delta and the number of ERs with exon delta equal to 0. The median exon delta represents the overall accuracy of all ER definitions, whereas the number of ERs with exon delta equal to 0 indicates the extent to which ER definitions precisely match overlapping exon boundaries. The MCC and MRG pair that generated the transcriptome with the lowest median exon delta and highest number of ERs with exon delta equal to 0 was chosen as the most accurate transcriptome definition for each tissue. Across all tissues, 50 to 54% of the ERs tested had an exon delta = 0, suggesting that we had accurately defined most of ERs. Taking the cerebellum as an example and comparing ER definitions to those which would have been generated applying the default derfinder parameters used in the existing literature (MCC: 0.5, MRG: None equivalent to 0), we noted a 96–base pair (bp) refinement in ER size, equating to 67% of median exon size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). In summary, by using known exons to calibrate the detection of transcription, we generated more accurate annotation-agnostic transcriptome definitions for 13 regions of the CNS and a further 28 human tissues.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Optimization of the detection of transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transcription in the form ERs was detected in an annotation-agnostic manner across 41 human tissues. The MCC is the number of reads supporting each base above which that base would be considered transcribed, and the MRG is the maximum number of bases between ERs below which adjacent ERs would be merged. MCC and MRG parameters were optimized for each tissue using the nonoverlapping exons from Ensembl v92 reference annotation.

S1A). Those that solely overlapped intronic, or intergenic regions were classified as unannotated. We discovered 8.4 to 22 Mb of unannotated transcription across all tissues, consistent with previous reports that annotation remains incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Unannotated ERs predominantly fell into intragenic regions, suggesting that we were preferentially improving the annotation of known genes, rather than identifying entirely undiscovered genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Although unannotated transcription was found to be ubiquitous across tissues, the abundance varied greatly between tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, B, D, and E</xref>). To investigate this further, we calculated the coefficient of variation for exonic, intronic, and intergenic ERs. We found that the levels of unannotated transcription varied 3.4 to 7.7 times more between tissues than the expression of exonic ERs (coefficient of variation of exonic ERs, 0.066 Mb; intronic ERs, 0.222 Mb; intergenic ERs, 0.481 Mb). Furthermore, focusing on a subset of unannotated ERs for which we could infer the precise boundaries of the putative exon (using intersecting junction reads), we found that more than half of these ERs were detected in only one tissue and that 86.3% were found in less than five tissues (fig. S2A). Even when restricting to ERs derived from only the 13 CNS tissues, 34.3% were specific to one CNS region (fig. S2B). This suggests that unannotated ERs are largely derived from tissue-specific transcription, potentially explaining why they had not already been discovered.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Transcription detected across 41 GTEx tissues categorized by annotation feature.</title><p>Within each tissue, the length of the ERs Mb overlapping (<bold>A</bold>) all annotation features, (<bold>B</bold>) purely exons, (<bold>C</bold>) exons and introns, (<bold>D</bold>) exons and intergenic regions, (<bold>E</bold>) purely intergenic regions, and (<bold>F</bold>) purely introns according to Ensembl v92 was computed. Tissues are plotted in descending order based on the respective total size of intronic and intergenic regions. Tissues are color-coded as indicated in the <italic>x</italic> axis, with GTEx brain regions highlighted with bold font. At least 8.4 Mb of previously unannotated transcription was discovered in each tissue, with the greatest quantity found within brain tissues (mean across brain tissues, 18.6 Mb; nonbrain, 11.2 Mb; two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic> = 2.35 × 10<sup>−10</sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aay8299-F2"></graphic></fig><p>This finding lead us to hypothesize that genes highly expressed in brain would be among the most likely to be reannotated because of the difficulty of sampling human brain tissue, the cellular heterogeneity of this tissue, and the particularly high prevalence of alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). As we predicted, the quantity of unannotated transcription found within brain was significantly higher than nonbrain tissues (<italic>P</italic> = 2.35 × 10<sup>−10</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). Ranking the tissues by descending Mb of unannotated transcription demonstrated that tissues of the CNS constituted 13 of the top 14 tissues. The importance of improving annotation in the human brain tissue was most apparent when considering purely intergenic ERs and ERs that overlapped exons and extended into intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>).</p><p>This observation raised the question of which factors were most important in determining whether a gene was reannotated (connected to an unannotated ER). We used logistic regression to find genic properties, such as measures of structural complexity and specificity of expression to brain, that significantly changed a gene’s likelihood of reannotation. We also accounted for factors that might be expected to contribute to errors in ER identification, including whether the gene overlapped with another known gene making attribution of reads more complex. We found that the annotation of longer, brain-specific genes with higher transcript complexity were more likely to have evidence for incomplete annotation (table S1). Overlapping genes were not significantly more likely to be reannotated (taking into account gene length), suggesting that unannotated transcription is not merely a product of noise from intersecting genes. Together, these findings demonstrate that widespread unannotated transcription is found across all human tissues, the quantity of which varies extensively between tissues. CNS tissues displayed the greatest quantity of unannotated transcription, and accordingly, genes highly expressed in the human brain are most likely to be reannotated.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Validation of unannotated transcription</title><p>We recognize that a proportion of unannotated transcription may originate from technical variability or pre-mRNA contamination. Therefore, we assessed the reliability of detecting unannotated ERs across different versions of Ensembl and within an independent dataset. First, we measured how many Kb of the transcription that we detected would have been classified as unannotated with respect to Ensembl v87 but was now annotated in Ensembl v92 and found that across all tissues, an average of 68 Kb (43 to 127 Kb) had changed status. This value was 5.3 times (3.2 to 10.1 times) greater in every tissue compared to the Kb of ERs overlapping exons in Ensembl v87 that had become purely intronic or intergenic in Ensembl v92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). To further assess whether this was greater than what would be expected by chance, we compared the total Kb of unannotated ERs entering v92 annotation for each tissue to 10,000 sets of random length-matched intronic and intergenic regions. For all tissues, the total Kb of both intronic and intergenic ERs that were now annotated in Ensembl v92 was significantly higher than the total Kb distribution of the randomized negative control regions, implying a high validation rate of unannotated ERs (fig. S3). Notably, brain regions had significantly higher Kb of ERs entering Ensembl v92 annotation from Ensembl v87 than nonbrain tissues, even when subtracting the Kb of ERs leaving Ensembl v87 (<italic>P</italic> = 7.6 × 10<sup>−9</sup>), suggesting that the greater abundance of brain-specific unannotated transcription was not purely attributed to increased transcriptional noise.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Validation of unannotated transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The classification of ERs based on v87 and v92 of Ensembl was compared.

Tissues are plotted in descending order based on the total Mb of unannotated ERs with respect to Ensembl v87 that were validated (classified as exonic in the Ensembl v92).

Therefore, we investigated whether our GTEx frontal cortex–derived ERs could also be discovered in an independent frontal cortex dataset reported by Labadorf and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). As expected, ERs that overlapped with annotated exons had near-complete validation (≥89%), but importantly, 62% of intergenic and 70% of intronic ERs, respectively, were also detected in the second independent frontal cortex dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). While this high validation rate implied that most of all ERs were reliably detected, we investigated whether a subset of ERs supported with evidence of RNA splicing as well as transcription would have even better rates of validation. Evidence of transcription is provided by the coverage data derived using derfinder, while junction reads, which are reads with a gapped alignment to the genome, provide evidence of the splicing out of an intron (fig. S1B). With this in mind, we focused our attention on the putative spliced ERs as indicated by the presence of an overlapping junction read. Consistent with expectation, we found that ERs with junction read support had higher validation rates than ERs lacking this additional feature. This increase in validation rate for ERs with junction read support was greatest for intergenic and intronic ERs with the validation rate rising to 87% for intergenic ERs and 88% for intronic ERs (as compared to 99% for ERs overlapping exons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Even when considering this set of highly validated ERs with junction read support, 1.7 to 3.8 Mb of intronic and 0.5 to 2.2 Mb of intergenic transcription was detected across all 41 tissues. Thus, in summary, most of the unannotated ERs were reliably detected and validated in an independent dataset.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Unannotated ERs are likely to be functionally important within humans</title><p>Given recent reports suggesting widespread transcriptional noise and acknowledging that transcription, even when tissue specific, does not necessarily translate to function, we investigated whether unannotated ERs were likely to be of functional significance using measures of both conservation and genetic constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>). The degree to which a base is evolutionarily conserved across species is dependent on its functional importance, and accordingly, conservation scores have been used to aid exon identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). However, this measure is unable to capture genomic regions of human-specific importance. Thus, we investigated unannotated ERs not only in terms of conservation but also genetic constraint. Constraint scores, measured here as a context-dependent tolerance score (CDTS), represent the likelihood that a base is mutated within humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). By comparing our detected unannotated ERs to 10,000 randomized sets of length-matched intronic and intergenic regions, we found that both intronic and intergenic ERs were significantly less conserved but more constrained than expected by chance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This would suggest that they have an important functional role in humans. Furthermore, considering the importance of higher-order cognitive functions in differentiating humans from other species, we separately measured the constraint of brain-specific unannotated ERs on the basis that these ERs may be the most genetically constrained of all unannotated ERs identified. We found that brain-specific unannotated ERs were even more constrained than other unannotated ERs, supporting the view that improvements in gene annotation are likely to have a disproportionate impact on our understanding of human brain diseases.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Unannotated ERs collectively serve an important function for humans, and a proportion can form potentially protein-coding transcripts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of conservation (phastCons7/phastCons20) and constraint (CDTS) of intronic and intergenic ERs to 10,000 sets of random, length-matched intronic and intergenic regions.

For this reason, we investigated whether unannotated ERs could potentially encode for proteins. Here, we focused on the subset of unannotated ERs that had evidence of splicing since the overlapping junction reads can be used to assign the precise boundaries of ERs, allowing us to confidently retrieve the DNA sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence for each unannotated ER. A total of 2961 ERs covering 274 Kb was found to be potentially protein coding, which represented 57% of the ERs analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Among this set of ERs with protein coding potential, 758 ERs also fell within the top 20% of most constrained regions of the genome. These ERs connect to 694 genes, 30% of which are expressed specifically in the CNS (table S2). Overall, we discovered that unannotated ERs are likely to be of functional importance in humans. We also identified a subset of unannotated ERs that have protein coding potential and are highly depleted for genetic variation in humans. Together, this suggested that at least a proportion of unannotated ERs are functionally important.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Incomplete annotation limits our understanding of specific cell types and complex diseases</title><p>Given that we discovered the greatest abundance of previously unannotated transcription among brain tissues, we investigated whether this may be affecting our understanding of certain cell types within the brain more than others. We tested this by calculating whether our set of 2962 reannotated brain-specific genes were significantly enriched for cell-type specific genes when compared to the background list of 2422 brain-specific genes without reannotations. Of the 13 brain-specific cell types considered, genes specifically expressed by oligodendrocytes had the largest difference in enrichment (reannotated = &lt;2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>; not reannotated = 0.169), suggesting that incomplete annotation was disproportionately limiting our understanding of this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). For example, we found that <italic>MBP</italic>, which encodes for myelin basic protein, was among those genes reannotated and with an oligodendrocyte-specific expression profile (fig. S4). We detected a 48-bp ER specific to cortex and striatal tissues (anterior cingulate cortex, cortex, frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and putamen), which was connected to two flanking protein-coding exons of <italic>MBP</italic>.

Unannotated ERs were first connected to known genes using junction reads (fig. S1B). Next, we filtered for OMIM-morbid genes and found that 63% of this set of OMIM-morbid genes were reannotated and 14% were connected to a potentially protein-coding ER, suggesting that despite many of these genes having been extensively studied, the annotation of many OMIM-morbid genes remains incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Given that OMIM-morbid genes often produce abnormalities specific to a given set of organs or systems, we investigated the relevance of unannotated transcription to disease by matching the human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms obtained from the disease corresponding to the OMIM-morbid gene, to the GTEx tissue from which ERs connected to that gene were derived. We discovered that 72% of reannotated OMIM-morbid genes had an associated unannotated ER originating from a phenotypically relevant tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). This phenomenon was exemplified by the OMIM-morbid gene <italic>ERLIN1</italic>, which, when disrupted, is known to cause spastic paraplegia 62 (SPG62), an autosomal recessive form of spastic paraplegia, which has been reported in some families to cause not only lower limb spasticity but also cerebellar abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). We detected a previously unannotated, cerebellar-specific ER that was intronic with respect to ERLIN1.

Furthermore, this putative exon was highly conserved (phastcons7 score: 1) and was among the top 30% most constrained regions in the genome, suggesting that it is functionally important both across mammals and within humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Reannotation of OMIM genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A previously unannotated ER connected through a junction read was discovered for 63% of OMIM-morbid genes.

This ER connected to two flanking protein-coding exons through junction reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>) and appeared to also have coding potential. While the ER sequence is not conserved within mammals (phastcons7 score: 0.09) or primates (phastcons20 score: 0.21), it is in the top 19% of most constrained regions in the genome, suggesting that it is of functional importance in humans. We validated the existence of this ER both in silico and experimentally. The expression of this ER was confirmed in silico using an independent frontal cortex dataset reported by Labadorf and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Using Sanger sequencing, we validated the junctions intersecting the ER and the flanking exons in RNA samples originating from pooled human frontal cortex samples (fig. S5).

This implied a full transcript structure containing a minimum of 609 bp with the unannotated ER predicted to add an additional 63 amino acids (45% of existing transcript size).

We find that although unannotated transcription is commonly detectable across all human tissues assayed, it is most frequently observed in the human brain. We find that the putative unannotated exons, which can be confidently assigned to a known gene using junction reads, have high replication rates (87% for intronic ERs as compared to 99% for annotated exons). Thus, our findings suggest the existence of previously unannotated exons that can be reliably detected from RNA-seq data and that might be expected to provide most insight into neurological disorders.</p><p>There are several reasons why these unannotated exons may have been previously missed from gene annotation and why they are most frequently detected in human brain. We believe that a key factor is the high cellular heterogeneity of human brain combined with the high cellular specificity of some transcripts. Lowly expressed, tissue-specific isoforms or those that are only transcribed within a cell type of proportionally low abundance may be missed from bulk RNA-seq datasets. Accordingly, we find that most of the putative unannotated exons that we detect have a restricted expression pattern across tissues and that the highest numbers are derived from human brain. Even within human brain, there appeared to be cellular biases influencing a gene’s likelihood of being reannotated. Among reannotated genes, we found a significant enrichment of genes with a cell-specific expression pattern, and this was most evident for genes specifically expressed by oligodendrocytes. We also note that the use of conservation measures in previous gene annotation pipelines may have biased exon and transcript discovery. Given that exons that are functionally important within humans might be expected to be enriched among genes of importance to human brain development, again this would predict higher rates of incomplete annotation within brain tissue. Consistent with this view, we find that, collectively, our unannotated exons are depleted for mutations within humans yet are not well conserved across other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Furthermore, as we predicted, the unannotated exons identified that were connected to brain-specific genes showed the most significant depletion in mutations. Together, these findings not only explain the high yield of previously undiscovered annotation with human brain but also imply that it is likely to be disease relevant.</p><p>Given this evidence, we expect annotation to be of greatest relevance to complex and Mendelian forms of neurogenetic disease. With this in mind, it is noteworthy that 1831 OMIM genes were reannotated on the basis of our analysis of which 1111 were associated with a neurological phenotype. Some 251 of these OMIM genes had at least one associated unannotated exon with the potential to be protein coding. We highlight the example of <italic>SNCA</italic>, a gene implicated in Mendelian and complex Parkinson’s disease. We identify a previously unannotated, potentially protein coding exon of <italic>SNCA</italic>, which is validated experimentally and located in a region that is among the most depleted for mutations among humans but is poorly conserved. Furthermore, we find that genes known to cause Mendelian and complex neurodegenerative disorders are enriched among the set of genes that we reannotate. Thus, our analyses suggest that incomplete annotation is a substantial limiting factor in our understanding of both Mendelian and common complex neurological diseases.</p><p>Last, we release our results through a dedicated web resource, vizER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rytenlab.com/browser/app/vizER">http://rytenlab.com/browser/app/vizER</ext-link>), which enables individual genes to be queried for incomplete annotation as well as the download of all the definitions of putative exons discovered in this study.

Optimization was performed using 156,674 nonoverlapping exons (defined by Ensembl v92) as the gold standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Exon biotypes of all Ensembl v92 exons were compared to this set of nonoverlapping exons to ensure that we were not preferentially optimizing for one particular biotype (fig. S6).

This generated six distinct categories: “exon,” “exon, intron,” “exon, intergenic,” “exon, intergenic, intron,” “intergenic,” and “intron” (fig. S1A). ERs classified as exon, intergenic, intron were removed from all downstream analysis as these formed only 0.54% of all ERs and were presumed to be technical artifacts generated from regions of dense, overlapping gene expression. For each tissue, the length of all ERs within each annotation feature was summed generating the total Mb of ERs per annotation feature. Normalized variance of exonic, intronic, and intergenic ERs was calculated by dividing the SD of the total Mb of ERs across tissues by the mean total Mb of ERs for each annotation feature.

The randomized regions were annotated with constraint scores and CDTS using the aforementioned method. The mean CDTS and phastCons scores of the unannotated ERs (split by annotation feature) were compared to the corresponding distribution of CDTS and phastCons scores of the randomized regions using a one sample, two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test. For easier interpretation when plotting, CDTS scores have been converted to their opposite sign; therefore, for both phastCons and CDTS, the higher the value, the greater the magnitude of conservation or constraint as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Checking ER protein coding potential</title><p>Intronic and intergenic ERs that were intersected by two junction reads were extracted. The junction reads were used to determine the precise boundaries of the ER. The R package Biostrings version 2.46.0 was used to extract the DNA sequence corresponding to the ER genetic coordinates from the genome build hg38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>). Since the translation frame was ambiguous without knowledge of the other exons that are part of the transcript that included the unannotated ER, we converted the DNA sequence to amino acid sequence for all three possible frames starting from the first, second, or third base. Any ER that had at least one frame that did not include a stop codon was considered to be potentially protein coding.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene properties influencing reannotation</title><p>All Ensembl v92 genes were marked with a 1 or a 0 depending on whether we detected a reannotation for that gene in the form of an ER connected to the gene using a junction read, with 1 representing a detected reannotation event. Details of gene length, biotype, and transcript count and whether the gene overlapped another gene were retrieved from the Ensembl v92 database. Brain specificity was assigned using the Finucane dataset and selecting the top 10% of brain-specific genes when compared to nonbrain tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>). Mean gene transcripts per million (TPM) was calculated by downloading tissue-specific TPM values from the GTEx portal and summarized by calculating the mean across all tissues. The list of OMIM genes (May 2018) was used to assign whether a gene was known to cause disease or not. We used a logistic regression to test whether different gene properties significantly influenced the variability of reannotation (formula = reannotated ~ brain-specific + mean TPM + overlapping gene + transcript count + gene biotype + gene length).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sanger sequencing of unannotated junctions</title><p>Commercially purchased (Takara) frontal cortex and cerebellum RNA samples, isolated from individuals of European descent, were used for validation of unannotated junctions detected in <italic>SNCA</italic> and <italic>ERLIN1</italic>, respectively. Tissues were chosen to match the tissue in which the reannotation for each gene was detected. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 μg of RNA from each tissue and then converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with RNase Inhibitor (Applied Biosystems) and random primers as per manufacturer’s instructions. Primers were designed to span predicted exon-exon junctions using Primer-BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and ordered from Sigma-Aldrich (table S5). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using FastStart PCR Master (Roche) and enzymatic cleanup of PCR products was performed using Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sanger sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Kit (Applied Biosystems), and sequences were viewed and exported using CodonCode Aligner (version 8.0.2). Sequences were blatted against the human genome (hg38) and alignment visually inspected for confirmation of validation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression-weighted cell-type enrichment: Evaluating enrichment of theta-correlated genes</title><p>Expression-weighted cell-type enrichment (EWCE) was used to determine whether brain-specific genes (both reannotated and not reannotated) have higher expression within particular cell types than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>). As our input, we used (i) neuronal and glial clusters of the CNS identified in the Linnarsson single-cell RNA-seq dataset (amounting to a subset of 114 of the original 265 clusters identified) and (ii) lists of genes split by whether or not they were reannotated, and if reannotated, by their overlap with Ensembl v92 annotation features (see table S6 for the full list of CNS neuronal clusters and genes used) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>). For each gene in the Linnarsson dataset, we estimated its cell-type specificity (the proportion of a gene’s total expression in one cell type compared to all cell types) using the “generate.celltype.data” function of the EWCE package. EWCE with the target list was run with 100,000 bootstrap replicates, which were sampled from a background list of genes that excluded all genes without a 1:1 mouse:human ortholog. We additionally controlled for transcript length and GC-content biases by selecting bootstrap lists with comparable properties to the target list. We performed the analysis with major cell-type classes (e.g., “astrocyte,” “microglia,” etc.). Data are displayed as SDs from the mean, and any values &lt;0, which reflect a depletion of expression, are displayed as 0. <italic>P</italic> values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg [false discovery rate (FDR)] method over all cell types and gene lists displayed.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Enrichment of reannotated genes for neurological disorder–associated genes</title><p>The STOPGAP database detailing all genes associated with 4684 GWASs was downloaded. To select which genes were associated to a GWAS, the “best gene” as determined by STOPGAP using functional evidence was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>). The medical subject heading for each disease was used to further subgroup GWASs into four categories; neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, other neurological conditions, and the remaining as other (table S7). For each of the subgroups, we generated a contingency table, counting the number of genes that were reannotated or not in relation to whether they fell into that particular subgroup. For genes that were overlapping between GWASs, we classified a gene to be part of a subgroup if it was associated with at least one GWAS contained in that subgroup. A Fisher’s exact test was used to examine whether our reannotated gene list was significantly enriched for genes from any of the subgroups. FDR was used to correct for multiple testing.</p></sec></sec>
