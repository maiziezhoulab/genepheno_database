<abstract>
<p>Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-mediated anti-proliferative and differentiating effects promote neuronal differentiation during embryonic central nervous system development. TGFβ downstream signals, composed of activated SMAD2/3, SMAD4 and a FOXO family member, promote the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>. In early CNS development, IGF1/PI3K signaling and the transcription factor FOXG1 inhibit FOXO- and TGFβ-mediated <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription. FOXG1 prevents cell cycle exit by binding to the SMAD/FOXO-protein complex. In this study we provide further details on the FOXG1/FOXO/SMAD transcription factor network. We identified ligands of the TGFβ- and IGF-family, <italic>Foxo1</italic>, <italic>Foxo3</italic> and <italic>Kcnh3</italic> as novel FOXG1-target genes during telencephalic development and showed that FOXG1 interferes with <italic>Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Tgfβ</italic> transcription. Our data specify that FOXO1 activates <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription. This process is under control of the IGF1-pathway, as <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription increases when IGF1-signaling is pharmacologically inhibited. However, overexpression of CDKN1A and knockdown of <italic>Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Foxo3</italic> is not sufficient for neuronal differentiation, which is probably instructed by TGFβ-signaling. In mature neurons, FOXG1 activates transcription of the seizure-related <italic>Kcnh3</italic>, which might be a FOXG1-target gene involved in the FOXG1 syndrome pathology.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>During neuronal differentiation progenitor cells are instructed according to a precise spatial and temporal plan, and specific signals control the equilibrium between proliferation and differentiation. Among these signals are extrinsic cues such as growth factors or activators of intracellular signaling pathways. Since proliferation and differentiation take place simultaneously in developing organ systems, cellular interpretation of such signals has to occur cell autonomously, for example through activity of specific transcription factors. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is an extrinsic cue implicated in neuronal differentiation of cortical progenitor cells (CPCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. It has 3 different isoforms (TGFB1, 2, and 3) and is a member of the TGFβ superfamily, including Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Activins. Canonical TGFβ-signaling occurs <italic>via</italic> SMAD-dependent pathways, in which the receptor complex phosphorylates R-SMAD (SMA- and MAD-related protein) 2 and/or 3. Phosphorylated SMAD2 and 3 translocate to the nucleus together with SMAD4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. SMAD proteins bind to diverse cofactors. SMAD/cofactor complexes activate or inhibit context-dependent transcription of a variety of target genes, which is apparent through the diversity of processes controlled by TGFβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>During embryonic neurogenesis, TGFβ exerts antiproliferative and differentiating effects on neuronal progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. TGFβ-signals lead to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase by transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and <italic>Cdkn2b,</italic> as well as repression of the myelocytomatosis oncogene (<italic>cMyc)</italic> and inhibitor of DNA binding 1, 2 and 3 (<italic>Id1-Id3)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Forkhead box O (FOXO) proteins are cofactors of SMAD3 and SMAD4 in the TGFβ-induced formation of a <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>-activation complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. FOXO proteins are important in the control of cell and organismal growth, development, metabolism and longevity. The phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) growth-promoting pathway negatively controls FOXO factors through thymoma viral proto-oncogene (AKT)-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO proteins, which prevents their translocation to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Another FOX family member, FOXG1, opposes the activity of SMAD/FOXO-complexes by preventing transcriptional activation of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> through a non-competitive, direct binding of FOXO3 in the FOXO/SMAD complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Absence of FOXG1 during mouse embryonic development leads to death at birth due to hypoplasia of cerebral hemispheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. In CPCs it promotes self-renewal of neural precursors and antagonizes neuronal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. FOXG1 expression is dynamic during cortical development whereby it is transiently downregulated when progenitors enter neuronal differentiation. The re-expression of FOXG1 in differentiating neurons is necessary for correct integration into the cortical plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. The interference of FOXG1 with TGFβ- and FOXO-mediated cell cycle exit might be responsible for its inhibition of neuronal differentiation. However, as the biochemical data that described the role of the FOXG1/FOXO/SMAD transcriptional complex in <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression comes from keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], this notion has still to be proven in CPCs. Regulation of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression by TGFβ, FOXO3 and FOXG1 might also be important for the differentiation of Cajal-Retzius (CR) neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. CR cells are among the earliest born neurons in the developing cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and are generated from different telencephalic regions, some of which do not express FOXG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite a substantial body of data, the functional role of the FOXG1/FOXO/SMAD transcription factor network in the cerebral cortex is mostly correlative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and several open questions remain. Firstly, FOXG1 and FOXO proteins might be a node of intersection between TGFβ- and IGF-signaling pathways. In contrast to this view, we recently reported that IGF1-signaling activates cell proliferation in early cortical development (E13.5), whereas TGFβ-signaling is mainly active at later stages (E16.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Hence, FOXG1 and FOXO proteins might be cofactors that are implicated in different developmental responses to IGF1- and TGFβ-signals rather than nodes of intersection. Secondly, it is unclear whether expression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> or FOXO proteins is sufficient to stimulate neuronal differentiation. Thirdly, further target genes apart from <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> in CPCs or in mature neurons might be controlled by FOXG1/FOXO/SMAD transcription factors. Hence, we studied the FOXG1/FOXO/SMAD network in CPCs of different developmental stages and in different mouse models. Our analyses revealed that (1) FOXG1 impaired TGFβ-induced neuronal differentiation in early developmental stages, i.e. E13.5; (2) FOXG1 blocks transcription of <italic>Cdkn1a, Tgfβ, Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Foxo3</italic>; (3) expression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> is activated by FOXO1; (4) neither CDKN1A, FOXO1 or FOXO3 can stimulate neuronal differentiation autonomously; and (5) <italic>Kcnh3</italic> is a novel neuronal FOXG1-regulated target gene which might be of clinical relevance in atypical Rett syndrome.</p>

<title>FOXG1 antagonizes TGFβ-mediated neuronal differentiation at early developmental stages</title>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> cultivated CPCs from E16.5 mouse cerebral cortex differentiate upon a TGFβ stimulus, but this instructive effect is not observed in E13.5-derived cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. FOXG1 has the ability to prevent premature differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and it antagonizes the TGFβ-pathway by inhibiting <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription through association with the FOXO/SMAD4 complex, at least in keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that altered expression levels of FOXG1 could be causative for the differences in responsiveness to TGFβ of E13.5 and E16.5-derived CPCs. Although FOXG1 has been studied to some extent, FOXG1 mRNA and protein expression during development has not yet been reported. We assessed FOXG1 expression in the telencephalon <italic>in vivo</italic> using reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, 1C</xref>) and immunohistochemistry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) at different developmental stages. On the transcriptional level, <italic>Foxg1</italic> expression increased significantly after E11.5 and remained on similar levels until the adult stage, where it declined significantly compared to embryonic stage E17.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Expression changes on the protein level were slightly shifted to the later stage and the highest amounts of FOXG1 were identified in E16.5, E17.5 and E18.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, 1C</xref>). In the adult, less protein was detected in the lateral cortex (LC) and hippocampus (Hippo) compared to embryonic telencephalon of different stages. Immunohistochemistry of FOXG1 in forebrain sections of E11.5, E13.5 and E16.5 indicated that FOXG1 was expressed predominantly in progenitor cells at E11.5, whereas E13.5 forebrains expressed FOXG1 in progenitor cells and mature neurons. At E16.5 FOXG1 expression is confined mainly to mature neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Together, these data indicated that the expression of FOXG1 is dynamic during development. FOXG1 expression thereby increased from E11.5 onwards, and coincided with increasing numbers of postmitotic neurons in the cortical plate. Hence, FOXG1 could indeed antagonize TGFβ-mediated neurogenesis during early development at E11.5 and E13.5. On the other hand, reduced levels of FOXG1 in E16.5 progenitor cells might render progenitors responsive to differentiative TGFβ-signals. Our recent reports on TGFβ-mediated neuronal differentiation are based on a culture paradigm where E13.5- and E16.5-derived cortical cells were cultured until day <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that FOXG1 expression in CPCs might decline between E13.5 and E16.5 <italic>in vitro</italic>. We thus assessed FOXG1 expression in cultured CPCs that derived from different developmental time points (E11.5, E13.5 and E16.5) and were cultured for either 0, 4 or 8 DIV. Using immunoblotting of protein extracts we showed that FOXG1 expression levels of freshly dissociated cells increased during development as observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E, 1F</xref>). However, while cultivated cells from E11.5 and E13.5 increased or at least retained FOXG1 protein levels during the 4 and 8 day culture period, respectively, E16.5-derived cells expressed decreasing levels of FOXG1 after 8 days in culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E, 1F</xref>). To further address whether declining FOXG1 levels promote TGFβ-mediated neuronal differentiation, CPCs from E11.5, E13.5 and E16.5 were cultured for 8 DIV in the presence of TGFB1 from DIV2 onwards. Immunostaining and quantification of the neuronal marker HuC/D revealed that TGFβ treatment significantly increased the amount of HuC/D-positive cells at E16.5, but not at E13.5 or at E11.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Finally, we treated E13.5-derived CPCs from <italic>Foxg1-</italic>deficient (Foxg1<sup>−/−</sup>), heterozygote (Foxg1<sup>+/−</sup>) and wild-type mice with TGFB1 and quantified cells positive for the neuronal marker HuC/D. Strikingly, TGFB1 treatment increased the numbers of HuC/D-positive neurons even in CPCs of E13.5, if the expression of FOXG1 is reduced, but not in wild-type CPCs expressing normal FOXG1 levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>).</p>

<title>FOXG1 suppresses transcription of <italic>Tgfβ</italic>- and <italic>Igf</italic>-ligands, <italic>Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Foxo3</italic> transcription factors and <italic>Cdkn1a in vivo</italic></title>
<p>We next investigated the transcriptional changes in FOXG1-deficient compared to wild-type CPCs in conditions of active TGFβ-signaling until DIV4. Using microarray technology, we identified 586 differentially expressed genes in FOXG1-deficient compared to wild-type cells using a cutoff of &gt; +1.5 or &lt; −1.5 Log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) (Log<sub>2</sub>FC) and a p-value ≤ 0.05. The majority of the identified genes showed increased expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Hence, FOXG1 acts mainly as transcriptional repressor. DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] analyses revealed that loss of FOXG1 affects multiple important cellular processes that are involved in brain development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Loss of <italic>Foxg1</italic> rendered E13.5-derived CPCs responsive to TGFβ-mediated neuronal differentiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed whether <italic>Foxg1</italic> deficiency antagonized the TGFβ-pathway not only through association with the FOXO/SMAD4 complex, but also through altered expression of TGFβ- and IGF-signaling pathway members. Compared to wild-type E13.5 forebrains, loss of <italic>Foxg1</italic> increased expression of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> and <italic>Tgfb2</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>)<italic>, Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Foxo3</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), and <italic>Igf1, Igf2,</italic> and <italic>Igfbp2</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). We concluded that FOXG1 is not only antagonizing TGFβ- and FOXO-functions on the protein level but also on the transcriptional level.</p>
<p>To further assess the antagonizing function of FOXG1 on SMAD- and FOXO-driven transcription of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>, we analyzed <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription in different mouse models in E13.5 forebrains. To address the impact of FOXG1 on <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription, we used <italic>Foxg1</italic> knockout mice (Foxg1<sup>−/−</sup>). The TGFBR2 is specifically activated by the TGFβ-ligands, whereas the TGFBR1 is also activated by other ligands of the TGFβ-superfamily. We therefore used TGFBR2-deficient mice to assess the involvement of TGFβ-signaling in <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription. TGFBR2-deficiency was achieved through conditional knockout of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> using a cre-knockin into the <italic>Foxg1</italic>-gene (Tgfbr2 cKO). Accordingly, these mice express reduced levels of FOXG1 and have impaired TGFBR2-signaling in the same cells. We also generated FOXG1 and TGFBR2 double-deficient mice (Foxg1;Tgfbr2 dKO). Whereas TGFB1 is mainly expressed in the meninges of the forebrain, TGFB2 and TGFB3 ligands are mainly expressed by neural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. We therefore assessed <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> in TGFB2 and 3 double deficient forebrains (Tgfb2;Tgfb3 dKO), which served as additional model system for impaired TGFβ-signaling. As displayed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>, only the complete loss of <italic>Foxg1</italic> increased expression of <italic>Cdkn1a in vivo</italic>. At this developmental stage, loss of TGFBR2 in FOXG1-expressing cells or constitutive lack of TGFB2 and 3 ligands did not seem to be relevant for <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>FOXG1, FOXO1 and SMAD4 form a regulative network to drive their own and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression</title>
<p>FOXG1, FOXO1, FOXO3 and SMAD4 form a network implicated in controlling <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression. In addition, FOXG1 interfered with transcription of <italic>Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Foxo3 in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). We therefore evaluated transcriptional changes of this network on its own members and on <italic>Cdkn1a in vitro</italic> using shRNA-mediated knockdown of single components and their combinations. Knockdown of <italic>Foxg1</italic> led to a moderate decrease of its own expression by approximately 63% (log<sub>2</sub>FC = −1.44; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This is little less than the <italic>Foxg1</italic> expression that we observed in heterozygote animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). <italic>Foxg1</italic> transcription was also decreased after knockdown of <italic>Foxo1</italic> and of <italic>Smad4</italic>, either alone or in combination. In contrast, the expression of <italic>Foxo1, Foxo3</italic> and <italic>Smad4</italic> was exclusively affected when shRNAs against their own mRNAs were used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, although loss of <italic>Foxg1 in vivo</italic> indicated that FOXG1 is implicated in transcriptional control of <italic>Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Foxo3</italic>, the level of suppression of FOXG1 using the shRNA (63%) was not sufficient to induce <italic>Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Foxo3</italic> transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>We next assessed the expression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> in this <italic>in vitro</italic> setup. We observed that shRNA-mediated <italic>Foxg1</italic> knockdown did not cause an increase in <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We concluded that even low expression of <italic>Foxg1</italic> efficiently blocked the transcription of this cell cycle inhibitor. This conclusion is supported by the <italic>in vivo</italic> data, which showed that loss of one <italic>Foxg1</italic> allele is not sufficient to increase <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> levels <italic>in vivo</italic> in Tgfbr2 cKO, whereas loss of both <italic>Foxg1</italic> alleles strongly increases <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Smad4</italic> suppressed <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> levels.

<p>We concluded that FOXG1 suppresses the expression of <italic>Foxo1</italic>, <italic>Foxo3</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>. FOXO1 in turn increases not only the expression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> but also that of its repressor <italic>Foxg1</italic>. <italic>Smad4</italic> also increases <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and <italic>Foxg1</italic> transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>.

<title>IGF-signaling drives <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression through FOXO1</title>
<p>IGF-signaling activates PI3K, which subsequently leads to phosphorylation of FOXO proteins and exclusion from the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. As our data showed that deficiency of FOXG1 increased expression of IGF-pathway members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), we analyzed the effects of IGF-signaling on <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression in the context of the FOXG1/FOXO1/FOXO3/SMAD4 transcriptional network. We have recently shown that IGF-signaling is highly active in CPCs that derive from early developmental time points (E11.5 and E13.5), whereas it does not have large impact at later stages (E16.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Hence, we hypothesized that IGF-signaling is involved in <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression in E11.5 and E13.5 CPCs. We isolated CPCs from E11.5 mouse brains, treated them with Picropodophyllin (PPP), IGF1 or DMSO. Using qRTPCR, we observed that <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression increased in E11.5-derived CPCs when IGF1-signaling was blocked with PPP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This result is in accordance with IGF-dependent activation of AKT-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO proteins that translocates FOXOs into the cytoplasm and interferes with their activating effects on transcription. It also reflects that IGF-signaling mediates proliferation of CPCs. Treatment of E11.5-derived CPCs with IGF1 did not result in transcriptional repression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This is probably because of high expression levels of IGF1 at these early developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] that might be sufficient to fully activate the pathway.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed whether IGF1-signaling interfered with <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription by impinging on FOXO1 and/or FOXO3. The shRNA knockdown experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) suggested that FOXO1 activates <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression, which might be prevented by IGF-mediated FOXO1 phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Hence, interference with FOXO1 expression should prevent transcriptional activation of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> after inhibition of IGF1-signaling. In contrast, reduced FOXO3 expression might not alter <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcript levels when IGF1-signaling is inhibited. To show this, we infected E11.5-derived CPCs with lentiviral shRNAs against specific members of the FOXG1/FOXO1/FOXO3/SMAD4 transcriptional network and subsequently blocked IGF1-signaling with PPP. Blocked IGF1-signaling induced <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription in nearly all conditions compared to respective DMSO controls, except in conditions with a knockdown of <italic>Foxo1</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In addition, compared to the scrambled control, knockdown of <italic>Foxo1</italic> was the only condition, which resulted in significantly decreased expression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>. This finding further corroborated that FOXO1 but not FOXO3 is important to activate <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription. Next, we assessed whether these transcriptional changes were also observed in E13.5 CPCs. Although induction of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription was generally less pronounced compared to E11.5-derived cells, IGF-signaling mainly affected FOXO1-mediated transcriptional activation of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>. In accordance with our observations in E11.5-derived CPCs, interference with <italic>Foxo1</italic> expression in E13.5-derived cells was one condition in which <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> was not significantly induced after PPP treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Interference with <italic>Smad4</italic> reduced <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression after PPP treatment as well, indicating a growing influence of the TGFβ pathway on <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription during development. Again, interference with <italic>Foxo3</italic> expression did not impair <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression after PPP treatment. We did not observe changes in localization of FOXO3 upon PPP or IGF1 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). This further suggests that FOXO3 might not be relevant in IGF1-mediated control of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression. Hence, we concluded that expression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> is activated by FOXO1, and not by FOXO3 in E11.5 and E13.5 cells.</p>

<title>TGFβ-signaling is not sufficient to induce differentiation of <italic>Calb2</italic>-expressing Cajal-Retzius cells</title>
<p>The FOXG1/FOXO1/FOXO3/SMAD4-network does not only control cell cycle exit, but also regulates differentiation of CR cells. TRP73-expressing CR cells derive from the cortical hem, which does not express FOXG1. Another CR-producing region is the pallial-subpallial boundary (PSB), in which progenitors express FOXG1 and generate CALB2-positive CR neurons. In the cortical hem, TGFβ-signaling is involved in the generation of TRP73-positive CR cells, because FOXG1 is not present in this region and is not antagonizing CR cell generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. We explored whether TGFβ increased CR cell differentiation in the FOXG1-expressing PSB in conditions of reduced FOXG1 levels. We assessed expression of <italic>Reln</italic>, <italic>Trp73</italic> and <italic>Calb2</italic> in Foxg1<sup>−/−</sup>, Tgfbr2 cKO and Foxg1;Tgfbr2 dKO forebrains. <italic>Foxg1</italic>-deficient mice expressed increased levels of <italic>Reln</italic>, which indicates general CR cell overproduction. The Tgfbr2 cKO mice did not show increased <italic>Reln</italic> expression. <italic>Trp73</italic> was strongly increased in both <italic>Foxg1</italic>-deficient mouse models, but only slightly in Tgfbr2 cKO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Expression of <italic>Calb2</italic> increased in all three mouse models as compared to control animals. We concluded that FOXG1 expression is not antagonizing TGFβ activated differentiation of <italic>Calb2</italic>-expressing CR from the PSB. Otherwise, expression of <italic>Calb2</italic> would be reduced in forebrains that are deficient for both, TGFβ-signaling and FOXG1. This result was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry stainings of CALB2 in the different mouse lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Overexpression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> or interference with FOXO1 or FOXO3 does not alter neuronal differentiation</title>
<p>We further investigated whether overexpression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> alone would be sufficient to increase neuronal differentiation. We infected E13.5-derived CPCs with a lentiviral CDKN1A overexpression construct and stained for the neuronal marker HuC/D. Quantification of HuC/D-positive CDKN1A-overexpressing cells compared to cells carrying the empty vector did not reveal increased neuronal differentiation. This was independent of TGFβ stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, 6C</xref>). To assess whether FOXO1 and FOXO3 increased neuronal differentiation, we interfered with their expression using shRNAs in E13.5-derived CPCs and determined the number of HuC/D-expressing neurons. We did not observe a striking influence of either FOXO protein on the generation of neurons. Only mild effects on neuronal differentiation were uncovered that opposed each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B, 6D</xref>). Whereas interference with FOXO1 led to a small but significant increase in the number of neurons in untreated conditions, interference with FOXO3 led to a slight decrease in HuC/D-positive neurons after stimulation with TGFβ, indicating a mild differentiating effect of FOXO3. We concluded that FOXO1 and FOXO3 might have opposing effects on neuronal differentiation and that FOXO1 and FOXO3 have non-redundant functions, which were also revealed by differences in the transcriptional control of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and <italic>Foxg1</italic>.

<title>FOXG1 activates <italic>Kcnh3</italic> transcription</title>
<p>We further analyzed our microarray data to assess which genes other than <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> were regulated by FOXG1 in a context of active TGFβ-signaling. Comparison between expression profiles of TGFβ-treated Foxg1<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type E13.5 CPCs showed differential expression of many genes involved in a great variety of biological processes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Such processes spanned from neuronal differentiation to apoptosis, from cell migration and adhesion to angiogenesis. To identify genes that are regulated through a FOXG1/TGFβ crosstalk, we first analyzed the whole mouse genome by searching for gene promoters that contained both FOX (GTAAACAA) and SMAD4 (AGAC) DNA-binding sites using SiteSearch software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. For this genome-wide screen, we analyzed DNA regions 15 Kb upstream of all transcription start sites (TSS), and added the constraint that both FOX and SMAD4 binding sites must be located within 200 bp of each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The resulting gene list was compared with the microarray results and shortlisted candidates were validated through qRTPCR analysis. We used RNA from cerebral cortex of E13.5 Foxg1<sup>−/−</sup>, Tgfbr2 cKO and Tgfb2;Tgfb3 dKO mice, respectively. Many candidates were regulated in Foxg1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, confirming the microarray results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Out of all short-listed genes only <italic>Kcnh3</italic>, a gene encoding for a member of the <italic>ether-à-go-go</italic> family of voltage gated K<sup>+</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], was transcriptionally decreased in both Foxg1<sup>−/−</sup> and Tgfb2;Tgfb3 dKO. However, Tgfbr2 cKO mice did not reveal significant changes in the expression of <italic>Kcnh3</italic>. Thus, although FOX and SMAD4 DNA-binding sites were identified upstream of the <italic>Kcnh3</italic> TSS, the influence of TGFβ-signaling on <italic>Kcnh3</italic> expression was less compared to FOXG1. In contrast to its repressive function in <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription, FOXG1 activated <italic>Kcnh3</italic> transcription. We next assessed whether further members of the FOXG1/FOXO1/FOXO3/SMAD4 transcriptional network were also involved in <italic>Kcnh3</italic> expression. We used lentiviral shRNAs to interfere with the expression of individual members and combinations of them <italic>in vitro</italic>. Corroborating our <italic>in vivo</italic> results, <italic>Kcnh3</italic> was strongly decreased in all conditions of FOXG1-deficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Whereas FOXO1 was not involved in transcriptional regulation of <italic>Kcnh3</italic>, loss of FOXO3 impaired <italic>Kcnh3</italic> expression. Interference with SMAD4 did not significantly change <italic>Kcnh3</italic> expression, supporting our <italic>in vivo</italic> results that indicated no significant contribution of TGFBR2-mediated signaling to <italic>Kcnh3</italic> expression. We concluded that <italic>Kcnh3</italic> expression is increased by FOXG1 and FOXO3, but is independent of FOXO1 and TGFβ-signaling.</p>
<p>For a more detailed analysis of the <italic>Kcnh3</italic> promoter, we used the ConTra v2 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], which allows analyses of individual genes as compared to the genome-wide approach of SiteSearch. ConTra v2 matrix-based sequence analysis of conserved motifs was performed within the promoter region and in the 3′-UTR of <italic>Kcnh3.</italic> The promoter analysis was restricted to 1500 bp upstream of the TSS. Using this method, we identified the closely located and conserved FOX- and SMAD4-binding sites 1428-1397 bp upstream of the <italic>Kcnh3</italic> TSS (reference NM_010601.3). As our expression data did not reveal TGFβ-dependent transcription of <italic>Kcnh3</italic>, we also analyzed the <italic>Kcnh3</italic> gene locus for isolated FOX-binding sites independent of SMAD4-target sequences. We identified an additional conserved FOX target sequence in the 3′-UTR region 252-287 bp downstream of the termination codon of <italic>Kcnh3</italic>. The study by Seoane et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] did not report whether FOXG1 is localized at the chromatin of the <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> gene. Thus, we aimed to reveal whether FOXG1 is present at the putative binding sites in the <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and <italic>Kcnh3</italic> genes. We employed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of FOXG1 on chromatin isolated from dorsal telencephalic CPCs derived from E13.5 wild-type mice. Enrichment at the specific sites was compared to an intergenic region devoid of putative FOX protein DNA-binding sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). We revealed strong and significant enrichment of FOXG1 at the forkhead binding site in the <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> gene that is located near the SMAD4-binding sites 2287-2251 bp upstream of the TSS (reference NM_007669.4). Hence, <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> repression by FOXG1 probably includes its presence on the chromatin. We also detected significant enrichment of FOXG1 at the <italic>Kcnh3</italic> 3′-UTR site, whereas the enrichment at the upstream candidate sequence showed a trend but was not significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). We therefore concluded that FOXG1 exerts transcriptional activation or repression either directly or indirectly associated with the chromatin.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Seoane et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] established the FOXG1/FOXO/SMAD model of interacting proteins that are involved in controlling proliferation of neuroepithelial cells by acting on the <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> promoter. In the pathological case, this network is important in keeping glioblastoma cells in a proliferative state and in conferring escape from TGFβ-mediated cytostasis. We discovered that FOXG1 expression impaired not only FOXO/SMAD-mediated cell cycle exit, but also TGFβ-induced neuronal differentiation in a dose dependent manner at the developmental stage E13.5. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate that FOXO1 is an activator of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression from E11.5 onwards, and that it is probably assisted by SMAD4 from E13.5 onwards (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data do not indicate that TGFβ-signaling <italic>via</italic> TGFBR2 or the neural ligands TGFB2 and 3 are essential regulators of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> transcription. The reason might be that either FOXO1/SMAD4-mediated <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression is only transient during the period when a progenitor leaves the cell cycle and enters neuronal differentiation. Alternatively, as our <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate a robust SMAD4-dependent transcription of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>, SMAD-signals might be under control of alternative pathways, such as BMP or Activin. In addition, on the basis of our data we cannot rule out that other compensatory mechanisms, such as activation of TGFβ-signaling in neural cells by increased levels of TGFB1, might cloud our analyses of the full impact of TGFβ-signaling on <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The FOXG1/FOXO/SMAD network was further characterized in the context of differentiation of Cajal-Retzius neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Our data do not support the hypothesis that FOXG1 antagonizes a putative involvement of TGFβ-signals in the generation of CALB2-positive CR cells from the PSB, as we revealed similar expression of CALB2 in Foxg1-/Tgfbr2-double deficient mice compared to FOXG1-deficient mice. However, we cannot rule out that SMAD4-dependent transcriptional regulation might promote CR differentiation, and that activation of SMAD4 occurs in response to BMP or Activin signals, independent of TGFβ ligands and receptors. Our additions to the existing model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] show that the FOXG1/FOXO/SMAD transcriptional network acts in different complexes to confer different cellular responses depending on the developmental time point (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). In early developmental stages, such as E11.5, progenitors mainly proliferate. Under these conditions, IGF1-signaling secures the proliferating status by preventing FOXO1 translocation to the nucleus to drive <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]). At E13.5 most progenitors still divide, but neuronal differentiation becomes increasingly important, and both proliferation and differentiation coexist. Thus, with progressing development, the progenitors are exposed to signals that increase neuronal differentiation although a subset of progenitors has to maintain the capacity for mitosis. As our data suggest, differentiating signals include TGFβ. FOXG1-expressing progenitors stay in mitosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>) as FOXG1 associates with FOXO1 and SMAD complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], blocks transcription of <italic>Tgfβ, Foxo1, Foxo3,</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), binds to the <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) and hampers neuronal differentiation upon a TGFβ-stimulus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Loss of FOXG1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>) renders progenitors capable to express <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> through FOXO1 and SMAD4 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and to enter neuronal differentiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Along this line, Miyoshi and Fishell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] reported that transient downregulation of FOXG1 is needed in pyramidal neuron precursors to enter into the cortical plate. We show that FOXO1 and SMAD4 are strong candidates to drive the re-expression of <italic>Foxg1</italic> in differentiating pyramidal neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Our finding that FOXG1 increases expression of <italic>Kcnh3</italic> extends the view that FOXG1 has important functions in mature neurons beyond integration of pyramidal neurons into the cortical plate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D</xref>).</p>

<title>Developmental dynamics of the FOXG1/FOXO/SMAD4 network in the context of cortical progenitor proliferation and differentiation</title>
<p><bold>A.</bold> At E11.5 proliferation is dominant and expression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> through FOXO1 protein is prevented by IGF1-mediated activation of the AKT-signaling pathway that keeps FOXO1 in the cytoplasm due to phosphorylation. <bold>B.</bold> As development progresses, progenitors are exposed to increasing amounts of differentiating signals. To prevent exit from mitosis FOXG1 associates with FOXO1 and SMAD4 complexes at the <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> promoter and thereby FOXG1 prevents cell cycle exit. At the same time, FOXG1 represses the expression of <italic>Foxo1</italic>, <italic>Foxo3</italic> and <italic>Tgfβ</italic>. <bold>C.</bold> In differentiating progenitors, transient downregulation of FOXG1 allows differentiating signals such as TGFβ to drive neuronal differentiation, which follows FOXO1/SMAD4 mediated transcription of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>. To allow differentiated cells to integrate into the cortical plate, FOXO1/SMAD4 proteins drive <italic>Foxg1</italic> expression. <bold>D.</bold> FOXG1 binds to the 3′-UTR of <italic>Kcnh3</italic> and activates expression of <italic>Kcnh3</italic> in mature neurons. FOXO3 also drives <italic>Kcnh3</italic> expression.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-07-37436-g009"></graphic>
</fig>
<p>Our data show that FOXG1 acts antagonistic to FOXO1 but along the same line as FOXO3. This reflects first of all non-redundant functions of the FOXO proteins, as FOXG1 opposes FOXO1-mediated transcription of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> but drives <italic>Kcnh3</italic> expression, which we also observed for FOXO3. It is possible that the position of the FOX-binding site determines the transcriptional readout. If the binding site is present at the 5′ end it might be antagonistic (<italic>Cdkn1a</italic>), while presence at the 3′ end might be synergistic (<italic>Kcnh3</italic>). Our observation that FOXG1 increases <italic>Kcnh3</italic> expression may also bear clinical relevance, as knockout mice for <italic>Kcnh3</italic> show improved cognitive performance, enhanced spatial working memory and enhanced latent learning memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. In addition, <italic>Kcnh3</italic>-deficient mice show signs of persistent neuronal hyperexcitability including frequent interictal spiking and spontaneous seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Early-onset seizures are also a specific feature of the pathology of atypical Rett syndrome, which is caused by <italic>FOXG1</italic> haploinsufficiency in humans (FOXG1 syndrome, OMIM#164874) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that reduced expression of KCNH3 is involved in the pathology of the FOXG1-syndrome in humans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>These data show that the FOXG1/FOXO/SMAD transcription factor network balances proliferation and differentiation in cortical progenitors. Our data strongly suggest that the network is dynamically involved in the control of cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation. The network components are used differently while development progresses. <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression underlies IGF1-controlled interference of nuclear translocation of FOXO1 at E11.5, when neither TGFβ nor FOXG1 are strongly expressed. At later developmental stages <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression is prevented through FOXG1-mediated interference with FOXO1/SMAD4. FOXO1/SMAD4 complexes induce <italic>Foxg1</italic> expression, which makes them candidates for resuming FOXG1 expression in differentiating cortical neurons, which have left mitosis after transient downregulation of FOXG1. FOXG1 and FOXO3 are of relevance to control expression of the seizure-related <italic>Kcnh3.</italic> FOXG1-mediated expression of ion channels could be relevant to understand the pathology of the FOXG1 syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder.</p>

<title>Microarray data analysis</title>
<p>Intensity data were extracted using Agilent's Feature Extraction (FE) software (version 9.5.3.1) including a quality control based on internal controls using Agilent's protocol GE1107 Sep09. Microarray data analysis consists of the following steps: 1. between-array normalization, 2. global clustering and PCA-analysis, 3. fitting the data to a linear model, 4. detection of differential gene expression and 5. over-representation analysis of differentially expressed genes. To estimate the average group values for each gene and assess differential gene expression, a simple linear model was fitted to the data, and group-value averages and standard deviations for each gene were obtained. To find genes with significant expression changes between groups, empirical Bayes statistics were applied to the data by moderating the standard errors of the estimated values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. P-values were obtained from the moderated t-statistic and corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. For each gene, the null hypothesis, that there is no differential expression between degradation levels, was rejected when its false discovery rate was lower than 0.05. To find over-represented functions (as represented by Gene Ontology terms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], we used DAVID, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p>

<p>For ICC, cells plated on coverslips were fixed for 20 min with 4% PFA and permeabilized in acetone for 10 min at −20°C. Blocking was performed in 10% normal goat serum, 1% Triton X/PBS for 1 h at RT, followed by the incubation with primary antibodies in blocking solution at 4°C overnight. The incubation with secondary antibodies was carried out for 1 h at RT, followed by counterstaining with DAPI (1:1000) and mounting in Fluorescent Mounting Medium (DAKO). The following antibodies were used: Anti-HuC/D antibody #A-21271, 1:100 (Life Technologies), FOXO3 #47409, 1:500 (Abcam). All secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen.</p>
<p>Images were taken with Axioplan 2, Axio Imager M2 with or without ApoTome 2.0 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Positive cells were counted manually using ImageJ software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. For each condition, at least 947 total cells were counted.</p>

<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>The procedure was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] with some modifications. CPCs were fixed with 1% freshly prepared PFA (Roth) for 5 min at RT. The cross-link was stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in DNA lysis buffer (50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche). Chromatin was sheared within 30 high-energy cycles by the Bioruptor Next Gen System (Diagenode): 30 s on and 30 s off to achieve DNA fragment lengths between 200-600 bp. The chromatin concentration was quantified with the NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientfic), diluted in DNA dilution buffer (20 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche), bovine serum albumin in PBS (final concentration: 0.1%) and precleared using Protein A Dynabeads (Life Technologies) for 2 h at 4°C. Antibodies were bound to equilibrated Protein A Dynabeads for 2 h at 4°C. Precleared supernatants were then added to antibody-bound beads. For immunoprecipitation, 20-30 μg of chromatin were incubated either with antibody directed against FOXG1 (1 μg per 20 μg chromatin; #18529, Abcam) or rabbit IgG (1.3 μg per 20 μg chromatin; #C15410206, Diagenode) at 4°C overnight. Immunocomplexes were washed for 10 min once with buffer 1 (20 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS), buffer 2 (20 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS), buffer 3 (20 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate) and thrice with TE buffer (20 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA) at 4°C. DNA was extracted from beads in extraction buffer (1% SDS / 100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) by shaking at 1400 rpm at RT for 1 h. ChIP and input DNA samples were incubated with RNase A (Sigma) at 37°C for 30 min, followed by the Proteinase K (Roche) digestion at 65°C while shaking at 1400 rpm for 6 h during the removal of the cross-link. Purification of the ChIP and input DNA samples was done following the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit and PCR purification Kit (both Qiagen), respectively. All DNA samples were diluted accordingly, quantified fluorospectroscopically using the Quanti-iT-PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Reagent (Life Technologies) and the NanoDrop 3300 (Thermo-Scientific). To analyze the enrichment of the ChIP samples, a qPCR was performed. 20 to 320 pg of DNA was applied per reaction. Ct values of ChIP samples were normalized to Ct values of input to calculate enrichment (% input). Final results are shown as a ratio between FOXG1 enrichment at a specific site and its enrichment in a region devoid of FOX binding sites, which was used as a negative control.</p>

<title>Riboprobe synthesis and <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization</title>
<p>This experiment was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, PCR products using <italic>Kcnh3</italic> primers (forward: CAGCTTTATGGACCTCCACTTC; reverse: AGAGCCTGTGGATCTCTAGCC, Allen Brain Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]) were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. The cloning product was linearized through digestion with NcoI (sense probe) or SacI (antisense probe) and transcribed with SP6- or T7-RNA polymerases (Roche), respectively. Forebrain slices were hybridized with digoxigenin-labelled riboprobes in hybridization buffer (12.7 mM Tris base, 184.4 mM NaCl, 5.9 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 6.27 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5x Denhardt's solution, 1 mg/ml Yeast RNA, 10% Dextran sulfate, 50% v/v Formamide) at 68°C overnight. Sections were washed thrice in a solution containing 50% formamide, 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% saline sodium citrate at 68°C in a water bath. They were then transferred to an incubation chamber and washed twice with maleic acid buffer and Tween-20 (MABT) for 30 min at RT. After blocking in a MABT solution containing 20% lamb serum, sections were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:1500 in blocking solution; Roche) overnight at RT. After four washing steps in MABT (10 min, 3x 20 min) and three washing steps (7 min each) in pre-staining buffer, the reaction product was developed using NBT/BCIP solution diluted in pre-staining buffer (1:100; Roche) overnight at RT. Stained sections were washed 4 times in PBS and then embedded using Aquatex (Merck Millipore). Image acquisition was performed using an Axio Imager 2 microscope without apotome (Zeiss).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used for all qRTPCR experiments where mutant values were compared with their respective controls and, in general, when comparison was performed between two groups. One-way ANOVA with either Šidák's, Dunnet's or Tukey's post-test was used in experiments involving comparison among more than one group. Analysis of experiments involving cell infection with lentiviral shRNA constructs and ChIP was performed using One-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, where comparison was made between each value and the control value (set as 0). Values in bar charts are expressed as average ± SEM.</p>
