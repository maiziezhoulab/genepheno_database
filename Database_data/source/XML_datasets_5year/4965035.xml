<abstract>
<p>NMDA receptors have been widely reported to be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity through effects on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP and LTD have been implicated in learning and memory processes. Besides synaptic plasticity, it is known that the phenomenon of gamma oscillations is critical in cognitive functions. Synaptic plasticity has been widely studied, however it is still not clear, to what degree synaptic plasticity regulates the oscillations of neuronal networks. Two NMDA receptor antagonists, ketamine and memantine, have been shown to regulate LTP and LTD, to promote cognitive functions, and have even been reported to bring therapeutic effects in major depression and Alzheimerâs disease respectively. These compounds allow us to investigate the putative interrelationship between network oscillations and synaptic plasticity and to learn more about the mechanisms of their therapeutic effects. In the present study, we have identified that ketamine and memantine could inhibit LTD, without impairing LTP in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampus, which may underlie the mechanism of these drugsâ therapeutic effects. Our results suggest that NMDA-induced LTD caused a marked loss in the gamma power, and pretreatment with 10 Î¼M ketamine prevented the oscillatory loss via its inhibitory effect on LTD. Our study provides a new understanding of the role of NMDA receptors on hippocampal plasticity and oscillations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has long been considered to be closely linked with long-term synaptic plasticity, because of its properties of high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability and voltage-dependent activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref001">1</xref>]. In the rodent hippocampus, a brain structure closely associated with processes involved in learning and memory, it is known that some forms of LTP are dependent on NMDARs, and some forms of hippocampal dependent learning and memory can be impaired by NMDAR antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref002">2</xref>]. Besides LTP, synaptic activation of NMDARs also triggers the opposite form of synaptic plasticity, long-term depression (LTD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref003">3</xref>] and excitotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref004">4</xref>]. The critical role of NMDARs in synaptic plasticity, neuroprotection and excitotoxicity, has attracted extensive interest in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry to investigate the effects of NMDARs on some forms of both LTP and LTD, and their role in multiple cognition related diseases, including Alzheimerâs disease (AD).</p>
<p>It has been reported that several NMDAR antagonists have neuroprotective effects. One of them is memantine, which is widely <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.baidu.com/link?url=MhGnjRg5JixedgzH4a2Jl7kbamb-sh1l4wvlVQUsytJrIgjjJ_cwbUjlT0X3fKrL0iaMmsCRullwIjCVdu3RLylsd2fSLZgwF3IbXZuekX3&amp;wd=&amp;eqid=c2643f6d00012d6f00000004558cf548">prescribed</ext-link> for patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref005">5</xref>]. There is also evidence that suggests memantine has cognitive enhancing effects in other brain disorders, such as Downâs syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref006">6</xref>], Huntingtonâs disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref007">7</xref>], and autism spectrum disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref008">8</xref>]. Another interesting NMDAR antagonist is ketamine which has been recently revealed to have antidepressant effect in patients and animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref010">10</xref>]. This novel antidepressant effect of ketamine is supported by cellular mechanisms, such as increases in synaptic transmission, spine number, synaptic proteins and BDNF expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref012">12</xref>]. It is clear that some NMDAR antagonists have general neuroprotective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref013">13</xref>], however it is still controversial whether the concentration-dependent effects of NMDAR antagonists can be explained at the level of synaptic physiology. In order to answer this question, we studied whether ketamine and memantine have a bidirectional effect on hippocampal LTP and LTD at a series of concentrations.</p>
<p>Besides synaptic plasticity, the phenomenon of gamma oscillations plays an important role in learning and memory function. The rhythmic electrical activities of the brain are known as oscillations and are categorized as different types according to frequency bands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref014">14</xref>], the most ubiquitous of which are the gamma oscillations (30â90 Hz) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref015">15</xref>]. A broad consensus is that synchronization of interneuron activity entraining rhythmic inhibition to pyramidal cells, which results in synchronous fast fluctuations of membrane potential of pyramidal cells, leading to gamma oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref017">17</xref>]. It is believed that the precise timing of neuronal spiking is important for coding of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref018">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref020">20</xref>], which largely depends on the gamma oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref022">22</xref>]. EEG signals, as measures of brain activity reflecting macroscopic rhythmical electrical activities, are reported to be abnormal in AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref023">23</xref>]. Notably, reduced gamma oscillations of EEG have been observed in AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref025">25</xref>], and also in several AD animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref026">26</xref>]. In brain slice preparation, gamma oscillations can be induced by electrical stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref028">28</xref>] and by chemicals, including muscarinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref029">29</xref>] or kainate receptor agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref030">30</xref>]. Consistent with <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, impaired kainate induced gamma oscillations are found in hippocampal slices of AD mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref031">31</xref>]. Since both plasticity and oscillations are closely related with cognitive function, and gamma oscillations are believed to be regulated by excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref017">17</xref>], it is not surprising that there has been considerable evidence supporting the interaction between oscillations and long-term plasticity. Most studies investigated the impact of oscillations on synaptic plasticity and suggested that oscillatory status could influence synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref032">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref035">35</xref>], however it is still not clear how synaptic plasticity regulates the network oscillations.</p>
<p>To address these questions, we also investigated the effects of NMDAR antagonists on synaptic plasticity and gamma oscillations. Our results showed that at certain concentrations, both ketamine and memantine can selectively reduce LTD without affecting LTP. Surprisingly, certain concentrations of ketamine had no significant effect on the power of gamma oscillations, but could protect gamma oscillations by inhibiting hippocampal LTD.</p>

<title>Submerged chamber recordings</title>
<p>Field extracellular postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings were made using the Slicemaster multi-slice recording system (Scientifica UK Ltd). The system has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref037">37</xref>]. Recording electrodes were pulled with a Microelectrode Puller P-97 (Sutter Ins., USA), filled with ACSF, and had resistances in the range of 2â5 MÎ©. fEPSPs were recorded at <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> of CA1 region (150Î¼m from cell bodies layer) and evoked by platinum or tungsten bipolar electrodes placed at the Schaffer collaterals (300 Î¼m away from recording electrode). Testing stimulus was at 0.01667 Hz for all the experiments.</p>
<p>To record LTP, the chamber temperature was set at 32Â°C and the ACSF perfusion at 2 ml/min. Thirty minutes of baseline fEPSP were recorded with a testing stimulus intensity that elicited fEPSP amplitude at 40% of maximum. LTP was induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) consisting of a train of ten bursts of stimuli at 5 Hz with each burst composed of four pulses at 100 Hz, with the same intensity as the test stimulus for evoking fEPSPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref038">38</xref>].

<p>To record cLTD and oscillation sequentially, the recording temperature was set at 30Â°C and ACSF perfusion at 10 ml/min. Thirty minutes of baseline fEPSP were recorded with a testing stimulus intensity that elicited fEPSP amplitude at 60% of maximum. For LTD induction groups, 20 Î¼M NMDA was applied for 5 min. Testing stimulus was suspended during NMDA perfusion and resumed after 2 min of NMDA clearance.

The total gamma power was quantified as the area under the peak in the power spectra, between 15â80 Hz. Gamma frequency oscillations in mice have been reported to be of lower frequency than those seen in rats hence a low cut-off frequency of 15 Hz was used to measure area power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref031">31</xref>].

<title>1. Concentration-related effect of ketamine and memantine on hippocampal LTP</title>
<p>It is well known that NMDAR antagonists can inhibit LTP at certain concentrations. To test the concentration-related effect of ketamine and memantine on LTP, we perfused a range of concentrations of ketamine and memantine (1 Î¼M-30 Î¼M) on hippocampal slices. fEPSP was evoked by Schaffer Collateral stimulation and recorded at <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> of the CA1 region. A four-chamber Slicemaster system was used for the fEPSP recordings with successful rate of trials around 50â75%.</p>
<p>Hippocampal slices were treated with different concentrations of ketamine (1â30 Î¼M), that had been reported not to disturb CA3-CA1 basal synaptic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref042">42</xref>]. The compound was bath applied before the start of fEPSP recording and within the recording period. TBS induced stable LTP in the control group, 1 Î¼M ketamine group, and 10 Î¼M ketamine group. Only 30 Î¼M ketamine blocked LTP significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159192.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159192.g001">Fig 1B</xref> summarizes the change of fEPSP slope during the last 20 min for each group (control 151.1 Â± 4.7% of baseline, n = 14, N = 12; 1 Î¼M ketamine 141.0 Â± 12.5% n = 8, N = 7; 10 Î¼M ketamine 147.7 Â± 13.6% n = 8, N = 7; 30 Î¼M ketamine 109.4 Â± 3.9% n = 7, N = 7).

<title>2. Ketamine and memantine blocked hippocampal LTD</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of representative NMDAR antagonists on the counterpart of LTP, we also tested the effects of ketamine and memantine (1â10 Î¼M) on LTD. The concentration range chosen did not inhibit LTP in our previous results. Chemical LTD (cLTD) was induced by 3 min perfusion of 20 Î¼M NMDA to hippocampal slices. Transient NMDA perfusion induced a stable cLTD in CA1 of control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159192.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

It is likely that selectively blocking synaptic depression and maintaining normal synaptic potentiation could be beneficial for learning and memory at the synaptic level, since LTP deficits and enhancement of LTD are reported in AD pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref026">26</xref>] and also in the aging process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref047">47</xref>].</p>

<title>3. Ketamine affected CA3-CA1 coherence of gamma oscillations in mouse hippocampus</title>
<p>Besides synaptic plasticity, such as LTP and LTD, the oscillatory activity of neuronal networks of the brain is another important electrophysiological phenomenon, which is closely related with learning and memory. Since we have shown the specific effects of ketamine and memantine on LTP and LTD, it is intriguing to know whether either of these two NMDAR antagonists can also affect gamma oscillations, especially at the concentration range of 1â10 Î¼M. We tested the effects of different concentrations of ketamine on kainate-induced gamma oscillations in the CA3 and CA1 region of hippocampal slices in an interface recording system. In order to have better control quality, each concentration of a treatment group was compared with its own control group which was conducted on the same batch of animals. No significant difference was detected from all these groups, after 1â30 Î¼M ketamine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159192.g003">Fig 3A &amp; 3B</xref>). The normalized changes of total gamma oscillation power (15â80 Hz) with or without the 35 minute ketamine perfusion were: 1 Î¼M ketamine 1.069 Â± 0.045% n = 10, N = 4 related to its control group 1 Â± 0.031% n = 4, N = 2; 10 Î¼M ketamine 1.090 Â± 0.061% n = 9, N = 7 related to its control 1 Â± 0.065% n = 8, N = 6; 30 Î¼M ketamine 0.998 Â± 0.032% n = 14, N = 9 related to its control 1 Â± 0.043% n = 16, N = 10. There was no significant change of the peak frequencies of gamma oscillations in either CA3 or CA1 regions (data not shown). In summary, the experiments showed that 1â30 Î¼M ketamine did not affect the power and frequency of gamma oscillations induced by kainate within 30 min in hippocampal CA3 and CA1 regions.</p>

<p>Since ketamine did not affect the total power of gamma oscillations, next we examined whether ketamine affected the coherence of gamma oscillations between CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. Coherence of oscillations between different regions reflects how information transfer is coordinated across several neuronal networks, and it has been reported that the coherence of CA3-CA1 oscillations is correlated with cognitive activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref048">48</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159192.g003">Fig 3C</xref> presents the normalized coherence change for the different groups. 1 Î¼M ketamine did not affect CA3-CA1 coherence (control n = 4, N = 2; 1 Î¼M ketamine n = 9, N = 4). However, 10 Î¼M ketamine significantly increased coherence at 22.0â29.3Hz (22.0â26.9Hz p&lt;0.05; 29.3Hz p&lt;0.01) and 61â63.5Hz (p&lt;0.05) (control n = 8, N = 6; 10 Î¼M ketamine n = 9, N = 6). Surprisingly, 30 Î¼M ketamine significantly reduced coherence at 36.6â43.9Hz (36.6Hz p&lt;0.05; 39.1â41.5Hz p&lt;0.001; 43.9Hz p&lt;0.05) (control n = 16, N = 10; 30Î¼M ketamine n = 9, N = 6). Although ketamine did not affect the power of gamma oscillations, 10 Î¼M and 30 Î¼M ketamine had significant effects on CA3-CA1 gamma coherence.</p>

<title>4. Ketamine application prevented cLTD-induced loss of gamma oscillations</title>
<p>Ketamine (1â30 Î¼M) significantly modulated synaptic plasticity, however since it did not affect the total power of hippocampal gamma oscillations directly, we speculated whether ketamine could modulate gamma oscillations indirectly through its inhibitory effects on LTD.</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, we designed a new protocol to record both cLTD and gamma oscillations in the Slicemaster system since drug application efficiency is too low in the interface system to induce LTD by NMDA perfusion. We successfully induced cLTD (20 Î¼M NMDA perfusion for 5 min) and gamma oscillations (100 nM kainate) on the same hippocampal slices sequentially. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159192.g004">Fig 4A</xref> shows the time points of drug application and recording configurations of the LTD plus oscillation protocol. Twenty minutes after stable baseline recording, LTD was induced by 5 min perfusion of NMDA and then monitored for 30 min. Then 100 nM kainate was applied to induce gamma oscillations. For the ketamine groups, 1 Î¼M or 10 Î¼M ketamine was applied into bath ACSF before baseline recording and maintained through the whole experiment, including LTD phase and oscillation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159192.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). A control group was carried out with oscillations induced by kainate but the 20 Î¼M NMDA perfusion was replaced with normal ACSF.</p>

However, it might be possible that a longer application of ketamine would have affected gamma power. In order to exclude this possibility, we further tested the effects of 1 Î¼M and 10 Î¼M ketamine (&gt;1h treatment, with 0.0167Hz testing stimulation) on 100 nM kainate-induced gamma oscillations in the submerged slice chamber recording system. However longer ketamine application did not affect the power of gamma oscillations either (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159192.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our studies have demonstrated that two NMDAR antagonists, ketamine and memantine, within a concentration window of 1â10 Î¼M, block LTD selectively without impairing LTP. In addition, although ketamine does not affect kainate-induced hippocampal gamma oscillations directly, it can prevent the loss of gamma oscillations through occlusion of cLTD.</p>
<p>We have shown that 1â10 Î¼M ketamine and memantine inhibited LTD but did not affect LTP, while higher concentration of ketamine and memantine (30 Î¼M) significantly reduced LTP. Consistent with several previous studies, 1â10 Î¼M memantine did not impair LTP in rodent hippocampal slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref046">46</xref>]. However, current result of ketamine on LTP seems inconsistent with the recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref043">43</xref>], in which 10 Î¼M ketamine significantly reduced hippocampal LTP. This discrepancy could be explained by the species difference between rats and mice, or the different protocols for LTP induction. In these two published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref043">43</xref>] LTP was induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS), whereas in our experiments theta burst stimulation (TBS) was used to induce LTP. The effect of ketamine on LTP/LTD in our results is consistent with that observed by Izumi and Zorumski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref044">44</xref>], however the species and the methods of drug application were different between the two studies. We conclude that cLTD is more sensitive to the treatment of ketamine and memantine than LTP.</p>
<p>For ketamine, the anesthetic dose in mice is around 100 mg/kg and the corresponding maximal total serum concentration is around 30 Î¼g/ml which can be estimated as a serum concentration around 100 Î¼M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref049">49</xref>]. Thus, the concentrations of ketamine studied here are under the serum concentration used for anesthetization. Several studies have reported that low-doses of ketamine in mice (10 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg) have antidepressant-like effects and improve synaptic function by increasing the expression of BDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref012">12</xref>]. According to a previous study, corresponding maximal serum concentrations for 3â10 mg/kg ketamine is approximately 3â10 Î¼M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref049">49</xref>]. As a result, we chose a concentration window (1â30 Î¼M) covering 3â10 Î¼M for our <italic>in vitro</italic> study. It is interesting that this concentration range is close to our ketamine concentration window (1â10 Î¼M) that can selectively inhibit LTD over LTP. The therapeutic concentration for memantine is also critical according to previous work, and it is known that memantine at low micro molar concentrations has beneficial effects without significant side-effects in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref051">51</xref>]. It is reported that therapeutically relevant doses of memantine in dementia patients yielded CSF concentration of 0.2â0.3 Î¼M after 1â2 weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref052">52</xref>]. In another study conducted in rats, a continuous treatment of memantine yielded a steady-state brain extracellular fluid concentration of approximately 0.8 Î¼M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref053">53</xref>], and the same treatment regimen has been reported to show cognitive benefit in AD animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref054">54</xref>]. It seems that chronic exposure of a low concentration (&lt;1 Î¼M) of memantine has therapeutic effects. In a prior study with hippocampal slices, disruption of LTP induction by magnesium removal was restored by memantine at 1 Î¼M, whereas LTP was further disrupted by 30 Î¼M memantine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref055">55</xref>]. Based on this prior result, we were interested to see the effects of 1â30 Î¼M memantine on our LTP/LTD experiments. Several studies have reported biphasic effects of memantine on cognitive related electrophysiological and behavioral tests in rodents and the lower doses of memantine which have beneficial effects for cognition are within the concentration window that has the selectivity for LTD over LTP revealed in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref055">55</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref057">57</xref>]. This indicates that the inhibitory selectivity on LTD over LTP may be related to ketamineâs and memantineâs beneficial effects on neurons and cognition. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that LTD is enhanced and LTP is impaired in several AD animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>It is already known that acute application of ketamine can increase the power of gamma oscillations in rodents under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref058">58</xref>] and it has been reported that 100 Î¼M ketamine significantly increases gamma power induced by focal application of kainate in mouse prelimbic cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref059">59</xref>]. Previous studies have also shown that 10â200 Î¼M ketamine did not affect the frequency of gamma oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref060">60</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref062">62</xref>] in hippocampal slices. Thus, we were interested to know whether 1â10 Î¼M ketamine would affect gamma oscillations in mouse hippocampus. Our results showed that low concentrations of ketamine (1â30 Î¼M) did not affect power and frequency of kainate-induced gamma oscillations in both CA3 and CA1 of mouse hippocampal slices, however, 10 Î¼M and 30 Î¼M ketamine increased and reduced CA3-CA1 gamma coherence respectively. It is postulated that one of the functions of gamma oscillations is coupling neighboring or distant cortical regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref063">63</xref>] which is referred to as communication through coherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref065">65</xref>]. The coupling/decoupling of brain oscillations and oscillatory coherence are related with neural communication, information transfer between different brain regions, and also involved in several cognition related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref066">66</xref>]. An <italic>in vivo</italic> study has shown that CA3 and CA1 gamma coupling occurs during memory task performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref048">48</xref>]. Thus, it is interesting that we observed subtle but significant effects of ketamine on CA3-CA1 gamma coherence in our <italic>dual</italic> recording assay. The peak frequency of gamma oscillations in mice is lower than that in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref031">31</xref>], and also largely influenced by temperature (240Â°C, 17.1 Â± 0.4 Hz; 29Â°C, 23.8 Â± 0.5 Hz; 34Â°C, 34.6 Â± 0.7 Hz; 39Â°C, 47.7 Â± 1.1 Hz) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref067">67</xref>]. In our study the temperature for oscillation recording was 30â31Â°C, so the change in coherence between 22 to 29Hz represents the major part of gamma oscillations. Further studies on the coherence analysis from multiple hippocampal circuits will unveil the underlying mechanism. It is notable that only 10 Î¼M ketamine significantly increased gamma coherence around 30 Hz, selectively reduced LTD and also prevented gamma oscillation loss after cLTD.</p>
<p>The novel finding of our study is that cLTD dramatically reduced hippocampal gamma oscillations and 10 Î¼M ketamine could prevent this LTD-induced oscillatory loss. There already have been many studies focused on the relationship of oscillations and plasticity, and it is reported that the states of network oscillations regulate synaptic plasticity. We firstly observed that the loss of gamma oscillations is induced by the cLTD. Both NMDA-induced LTD and low frequency stimulation induced LTD are NMDAR dependent and widely used for synaptic physiology. Our pilot experiment showed the electrical low-frequency stimulation induced LTD was too small to differentiate drug effects, so we adopted NMDA-induced standard chemical LTD in current studies. Firstly, both synaptic plasticity and network oscillations are believed to be responsible for memory encoding at different levels, namely cellular level and network level. Our results support the association between the macroscopic phenomena of oscillations and the microscopic phenomena of synaptic plasticity. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are needed to confirm this impact of synaptic depression on network oscillations. Secondly, this result implies that abnormality of synaptic plasticity in pathological conditions or induced by drug application may be reflected at a network level, which encourages more analysis of EEG signals in AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0159192.ref068">68</xref>]. Lastly, our finding that ketamine can prevent gamma loss induced by cLTD suggests that other compounds may influence the network dynamics via their effects on synaptic strength or gamma coherence, which calls for more mechanism research on NMDAR antagonists in neural networks.</p>
