<abstract>
<p id="P1">A genetically informed cross-lagged model was applied to twin data to
explore etiological links between autistic-like traits and affective problems in
early childhood. The sample comprised 310 same-sex twin pairs (143 monozygotic
and 167 dizygotic; 53% male). Autistic-like traits and affective problems were
assessed at ages 2 and 3 using parent ratings. Both constructs were related
within and across age (<italic>r</italic> = .30−.53) and showed moderate
stability (<italic>r</italic> = .45−.54). Autistic-like traits and
affective problems showed genetic and environmental influences at both ages.
Whereas at age 2, the covariance between autistic-like traits and affective
problems was entirely due to environmental influences (shared and nonshared), at
age 3, genetic factors also contributed to the covariance between constructs.
The stability paths, but not the cross-lagged paths, were significant,
indicating that there is stability in both autistic-like traits and affective
problems but they do not mutually influence each other across age. Stability
effects were due to genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental influences.
Substantial novel genetic and nonshared environmental influences emerge at age 3
and suggest change in the etiology of these constructs over time. During early
childhood, autistic-like traits tend to occur alongside affective problems and
partly overlapping genetic and environmental influences explain this
association.</p>
