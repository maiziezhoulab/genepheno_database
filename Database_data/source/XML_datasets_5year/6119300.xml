<title>Abstract</title>
<sec id="s1">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Psychiatric disorders are associated with altered function of inhibitory neurotransmission within the limbic system, which may be due to the vulnerability of selective neuronal subtypes to challenging environmental conditions, such as stress. In this context, parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons, which are critically involved in processing complex cognitive tasks, are particularly vulnerable to stress exposure, an effect that may be the consequence of dysregulated redox mechanisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Adult Male Wistar rats were subjected to the chronic mild stress procedure for 7 weeks. After 2 weeks, both control and stress groups were further divided into matched subgroups to receive chronic administration of vehicle or lurasidone (3 mg/kg/d) for the subsequent 5 weeks. Using real-time RT-PCR and western blot, we investigated the expression of GABAergic interneuron markers and the levels of key mediators of the oxidative balance in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Chronic mild stress induced a specific decrease of parvalbumin expression in the dorsal hippocampus, an effect normalized by lurasidone treatment. Interestingly, the regulation of parvalbumin levels was correlated to the modulation of the antioxidant master regulator NRF2 and its chaperon protein KEAP1, which were also modulated by pharmacological intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that the susceptibility of parvalbumin neurons to stress may represent a key mechanism contributing to functional and structural impairments in specific brain regions relevant for psychiatric disorders. Moreover, we provide new insights on the mechanism of action of lurasidone, demonstrating that its chronic treatment normalizes chronic mild stress-induced parvalbumin alterations, possibly by potentiating antioxidant mechanisms, which may ameliorate specific functions that are deteriorated in psychiatric patients.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Our study provides evidence for an association between the stress-induced decrease of parvalbumin, a marker of GABAergic interneurons, and the alterations of key players of the oxidative balance. Of particular interest is the observation that chronic treatment with the antipsychotic drug lurasidone is able to normalize the decrease of parvalbumin in parallel with potential antioxidative effects on the NRF2-KEAP1 system as well as on the enzyme NOX2. Our data suggest a close relationship between the alterations of selected GABAergic interneurons and the redox balance that may represent an important mechanism through which lurasidone may ameliorate brain function in stress-related pathologic conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Psychiatric diseases, such as major depression and schizophrenia, are highly disabling disorders characterized by complex etiological mechanisms that lead to functional abnormalities of different neurotransmitters, including monoamines, GABA and glutamate, as well as a dysregulation of inflammation, neuroplasticity, and hormonal signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Kupfer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Calabrese et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Owen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">Begni et al., 2017</xref>). The multifaceted behavioral symptomatology of these disorders involves the perturbation of emotional and cognitive domains of the individual and, among the others, cognitive symptoms have a dramatic impact on the everyday life of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">Millan et al., 2012</xref>). In this context, at the cortical and hippocampal levels, the GABAergic inhibitory tone finely regulates the firing of principal glutamatergic neurons. In more detail, GABAergic interneurons synchronize the firing of principal cells controlling the plasticity of excitatory synaptic inputs through dendritic inhibition, while they inhibit the output with perisomatic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Freund, 2003</xref>). Among the diverse subtypes of GABAergic interneurons populating the hippocampal formation, parvalbumin (PVB), somatostatin (SST), calbindin (CALB), and neuropeptide-Y (NPY) positive cells represent the most sensitive to stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Filipovic et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Czeh et al. 2015</xref>). Specifically, the highly energized, fast-spiking, PVB positive (PVB+) interneurons play a pivotal role in the processing of complex information. Their contribution in cognitive decline may be fundamental, especially when dysregulation of the energy demand and/or of the oxidative balance may impair their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Kann, 2016</xref>). This may occur following exposure to stress, which represents a major environmental condition for mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">Pittenger and Duman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Cattaneo and Riva, 2016</xref>). Indeed, PVB+ neurons can be part of a critical loop since, while stress may lead to an impairment of this neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0050">Zaletel et al., 2016</xref>), the suppressed function of PVB+ neurons may reduce resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">Perova et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present work we used the chronic mild stress (CMS) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0048">Willner, 2017</xref>) to investigate the detrimental effects of stress on PVB+ cells in rat hippocampus and the potential contribution of a dysregulation in redox mechanisms, which have also been associated with the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Moniczewski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">Smaga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Steullet et al., 2017</xref>). We have previously shown that CMS is able to induce depressive-like behaviors such as anhedonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">Rossetti et al., 2016</xref>) as well as cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Calabrese et al., 2017</xref>), which are associated with alterations in key molecular players for psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Luoni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Calabrese et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">Molteni et al., 2016</xref>). We also investigated the effect of a chronic treatment with lurasidone in counteracting the CMS-induced alterations in rat hippocampus. Lurasidone is a multi-receptor antipsychotic drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">Tarazi and Riva, 2013</xref>) with demonstrated clinical efficacy for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>) and in bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">Yatham et al., 2017</xref>) and depressive symptoms in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Nasrallah et al., 2015</xref>) and in bipolar depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">Loebel et al., 2014</xref>). We previously demonstrated that chronic lurasidone is able to normalize the stress-induced depressive-like behaviors as well as the neuroplastic and inflammatory alterations observed in stressed rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Luoni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">Rossetti et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s8">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Adult male Wistar rats (Charles River) were brought into the laboratory 1 month before the start of the experiment. Except as described below, the animals were singly housed with food and water freely available and were maintained on a 12-h- light/-dark cycle in a constant temperature (22Â±2Â°C) and humidity (50Â±5%) conditions. All procedures used in this study conform to the rules and principles of the 2010/63/EU Directive and were approved by the Local Bioethical Committee at the Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow, Poland. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used (n=10 each experimental group).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9">
<title>CMS Procedure and Pharmacological Treatment</title>
<p>After a period of adaptation to laboratory and housing conditions, the animals (220Â±7 g) were subjected to 7 weeks of CMS in parallel with a 5-week-long treatment with lurasidone.</p>
<p>The stress regimen consisted of 2 periods of food or water deprivation, 2 periods of 45Â° cage tilt, 2 periods of intermittent illumination (lights on and off every 2 h), 2 periods of soiled cage (250 mL water in sawdust bedding), one period of paired housing, 2 periods of low intensity stroboscopic illumination (150 flashes/min), and 3 periods of no stress. All stressors were 10 to 14 hours of duration and were applied individually and continuously, day and night. Control animals were housed in separate rooms and had no contact with the stressed animals. They were deprived of food and water for 14 hours preceding each sucrose test, but otherwise food and water were freely available in the home cage.</p>
<p>Animals were subjected to the stress procedure for 7 weeks. Following the first 2 weeks of stress, both control and stress groups were further divided into matched subgroups, and for the subsequent 5 weeks they received oral administration (by gavage) of vehicle (hydroxy-ethyl-cellulose 1%) or lurasidone (3 mg/kg daily). Our experimental design included 4 groups of animals: unstressed rats that received the vehicle, used as reference control group (âNo Stress/Vehicleâ, n=10); unstressed rats that received the drug (No Stress/Lurasidone, n=10); stressed rats that received the vehicle (Stress/Vehicle, n=10); and stressed rats that received the drug (Stress/Lurasidone, n=10). After 5 weeks, the treatments were terminated, and all control and stressed animals were killed by decapitation 24 hours after the last drug administration. The brains were removed and dissected for prefrontal cortex, dorsal, and ventral hippocampus as fresh tissues. All samples were then rapidly frozen in dry ice/isopentane and stored at â80Â°C for further molecular analyses.</p>

<p>Specifically, RNA aliquots of each sample were treated with DNase to avoid DNA contamination and then analyzed by TaqMan qRT-PCR instrument (CFX384 real-time system, Bio-Rad Laboratories) using the iScript one-step RT-PCR kit for probes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The samples were run in 384-well formats in triplicate as multiplexed reactions with a normalizing internal control (Î²-Actin).</p>
<p>Thermal cycling was initiated with an incubation at 50Â°C for 10 minutes (RNA retro-transcription) and then at 95Â°C for 5 minutes (TaqMan polymerase activation). After this initial step, 39 cycles of PCR were performed. Each PCR cycle consisted of heating the samples at 95Â°C for 10 seconds to enable the melting process and then for 30 seconds at 60Â°C for the annealing and extension reaction. A comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method was used to calculate the relative target gene expression vs the control group. Specifically, fold change for each target gene relative to Î²-actin was determined by the 2-â(âCT) method, where âCT=CT(target)-CT(Î²-actin); â(âCT)=âCT(exp. group)-âCT(control group); CT is the threshold cycle. For graphical clarity, the obtained data were then expressed as percentage vs control group, which has been set at 100%.</p>

<title>Protein Extraction and Western-Blot Analyses</title>
<p>Brain samples were manually homogenized using a glass-glass potter in a pH 7.4 cold buffer (containing 0.32 M sucrose, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM HEPES solution, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in presence of a complete set of proteases [Roche] and phosphatase [Sigma-Aldrich] inhibitors) and then sonicated for 10 seconds at a maximum power of 10% to 15% (Bandelin Sonoplus). The homogenate was clarified (1000 g; 10 minutes), obtaining a pellet (P1) enriched in nuclear components, which was resuspended in a buffer (1 mM HEPES, 0.1mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EGTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The supernatant (S1) was then centrifuged (13000g; 15 minutes) to obtain a clarified fraction of cytosolic proteins (S2). The pellet (P2), corresponding to the crude membrane fraction, was resuspended in the same buffer used for the nuclear fraction. Total protein content was measured according to the Bradford Protein Assay procedure (Bio-Rad Laboratories), using bovine serum albumin as calibration standard.</p>
<p>Protein analyses were performed in the whole homogenate (for PVB), in the cytosolic fraction (for NRF2 and KEAP1), and in the crude membrane fraction (for NOX2). Equal amounts of protein (10 Î¼g for the homogenate, 30 Î¼g for the S2, and 15 Î¼g for the P2) were run under reducing conditions on polyacrylamide gels and then electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk; then the membranes were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies and for 1 hour at room temperature with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Immunocomplexes were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL Star (Euroclone), ECL Plus (Euroclone), or ECL Clarity (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Results were standardized using Î²-actin as the internal control, which was detected by evaluating the band density at 43 kDa. Protein levels were calculated by measuring the optical density of the immunocomplexes using chemiluminescence (Chemidoc MP Imaging System, Bio-Rad Laboratories). To ensure that autoradiographic bands would be in the linear range of intensity, different exposure times were used.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>The effects of drug treatment (lurasidone) and chronic stress exposure on the mRNA or protein levels of our molecular targets were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA followed, when appropriate, by Fisherâs Least Significant Difference (LSD) posthoc comparisons. In addition, to evaluate the association between the modulation of the NRF2-KEAP1 system and the protein levels of PVB, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) were calculated between NRF2 or KEAP1 protein and PVB levels. Significance for all tests was assumed for <italic>P&lt;</italic>.05. Data are presented as meansÂ±SEM. SPSS (Release 24.0.0.0) was used to perform the statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Analysis of the mRNA Levels for Different Subtypes of GABAergic Interneurons in Rats Exposed to CMS and Treated with Lurasidone</title>
<p>We first investigated the mRNA levels of the GABAergic markers <italic>Pvb</italic>, <italic>Sst</italic>, <italic>Npy</italic>, and <italic>Calb</italic> in the dorsal (D-HIP) and ventral (V-HIP) hippocampus of animals exposed to CMS and treated, or not, with the antipsychotic drug lurasidone.</p>
<p>The analysis of <italic>Pvb</italic> gene expression in the D-HIP showed a significant interaction between CMS and lurasidone treatment (F<sub>3,32</sub>=11.755, <italic>P&lt;</italic>.01).

<title>Analysis of NADPH Oxidase-2 Gene and Protein Expression in the Dorsal Hippocampus of Animals Exposed to CMS and Treated with Lurasidone</title>
<p>PVB neurons show a sustained firing activity that requires a high demand of energy, which may expose them to an increased susceptibility toward the detrimental effects of oxidative stress. On these bases, we investigated if the effects of CMS exposure in D-HIP could be associated with alterations of molecules involved in the complex machinery regulating the oxidative balance in the brain. We analyzed the gene expression of <italic>Nox2</italic>, an enzyme responsible for the production of reactive oxygen species by activated macrophages, including microglia.

<title>Analysis of the NRF2-KEAP1 Antioxidant System in the Dorsal Hippocampus of Animals Exposed to CMS and Treated with Lurasidone</title>
<p>The NRF2 and the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) have a pivotal role in the control of the cellular antioxidant response. Indeed, upon nuclear translocation NRF2 binds to its consensus sequences (the so-called antioxidant responsive elements) to promote the transcription of several enzymes involved in the cellular mechanisms of detoxification. The transcription factor interacts in the cytosol with KEAP1, a chaperon protein that prevents its translocation into the nucleus, thus inhibiting its transcriptional antioxidant activity.</p>
<p>When considering the expression of the transcription factor <italic>Nrf2</italic>, we found a statistically significant interaction between CMS and lurasidone treatment (F<sub>3,36</sub>=11.616, <italic>P&lt;</italic>.01). Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, while CMS exposure produced a slight, non-significant decrease of the transcription factor (-11% vs No Stress/Vehicle, <italic>P&gt;</italic>0.05), lurasidone was able to increase its mRNA levels only when administered to CMS animals (+24% vs Stress/Vehicle, <italic>P&lt;</italic>.01).

Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, the protein levels of NRF2 were decreased by CMS (-40% vs No Stress/Vehicle, <italic>P&lt;</italic>.05), an effect that was, at least in part, restored by lurasidone treatment considering that the levels of NRF2 protein in Stress/Lurasidone group did not differ from sham rats.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years the interest in GABAergic interneurons has gained much attention due to their key role in functions that are altered in different psychiatric disorders, including major depression and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">Luscher and Fuchs, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Owen et al., 2016</xref>). Within this context, our data point out that the restorative effect of pharmacological treatment on PVB expression may be mediated by the drug-mediated regulation of the oxidative balance within the brain.</p>
<p>Most PVB-expressing cells are present in the central nervous system as interneurons, particularly within selected brain structures, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0050">Zaletel et al., 2016</xref>). In the hippocampus, a critical brain area involved in the control of emotional states, stress response, and cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>), PVB+ cells are mostly fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons that control the circuitry activity of pyramidal cells through their inhibitory activity. The reduction of PVB expression found in the D-HIP of CMS exposed rats is in line with the detrimental effects of stress or other adverse manipulations on the GABAergic system reported in other preclinical studies. For example, Czeh and collaborators have shown that 5 weeks of psychosocial stress were able to impair PVB expression in specific subregions of treeshrew hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Czeh et al., 2005</xref>). Similar results were obtained with other stress paradigms in rats, such as chronic immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Hu et al., 2010</xref>) and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">FilipoviÄ et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, in our experimental setting, the D-HIP appears to be more vulnerable to the impact of CMS, an effect that is in line with the results of Czeh and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">CzÃ©h et al., 2015</xref>). Considering that functional alterations of this hippocampal subregion have a major role in cognitive dysfunctions, we hypothesize that reduced PVB expression may contribute to the impaired cognitive function we have recently shown in rats exposed to the CMS paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Calabrese et al., 2017</xref>). It is likely that the expression of PVB may be due to a decrease of protein expression instead of to cell loss. Indeed, as demonstrated by others, chronic stress exposure does not increase caspase-3 expression in GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">FilipoviÄ et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, we found a strong induction of SST expression in the D-HIP following stress exposure. In both hippocampus and neocortex, PVB+ interneurons target the soma and the perisomatic dendrites of pyramidal neurons, controlling the output signaling of principal excitatory neurons. In parallel, SST interneurons generally target the more distal dendrites, gating the excitatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">Horn and Nicoll, 2018</xref>). Moreover, the activity of PVB and SST interneurons is strictly interconnected as part of complex inhibitory microcircuits involved in the control of behavior and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Caroni, 2015</xref>). Considering that SST decrease has been causally related to anxiety/depression-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Lin and Sibille, 2015</xref>), our result may seem counterintuitive. However, the increased expression of SST may represent a compensatory mechanism to limit the impaired somato-dendritic inhibition of pyramidal neurons after CMS-induced PVB loss. In parallel, the increase of SST observed after lurasidone treatment may be related to a specific mechanism induced by the drug, which is independent from the model analyzed. Indeed, we have previously shown a similar effect in serotonin transporter knockout rats treated with lurasidone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">Luoni et al., 2013</xref>). In this sense, further functional studies are needed to better clarify the impact of pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs on these interneuron populations.</p>
<p>The opposite effects of CMS on these two markers may also explain why the protein levels of the glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 were not modulated by stress exposure in the D-HIP (data not shown). Indeed, we may speculate that in our experimental setting this enzyme is differentially modulated in the diverse interneuron subpopulations.</p>
<p>While the precise detrimental mechanisms triggered by stress exposure on PVB interneurons are not well clarified, the selective vulnerability of PVB+ interneurons to chronic stress may be due to their peculiar fast spiking activity. The firing of PVB interneurons requires a high amount of energy, and the increased metabolic activity under certain conditions, such as stress, may expose PVB neurons to potentially toxic effects of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which alter the redox balance of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Kann, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In this respect, the NOX family represents a very important group of enzymes that, especially in the injured nervous system, is a major source of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Cooney et al., 2013</xref>). The upregulation of NOX2 expression after stress suggests an increase of the prooxidative activity in rats exposed to CMS. Increased levels of NOX2 have also been observed in brain areas of animals exposed to prolonged social isolation from weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">Schiavone et al. 2009</xref>) as well as in a model of posttraumatic stress disorder, where NOX2 upregulation was paralleled by a decrease of PVB expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Considering that NOX2 has been reported as the primary phagocytic oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">Bermudez et al., 2016</xref>), its altered expression may be associated with the increased activity of microglial cells under stressful conditions. In parallel, the production of prooxidative agents from NOX2 induces the activation of microglia, triggering a detrimental inflammatory loop, potentially harmful for neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">Vilhardt et al., 2017</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by previous data from our laboratory showing increased expression of hippocampal CD11b, a marker of microglia activation, in animals exposed to 7 weeks of CMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">Rossetti et al., 2016</xref>). Although in the present study we measured the levels of gp190<sup>PHOX</sup>, the principal membrane subunit of NOX2 enzyme, without evaluating other subunits of the enzymatic complex, we believe that the expression of the fundamental enzymatic subunit may reflect an increased response of the prooxidative system within the hippocampus. The detrimental effects of oxidative stress on PVB expression observed in response to CMS may also be the result of a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent extragenomic mechanism, which may affect the firing activity of these interneurons. Indeed, it has been proposed that the activation of membrane bound GR may induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a small neurotransmitter responsible of the activation of PVB positive interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). The sustained activation of GR during chronic stressful condition may decrease PVB expression by sensitizing interneuron activation and, possibly, through a toxic effect due to NO release. Indeed, NO may be converted in different reactive nitrogen species, thus leading to oxidative damage of proteins, lipids, and DNA that are able to alter neuronal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Moniczewski et al., 2015</xref>). We also showed that prolonged stress exposure alters the NRF2-KEAP-antioxidant responsive element system, a master regulator of the antioxidative response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">Sandberg et al., 2014</xref>), with a decrease of NRF2 expression that may impair the activation of antioxidant mechanisms. Our results are in line with previous studies showing the negative effects of stress on NRF2. For example, a decreased expression of NRF2, with a parallel increase of oxidative stress, was found in social defeat-vulnerable animals exposed to chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Bouvier et al., 2017</xref>) as well as in rats exposed to 4 weeks of chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">Omar and Tash, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Chronic treatment with lurasidone, an antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression, was able to normalize CMS-induced decrease of PVB expression in D-HIP. In this sense, other studies support the idea that antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Filipovic et al., 2017</xref>) and risperidone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">Piontkewitz et al., 2012</xref>), may regulate the function of GABAergic interneurons through the modulation of specific markers. While these drugs share high affinity for 5-HT7 receptors, it is difficult to ascertain if this is the unique mechanism through which these agents modulate GABAergic function, considering the vast heterogeneity in their receptor profiles. Indeed, we believe that the observed effects represent adaptive mechanisms following prolonged drug administration regulating complex neuronal circuits that will eventually lead to changes in selective GABAergic subtypes. Lastly, the effect of lurasidone closely resembles what we have recently observed in the hippocampus of adult mice exposed to prenatal immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">Luoni et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the peculiar receptor profile of lurasidone, it is difficult to enlighten a molecular mechanism responsible for the effects of the pharmacological treatment on GABAergic interneurons. Our results, however, suggest that the ability of lurasidone to modulate the oxidative stress balance may be part of its restorative effect. Indeed, chronic lurasidone treatment was able to induce the gene expression of NRF2 only in stressed animals, suggesting an antioxidative effect of the pharmacological treatment only under adverse conditions. The positive effect of lurasidone was also found at the translational level, since the CMS-induced decrease of NRF2 was partially normalized in animals treated with the antipsychotic drug. Interestingly lurasidone is also able to regulate KEAP1, a chaperone protein that segregates NRF2 into the cytosol and promotes its proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">Sandberg et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, while KEAP1 protein levels in the cytosolic fraction were not altered by CMS exposure, we found that lurasidone treatment was able to reduce its levels, suggesting that the drug not only increases the expression of NRF2 but may also promote its activity through a negative modulation of KEAP1.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that, in addition to synaptic and neuroplastic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">Tarazi and Riva, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Luoni et al., 2014</xref>), lurasidone is able to modulate the brain oxidative balance, which may contribute to its therapeutic effects and eventually enhance neuronal resiliency. Interestingly, similar mechanisms have also been described for other psychotropic drugs, including antidepressants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">MartÃ­n-HernÃ¡ndez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">Omar and Tash, 2017</xref>) and antipsychotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">MacDowell et al., 2016</xref>). It is interesting to note that the modulation of NRF2 and KEAP1 showed a significant Pearson correlation (positive and negative, respectively) with PVB protein levels, providing further support to the notion that the alterations of the GABAergic system following CMS exposure may be causally linked to a dysregulation of the oxidative balance in the D-HIP. In addition, the pharmacological treatment with lurasidone was able to induce the expression of key antioxidant enzymes related to NRF2 transcriptional activity. The specific increased levels of <italic>Nqo1</italic> and <italic>Catalase</italic> support the idea of an antioxidative activity of the drug. This is in line with previously published data showing that, although stress exposure did not impair the transcription of antioxidant enzyme, the administration of an atypical antipsychotic increased antioxidant response in stressed animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">MacDowell et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the susceptibility of PVB neurons to stress may represent a key mechanism contributing to functional and structural deterioration in specific brain regions, such as the D-HIP, associated with psychiatric illness. The ability to counteract PVB alterations, for example with antioxidants/redox regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">Steullet et al., 2017</xref>), or to promote the activity of PVB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) may represent a novel and important strategy to promote resilience. In this respect, our data provide new insights on the mechanism of action of lurasidone in the context of stress-related hippocampal dysfunction, suggesting that its pharmacological profile, which can improve neuronal/synaptic plasticity in hippocampus and cortex through both protective (antioxidant) and functional (BDNF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Luoni et al., 2014</xref>) mechanisms, should support clinical efficacy reported in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.</p>
