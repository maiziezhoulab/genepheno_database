<title>Purpose</title>
<p id="Par1">To identify the economic impact of pediatric patients with clinical
indications of genetic disease (GD) on the US health-care system.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="Par2">Using the 2012 Kids’ Inpatient Database, we identified pediatric
inpatient discharges with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes linked to genetic disease,
including well-established genetic disorders, neurological diseases, birth
defects, and other physiological or functional abnormalities with a genetic
basis. Cohort characteristics and health-care utilization measures were
analyzed. Discharges with a GD-associated primary diagnosis were used to
estimate the minimum burden; discharges with GD-associated primary <italic>or</italic> secondary codes established the maximum
burden.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par3">Of 5.85 million weighted discharges, 2.6–14% included GD-associated
ICD-9-CM codes. For these discharges, mean total costs were $16,000–77,000
higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) in neonates and
$12,000–17,000 higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) in
pediatric patients compared with background, corresponding to significantly
higher total charges and lengths of stay. Aggregate total charges for suspected
GD accounted for $14 to $57 billion (11–46%) of the “national bill” for
pediatric patients in 2012.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="Par5">Standard diagnostic approaches to suspected genetic disease (GD) include
examination for distinctive clinical finding patterns, followed by narrowly selected
molecular tests, to arrive at a precision diagnosis. For example, microarrays have
traditionally been utilized for patients with birth defects and neurological
disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and single-gene testing is often implemented
for high penetrance Mendelian conditions. Both approaches are limited, however, when
a patient presents with ambiguous signs and symptoms, and may have one of
approximately 5000 conditions for which a disease gene has been
identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> This can lead to long and costly diagnostic
odysseys in which these patients remain undiagnosed for several years.</p>
<p id="Par6">The overall health-care utilization of patients with a possible GD in
the United States has not yet been comprehensively assessed, limiting our
understanding of the potential impact of new technologies, including genome and
exome sequencing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> as aids to earlier diagnosis. Several
barriers, including clinical heterogeneity, incomplete utilization of genetic
testing, inconsistent coding practices, and general lack of physician awareness or
expertise, make it difficult to capture the incidence and burden of pediatric
genetic disease. As a surrogate to identify a study population of patients likely to
include most patients with GD, we have used the presence of clinical diagnoses that
are typical indications for use for standard genetic tests. These descriptive
diagnoses include morphological, physiological, and functional abnormalities that
while themselves are not pathognomonic for a genetic diagnosis, are sufficiently
uncommon or specific to constitute a reasonable indication for genetic
testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (also see Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Investigation of these patients’ health-care utilization
shows that they require disproportionate resources for their care and highlights the
potential for earlier molecular diagnosis to relieve some of the economic burden
through reduction in iterative diagnostic approaches and improved targeted
interventions.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="Sec3">
<title>Data source</title>
<p id="Par7">We utilized the 2012 version of the Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID),
developed by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), sponsored by
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). KID is a nationally
representative sample and the largest comprehensive, all-payer database for
children in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> KID represents a stratified sampling of
HCUP’s State Inpatient Databases, with random sampling of 10% of uncomplicated
(healthy) live births and 80% of complicated in-hospital births and other
pediatric discharges (age 0 to 20 years).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Similar to other HCUP
national databases, KID data was weighted to produce national and regional
estimates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> Weighted estimates of discharge counts are
shown in all result tables and figures. KID is released triennially, and the
2012 version was sampled from over 4000 US community, nonrehabilitation
hospitals with pediatric discharges in 46 HCUP member
states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Patients less than 18 years of age at time
of admission in 2012, represented by over 5 million weighted inpatient
discharges, were selected for analysis. Diagnoses and procedures were coded
using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM). Research is exempt from Human Subjects Research under
OHRP 45 CFR 46.101(b)(2) from all 45 CFR part 46 requirements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Study population</title>
<p id="Par8">We aimed to identify discharges in which the clinical diagnoses are
acceptable indications for use of genetic testing. An expert medical geneticist
compiled a list of 919 ICD-9-CM codes (October 2011), which enabled
identification of codes definitely indicative of a genetic disorder (e.g.,
cystic fibrosis or specific inborn errors of metabolism), likely to be caused by
a genetic disorder (i.e., a genetic diagnosis is likely to be achieved with
appropriate genetic testing in &gt;50% of discharges with these codes; e.g.,
neonatal intractable epilepsy), or possibly associated with a genetic disorder
(i.e., &gt;10% of discharges will yield a genetic diagnosis with appropriate
testing, including most severe birth defects, such as congenital central nervous
system [CNS] and cardiac malformations). These ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes
(Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref>) represent
morphological, physiological, or functional diagnoses that could be used to
support a medical decision to undertake genetic testing, and represent a patient
population that encompasses those with rare, undiagnosed, or genetic
disease.</p>
<p id="Par9">Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S3</xref> shows the results
of a primary literature search supporting the compilation of these codes. Each
ICD-9-CM diagnostic code description in Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref> was parsed to remove nonalphanumeric characters and
queried against the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and the
OMIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> GeneMap application programming interface
(API). OMIM GeneMap and HPO query results were parsed to identify disease names
and gene/locus symbols. The resulting ICD-9-CM description, gene/locus symbols,
and disease name were queried against a Google custom search engine (CSE) API
focused to academic literature using PubMed-listed uniform resource locators
(URLs). Google CSE query results were parsed to identify academic publication
titles, URLs, and PubMed IDs (PMIDs) that matched the specified query. A medical
geneticist manually reviewed the results. While not comprehensive, the
literature review (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S3</xref>) shows
that the codes in Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref> can
reasonably serve as correlates of genetic disorders for the purpose of this
analysis and that their presence is positively associated with genetic
diagnoses. Codes were also categorized into 13 ICD-9-CM disease categories for
aggregation and analysis, as shown in Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref>.</p>
<p id="Par10">The maximum number of diagnoses and procedures recorded for each
inpatient discharge varies by HCUP member state, but up to 15 diagnoses and 15
procedures were included per discharge in the KID data set and coded in
ICD-9-CM. In the HCUP data, the first diagnosis is considered the primary
diagnosis, and all other ICD-9-CM codes are considered secondary. Using the 919
ICD-9-CM codes, we identified two sets of criteria by which to define the
prevalence range. To establish the upper bound of possible GD discharges, we
defined the maximum number of discharges of patients with suspected GD as those
for which <italic>any diagnosis</italic> (up to 15 diagnoses
per discharge) was included in the list of 919 codes. For a conservative
minimum, discharges with a <italic>primary</italic> diagnosis
in the set of ICD-9-CM codes were selected. In HCUP and other claims data sets,
the first listed diagnosis is commonly defined as the condition to be chiefly
responsible for inpatient admission and care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> To account for variability in coding
practice and discharges for newborns, in which “live birth” is often coded
first, we considered any diagnosis in our maximum definition, as has been done
in similar studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> In addition, we required that the ICD-9-CM
diagnosis be a clinical indication for genetic testing given the age at
discharge. Specifically, an age cutoff was applied based on estimates of genetic
test diagnostic yield for a given ICD-9-CM in neonates versus the remaining
pediatric population (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref>). For
example, a diagnosis code indicating scoliosis would only be considered
suspected GD if observed in a neonate, but not in an adolescent. For each
definition, we consider the background population as those patients represented
by discharges with no ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes in the list.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p id="Par11">Descriptive statistics, including counts, means, and standard
errors, of the weighted national estimates, were used to characterize the
cohort. Demographic variables were defined by HCUP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Due to the sampled
nature of the database, reported numbers are based on discharge weights and
represent national estimates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> Analysis units are inpatient discharges,
not individual patients. Year of service was 2012, and all discharges were
analyzed independently. It is not possible to link multiple discharges to a
single patient because records do not include patient identifiers. Total charges
per discharge represent the amount billed for services by individual hospitals,
exclusive of professional (physician) fees, but do not reflect actual cost of
hospital services. Total charges per discharge were converted to costs using
HCUP cost-to-charge ratios.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> These costs reflect actual expenses of
hospital services, such as wages, supplies, and utility costs, specific to each
HCUP hospital. All charges and costs are shown in 2012 US dollars.</p>
<p id="Par12">Two-sided tests (chi-square and Fisher’s exact for categorical
measures, and Student’s <italic>t</italic> tests for
continuous measures) were used where appropriate with <italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.05 considered to be statistically significant
between groups. Calculations were performed separately for neonates (up to 28
days old, nonmaternal discharges) and the remaining pediatric population (29
days to less than 18 years of age at time of admission).</p>
<p id="Par13">To account for confounding variables, e.g., region or payer type,
we employed a propensity score method to compare health-care utilization
metrics, accounting for systematic differences in baseline characteristics in
subgroups,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> as utilized by other studies of KID
data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> Briefly, the propensity score was
defined as the conditional probability of receiving a suspected GD diagnosis,
using either the GD minimum or maximum classification, based on observed
covariates and estimated from multivariate logistic regression. Covariates
included race, sex, age, primary payer type, hospital region, the number of
diagnoses and procedures included in the discharge, whether care was received at
a freestanding children’s hospital, whether the birth was complicated, whether a
major operating room procedure was performed, whether there was indication of a
transfer into or out of the hospital, and whether there was evidence of
emergency department services. The GD maximum model also included the GD minimum
classification as a covariate, since the maximum estimate was inclusive of GD
minimum discharges. Propensity scores were estimated using a multivariate
logistic regression on GD status, with minimum and maximum definitions modeled
separately. Propensity scores were trimmed to the 90th percentile because weight
trimming has been shown to improve performance of propensity score weights,
particularly for those estimated by logistic
regression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> Average treatment effect weights were
calculated as 1<italic>/e</italic> for the treatment group and
1/(1–<italic>e</italic>) for the control group, where
<italic>e</italic> is the trimmed propensity score based
on GD status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> For all health-care utilization metrics, the
population average treatment effect (PATE) estimand was calculated as the
difference of means between GD and the background population, after accounting
for survey design, and based on the minimum or maximum GD definition. Per
published recommendations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> the product of the original survey weights
and the propensity score weights were included in the final model estimating the
PATE. This represented the average impact of having a suspected GD diagnosis on
health-care utilization. All statistical analyses for weighted discharges were
performed using the “survey”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> package in R.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup></p>
</sec>

<sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results">
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p id="Par14">A total of 3,195,782 records, weighted to represent a national estimate
of 5.85 million discharges, were identified for children less than 18 years of age
in the 2012 KID. We calculated 4.37 million discharges for children less than 1 year
of age, with 3.92 million of those representing neonates (nonmaternal records, 67%),
with neonate status defined by admission during the first 28 days after birth. Of
the neonates, a weighted 1.30 million records (33%) were labeled as complicated
births.</p>
<p id="Par15">For all analyses, unless otherwise noted, we calculated the range of
potential values using the minimum and maximum estimates as defined in “Materials
and Methods.” In brief, minimum estimates of GD required the discharge to have a
GD-associated ICD-9-CM code as the primary diagnosis, while the maximum estimate
required a GD-associated ICD-9-CM code anywhere in the diagnostic code list.</p>
<p id="Par16">We identified a weighted estimate of 150,169 (2.6%) to 818,384 (14%)
discharges with suspected GD. The range of GD estimates varied significantly by age
group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). Of all the GD-linked
discharges in KID, 23–45% occurred in freestanding children’s hospitals, compared
with only 7.7% of all non-GD-linked discharges. Of the total number of discharges
that took place in freestanding children’s hospitals (<italic>N</italic> = 577,568), 12–33% include diagnosis codes associated with
GD.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Total</th><th>Percentage of total discharges</th><th>Number of GD discharges in category, min to max

<p id="Par17">Mortality rates were higher in GD-linked discharges (1.0–1.3%) compared
with all other discharges (0.20%). Between 30% and 57% of suspected GD discharges
also included a major operating room procedure as defined by

Similarly, the percent of discharges indicating that the patient was transferred in

suspected GD patients (9–15%) than all remaining patients (4%). Additional cohort

<p id="Par19">Health-care utilization was captured using length of stay (LOS), total

with no GD-linked diagnosis for the generalized pediatric population and neonates,
respectively (mean total charges were $37,907–$58,511 higher). This corresponded to
an adjusted mean increase in LOS of 2.4 and 6.6 days for pediatric patients and
neonates, respectively. Total costs per discharge for the GD minimum estimate

<p id="Par20">GD maximum estimate discharges were aggregated according to clinical
ICD-9-CM categories based on ICD-9-CM coding groups and are annotated in
Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>. Sixty-six percent of GD
maximum estimate discharges had a single GD-linked ICD-9 code, and 84% had diagnosis
codes in a single diagnosis group (see Figures <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). Mean total

GD-linked diagnoses per discharge (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>).
When considering between one and seven diagnoses, which shows a linear relationship

total cost of $13,999 (total charge of $43,862) per additional GD-linked code
(Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). After seven diagnoses, the
relationship is less clear, likely due to small sample sizes. Discharges with eight

<p id="Par21">A subanalysis examining the confidence that a code is positively linked
to genetic disease (see “Materials and methods” and Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref>) yielded results that show similar trends
(Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S7</xref>). Discharges with codes most
strongly linked to GD represent the smallest subpopulation (2.8% of all discharges
with “definite” codes) with the highest mean health-care utilization compared with
subgroups of codes that are “highly likely” or “positively associated” with
GD.</p>
<p id="Par22">The distribution of discharges and health-care utilization varied
widely among diagnostic disease groupings and age group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">S8</xref>). Discharges with diagnosis codes in the congenital anomalies
category (ICD-9-CM codes 740.xx–759.xx) had the largest number of GD-linked
discharges, as well as largest aggregate cost, in both neonates and the remaining
pediatric population. Congenital anomalies accounted for an aggregate total cost of
$1.4 to $8.1 billion in neonates ($4.1 to $27.6 billion, or 3.3–22% of the $124
billion aggregate total pediatric charges) and $2.3 to $5.0 billion in the remaining
pediatric population ($7.1 to $15.3 billion, or 5.7–12.4% of all aggregate total
pediatric charges). For neonates, diseases of the respiratory system (ICD-9-CM codes
460.xx–519.xx) had the highest mean total charge at $434,477 to $684,581 per
discharge (corresponding to mean total costs of $141,198 to $235,677 and mean LOS of
35.6 to 41.3 days). In the older pediatric age group, discharges with a perinatal
diagnoses code (ICD-9-CM codes 760.xx–779.xx) had the highest mean total charge,
ranging from $436,934 to $437,687. This corresponded to a mean total cost of
$117,719 to $123,468 and mean LOS of 41.2 to 49.7 days. All pediatric discharges

<p id="Par23">Discharges with GD-associated codes show significantly higher
health-care utilization across all age groups compared with discharges with no
GD-associated diagnoses. Adjusted mean total costs for discharges with no GD-linked
codes were $2680 in neonates and $7599 in the remaining pediatric population
(unadjusted values are shown in Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>).
Mean total charges for GD-associated discharges were at least 3–12 times higher in
neonates, and at least 50% higher for pediatric patients, depending on the diagnosis
category (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">S8</xref>). Overall, the aggregate total charges for all
pediatric discharges in the US in 2012 were just over $124 billion, representing
total costs of $37.3 billion (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S10</xref>).
While our maximum estimate of GD in neonates was only 10.2% of all neonatal
discharges, aggregate costs in this population exceeded those neonatal discharges
with no associated GD-linked codes ($8.7 billion versus $8.5 billion, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). In nonneonatal discharges with age less
than 1 year, the aggregate cost of discharges with GD-associated codes was 60%
higher than discharges with none (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). While the estimated genetic disease population in this data
set comprises 2.6–14% of all discharges, it makes up a larger portion of the
“national bill” - 11–46% of all aggregate total charges (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="Par24">This study utilized the largest all-payer database of pediatric
discharges in the United States to estimate the economic burden of pediatric
patients who are suspected of having a genetic disease. We found that patients with
suspected GD are high utilizers of health care, on average, undergoing up to four
additional procedures and staying 2 to 18 days longer in hospital, corresponding to
an increase of total costs ranging from $12,000 to $77,000 per discharge compared
with patients without a GD-linked diagnosis.</p>
<p id="Par25">The selected ICD-9 codes used in our study describe clinical features
that have been previously associated with genetic disorders in the literature
(Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S3</xref>). The list is intended to
achieve moderate to high sensitivity for inclusion of those with underlying genetic
disease. Because of the current limitations of all genetic testing and the known
contributions of complex or environmental causes of these clinical presentations,
the specificity for GD in this population is inevitably somewhat lower. There are
not standard professional society–endorsed guidelines for use of genetic testing for
each of the individual selected ICD-9 codes. There are, however, large groups of
patients within our study population where guidelines have endorsed genetic testing.
For example, karyotype, single-gene testing, and chromosomal microarray are
recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Medical
Genetics and Genomics for the evaluation of patients with intellectual disability,
autism, and birth defects (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). The
diagnostic yield of genetic testing has also been documented in other neurological
disorders such as epilepsy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> with accompanying recommendation for routine
testing. With respect to isolated severe birth defects, the American Heart
Association has recently reinforced recommendations for genetic testing for patients
with congenital heart defects, and translational research literature has documented
the important role for single-gene pathogenic variants in a wide array of congenital
heart defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (also see Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par26">Similar population definitions have been used in previous studies. A
1997 study by Yoon et al. that reviewed pediatric hospital discharges in two states
identified a similar list of 73 ICD-9-CM codes and code ranges that capture birth
defects and genetic diseases across 17 disease categories. Our list
(Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref>) includes all but 5 of their
identified codes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Our code set is also inclusive of the Arth et
al. codes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>
associated with birth defects, and both the Arth et al. analysis and ours derived
similar proportions of discharges and costs in this population despite using
different data sources. Arth et al. report 556,710 patients under 18 years old using
the HCUP 2013 National Inpatient Sample database, resulting in $12.4 billion in
aggregate costs; while we observed that 10.3% of discharges (<italic>N</italic> = 602,028) in the database had a diagnosis code for a congenital
anomaly (ICD-9-CM 740.xx–759.xx), resulting in $13.0 billion in aggregate costs in
2012. By using a more comprehensive list of GD-linked codes, we expand on these
previous studies and report on an additional 216,357 discharges in 12 other disease
categories, representing an aggregate cost of $4.5 billion in 2012.</p>
<p id="Par27">Generally, patients with more indications of genetic disease, i.e.,
those with multiple GD-associated ICD-9 codes, showed a mean incremental total cost
per discharge of $13,999, suggesting that more complex cases result in higher
health-care utilization. Additionally, the majority of health-care dollars spent on
GD-associated discharges tends to skew toward younger ages, as shown in
Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>. Overall, GD-linked
discharges accounted for a disproportionally high component of health-care costs for
the pediatric population. This population combines patients with known underlying
genetic disorders, those with genetic disorders in which the condition is either not
yet diagnosed or cannot yet be recognized due to limitations of test technologies or
variant interpretation, and those with either complex or purely environmental causes
of their clinical presentations. This aggregated population is relevant because it
represents an estimate of the population in which genetic testing might be prudently
performed and whose management and therapy might be positively affected by
identification of a genetic disorder.</p>
<p id="Par28">It is possible that the estimates of health-care burden presented here
are underestimates. KID is comprised of claims data for inpatient hospital stays for
a single year, and although we expect the bulk of costs to be captured in an
inpatient setting, charges that may occur beyond the year data were accumulated
(2012) or in other hospital settings are excluded. Additionally, due to differences
in state-level reporting of revenue codes, we were unable to distinguish which
discharges took place in a neonatal or pediatric intensive care unit, which are
generally costlier. Similarly, only bundled total charges per discharge are reported
in KID, and we were unable to distinguish between individual charges within a
hospital stay. By limiting our population definition to diagnosis codes in this data
set, it is possible that these results may underestimate the true economic impact of
genetic diseases in childhood and therefore also underestimate the implied value of
genomic testing.</p>
<p id="Par29">Results from this study have several clinical and societal
implications. For example, the majority of well-established genetic diseases,
neurological diseases, and birth defect–associated discharges were not for neonates
(51–89%). While we are unable to longitudinally track patients in this data set,
this observation may represent either a delay in diagnosis for GD patients, or a
distinct group of GD diseases that present later in childhood. Because these cases
occurred at older ages, they are likely to have presented outside of a typical
neonatal intensive care unit. Increased physician awareness of genetic diseases is
therefore necessary in a broader care setting to better recognize GD patients. In an
analysis of hospital characteristics, we observed a higher proportion of GD-linked
discharges in larger, high-volume urban teaching hospitals (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S11</xref>). These hospitals are likely better equipped
with the resources and expertise to handle complex medical care issues. However, we
also observed a high rate of GD-associated discharges at small, nonteaching,
nonchildren’s hospitals, suggesting that a substantial number of true GD cases may
present in facilities not as well prepared to accurately recognize or diagnose these
cases. General practitioners may miss indicators of GD, and not all physicians are
familiar with the most accurate coding for rare disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> This lack of awareness or
local expertise in different care settings or hospital types may lead to
misdiagnosis and extension of diagnostic odyssey.</p>
<p id="Par30">In utilizing this nationally representative data set, we have presented
an assessment of the economic burden of pediatric GD in the United States. Given
that the unit of measure in KID is inpatient discharge, not individual patient,
further research, particularly cost-effectiveness studies and prospective trials, is
needed to further characterize the economic burden of the diagnostic odysseys of
pediatric GD patients. Evidence is accumulating that next-generation sequencing may
end the diagnostic odyssey for some GD patients, and that incorporation of
comprehensive testing methodologies may result in cost savings. While we were unable
to directly address this question with this study, it is possible that future
studies will demonstrate that early genetic testing leads to cost savings,
particularly for neonates in intensive care or pediatric patients on long-term
admissions.</p>
<p id="Par31">Collectively, we observed that GD-linked discharges accounted for
2.6–14% of pediatric inpatient admissions in 2012, but made up 11% to 46% of the
pediatric “national bill” based on total charges per discharge. Children who present
clinically with indications of GD have a large economic impact on the national
health-care system. Improved physician awareness and earlier diagnosis, particularly
with comprehensive genetic testing approaches, may serve to significantly reduce
costs associated with an otherwise lengthy diagnostic odyssey in pediatric GD
patients.</p>
