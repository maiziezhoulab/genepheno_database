<abstract>
<p>Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by truncating variants in the paternal allele of <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, located in the Prader-Willi critical region, 15q11-q13. Although the phenotypes of SYS overlap those of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), including neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems, and developmental delay/intellectual disability, SYS patients show autism spectrum disorder and joint contractures, which are atypical phenotypes for PWS. Therefore, we hypothesized that the truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> protein could potentially produce gain-of-function toxic effects. To test the hypothesis, we generated two engineered mouse models; one, an overexpression model that expressed the N-terminal region of <italic>Magel2</italic> that was FLAG tagged with a strong ubiquitous promoter, and another, a genome-edited model that carried a truncating variant in <italic>Magel2</italic> generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In the overexpression model, all transgenic mice died in the fetal or neonatal period indicating embryonic or neonatal lethality of the transgene. Therefore, overexpression of the truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> could show toxic effects. In the genome-edited model, we generated a mouse model carrying a frameshift variant (c.1690_1924del; p(Glu564Serfs*130)) in <italic>Magel2</italic>. Model mice carrying the frameshift variant in the paternal or maternal allele of <italic>Magel2</italic> were termed <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>P:fs</sup> and <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>M:fs</sup>, respectively. The imprinted expression and spatial distribution of truncating <italic>Magel2</italic> transcripts in the brain were maintained. Although neonatal <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>P:fs</sup> mice were lighter than wildtype littermates, <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>P:fs</sup> males and females weighed the same as their wildtype littermates by eight and four weeks of age, respectively. Collectively, the overexpression mouse model may recapitulate fetal or neonatal death, which are the severest phenotypes for SYS. In contrast, the genome-edited mouse model maintains genomic imprinting and distribution of truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> transcripts in the brain, but only partially recapitulates SYS phenotypes. Therefore, our results imply that simple gain-of-function toxic effects may not explain the patho-mechanism of SYS, but rather suggest a range of effects due to <italic>Magel2</italic> variants as in human SYS patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2013, the first four individuals with truncating variants in the paternal allele of <italic>MAGEL2</italic> were reported, and later described as having Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS, OMIM#615547). The phenotypes of SYS patients overlap those of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, OMIM#176270), including neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems and developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref001">1</xref>]. Additionally, SYS patients show autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contractures of the small finger joints, which are atypical phenotypes for PWS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>PWS occurs as the result of absence of expression of paternal genes from chromosome 15q11.2-q13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref004">4</xref>]. Chromosome 15q11.2-q13 contains paternal-only expressed genes encoding polypeptides (<italic>MKRN3</italic>, <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, <italic>NDN</italic>, <italic>NPAP1</italic> and <italic>SNURF-SNRPN</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref001">1</xref>]. It also contains snoRNAs (<italic>SNORD115</italic>, <italic>116</italic>) which show paternal-only expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref005">5</xref>]. Recently, it was revealed that a paternal deletion of <italic>SNORD116</italic> is responsible for PWS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref006">6</xref>]. <italic>MAGEL2</italic> is not expressed in patients with PWS. Therefore, a loss-of-function in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> should be associated with PWS. Nevertheless, SYS patients generally show more severe phenotypes than typical PWS patients. Additionally, patients with a paternally inherited deletion including <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, but not <italic>SNRPN/SNORD116</italic>, have a milder phenotype than those with truncating variants in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref008">8</xref>]. Thus, a gain-of-function mechanism in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> was suggested as the pathological mechanism underlying SYS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Human <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, and its mouse ortholog <italic>Magel2</italic>, are GC-rich, single-exon, maternally imprinted genes that are exclusively expressed from the unmethylated paternal allele. <italic>MAGEL2</italic> and <italic>Magel2</italic> encode putative proteins of 1249 and 1284 amino acids, respectively, which are highly homologous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237814.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref010">10</xref>]. In SYS, more than half of the patients carry a truncating variant in nucleotides c.1990-1996, which is upstream of the region encoding the C-terminus of the proline-rich region in <italic>MAGEL2</italic>. Notably, c.1996dupC is the most common and severe variant in SYS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref009">9</xref>]. In mice, <italic>Magel2</italic> RNA is expressed at low levels throughout the brain, but shows the highest expression in hypothalamic regions, especially the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). A mouse model has been generated by inactivating <italic>Magel2</italic> in C57BL/6 mice with the use of a lacZ knock-in allele with paternal inheritance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref012">12</xref>]. <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice have reduced embryonic viability, but otherwise normal embryonic growth in survivors, followed by postnatal growth retardation. In their later development, they even showed more weight gain compared to littermates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref011">11</xref>]. Such mild phenotypes in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice did not recapitulate those of SYS, but may represent those of patients with a deletion of the entire <italic>MAGEL2</italic> gene.</p>

<title>Schematic structure of the human <italic>MAGEL2</italic> and mice <italic>Magel2</italic>.</title>
<p>(A) Human <italic>MAGEL2</italic> contains a proline-rich region (residues 13–700), USP7 binding site (U7BS: residues 949–1004), and MAGE homolog domain (MHD: residues 1020–1219). Truncating variants reported previously are indicated by their positions (top; frameshift variants, bottom: nonsense variants). The mutation hotspot is located at nucleotides c.1990-1996. Over half of SYS patients carried c.1996dupC:p.(Q666Pfs*47) in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> (in red text). (B) Mouse <italic>Magel2</italic> contains proline-rich region (residues 13–646) and MHD (residues 1052–1251).</p>

<p>Therefore, we generated mouse models to test the hypothesis that the truncating <italic>MAGEL2</italic> protein could potentially produce gain-of-function toxic effects. Assuming that mice carrying a truncating variant in <italic>Magel2</italic> have a more severe phenotype than <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice, we generated two types of mouse models: a transgenic mouse that overexpressed the N-terminal region of <italic>Magel2</italic>, and a genome-edited mouse expressing truncating <italic>Magel2</italic> under the intrinsic promoter.</p>

<p>We generated an overexpression model that overexpressed the N-terminal region of <italic>Magel2</italic> (amino acid residues 1–437). We amplified a 1311bp fragment encoding the N-terminal region of <italic>Magel2</italic> with a FLAG tag at the C-terminus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was performed with mouse genomic DNA, AmpliTaq Gold 360 Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and primers F1 and R1. Primers F1 and R1 contained recognition sites for <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Xho</italic>I, respectively. As an antibody specific to <italic>Magel2</italic> protein was not available, we inserted a FLAG-tag at the C-terminus of the truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237814.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). To express truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> under the control of the CAG promoter, the product was subcloned into <italic>pCAGGS1</italic> containing a modified chicken actin promoter with the CAG promoter, kindly provided by Dr. J. Miyazaki (Osaka University), using <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Xho</italic>I cloning sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237814.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The construct was named <italic>pCAGGS1-Magel2-FLAG</italic>. The construct was linearized by digestion with <italic>Sal</italic>I and <italic>Hind</italic>III prior to microinjection into fertilized eggs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>MAGEL2</italic> is located in the PWS critical region and typically deleted in PWS patients. Therefore, loss-of-function phenotypes with <italic>MAGEL2</italic> are likely to be included in typical PWS patients. However, most SYS patients with a truncating variant in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> show more severe clinical features than PWS patients. Indeed, our previous study identified six patients with SYS with a truncating variant, including the common c.1996dupC, and all six patients showed severe intellectual disability and complication of joint contracture, which are atypical for PWS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref017">17</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that the truncated Magel2 protein could potentially produce gain-of-function toxic effects, and we generated two types of mouse models expressing truncating mutations of <italic>Magel2</italic>.</p>
<p>First, we generated an overexpression model which expressed truncating <italic>Magel2</italic> under the control of the CAG promoter, and found that all transgenic mice died in fetal or neonatal period. In normal mouse embryos, <italic>Magel2</italic> is expressed in the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref018">18</xref>]. In contrast, our model mice expressed truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> under the CAG promoter, which induced much higher expression levels ubiquitously. Therefore, we assumed that the expression of truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> in various types of organs were responsible for fetal death. We tried to extract protein from the brain of dead mice in the overexpression model, and to detect truncated Magel2 protein with FLAG tag. However, we were not able to detect FLAG tag signal by western blot analysis as the extracted proteins were denatured. Therefore, we were not able to assess the patho-mechanism of fetal or neonatal death in the overexpression mouse model. Nevertheless, the overexpression model revealed the toxic effects of overexpression of truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> in the fetal period. It is intriguing that Mejlachowics et al. reported that the c.1996delC variant in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> was responsible for fetal death at 24 to 27 weeks of gestation in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref019">19</xref>], indicating the severe toxic effects of the specific truncated <italic>MAGEL2</italic>. Our overexpression model may, at least in some degree, recapitulate the most severe of the toxic effects of truncated <italic>MAGEL2</italic>.</p>
<p>Next, we generated a genome-edited mouse model carrying a frameshift variant in <italic>Magel2</italic> (c.1690_1924del;p(Glu564Serfs*130)) with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. As the paternal allele of <italic>Magel2</italic> is expressed, but the maternal allele is silenced, we classified the model mice into those carrying a paternal allele variant (<italic>Magel2</italic><sup>P:fs</sup>) and those carrying a maternal allele variant (<italic>Magel2</italic><sup>M:fs</sup>).</p>
<p>Kozlov et al. generated a mouse model with inactivate paternal <italic>Magel2</italic> with the use of a lacZ knock-in allele, and <italic>Magel2</italic> knockout model displayed 10% postnatal lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref012">12</xref>]. We investigated the birth rate of <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>P:fs</sup> and <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>M:fs</sup>, but there was no difference between the two groups although statistical power was not high.</p>
<p>Imprinting regions, including <italic>Magel2</italic>, are governed by imprinting centers that regulate parent-of-origin epigenotypes and gene expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref020">20</xref>]. Matarazo et al. reported the loss of imprinting and the expression of the maternal allele of <italic>Magel2</italic> in a mouse model with a deletion of the paternal allele of <italic>Magel2</italic>, including its promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref021">21</xref>]. We confirmed genome imprinting by RT-PCT on newborn mouse brain mRNA, and revealed that <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>P:fs</sup> expressed truncated <italic>Magel2</italic>, and <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>M:fs</sup> expressed full-length <italic>Magel2</italic>. That suggested that our mouse model maintained the genome imprinting mechanism of <italic>Magel2</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Magel2</italic> expression is specifically localized to the SCN and PVN in the hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref018">18</xref>]. We performed ISH to compare the distribution of <italic>Magel2</italic> mRNA in wildtype and <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>P:fs</sup> males. There was no difference in the distribution of <italic>Magel2</italic> mRNA. Those results suggested that our model mice maintained the distribution of <italic>Magel2</italic> mRNA in the brain. As we do not have a specific anti-Magel2 antibody, we could not assess the expression of the Magel2 protein.</p>
<p>We measured the body weight of genome-edited model mice compared with their littermates (<italic>Magel2</italic><sup>+</sup>). At P10, <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>P:fs</sup> pups were statistically lighter than <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>+</sup>. Although <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>P:fs</sup> males were statistically lighter than <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>+</sup> males at four weeks of age, their body weight caught up with those of <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>+</sup> males at eight weeks of age. Furthermore, the body weight of <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>P:fs</sup> females was similar to that of <italic>Magel2</italic><sup>+</sup> females at four weeks of age. Bischof et al. reported that <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice exhibited neonatal growth retardation and excessive weight gain after weaning, and their growth abnormality was similar to PWS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref011">11</xref>]. In contrast, it was reported that 97% of SYS patients exhibited poor suck in infancy, but only 22–41% exhibited excessive weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref022">22</xref>]. Our mouse model showed growth retardation in neonates, but they did not show excessive weight gain after weaning. They may partially recapitulate human SYS phenotype in terms of characteristic growth abnormality.</p>
<p>The genome-edited mouse model did not show obvious abnormality in physical findings. In humans, genotype-phenotype association in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> has been discussed previously. McCarthy et al. mentioned that c.1996dupC in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> is the most common variant in SYS. Patients carrying c.1996dupC in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> showed a higher prevalence of joint contractures, feeding difficulties, and severe ID/DD than patients carrying other variants in <italic>MAGEL2</italic>. They mentioned that the severity of SYS depended on the specific location of the truncating mutation. <italic>MAGEL2</italic> and <italic>Magel2</italic> are single exon genes, and mutations leading to a premature stop codon are predicted not to cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The pathogenic effect of the truncated <italic>MAGEL2</italic> protein may differ depending on the precise location of the mutation in <italic>MAGEL2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref009">9</xref>]. Our mouse model carrying the c.1690_1924del variant in paternal <italic>Magel2</italic> may produce truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> protein which shows a milder toxic effect.</p>
<p>Our genome-edited mouse model showed almost comparable or less severe phenotypes to previously reported <italic>Magel2</italic> null mice, and failed to recapitulate the common phenotype of SYS. This may be due to the position of the variant we made and the wide clinical spectrum of human SYS patients. Thus, the gain-of-function hypothesis remains unsolved. Nevertheless, in our genome-edited mouse model, we showed the maintenance of imprinted expression and the distribution of the truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> transcripts in the mouse brain.</p>
<p>There are several limitations of the study. First, although we analyzed <italic>Magel2</italic> mRNA, we did not analyze Magel2 protein due to the lack of a specific anti-Magel2 antibody. Second, we were not able to investigate the patho-mechanism of fatal or neonatal death of the overexpression model because we were unable to obtain purified brain proteins. Third, the analyses of our mouse models are not exhaustive. It is known that human SYS patients have ASD and arthrogryposis, and Magel2-null mice have altered circadian rhythm, reduced motor activity, and increased adiposity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237814.ref023">23</xref>]. Therefore, behavioral, anatomical and serological tests are required for our mouse model in the future.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We generated two types of mouse models carrying a truncating variant in <italic>Magel2</italic>. The overexpression model was embryonic or neonatal lethal, indicating toxic effects of overexpression of the truncated <italic>Magel2</italic>. The genome-edited model maintained genomic imprinting and distribution of truncated <italic>Magel2</italic> transcripts in the brain, and only partially recapitulate SYS phenotypes. Our results suggest that not simple gain-of-function toxic effects, but rather varied effects due to the position and type of <italic>MAGEL2</italic> variants, underlie the patho-mechanism of SYS.</p>

<p>Two mouse models carrying truncating mutations in Magel2 show distinct phenotypes</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Saitoh,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate you on your studying the hypothesis that mice carrying a truncating variant in Magel2 have a more severe phenotype than Magel2-null mice, with the generation of two types of mouse models.</p>
<p>This is most straight-forward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither mouse model recapitulates the specific human phenotype associated with paternally-inherited, truncating MAGEL2 mutations.</p>
<p>While I think that your study merits publication, I do not concur with your statement that</p>
<p>“Our genome-edited mouse model could serve as a new model of truncated Magel2 to investigate the mechanism of SYS,” as there are no specific indications how the mechanisms in SYS should be addressed.</p>
<p>I would like you to either produce a specific list of experiments to be conducted as the next steps, in your genome-edited model mouse to address the mechanisms underlying SYS,</p>
<p>OR to remove the above statement from the manuscript.</p>
<p>I am not asking you to conduct further experiments.</p>
<p>Please also take the comments of the Reviewers into account, when submitting a revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Jul 03 2020 11:59PM.

<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future.

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Truncating variants in the paternal allele of MAGEL2 have previously been reported, and described as resulting in Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS), The phenotypes of SYS patients overlap those of Prader-Willi syndrome patients, which include neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems and mental retardation. Ieda et al report the generation and phenotypes of two mouse models for SYS, one representing a CRISPR-Cas generated frameshift mutation within Magel2, the second representing an expressed truncated version of Magel2 thus mimicking a frameshift mutation in the Magel2 gene which reflects common SYS mutations in humans. Since the phenotype of Magel2 null mutations in humans is milder than those of frameshift mutations (reflecting many aspects of PWS) the authors hypothesized that truncated versions of Magel2 might exert a dominant negative gain-of-function in humans and thus might be the reason for more severe SYS phenotypes. While the Magel2 frameshift mice almost reflected wt mice the – ubiquitously – expressed truncated version of Magel2 resulted in fetal or neonatal death.</p>
<p>Major Concerns:</p>
<p>1)The authors expressed the truncated version of Magel2 ubiquitously in all tissues , although Magel2 is normally expressed mainly in brain. Due to the small number of transgenic truncated specimens (n=3) the authors were unable to assess the patho-mechanism of the fetal or neonatal death, being due to either overexpression of the truncated protein or ubiquitous expression; i.e. this is a “no data experiment” since no conclusions can be drawn. The authors are strongly advised to closely investigate the patho-mechanism of fetal or neonatal death of the truncated version of Magel2, since this was the major objective in their study.</p>
<p>2) The CRIPR-Cas generated frameshift Magel2 mice, after four weeks, did not show obvious abnormalities in physical findings and failed to recapitulate the common phenotype of SYS. Their value in investigating pathophysiology in SYS is thus extremely limited. Other models for the effects of the more severe phenotype of Magel2 frameshift mutations should ,be considered and discussed.</p>
<p>Minor Concers:</p>
<p>The authors should cite relevant primary literature regarding PWS etiologies; it is common practice in recent years to cite reviews which again cite reviews and so on, but not mention the original publications: for example, the group of Hüttenhofer (Cavaille et al, 2000 PNAS) discovered the ncRNAs (SNORD115, 116) later shown by the group of Beaudet (Nature Gen. 2008) to be solely responsible for PWS. Please cite relevant original literature , not reviews.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This study reports the generation of two new mouse models for Schaaf-Yang syndrome: an over expression model for an N-Terminal truncated Magel2 protein, and a transgenic mouse with a truncation mutation. These models may be important for the investigation of SYS in a preclinical model. However, the models presented have only undergone limited characterization.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>I did not see a quantification of the level of overexpression for the overexpression mouse model.</p>
<p>The decreased number of life-born pups with the frameshifting variant of Magel2 on the paternal allele may indicate prenatal lethality, as has been suggested for the Magel2-LacZ mouse . A power calculation should be done and subsequently that hypothesis should be tested.</p>
<p>Minor comment:</p>
<p>Lines 87 and 390: MAGEL2 is misspelled.</p>
