<p id="Par1">YAP and its neuronal isoform YAPdeltaC are implicated in various cellular functions. We found that expression of YAPdeltaC during development, but not adulthood, rescued neurodegeneration phenotypes of mutant ataxin-1 knock-in (Atxn1-KI) mice. YAP/YAPdeltaC interacted with RORα via the second WW domain and served as co-activators of its transcriptional activity. YAP/YAPdeltaC formed a transcriptional complex with RORα on <italic>cis</italic>-elements of target genes and regulated their expression. Both normal and mutant Atxn1 interacted with YAP/YAPdeltaC, but only mutant Atxn1 depleted YAP/YAPdeltaC from the RORα complex to suppress transcription on short timescales. Over longer periods, mutant Atxn1 also decreased RORα in vivo. Genetic supplementation of YAPdeltaC restored the RORα and YAP/YAPdeltaC levels, recovered YAP/YAPdeltaC in the RORα complex and normalized target gene transcription in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice in vivo. Collectively, our data suggest that functional impairment of YAP/YAPdeltaC by mutant Atxn1 during development determines the adult pathology of SCA1 by suppressing RORα-mediated transcription.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a neurological disease that mainly affects Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and motoneurons in the spinal cord<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It has been more than 20 years since the discovery of the causative gene, Ataxin-1 (<italic>ATXN1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Since then, a great deal of knowledge has accumulated regarding the mechanisms of SCA1, including the identities of the Atxn1-interacting factors involved in transcription and splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, SCA1 remains intractable, and no disease-modifying therapy has reached the clinical bedside.</p>
<p id="Par4">Meanwhile, as with other neurodegenerative diseases, our conception of spinocerebellar ataxias (including SCA1) has changed substantially. First, it has become clear that the types of affected neurons are not as specific as originally believed. For example, we now know that SCAs affect not only cerebellar neurons but also cerebral neurons, sometimes leading to cognitive impairment in patients with SCA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Second, the effects of these disorders are not limited to single organs: polyQ diseases like Huntington’s disease affect not only the brain but also muscle, adipose, pancreas, and heart tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and this may also be the case in SCAs. Third, SCA might be a developmental disorder that affects cerebellar neurons during embryogenesis or in early childhood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">In regard to the third point, a study by the Orr group revealed the developmental molecular pathology of SCA1 by showing that Atxn1 indirectly interacts with RORα, an orphan nuclear receptor with similarities to retinoic acid receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Expression of mutant Atxn1 protein, encoded by a gene containing a CAG expansion, decreases RORα levels and thus broadly affects expression of target genes necessary for cerebellar development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">We previously showed that the transcriptional co-factor YAP is involved in an atypical form of necrosis induced by alpha-amanitin, transcriptional repression-induced atypical cell death (TRIAD) in which C-terminal truncated isoforms of YAP (ins13, ins25, and ins61 possessing additional mini-exon sequences between exon 5 and exon 6) play critical roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In subsequent experiments, we expressed these isoforms in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> under the control of the tubulin Gal4 driver, fed the larvae alpha-amanitin, and monitored the survival ratio from larva to pupa. The results revealed that YAPdeltaC-ins61 had the strongest anti-TRIAD activity (our unpublished data). Therefore, we took YAPdeltaC-ins61 (hereafter, “YAPdeltaC”) as the representative of three isoforms. Biochemical and morphological data support the idea that TRIAD actually occurs in human Huntington’s disease brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and overexpression of YAPdeltaC prevents TRIAD in Huntington’s disease in vitro models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par7">In this study, we tested the therapeutic effect of YAPdeltaC on SCA1 pathology using a newly developed Tet-ON YAPdeltaC system in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI (Sca1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup>) mice. Unexpectedly, adulthood expression of YAPdeltaC did not ameliorate the pathology and symptoms of <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice. By contrast, YAPdeltaC expression during development markedly rescued the pathology and symptoms in adulthood. We found that YAP/YAPdeltaC functioned as a transcriptional co-activator of RORα. Normal Atxn1 collaborated with YAP/YAPdeltaC to activate RORα, whereas mutant Atxn1 inhibited incorporation of YAP/YAPdeltaC into the RORα transcription complex. Supplementation of YAP/YAPdeltaC overcame the toxic effect of mutant Atxn1 and restored the transcriptional activity of RORα. These results elucidate the molecular function of YAPdeltaC in the developmentally determined pathology of SCA1.</p>

<title>Developmental YAPdeltaC rescues adult phenotype of KI mice</title>
<p id="Par8">We generated transgenic mice expressing YAPdeltaC using the advanced Tet-ON system (see Methods). When fed doxycycline (Dox), these transgenic mice express YAPdeltaC under the control of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter. To investigate the temporal specificity of the potential therapeutic effect of YAPdeltaC, the Tet-ON mice were crossed with mutant heterozygous <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI (Sca1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup>) mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The double-transgenic mice (Tet-ON YAPdeltaC; <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI) expressed mutant Atxn1 (Atxn1-154Q) from E0 to death, but expressed YAPdeltaC specifically in neurons only when fed Dox. All mice were of the C57BL/6 genetic background.</p>
<p id="Par9">In Group I, mother mice were fed Dox during pregnancy and breast-feeding (from E0 to 3 weeks of age); after 3 weeks, the double-transgenic progeny received Dox in drinking water (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). In Group II, the double-transgenic mice received Dox in drinking water from 8 weeks of age until death (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). No Dox group of the double-transgenic mice received no Dox during embryogenesis and after birth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). The induction of YAPdeltaC by Dox in Group I mice was confirmed by analysis of cerebellar tissues from Group I, Group II, No-Dox, and C57BL/6 mice (without Dox feeding) at P21 (3 weeks of age) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Experimental design of YAPdeltaC Dox-ON in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice. <bold>a</bold> Protocol of Dox feeding of the YAPdeltaC Dox-ON mice.

</p>
<p id="Par10">The lifespans of the four groups were investigated, and their motor functions were evaluated using the Rotarod test. In <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice, the onset of motor dysfunction was quite early, and Rotarod test scores declined at 7 weeks. In Group II and No Dox, the decline of motor function was similar to that in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). By contrast, the scores remained high in Group I, and the improvement was statistically significant from 11 to 21 weeks of age (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par11">Developmental expression, but not adulthood expression, of YAPdeltaC was also effective in lengthening lifespan (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). In the background control group (C57BL/6), mean lifespan was longer than 400 days. By contrast, in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice, mean and maximum lifespans were 224.1 and 274 days, respectively; in Group I (Tet-ON-YAPdeltaC;Atxn1-KI, Dox+ from E0 to death), 318.3 and 400 day; and in Group II (Tet-ON-YAPdeltaC;Atxn1-KI, Dox+ from 8 weeks to death), 238.4 and 297 days; in No Dox (Tet-ON-YAPdeltaC;Atxn1-KI, Dox−), 238.3 and 290 days. These differences in lifespan confirmed that the critical period for YAPdeltaC expression is the developmental stage (E0–8 weeks). We confirmed that YAPdeltaC protein was rapidly induced within 1 week after initiation of Dox-feeding at 8 weeks of age (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>).</p>

<title>Developmental YAPdeltaC rescues adult pathology of KI mice</title>
<p id="Par12">In <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice at P21, the number of Purkinje cells was not affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>), but the thickness of the molecular layer was reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). In addition, the diameters of Purkinje cell bodies were significantly reduced in these animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). These data obtained from the primary fissure side area of lobule IV–V, which corresponds to the upper vermis severely affected in human SCA1 patients, suggested that differentiation and maturation of Purkinje cells were impaired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, but cell death did not occur by P21. By 32 weeks, cell number was also decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>), indicating that cell death occurred between P21 and 32 weeks.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Morphological changes precede cell death in Purkinje cells at P21. <bold>a</bold> Upper panels are low-magnification images of the cerebellar cortex in three mouse groups at P21. Sections were immunostained with anti-calbindin antibody. The number of Purkinje cells in 600 μm of the primary fissure side of lobule IV–V was counted in one slide, and the values from 20 slides from four mice (five per mouse) were used for statistical analysis. To determine the thickness of the molecular layer, the thickness was measured at six regions on the primary fissure side of lobule IV–V per slide, and the values from 120 regions from 20 slides from four mice were used for statistical analyses. The diameter of Purkinje cells was measured for all Purkinje cells on the primary fissure side of lobule IV–V, and the values from 20 slides from four mice were directly used for analysis. Lower graphs show quantitative analyses of the thickness of the molecular layer, the number of Purkinje cells, and the diameter of Purkinje cells.

</p>
<p id="Par13">In Group I mice at P21, YAPdeltaC restored Purkinje cell body diameter and molecular layer thickness (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>) and also prevented the decrease in Purkinje cell number at 32 weeks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>), in consistence with the late-onset effect of RORα-mediated transcription reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and suggested functional interaction between YAPdeltaC and RORα.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>YAP/YAPdeltaC interact with RORα</title>
<p id="Par14">Hence, we tested physical interaction between YAP/YAPdeltaC and RORα. We scanned the amino-acid sequence of RORα and found a PPLY sequence that matches the PPxY consensus for interaction with YAP WW domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This PPLY motif also overlapped with a consensus sequence (PLYKELFT) for interaction with Tip60 NR box (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). To determine which YAP WW domain is essential for interaction with RORα, we generated YAP expression vectors mutated at the first and/or second WW domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). To investigate YAP binding to the PPLY consensus, we also constructed a RORα mutant in which PPLY was replaced to PPLA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Structures of RORα, YAP, and Tip60 and their possible relationship. <bold>a</bold> Scheme showing the interaction among YAP, Tip60, and RORα.

In middle panels, YAP2 mutants of the first and/or second WW domain were also examined for interaction with endogenous RORα. In right panels, wild-type RORα and mutant RORα at the PPLY motif were tested for interaction with FLAG-YAP2/YAPdeltaC. The lower graphs show quantitative analyses of the relative intensities of output bands, corrected based on the corresponding input band (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Double asterisks: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 in one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s HSD test</p></caption><graphic id="d29e626" xlink:href="41467_2017_1790_Fig3_HTML"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p id="Par15">FLAG-tagged full-length YAP or YAPdeltaC was transiently expressed along with wild-type RORα in primary cerebellar neurons and immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG and anti-RORα antibodies at 2 days after transfection. RORα reciprocally co-precipitated with both full-length YAP and YAPdeltaC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c, d</xref> left panels), and deletion of the C-terminal domain of YAP in YAPdeltaC did not markedly affect the interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c, d</xref>, left panels). FLAG-empty, used as a negative control, did not co-precipitate RORα (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c, d</xref>, left panels). The interaction was retained when the first WW domain was mutated, but was completely lost in a YAP mutant lacking the second WW domain, as well as in the double mutant lacking both WW domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c, d</xref>, middle panels). RORα harboring a mutation in the binding motif (Y507A) was not co-precipitated with full-length YAP or YAPdeltaC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c, d</xref>, right panels). These results indicated that the second WW domain of YAP/YAPdeltaC and the PPLY motif of RORα are essential for the interaction.</p>
<p id="Par16">The similar experiments were further performed with COS-7 cells transiently overexpressing RORα at 2 days after transfection, in which endogenous expression of RORα is very low (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1A, B</xref>). The results were exactly similar with those from primary cerebellar neurons and supported that the second WW domain of YAP/YAPdeltaC and the PPLY motif of RORα are essential for the interaction.</p>

<title>Atxn1 forms a complex with YAP/YAPdeltaC and RORα</title>
<p id="Par17">Next, we tested the difference between normal and mutant Atxn1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>). From primary cerebellar neurons expressing Myc-Atxn1 and FLAG-YAP/YAPdeltaC at 2 days after transfection, both normal and mutant Atxn1 proteins were co-precipitated with YAP/YAPdeltaC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>).

<p id="Par19">Because RORα co-precipitated with normal but not mutant Atxn1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>), and a direct interaction between Atxn1 and RORα was not confirmed in a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the RORα–YAP–Atxn1 ternary complex forms via RORα–YAP and YAP–Atxn1 direct interactions.

Co-transfection of an effector plasmid expressing RORα (RORα-pCI neo), but not RORα-Y507A mutant lacking affinity for YAP/YAPdeltaC, increased luciferase activity from a RORα-responsive element on a reporter plasmid (RORE-pGreenFire) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). In the absence of RORα, overexpression of YAP/YAPdeltaC did not affect luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). YAP/YAPdeltaC increased transcriptional activity in the presence of wild-type RORα but not of RORα-Y507A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>).

<p id="Par22">We knocked down YAP and/or Tip60 using siRNA in 293T cells which express RORα and YAP endogenously (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). YAP-siRNA dramatically decreased the level of YAP protein, and suppressed transcriptional activity proportional to the degree of knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). Tip60-siRNA decreased Tip60 protein level, albeit less efficiently, and also proportionally suppressed transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>), suggesting that YAP and Tip60 are co-factors with equivalent activity. Double knockdown of YAP and Tip60 additively suppressed transcription from the RORα-responsive element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>), indicating that YAP and Tip60 have complementary functions.</p>
<p id="Par23">In vitro pull-down assays revealed that YAP and Tip60 compete for binding to RORα.

<title>Mutant Atxn1 depletes YAP/YAPdeltaC from the RORα complex</title>
<p id="Par25">We next asked how mutant Atxn1 affects interaction between YAP/YAPdeltaC and RORα in vivo. Using the cerebellar tissues prepared from mice at P7 and P21, we confirmed co-precipitation of full-length YAP (YAP2) and RORα (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>, left panels).

In all three genes, the amount of amplified RORα-responsive element was lower in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice (No Dox) than in background C57BL/6 mice, but recovered in Group I mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>, left panels and right graphs).

<p id="Par27">Next, we investigated in chronological order when mutant Atxn1 deprived YAP/YAPdeltaC from the RORα transcription complex on target genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). We transiently expressed Myc-tagged normal/mutant Atxn1 in primary cerebellar neurons, which endogenously express RORα, YAP/YAPdeltaC, and normal Atxn1, and subjected these cells to ChIP assays. Already at 2 days after transfection, YAP/YAPdeltaC were not present in the RORα transcription complex on RORα-responsive element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>), and the deprivation of YAP/YAPdeltaC continued to day 7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>).

Since Myc-Atxn1-33Q and Myc-Atxn1-86Q were equivalently expressed in primary neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>), the results indicated that Myc-Atxn1-86Q could not efficiently approach to the RORα-responsive element.</p>

<title>YAPdeltaC recovers RORα-transcription</title>
<p id="Par29">To test the effects of mutant Atxn1 on RORα-dependent transcription, we performed luciferase assays in primary cerebellar neurons at 2 days after transfection. As expected, mutant Atxn1 suppressed transcription from RORα-responsive promoter, and YAP/YAPdeltaC rescued the suppression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). The suppression by mutant Atxn1 and the rescue by YAP/YAPdeltaC were dose-dependent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>). In addition, we found that YAP/YAPdeltaC levels decreased from 4 days after transfection of mutant Atxn1 and RORα level followed from day 7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>). Proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocked the reduction of RORα and YAP/YAPdeltaC levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>, right panels), suggesting that non-functional RORα and YAP/YAPdeltaC were degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Morphological analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d</xref>) and cell death assay with trypan blue staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref>) excluded the concern that these changes were due to the unhealthy state and/or cell death of primary cerebellar neurons by expression of mutant Atxn1.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>YAP/YAPdeltaC restores RORα target gene expression in vitro. <bold>a</bold> In primary cerebellar neurons, luciferase assays were performed 2 days after transfection of reporter and effector plasmids (left upper graph).

RT-qPCR analysis also revealed that expression of multiple YAP target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> was similarly reduced and recovered in Purkinje cells of three types of mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10b</xref>).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>YAPdeltaC restores RORα target gene expression in Group I mice in vivo. <bold>a</bold> RT-qPCR confirmed that YAPdeltaC overexpression in Group I mice rescued the reduced expression of two RORα target genes (<italic>A2bp1</italic> and <italic>Cyp19a1</italic>) in Purkinje cells of <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice at P7, P21, and 32 weeks. <bold>b</bold> RT-qPCR revealed a similar change in YAP target genes independent of RORα: <italic>Cyp19a1</italic> (TEAD-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>), <italic>Cyr61</italic> (TEAD-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>), and <italic>Ankrd1</italic> (TEAD-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>). <bold>c</bold> RT-qPCR detected no remarkable changes in expression of representative anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2, c-Flip, XIAP, Naip1) in Purkinje cells in three types of mice.

<p id="Par38">YAP overexpression might make neurons more resistant to mutant Atxn1-induced cell death, dependently on the upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes in developing cerebellar neurons. However, expression levels of representative anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2, c-Flip, and XIAP were not altered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10c</xref>). Regarding Naip1, which was detected in our previous study as an increased gene during TRIAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, was not changed at P7 and P21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10c</xref>). At 32 weeks, Naip1 was already increased in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice similarly to the condition of TRIAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10c</xref>). These results did not support that apoptosis is responsible for the decrease of Purkinje cell death in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice, while it remained possible that other types of cell death contribute to the pathological process from P21 to 8 weeks of age. These results supported our hypothesis that supplementation with YAPdeltaC ameliorates Atxn1-induced pathology in vivo via recovery of RORα-dependent transcription.</p>
<p id="Par39">Furthermore, we tested whether YAP or YAPdeltaC induced de-differentiation of primary cerebellar neurons prepared at P7 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). The concern was basically excluded, since YAP or YAPdeltaC even at high expression levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7A</xref>) did not induce tumor-like foci (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7B</xref>) or did not increase the number of cells positive for Ki67 (a tumor marker) and Sox2 (a de-differentiation marker), as revealed by immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7C</xref>) or western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7D</xref>).</p>

<title>YAPdeltaC rescues DNA damage in KI mice</title>

Western blot analyses of cerebellar tissues supported this conclusion (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8A, B</xref>, lower panels).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par42">The mouse genetic analyses performed in this study revealed that expression of YAPdeltaC during development, but not in adulthood, markedly ameliorated the behavioral and pathological phenotypes of <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice in adulthood (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Our results suggest that certain molecular signatures generated during development significantly influence late-onset phenotypes, and that these signatures act by restoring gene expression to optimal levels. YAP/YAPdeltaC and RORα are candidate components of such a molecular signature. At short timescales, mutant Atxn1 binds to YAP/YAPdeltaC and disrupts RORα-mediated transcription by depleting YAP/YAPdeltaC from the RORα complex. Shuttling of nuclear proteins between nuclear bodies, where transcription-related factors are stored, and the nucleoplasm, where the factors assemble to on histone-free and relaxed regulatory elements of target genes, is impaired by mutant Atxn1 and other polyQ proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, mutant Atxn1 could slow down the dynamic interactions of direct binding partners such as YAP/YAPdeltaC, and thereby impair transcription.</p>
<p id="Par43">Over longer periods of more than 7 days, the interaction with mutant Atxn1 decreased YAP/YAPdeltaC and RORα levels in a cell culture model via accelerated proteasome-mediated degradation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>). A similar decrease in YAP/YAPdeltaC and RORα levels was confirmed in vivo in mutant <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice at 21 days and 32 weeks of age (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Therefore, both acute and chronic mechanisms are likely to contribute to the suppression of RORα-mediated transcription of critical target genes that eventually causes the late-onset pathology of SCA1.</p>
<p id="Par44">We employed the NSE promoter for our Tet-ON system. If this promoter drove YAPdeltaC in cells other than Purkinje cells, this expression might have affected RORα-mediated transcription or TRIAD and contributed to the lifespan elongation observed in Group I mice. To explore this possibility, it will be necessary to characterize the gene expression patterns of NSE in other cell types, other regions of the brain, and other organs. Based on publicly available information in databases such as GeneCards (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ENO2">http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ENO2</ext-link>) and MGI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/gxd#gxd=nomenclature%3DNSE%26vocabTerm%3D%26annotationId%3D%26locations%3D%26locationUnit%3Dbp%26structure%3D%26structureID%3D%26theilerStage%3D0%26results%3D100%26startIndex%3D0%26sort%3D%26dir%3Dasc%26tab%3Dresultstab">http://www.informatics.jax.org/gxd#gxd=nomenclature%3DNSE%26vocabTerm%3D%26annotationId%3D%26locations%3D%26locationUnit%3Dbp%26structure%3D%26structureID%3D%26theilerStage%3D0%26results%3D100%26startIndex%3D0%26sort%3D%26dir%3Dasc%26tab%3Dresultstab</ext-link>), expression levels of NSE are very low in organs other than the brain, and within the brain expression is restricted to neurons. Based on our previous results, obtained using transgenic mice in which the same NSE promoter drove HMGB1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we can speculate about the gene’s expression pattern. Although expression was detected in neurons of various brain regions, the levels in Purkinje cells were substantially higher than in other neurons in different regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We also measured NSE expression in other organs, and confirmed that the levels were very low (data not shown).</p>
<p id="Par45">Therefore, although the effects of YAPdeltaC on RORα-mediated transcription or TRIAD (discussed later) in other brain regions or organs might have additively contributed to the phenotypic recovery of Group I mice, we consider it likely that a large proportion of the rescue effect of YAPdeltaC is derived from its activity in Purkinje cells. This hypothesis effectively explains why our results in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice (Sca1<sup>154Q/2Q</sup>) were consistent, but slightly improved with respect to lifespan with previous results obtained in transgenic mice harboring Pcp2/L7-promoter-driven Atxn1-82Q<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, in which mutant Atxn1 expression could be switched on or off specifically in Purkinje cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This speculation is also consistent with recent observations of polyQ/CAG repeat disease pathology in non-neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par46">Moreover, in human patients, most cases progress motor ataxia due to the loss of Purkinje cells, become bed-ridden, suffer insufficient food intake and aspiration pneumonia due to ataxia of pharyngeal muscles, and die. SCA1 patients with severer loss of Purkinje cells die at younger ages than SCA6 patients in which loss of Pukinje cells are not prominent. Therefore, the lifespan shortening/recovery in our mouse models based on Purkinje cell pathology may mimic the human natural history better than previous experimental reports.</p>
<p id="Par47">Our findings revealed that YAP/YAPdeltaC interacts with RORα via the second WW domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). Interestingly, YAP/YAPdeltaC also use the second WW domain to interact with mutant Htt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In both cases, YAP/YAPdeltaC are deprived of their partner transcription factors. In HD pathology, transcription mediated by TEAD, a partner transcription factor of YAP/YAPdeltaC, is impaired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This study provides the first evidence that RORα is a partner transcription factor of YAP/YAPdeltaC, and that RORα-mediated transcription is impaired in SCA1 pathology. Together, these two studies imply that YAP/YAPdeltaC-related gene expression represents a common pathological mechanism shared by multiple polyQ diseases.</p>
<p id="Par48">It is possible that YAP/YAPdeltaC influence apoptosis and increase resistance against SCA1-associated cerebellar degeneration, including the reduction in Purkinje cell numbers, independently of the hypothesized effect of YAP/YAPdeltaC on RORα-mediated transcription. However, YAP/YAPdeltaC did not affect expression levels of anti-apoptotic genes in Purkinje cells from P7 to 32 weeks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10</xref>). Since previous data suggested that cell death of Purkinje cells occur from 16 to 32 weeks in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, these data do not support the idea that the late-onset effects of YAPdeltaC in Group I mice are due to suppression of apoptosis.</p>
<p id="Par49">Another important observation was the delay in cell death downstream of YAP/YAPdeltaC dysfunction. Recently, we reported that a new form of necrosis, dependent on Hippo pathway signaling, contributes to the pathology of Huntington’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The impairment of TEAD–YAP-mediated transcription leads to a lengthy process of necrotic cell death. The morphological and molecular features of TEAD–YAP-dependent cell death were very similar to those of TRIAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, a Type 3 necrotic cell death induced by repression of transcription with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Accordingly, these two forms of cell death are considered identical. Ultra-structural and biochemical analyses of human postmortem tissue revealed that TRIAD actually occurs in human HD brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Given that target genes of TEAD-YAP transcription were suppressed in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice and recovered in Group I mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10</xref>), TEAD-YAP-mediated TRIAD might be a possible explanation for the late-onset effect of YAPdeltaC in Group I mice.</p>
<p id="Par50">From the perspective of neuronal dysfunction, dendrite abnormalities were observed in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice at 13 weeks, an age when the cell death of Purkinje cells was not obvious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the Hippo pathway has recently been implicated in synapse formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that functional impairment of YAP/YAPdeltaC during development until 8 weeks of age induces sequential processes, ranging from neuronal dysfunction to cell death in adulthood. Given that RORα plays a critical role in SCA1-associated neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and considering that the results our study reveal the close relationship between YAP/YAPdeltaC and RORα, it is very plausible that YAP/YAPdeltaC contribute to the adult-onset functional pathology of SCA1 by impairing RORα-mediated transcription during development. However, the effect exerted by YAP/YAPdeltaC on SCA1 pathology via TEAD-mediated transcription should be investigated in future studies.</p>
<p id="Par51">During the process of our paper evaluation, another group reported that TAZ, the mammalian homolog of YAP, functioned as a co-activator of ROR to promote Th17 cell differentiation through similar biochemical mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. These two independent but consistent results might open a new pathway from Hippo pathway to ROR family receptors that could be applied to multiple organs.</p>
<p id="Par52">Our results revealed that mutant, but not wild-type, Atxn1 depletes YAP/YAPdeltaC from the RORα complex. The first mechanism underlying the depletion would be proteasome-dependent degradation of YAP/YAPdeltaC after the YAP/YAPdeltaC–mutant Atxn1 complex formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3C</xref>). Second, presumably the nuclear dynamics of YAP/YAPdeltaC would be impaired by interaction with mutant Atxn1, as with RpA1 and VCP, whose nuclear dynamics are slowed and diminished by interaction with the mutant protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In addition, the nuclear sites of interaction between YAP/YAPdeltaC and Atxn1 and between RORα and YAP/YAPdeltaC are likely to differ, as demonstrated previously for different combinations of transcription factors that ultimately execute integrated functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Therefore, interaction of mutant Atxn1 with YAP/YAPdeltaC in one subdomain would prevent interaction of YAP/YAPdeltaC with RORα in another. However, the second explanation remains a hypothesis that should be critically tested in future analyses.</p>
<p id="Par53">The roles of YAP in DNA repair remain controversial. Two previous studies reported that YAP induces apoptosis in DNA-damaged cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This function is mediated by the YAP–p73 complex, which promotes expression of pro-apoptotic genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, in non-dividing neurons, YAP/YAPdeltaC functions as a protective factor against transcriptional repression-induced necrosis dependent on the YAP–TEAD complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In that context, DNA damage is promoted by transcriptional inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, whereas YAP/YAPdeltaC decreases the level of DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). Conversely, the discrepant functions of YAP/YAPdeltaC in DNA repair suggest that the proteins’ primary roles are related to transcriptional regulation, and that any effects on DNA damage are secondary.</p>
<p id="Par54">Regardless of the causative pathway, elevated DNA damage in stem cells decreases production of neurons. However, we did not observe a reduction in the abundance Purkinje cells at P21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Instead, our analysis revealed that developmental expression of YAP/YAPdeltaC before 8 weeks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>) is protective against late-onset death of Purkinje cells after 16 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). Atxn1 expression begins at E13.5–15 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:104783">http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:104783</ext-link>), and markedly increases at P14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In addition, protein aggregation and RNA foci of Atxn1 was not detected in <italic>Atxn1</italic>-KI mice until 40 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> far later than the onset age of motor symptom. Collectively, these findings suggest that the key mechanism by which YAPdeltaC ameliorates delayed cell death would be normalization of RORα-dependent and/or TEAD-dependent genes between E13.5 and 8 weeks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Therefore, identification of these downstream target genes would enable us to manipulate the late-onset cell death of SCA1 in the future.</p>
