<abstract>
<p>While rare pathogenic copy-number variants (CNVs) are associated with both neuronal and non-neuronal phenotypes, functional studies evaluating these regions have focused on the molecular basis of neuronal defects. We report a systematic functional analysis of non-neuronal defects for homologs of 59 genes within ten pathogenic CNVs and 20 neurodevelopmental genes in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Using wing-specific knockdown of 136 RNA interference lines, we identified qualitative and quantitative phenotypes in 72/79 homologs, including 21 lines with severe wing defects and six lines with lethality. In fact, we found that 10/31 homologs of CNV genes also showed complete or partial lethality at larval or pupal stages with ubiquitous knockdown. Comparisons between eye and wing-specific knockdown of 37/45 homologs showed both neuronal and non-neuronal defects, but with no correlation in the severity of defects. We further observed disruptions in cell proliferation and apoptosis in larval wing discs for 23/27 homologs, and altered Wnt, Hedgehog and Notch signaling for 9/14 homologs, including <italic>AATF/Aatf</italic>, <italic>PPP4C/Pp4-19C</italic>, and <italic>KIF11/Klp61F</italic>. These findings were further supported by tissue-specific differences in expression patterns of human CNV genes, as well as connectivity of CNV genes to signaling pathway genes in brain, heart and kidney-specific networks. Our findings suggest that multiple genes within each CNV differentially affect both global and tissue-specific developmental processes within conserved pathways, and that their roles are not restricted to neuronal functions.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Rare copy-number variants (CNVs), or large deletions and duplications in the genome, are associated with both neuronal and non-neuronal clinical features. Previous functional studies for these disorders have primarily focused on understanding the cellular mechanisms for neurological and behavioral phenotypes. To understand how genes within these CNVs contribute to developmental defects in non-neuronal tissues, we assessed 79 homologs of CNV and known neurodevelopmental genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models. We found that most homologs showed developmental defects when knocked down in the adult fly wing, ranging from mild size changes to severe wrinkled wings or lethality. Although a majority of tested homologs showed defects when knocked down specifically in wings or eyes, we found no correlation in the severity of the observed defects in these two tissues. A subset of the homologs showed disruptions in cellular processes in the developing fly wing, including alterations in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, human CNV genes also showed differences in gene expression patterns and interactions with signaling pathway genes across multiple human tissues. Our findings suggest that genes within CNV disorders affect global developmental processes in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues.</p>

While dosage alteration of CNV regions contribute predominantly to defects in nervous system development, several CNV-associated disorders also lead to early developmental features involving other organ systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref004">4</xref>], including cardiac defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref006">6</xref>], kidney malformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref007">7</xref>], craniofacial features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref003">3</xref>], and skeletal abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref008">8</xref>]. In fact, an overall survey of ten rare disease-associated CNVs among individuals within the DECIPHER database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref009">9</xref>] showed a wide range of non-neuronal phenotypes across multiple organ systems for each CNV disorder (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s009">S1 Data</xref>). For example, the 1q21.1 deletion causes variable expression of multiple neuronal and non-neuronal phenotypes, including developmental delay, autism, and schizophrenia as well as craniofacial features, cataracts, cardiac defects, and skeletal abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref012">12</xref>]. Additionally, while the 7q11.23 deletion associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) causes neuropsychiatric and behavioral features, other non-neuronal phenotypes, including supravalvular aortic stenosis, auditory defects, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and musculoskeletal and connective tissue anomalies, are also observed among the deletion carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the prevalence of non-neuronal phenotypes among CNV carriers, functional studies of CNV genes have primarily focused on detailed assessments of neuronal and behavioral phenotypes in model systems. For example, mouse models for the 16p11.2 deletion exhibited post-natal lethality, reduced brain size and neural progenitor cell count, motor and habituation defects, synaptic defects, and behavioral defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref016">16</xref>]. Similarly, mouse models for the 3q29 deletion showed decreased weight and brain size, increased locomotor activity, increased startle response, and decreased spatial learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref018">18</xref>]. However, fewer studies have focused on detailed evaluation of non-neuronal phenotypes in functional models of CNV disorders. For example, Arbogast and colleagues evaluated obesity and metabolic changes in 16p11.2 deletion mice, which showed reduced weight and impaired adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref019">19</xref>]. While Haller and colleagues showed that mice with knockdown of <italic>MAZ</italic>, a gene within the 16p11.2 deletion region, exhibit genitourinary defects also observed in individuals with the deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref020">20</xref>], mouse studies for other homologs of 16p11.2 genes, including <italic>TAOK2</italic>, <italic>KCTD13</italic>, and <italic>MAPK3</italic>, have only focused on assessing neuronal defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref025">25</xref>]. Furthermore, Dickinson and colleagues reported a high-throughput analysis of essential genes in mice and identified both neuronal and non-neuronal phenotypes for individual gene knockouts, including more than 400 genes that lead to lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref026">26</xref>]. While these efforts aided in implicating novel genes with human disease, our understanding of how genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders contribute towards non-neuronal phenotypes is still limited. Therefore, a large-scale analysis of non-neuronal phenotypes is necessary to identify specific candidate genes within CNV regions and associated biological mechanisms that contribute towards these phenotypes.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is an excellent model system to evaluate homologs of neurodevelopmental genes, as many developmental processes and signaling pathways are conserved between humans and flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref027">27</xref>]. In fact, over 75% of human disease genes have homologs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including many genes involved in cellular signaling processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref029">29</xref>]. We recently examined the contributions of individual <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs of 28 genes within the 16p11.2 and 3q29 deletion regions towards specific neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including rough eye phenotypes and defects in climbing ability, axon targeting, neuromuscular junction, and dendritic arborization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref031">31</xref>]. While these findings implicated multiple genes within each CNV region towards conserved cellular processes in neuronal tissues, the conserved role of these genes in non-neuronal tissues is not well understood. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing is an effective model system to evaluate such developmental defects, as key components of conserved signaling pathways, such as Notch, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Hegdehog, and Wnt pathways, were identified using fly wing models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref038">38</xref>]. Although fly wing phenotypes cannot be directly translated to human phenotypes, defects observed in fly wings can be used to assess how homologs of human disease genes alter conserved cellular and developmental mechanisms. For example, Wu and colleagues showed that overexpression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog for <italic>UBE3A</italic>, associated with Angelman syndrome, leads to abnormal wing and eye morphology defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref039">39</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant screens for developmental phenotypes, including wing defects, were used to identify conserved genes for several human genetic diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and syndromic microcephaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref040">40</xref>]. Kochinke and colleagues also recently performed a large-scale screening of ID-associated genes, and found an enrichment of wing trichome density and missing vein phenotypes in ID genes compared to control gene sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref041">41</xref>]. Hence, the fly wing provides a model system that is ideal for evaluating the contributions of individual homologs of CNV genes towards cellular and developmental defects.</p>
<p>In this study, we tested tissue-specific and cellular phenotypes of 79 total fly homologs, including 59 fly homologs of human genes within ten pathogenic CNV regions and 20 genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We used the adult fly wing to evaluate phenotypes in a non-neuronal tissue, and observed a wide range of robust qualitative and quantitative wing phenotypes among 136 RNA interference (RNAi) lines, including size defects, ectopic and missing veins, severe wrinkling, and lethality. Further analysis of cellular phenotypes revealed disruptions in conserved developmental processes in the larval imaginal wing disc, including altered levels of cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as altered expression patterns in the Wnt, Hedgehog, and Notch signaling pathways. However, we found no correlation in the severity of phenotypes observed with wing and eye-specific knockdown. These findings were further supported by differences in expression patterns and network connectivity of human CNV genes across different tissues. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of multiple genes within each CNV region towards both global and tissue-specific developmental processes.</p>

<title>Knockdown of fly homologs of CNV genes contribute to a range of wing defects</title>
<p>We used the <italic>bx</italic><sup><italic>MS1096</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4</italic> wing-specific driver to assess a total of 136 RNAi lines for 59 fly homologs of 130 total human genes within pathogenic CNV regions (chromosomal locations 1q21.1, 3q29, 7q11.23, 15q11.2, 15q13.3, 16p11.2, distal 16p11.2, 16p12.1, 16p13.11, and 17q12), as well as 20 fly homologs of human genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s010">S2 Data</xref>). Fly homologs of these genes were identified using the DIOPT orthology prediction tool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s010">S2 Data</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref042">42</xref>]. We list both the human gene name and the fly gene name for each tested gene as <italic>HUMAN GENE/Fly gene</italic> (i.e. <italic>KCTD13/CG10465</italic>), as well as the human CNV region for context at first instance. We scored 20–25 adult wings for five distinct wing phenotypes in each non-lethal RNAi line, including wrinkled wing, discoloration, ectopic veins, missing veins, and bristle planar polarity phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s011">S3 Data</xref>). We categorized adult female wing phenotypes based on their severity, and performed k-means clustering analysis to categorize each RNAi line by their overall phenotypic severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). We observed four clusters of RNAi lines: 75 lines with no observable qualitative phenotypes (55.2%), 24 lines with mild phenotypes (17.6%), 10 lines with moderate phenotypes (7.4%), 21 lines with severe phenotypes (15.4%), and 6 lines with lethal phenotypes (4.4%), including <italic>ACACA/ACC</italic> within 17q12, <italic>DLG1/dlg1</italic> within 3q29, and <italic>STX1A/Syx1A</italic> within 7q11.23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g002">Fig 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s011">S3 Data</xref>). We observed severe wrinkled wing phenotypes for 13/79 fly homologs, including <italic>PPP4C/Pp4-19C</italic> within 16p11.2, <italic>ATXN2L/Atx2</italic> within distal 16p11.2, <italic>AATF/Aatf</italic> within 17q12, and <italic>MFI2/Tsf2</italic> within 3q29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s012">S4 Data</xref>). Interestingly, seven out of ten CNV regions contained at least one homolog that showed lethality or severe wing phenotype, and five CNV regions (3q29, 16p11.2, distal 16p11.2, 16p12.1, and 17q12) had multiple homologs showing lethality or severe wing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s012">S4 Data</xref>). For example, RNAi lines for both <italic>UQCRC2/UQCR-C2</italic> and <italic>POLR3E/Sin</italic> within 16p12.1 showed lethality. Within the 3q29 region, <italic>NCBP2/Cbp20</italic> and <italic>MFI2/Tsf2</italic> showed severe phenotypes, while <italic>DLG1/dlg1</italic> showed lethality. In contrast, 12/20 known neurodevelopmental genes showed no observable wing phenotypes, suggesting that these genes could be responsible for neuronal-specific phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s012">S4 Data</xref>). We note that 18/79 fly homologs showed discordant phenotypes between two or more RNAi lines for the same gene, which could be due to differences in expression of the RNAi construct among these lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s012">S4 Data</xref>).</p>

<p>Certain qualitative phenotypes were present at a higher frequency in males compared to females among all non-lethal and non-severe RNAi lines (independent of k-means clustering analysis). For example, discoloration (87 lines in males compared to 55 lines in females; p = 1.315×10<sup>−4</sup>, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test) and missing vein phenotypes (92 lines in males compared to 29 lines in females; p = 2.848×10<sup>−16</sup>, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test) were more commonly observed in males than females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s011">S3 Data</xref>). In particular, 25/92 lines in males (compared to 1/29 lines in females) showed a total loss of the anterior crossvein (ACV) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s011">S3 Data</xref>). We further identified 17 RNAi lines that were lethal in males with wing-specific knockdown of fly homologs. While higher frequencies of wing phenotypes in males could be due to a sex-specific bias of developmental phenotypes, the increased severity we observed in males is most likely due to a stronger RNAi knockdown caused by X-linked dosage compensation, as the <italic>bx</italic><sup><italic>MS1096</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4</italic> driver is inserted on the fly X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Next, we measured the total adult wing area and lengths of six veins (longitudinal L2, L3, L4, L5, ACV, and posterior crossvein or PCV) in the adult wing for each of the tested RNAi lines that did not show lethality (or severe wrinkled phenotypes for vein length measurements) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Overall, we identified significant wing measurement changes for 89 RNAi lines compared to controls, which included lines that did not have an observable qualitative wing phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s011">S3 Data</xref>). A summary of L3 vein lengths is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, and the measurements for the remaining five veins are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s010">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s011">S3 Data</xref>. We found that 33/61 homologs (54.1%) showed significant changes in L3 vein length, including 20 homologs with longer vein lengths and 13 homologs with shorter vein lengths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s012">S4 Data</xref>). Additionally, 41/74 fly homologs (55.4%) showed changes in wing area, including 36 homologs which showed smaller wing areas and five homologs showed larger wing areas compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s012">S4 Data</xref>). For example, both homologs of genes within 1q21.1 region, <italic>BCL9</italic>/<italic>lgs</italic> and <italic>FMO5/Fmo-2</italic>, showed decreased wing area and vein length, potentially mirroring the reduced body length phenotype observed in mouse models of the deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref045">45</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). In addition, <italic>PAK2/Pak</italic> within 3q29, <italic>TBX1/org-1</italic> within 22q11.2, autism-associated <italic>CHD8/kis</italic>, and microcephaly-associated <italic>ASPM/asp</italic> also showed smaller wing areas and vein lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>TRPM1/Trpm</italic> within 15q13.3 and the cell proliferation gene <italic>PTEN/Pten</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref046">46</xref>] both showed larger wing areas and vein lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Furthermore, we identified eight homologs that showed no qualitative wing phenotypes, but had significant changes in wing areas and vein lengths, including <italic>CCDC101/Sgf29</italic> in distal 16p11.2, <italic>FMO5/Fmo-2</italic>, <italic>TRPM1/Trpm</italic>, <italic>DHRS11/CG9150</italic> in 17q12, and <italic>NSUN5/Nsun5</italic> in 7q11.23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s012">S4 Data</xref>). These results indicate that homologs of certain CNV genes may influence variations in size without causing adverse wing phenotypes, and may be specifically implicated towards cellular growth mechanisms.</p>

<p>We previously showed that many fly homologs of CNV genes that showed wing defects in the current study also contributed towards neuronal phenotypes in the fly eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref031">31</xref>], suggesting a role for these genes in global development. We therefore performed ubiquitous and eye-specific knockdown of fly homologs to assess tissue-specific effects in comparison to the wing phenotypes. First, we used the <italic>da-GAL4</italic> driver at 25°C to drive ubiquitous knockdown of RNAi lines for 31 homologs of CNV genes, including 19 that were previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref031">31</xref>]. We observed complete or partial lethality at larval and pupal stages with knockdown of 10/31 homologs (32.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Lethal phenotypes have also been documented for 43/130 knockout mouse models of individual CNV genes as well as for entire deletion regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s013">S5 Data</xref>). For example, mouse models heterozygous for the 16p11.2 deletion showed partial neonatal lethality, while knockout mouse models of four individual homologs of genes within the 16p11.2 region, including <italic>Ppp4C</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Kif22</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>, showed embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref048">48</xref>]. In our study, the <italic>DLG1/dlg1</italic> line that showed lethality with wing-specific knockdown also exhibited larval lethality with ubiquitous knockdown, indicating its role in global development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In addition, six homologs that showed severe wing phenotypes also showed larval or pupal lethality with ubiquitous knockdown, including <italic>ALDOA/Ald</italic> and <italic>PPP4C/Pp4-19C</italic> within 16p11.2 and <italic>ATXN2L/Atx2</italic> and <italic>TUFM/mEFTu1</italic> within distal 16p11.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<p>We next compared the phenotypes observed with wing-specific knockdown of fly homologs to their corresponding eye-specific knockdowns to evaluate tissue-specific effects. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye has been classically used to evaluate neuronal phenotypes due to genetic perturbations, as individual ommatidial units within the eye contain photoreceptor neurons that project into the optic lobe within the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref050">50</xref>]. In fact, numerous genes associated with human neurological disorders have been modeled using the fly eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref053">53</xref>]. To quantitatively assess the phenotypic severity of cellular defects with eye-specific knockdown of fly homologs, we developed a computational tool called <italic>Flynotyper</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref054">54</xref>] that quantifies the degree of disorganization among the ommatidia in the adult eye. We analyzed phenotypic scores obtained from <italic>Flynotyper</italic> for 66 RNAi lines of 45 fly homologs, including from previously published datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref054">54</xref>]. We found that 37/45 homologs (82.2%) exhibited both eye and wing-specific defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s014">S6 Data</xref>). Two homologs with significant eye phenotypes did not show any wing phenotypes, including <italic>SPNS1/spin</italic> within distal 16p11.2 and microcephaly-associated <italic>SLC25A19/Tpc1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref055">55</xref>], while five homologs only showed wing-specific phenotypes, including <italic>CDIPT/Pis</italic> and <italic>YPEL3/CG15309</italic> within 16p11.2, <italic>FBXO45/Fsn</italic> and <italic>OSTalpha/CG6836</italic> within 3q29, and <italic>UQCRC2/UQCR-C2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In particular, <italic>UQCRC2/UQCR-C2</italic> showed lethality with wing-specific knockdown, suggesting potential tissue-specific effects of this gene in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). While most homologs contributed towards both eye and wing-specific phenotypes, we observed a wide range of severity in eye phenotypes that did not correlate with the severity of quantitative or qualitative wing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). For example, <italic>TUFM/mEFTu1</italic> showed a severe wing phenotype but only a mild increase in eye phenotypic score, while <italic>SH2B1/Lnk</italic>, also within the distal 16p11.2 region, showed severe rough eye phenotypes but only a mild increase in wing size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Similarly, <italic>BCL9/lgs</italic> also showed opposing tissue-specific effects with mild qualitative wing phenotypes and severe eye phenotypes, suggesting that the role of these homologs towards development differs across tissue types.</p>

<title>CNV genes show variable expression across different tissues in flies and humans</title>
<p>To assess how expression levels of CNV genes vary across different tissues, we first examined the expression patterns of fly homologs in larval and adult tissues using the FlyAtlas Anatomical Microarray dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref056">56</xref>]. We found that 76/77 homologs with available data were expressed in at least one larval and adult tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s015">S7 Data</xref>). In general, we did not observe a correlation between wing phenotype severity and expression patterns of homologs in larval or adult tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). For example, 58/77 homologs (75.3%) showed ubiquitous larval expression, including both fly homologs that showed no qualitative wing phenotypes, such as <italic>KCTD13/CG10465</italic> within 16p11.2 and <italic>FBXO45/Fsn</italic>, and those with severe wing phenotypes, such as <italic>PPP4C/Pp4-19C</italic> and <italic>NCBP2/Cbp20</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, 30/39 homologs (76.9%) that showed eye phenotypes also had ubiquitous larval expression, providing further support to the observation that genes causing neuronal phenotypes may also contribute to developmental phenotypes in other tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s014">S6 Data</xref>). Of note, 9/77 homologs (11.7%) did not have any expression in the larval central nervous system (CNS), including <italic>FMO5/Fmo-2</italic>, <italic>BDH1/CG8888</italic> within 3q29, and <italic>TBX6/Doc2</italic> within 16p11.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). However, we observed wing phenotypes for 8/9 of these homologs, suggesting that they may contribute to tissue-specific phenotypes outside of the nervous system. Except for the epilepsy-associated <italic>SCN1A/para</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref057">57</xref>], which was exclusively expressed in both the larval central nervous system (CNS) and adult brain tissues, the other tested neurodevelopmental genes were also expressed in non-neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>

<title>Knockdown of fly homologs of CNV genes lead to disruption of cellular processes</title>
<p>Disruptions of basic cellular processes in neuronal cells, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis, have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref061">61</xref>]. We previously identified defects in cell proliferation among photoreceptor neurons in larval eye discs with knockdown of 16p11.2 homologs, as well as increased apoptosis with knockdown of a subset of 3q29 homologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref031">31</xref>]. Here, we explored how these basic cellular processes are altered in non-neuronal cells, specifically in the developing wing disc, with knockdown of homologs of CNV genes. We targeted 27 fly homologs that showed a range of adult wing phenotypes for changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis, using immunostaining for anti-phospho-Histone H3 Ser10 (pH3) and anti-<italic>Drosophila</italic> caspase-1 (dcp1), respectively, in the third instar larval wing discs. We identified 23/27 homologs that showed significant increases in apoptotic cells compared to controls, including seven homologs, such as <italic>PPP4C/Pp4-19C</italic>, <italic>ATXN2L/Atx2</italic>, and <italic>AATF/Aatf</italic>, which showed dcp1 staining across the entire larval wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s006">S6</xref> Figs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s016">S8 Data</xref>).

In particular, we evaluated the role of Wnt, Hedgehog, and Notch signaling pathways by testing the expression patterns of four key proteins within these pathways, including wingless (Wnt), patched (Hedgehog), engrailed (Hedgehog), and delta (Notch). We found that 9/14 homologs, including 8/10 homologs showing severe wing phenotypes or lethality, exhibited disruptions in at least one signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s016">S8 Data</xref>). For example, five homologs with severe or lethal phenotypes showed disruptions of all four signaling pathways, including <italic>AATF/Aatf</italic>, <italic>NCBP2/Cbp20</italic>, <italic>POLR3E/Sin</italic>, <italic>PPP4C/Pp4-19C</italic>, and <italic>KIF11/Klp61F</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g008">Fig 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s016">S8 Data</xref>). Our observations are in concordance with previous findings by Swarup and colleagues, who showed that <italic>PPP4C/Pp4-19C</italic> is a candidate regulator of Wnt and Notch signaling pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval wing discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref072">72</xref>]. Furthermore, two genes from the 3q29 region, <italic>DLG1/dlg1</italic> and <italic>MFI2/Tsf2</italic>, showed altered expression patterns for delta and patched but not for engrailed, indicating that they selectively interact with the Hedgehog as well as Notch signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In fact, Six and colleagues showed that Dlg1 directly binds to the PDZ-binding domain of Delta1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref073">73</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>ACACA/ACC</italic> and <italic>UQCRC2/UQCR-C2</italic> showed no changes in expression patterns for any of the four signaling proteins tested, suggesting that the observed lethality could be due to other cellular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). We conclude that several tested homologs disrupt the expression of key proteins in signaling pathways in the developing larval wing discs, potentially accounting for the developmental defects observed in the adult wings.</p>

<title>Connectivity patterns of CNV genes vary across human tissue-specific networks</title>
<p>We examined patterns of connectivity for nine candidate genes, based on disruptions of signaling pathways identified in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs, within the context of human brain, heart, and kidney-specific gene interaction networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref074">74</xref>]. These tissue-specific networks were constructed using Bayesian classifier-generated probabilities for pairwise genetic interactions based on co-expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref074">74</xref>]. Within each network, we calculated the lengths of the shortest paths between each candidate gene and 267 genes from the Wnt, Notch, and Hedgehog pathways as a proxy for connectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s017">S9 Data</xref>). In all three networks, each of the candidate genes were connected to a majority of the signaling pathway genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a higher connectivity (i.e. shorter path distances) between candidate genes and Wnt and Hedgehog pathway genes in the brain-specific network compared to the heart and kidney-specific networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). We further identified enrichments for genes involved in specific biological processes among the connector genes that were located in the shortest paths within neuronal and non-neuronal tissue-specific networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s017">S9 Data</xref>). For example, axon-dendrite transport, dopaminergic signaling, and signal transduction functions were enriched among connector genes only for the brain-specific network, while organelle organization and protein ubiquitination were enriched among connector genes only for kidney and heart networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). However, several core biological processes, such as cell cycle, protein metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and RNA processing/splicing, were enriched among connector genes within all three tissue-specific networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g009">Fig 9C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing as a model to assess how homologs of key CNV genes contribute towards non-neuronal phenotypes. We tested fly homologs of 79 genes and identified multiple homologs within each CNV region that exhibited robust phenotypes indicative of developmental disruptions. Several themes have emerged from our study highlighting the importance of fly homologs of CNV genes towards both global and tissue-specific phenotypes.</p>
<p><italic>First</italic>, we found that fly homologs of CNV genes contribute towards developmental phenotypes through ubiquitous roles in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Although we did not study models for the entire CNV, nearly all individual fly homologs of CNV genes contribute to wing-specific developmental defects. It is likely that these genes also contribute to additional phenotypes in other tissues that we did not assess. In fact, a subset of these homologs also showed early lethality with ubiquitous knockdown in addition to severe or lethal wing-specific phenotypes. However, we found no correlation between the severity of the eye and wing phenotypes, suggesting tissue-specific effects of these homologs towards developmental defects. In contrast, fly homologs of known neurodevelopmental genes generally showed milder wing phenotypes compared with eye phenotypes, indicating a more neuronal role for these genes. While our study only examined a subset of CNV genes with <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs, phenotypic data from knockout mouse models also support a global developmental role for individual CNV genes. In fact, 44/130 (33.8%) knockout models of CNV genes within the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref075">75</xref>] exhibited non-neuronal phenotypes, including 20 homologs of CNV genes that showed both neuronal and non-neuronal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s013">S5 Data</xref>). For example, knockout mouse models of <italic>Dlg1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> showed defects in dendritic growth and branching in the developing nervous system, in addition to craniofacial features and multiple kidney and urinary tract defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref076">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref079">79</xref>]. Furthermore, Chapman and colleagues showed that knockout of <italic>Tbx6</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> caused defects in mesodermal and neuronal differentiation early in development, leading to abnormal vascular, tail bud, and neural tube morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref080">80</xref>]. These observations further support our findings that most fly homologs of CNV genes have a global role in development that could account for the observed non-neuronal defects.</p>
<p><italic>Second</italic>, based on tissue-specific phenotypes, we identified fly homologs of CNV genes that are key regulators of conserved cellular processes important for development. For example, 9/10 homologs with severe or lethal adult wing phenotypes also exhibited defects in cell proliferation and apoptosis during development. In fact, we found concordance between cellular processes affected by wing and eye-specific knockdown of homologs of genes within 16p11.2 and 3q29 regions, including decreased proliferation for <italic>MAPK3/rl</italic> and increased apoptosis for <italic>NCBP2/Cbp20</italic> and <italic>DLG1/dlg1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref031">31</xref>]. While eye-specific knockdown of <italic>BDH1/CG8888</italic> showed decreased cell proliferation in larval eye discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref031">31</xref>], we found increased cell proliferation with wing-specific knockdown, suggesting a tissue-specific effect for this gene. Notably, at least one fly homolog per CNV region showed defects in cell proliferation or apoptosis, suggesting these cellular processes are important for development in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. For example, <italic>ATXN2L/Atx2</italic>, <italic>SH2B1/Lnk</italic>, and <italic>CCDC101/Sgf29</italic> each showed decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting a potential shared cellular mechanism for several genes within the distal 16p11.2 deletion. Furthermore, a subset of these genes also disrupted multiple signaling pathways, indicating a potential role for these homologs as key regulators of developmental processes. We specifically identified five homologs whose knockdown caused disruptions of Wnt, Notch, and Hedgehog signaling pathways. Each of these genes have important roles in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, transcription, or RNA processing, based on Gene Ontology annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref081">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref082">82</xref>]. In fact, we found that the RNA transport protein <italic>NCBP2/Cbp20</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref083">83</xref>], which we recently identified as a key modifier gene for the 3q29 deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref031">31</xref>], interfaced with all three signaling pathways. Furthermore, <italic>AATF</italic> disrupts apoptosis and promotes cell cycle progression through displacement of HDAC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref084">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref086">86</xref>], while <italic>PPP4C</italic> promotes spindle organization at the centromeres during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref087">87</xref>]. While we only evaluated the role of these genes towards development in a single fly tissue, our additional analysis of human gene interaction networks showed strong connectivity between the CNV genes and signaling pathways in multiple neuronal and non-neuronal human tissues. In fact, cell cycle genes were enriched among the connector genes in all three tested tissue-specific networks, further emphasizing the role of cell cycle processes towards developmental phenotypes. Notably, we also observed certain biological processes enriched among connector genes that were specific to neuronal or non-neuronal tissues, indicating that genes within CNV regions may affect different biological processes in a tissue-specific manner.</p>
<p><italic>Overall</italic>, we show that fly homologs of most CNV genes contribute towards global developmental phenotypes, although exactly how they contribute toward such phenotypes varies between neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Previous functional studies for CNV disorders have focused primarily on identifying candidate genes for the observed neuronal phenotypes. In this study, we identified several homologs of CNV genes that are responsible for non-neuronal defects, as well as novel associations between these homologs and conserved biological processes and pathways. We therefore propose that multiple genes within each CNV region differentially disrupt conserved cellular pathways and biological processes in neuronal versus non-neuronal tissues during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g010">Fig 10</xref>). These results are in line with a multigenic model for CNV disorders, as opposed to models where individual causative genes are responsible for specific phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref088">88</xref>]. Our study further exemplifies the utility of evaluating non-neuronal phenotypes in addition to neuronal phenotypes in functional models of individual genes and CNV regions associated with developmental disorders, including future studies in mammalian or cellular model systems. Further studies exploring how CNV genes interact with each other and with other developmental pathways could more fully explain the conserved mechanisms underlying global developmental defects and identify potential therapeutic targets for these disorders.</p>

<title>Phenotypic analysis of adult wing images</title>
<p>Adult progeny were isolated from crosses between RNAi lines and <italic>bx</italic><sup><italic>MS1096</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4</italic> driver shortly after eclosion, and kept at 25°C until day 2–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008792.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The progeny were then frozen at -80°C, and moved to -20°C prior to imaging. Approximately 20–25 progeny, both male and female, were collected for each RNAi line tested. The adult wings were plucked from frozen flies and mounted on a glass slide. The slides were covered with a coverslip and sealed using clear nail polish. Adult wing images were captured at 40X magnification using a Zeiss Discovery V20 stereoscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA), with a ProgRes Speed XT Core 3 camera and CapturePro v.2.8.8 software (Jenoptik AG, Jena, Germany).</p>

<p>Third instar larvae wing imaginal discs were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36930) for imaging using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus America, Lake Success, NY). Images were acquired using FV10-ASW 2.1 software (Olympus, Waltham, MA, USA). Composite z-stack images were analyzed using the Fiji ImageJ software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref095">95</xref>]. To calculate the number of pH3 positive cells within the wing pouch area of the wing discs, we used the AnalyzeParticles function in ImageJ, while manual counting was used to quantify dcp1-positive cells.

<title>Expression data analysis</title>
<p>We obtained tissue-specific expression data for fly homologs of CNV genes from the FlyAtlas Anatomical Microarray dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref056">56</xref>]. Raw FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads) expression values for each tissue were categorized as follows: &lt;10, no expression; 10–100, low expression; 100–500, moderate expression; 500–1000, high expression; and &gt;1000, very high expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s015">S7 Data</xref>). The median expression among midgut, hindgut, Malpighian tube, and (for adult only) crop tissues was used to represent overall gut expression. We similarly obtained human tissue-specific expression data for CNV genes from the GTEx Consortium v.1.2 RNA-Seq datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref058">58</xref>]. Median TPM (transcripts per million reads) expression values for each tissue were categorized as follows: &lt;3, no expression; 3–10, low expression; 10–25, moderate expression; 25–100, high expression; and &gt;100, very high expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s015">S7 Data</xref>). The median expression among all sub-types of brain and heart tissues was used to represent brain and heart expression, while the median expression among all colon, esophagus, small intestine, and stomach tissues was used to represent digestive tract expression. Tissue-specific preferential gene expression was determined if the expression of a gene within a particular tissue was greater than the third quartile of expression values for that gene across all tissues, plus 1.5 times the interquartile range. Venn diagrams were generated using the Venny webtool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny">http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Network analysis</title>
<p>We obtained human tissue-specific gene interaction networks for brain, heart, and kidney tissues from the GIANT network database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref074">74</xref>] within HumanBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hb.flatironinstitute.org">https://hb.flatironinstitute.org</ext-link>). These networks were built using a Bayesian classifier trained on tissue-specific gene co-expression datasets, which assigned posterior probabilities for interactions between pairs of genes within a particular tissue. We downloaded the “Top edge” version of each tissue-specific network, and extracted all gene pairs with posterior probabilities &gt;0.2 to create networks containing the top ~0.5% tissue-specific interactions. Next, we identified the shortest paths in each network between human CNV genes whose fly homologs disrupted signaling pathways in the larval wing disc and human genes within each disrupted pathway, using the inverse of the posterior probabilities as weights for each interaction in the network. Gene sets from the human Notch (KEGG:map04330), Wnt (KEGG:map04310) and Hedgehog pathways (KEGG:map04340) were curated from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref096">96</xref>]. Using the NetworkX Python package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref097">97</xref>], we calculated the shortest distance between each CNV gene and pathway gene, and identified connecting genes that were within each of the shortest paths for the three tissue-specific networks. We further tested for enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms (GO-Slim) among the connector genes using the PantherDB Gene List Analysis tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008792.ref098">98</xref>]. Lists of the shortest paths and connector genes in each tissue-specific network, as well as enriched GO terms for sets of connector genes, are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008792.s017">S9 Data</xref>.

<p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript entitled “Drosophila models of pathogenic copy-number variant genes show global and nonneuronal defects during development” by Yusuff and colleagues seeks to identify genes within neurodevelopmental disorder-associated copy number variants that might be responsible for phenotypes observed in patients carrying these CNVs. Although most studies have focused on the genes underlying the neurodevelopmental disorder aspects, the novelty of this study is that the authors focused on what genes might underlie the non-neuronal phenotypes. The manuscript is well written and clear, and the authors have done a substantial amount of work to identify putative developmental and/or cellular pathways perturbed when the products encoded by these genes are eliminated (this is a particularly strong section of the manuscript). The model organism they use is Drosophila with its powerful genetic toolkit, allowing the authors to screen large numbers of potential candidates using tissue-specific knockdown strategies, something that could not readily be accomplished in vertebrate systems. Although this strength is somewhat counterbalanced by the evolutionary distance between flies and humans (with a reasonable number of CNV-associated human genes either being absent or showing reduced levels of conservation in flies), the novelty of the study merits consideration for publication in PLoS Genetics. Addressing the concerns listed below would help strengthen the study and provide a more compelling argument for the use of flies to validate the genes.</p>
<p>1. While the authors provide intriguing data that identifies some of the likely contributors to the non-neuronal phenotypes, it would strengthen the paper if the authors could include in the study knockdown of a random selection of genes from a genomic interval of similar size to the pathogenic CNVs considered. For example, if 10/12 genes of a pathogenic CNV show non-neuronal phenotypes of varying severity, would a random selection of 10/12 genes from a similarly sized different region of the genome not associated with a pathogenic CNV give a similar result, or would the number of genes associated with phenotypes be reduced in number or severity? If the latter were the case, this would provide a strong argument that the pathogenic CNVs considered in this study are indeed enriched for developmentally important genes, and that flies are a reasonable proxy for identifying them.</p>
<p>2. It would help to have a figure that lays out how many genes per CNV would need to be considered for knockdown (the total number), and how many of those have fly orthologs that could be tested (Table S1 could be expanded for this). In addition, any genes within the CNVs known to be involved in any of the phenotypic anomalies present in cases carrying that CNV should be highlighted. Collectively, this would help to determine whether known genes responsible for at least a subset of the phenotypes (and are thus critically important) are able to be tested in flies. Finally, along the lines of the lgs/Fmo-2 and asp, it would be nice to show that additional phenotypes of the knockdowns of such fly genes have some relationship to the phenotypic anomalies in cases (e.g., a gene knockdown in flies resulting in reduced proliferation could be connected to a hypoplastic organ in cases).</p>
<p>3. It is unclear why wing-specific drivers would result in lethality unless the driver is not specific for wing expression. A second driver could be used for at least a subset of genes to address this issue, and confirm/refute the initial results. If a truly wing-specific driver were used, then knockdown of these genes should reveal a phenotype (since wing development is not required for viability).</p>
<p>4. How well does DIOPT predict orthologues? For example, many of the genes tested are ranked as moderate, with a range of DIOPT scores. This should be explained, including how much actual conservation exists for “moderate” genes with the various DIOPT scores.</p>
<p>5. The eye-specific knockdown experiments are meant to look at “neuronal defects,” but it is never explained why knockdown in the eye should give rise to neuronal defects. This needs to be explained.</p>
<p>6. Since flies do not have structurally conserved major vertebrate organs such as kidneys and lungs, it is more challenging to test pathways involved in their morphogenesis. (minor criticism)</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this manuscript the authors investigated genes associated with CNVs that have been shown to have neuronal effects in humans. They used RNAi to analyze and catalog non-neuronal effects for 79 drosophila homologs. They investigated phenotypic effects in wings and eyes using multiple RNAi drosophila lines. The classified phenotypic effects were systematically quantified into bins of severity. Homologs were then surveyed for disruptions in various cellular functions such as proliferation and apoptosis. I think this paper was well written, did a nice job in stating the conclusions that can be made from the analysis, but I have a few comments. The vast majority of them being cosmetic.</p>
<p>1. Some of the numbers, I am having a hard time to keep clear. For instance, line 145-146 “We observed four clusters of RNAi lines: 75 lines with no observable qualitative phenotypes (55.2%).” That would suggest that 61 lines had observable qualitative phenotypes. but then in line 163- “For example, discoloration (87 lines in males compared to 56 lines in females)”. That suggest that you observed discoloration in 87 lines. Does clustering group the mildest qualitative phenotypes as “no observable phenotypes” bin? If so, this could be clearer.</p>
<p>2. Line 159-161: “We note that 18/79 fly homologs showed discordant phenotypes between two or more RNAi lines for the same gene, which could be due to differences in expression of the RNAi construct among these lines.” Can this be confirmed with qPCR to see if certain RNAi lines are less effective than others?</p>
<p>3. It is not clear how the final total of 59 genes were determined. Did you identify the genes that would most likely affect nonneuronal phenotypes? Were they the only ones that had homologs and RNAi lines for? If the former, this could imply that their results might be an over estimation of the proportion of CNV genes that affect development. The authors do a good job not overstepping their results, but I feel like this should be discussed or clarified.</p>
<p>4. You removed the KK lines with the offsite tio target. Was this confirmed using the PCR assay or the crossing 40DUAS? This could be clearer. And if you used the PCR assay, I suggest the gel be a supplementary figure.</p>
<p>5. Homologs had varied phenotypic effects. Looking at figure 2A, homologs associated with CNV 16p11.2 had a higher proportion of lethal and or severe phenotypes than the others. Can you compare the CNVs against each other? Does that CNV have more severe phenotypic impacts than the other CNVs. Is it possible to associate your finding with severity of the particular CNVs in humans?</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>6. Some of the figure legends are long (like figure 1 and 4). In the case of figure 4, not much can be done but maybe for figure 1, part A could be its own figure.</p>
<p>7. Figure 6B and 6C could be rearranged to show the pattern described in the text. Instead of having the X axis ordered by their effects with respect to apoptosis and proliferation. Order the genes by their wing severity. As done in figure 4B.</p>
<p>8. In the introduction (line 119) you state you observed 79 genes. I think it should be done similar to figure 1 legend "We evaluated 59 Drosophila homologs of genes within 10 CNV regions and 20 known neurodevelopmental genes (79 total homologs)." This makes it clear what genes your looking at. Sometimes referring to 79 genes and then sometimes referring it as 59 genes +20 others made it unclear to follow the number of genes that was observed. Having it clear in the intro would help.</p>
<p>9. Also it is not clearly stated that the 20 neurodevelopment genes are CNV genes or not.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: In the revised manuscript entitled “Drosophila models of pathogenic copy-number variant genes show global and nonneuronal defects during development,” Yusuff and colleagues have done an exceptional job in addressing reviewer concerns. Although they were unable to find an overall enrichment of genes within pathogenic CNVs that produce severe phenotypes compared to similarlyc sized genomic intervals, they correctly point out that a significant percentage of genes within the fly genome are important developmental regulators suggesting that their distribution would be located throughout the genome. They also note that CNV generation is driven by the particular local genomic structure (seg dups, repeat sequences) implying that more pathogenic CNVs would likely be found in additional regions of the genome if the appropriate underlying genomic architecture was in place. Summarizing the data, Figure R1 is a useful addition to the manuscript.</p>
<p>Second, the reviewers have added the requested level of detail to Table R1 to better articulate which genes within a CNV were tested, which were not, the percentage identity of the orthologues, etc. Moreover, a better description of DIOPT has been provided, as well as a description of the neuronal components of the fly eye.</p>
<p>While I would have liked to see a second wing-specific driver used (given the lethal phenotypes associated with the bx MS1096) in order to sort out leaky non-wing expression issues, the overall effort of the authors to address the other concerns outweighs this relatively minor issue.</p>
