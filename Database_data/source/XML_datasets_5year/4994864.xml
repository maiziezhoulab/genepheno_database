<abstract>
<p>DNA Topoisomerases are essential to resolve topological problems during DNA metabolism in all species. However, the prevalence and function of RNA topoisomerases remain uncertain. Here, we show that RNA topoisomerase activity is prevalent in Type IA topoisomerases from bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. Moreover, this activity always requires the conserved Type IA core domains and the same catalytic residue used in DNA topoisomerase reaction; however, it does not absolutely require the non-conserved carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), which is necessary for relaxation reactions of supercoiled DNA. The RNA topoisomerase activity of human Top3β differs from that of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> topoisomerase I in that the former but not the latter requires the CTD, indicating that topoisomerases have developed distinct mechanisms during evolution to catalyze RNA topoisomerase reactions. Notably, Top3β proteins from several animals associate with polyribosomes, which are units of mRNA translation, whereas the Top3 homologs from <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast lack the association. The Top3β-polyribosome association requires TDRD3, which directly interacts with Top3β and is present in animals but not bacteria or yeast. We propose that RNA topoisomerases arose in the early RNA world, and that they are retained through all domains of DNA-based life, where they mediate mRNA translation as part of polyribosomes in animals.</p>

<body><sec id="SEC1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The first topoisomerase was discovered in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in 1971 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Since then, topoisomerases have been identified and characterized in numerous species from all domains of life. These enzymes are ‘magicians of the DNA world’, solving critical topological problems generated during DNA dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Topoisomerases uniquely catalyze DNA strand passage reactions. Type I topoisomerases can create a transient break on one strand, whereas Type II topoisomerases can produce breaks on both strands. Type IA and II enzymes then allow the unbroken strand(s) to pass through break(s) and rejoin the broken ends; whereas Type IB enzymes allow swiveling of the broken strand around the intact strand, and then re-ligate the broken ends. As a result, supercoils generated during replication can be relaxed, interlocked DNA rings can be separated, and DNA circles can be interconverted with knots.</p><p>Unlike the well-characterized DNA topoisomerases, RNA topoisomerases have received far less attention and their prevalence, function and mechanism of action are largely unknown. To date, only two proteins have been reported to possess topoisomerase activity for RNA–<italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase III (EcoTop3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and human topoisomerase 3β (HumTop3β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Both belong to the Type IA family of topoisomerases, hinting that this family may have dual activities for both DNA and RNA. However, two other members of the type IA family from identical species, <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase I (EcoTop1) and human topoisomerase 3α (HumTop3α), lack RNA topoisomerase activity. The reason for this difference remains unclear. For human Top3 paralogs, however, the difference probably involves an RGG box RNA-binding domain that is present only in Top3β but not Top3α. Deletion of this domain strongly reduces the RNA topoisomerase activity of Top3β, suggesting that the domain targets the enzyme to RNA to enable strand passage reactions.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that Top3β interacts with other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to regulate mRNA translation. First, Top3β forms a stoichiometric complex with TDRD3 (Tudor domain-containing 3), and this complex biochemically and genetically interacts with FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), an RBP that is deficient in Fragile X syndrome and is known to regulate translation of mRNAs important for neuronal function and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Notably, the interaction between Top3β–TDRD3 complex and FMRP is abolished by a disease-associated FMRP mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>); and Top3β gene deletion has also been linked to schizophrenia and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Second, Top3β has been reported to bind many mRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>, and these mRNAs are enriched with known FMRP targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Moreover, the distribution of Top3β-binding sites on mRNAs is similar to that of FMRP—dense in open reading frames and sparse in untranslated regions, again supporting the notion that the two proteins work together in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Third, Top3β resembles TDRD3 and FMRP in its association with active-translating polyribosomes, and its localization in RNA stress granules, which are aggregations of non-translating mRNAs formed transiently in response to cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Fourth, Top3β binds multiple mRNAs encoding proteins with neuronal functions related to schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Expression of one such gene, ptk2/FAK (protein kinase 2/focal adhesion kinase) is reduced in synapses at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of Top3β mutant flies. Synapse formation is defective in both flies and mice deleted for Top3β, as observed in FMRP mutant animals. These data suggest that Top3β works with FMRP and TDRD3 to regulate expression of mRNAs important for neurodevelopment and mental health.</p><p>Here, we investigate three salient questions regarding RNA topoisomerases: (i) how prevalent are they? (ii) which domains are required for their activity? And (iii) do they associate with polyribosomes as human Topoisomerase 3β does? Our results show that RNA topoisomerase activity is prevalent in Type IA topoisomerases from all domains of life. Moreover, the activity requires the conserved Type IA core domains and the same catalytic residue used in DNA topoisomerase reactions, but does not absolutely require the non-conserved CTD. Finally, RNA topoisomerases from animals associate with polyribosomes, whereas those from bacteria and yeast do not; and this association requires TDRD3, which is present in animals but absent in bacteria and yeast. Our data suggest that RNA topoisomerases are prevalent in all domains of life, and may participate in mRNA translation in animals.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell culture, media, siRNAs and antibodies</title><p>Human HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37<sup>o</sup>C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

To summarize, forward (TTCGGAGAGACCACCGCGAGAGCG) and reverse (AACCGCTCTCGCGGTGGTCTCTCC) primers were selected from the CRISPR optimal target finder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tools.flycrispr.molbio.wisc.edu/targetFinder/">http://tools.flycrispr.molbio.wisc.edu/targetFinder/</ext-link>). Two phosphorylated oligos (10 μM) in a mixture containing NEB T4 ligation buffer were heated to 95°C and the annealing process occurred after gradually cooling the mixture to 25°C. The pAc-sgRNA-Cas9 vector was obtained from Addgene (plasmid # 49330) and digested with BspQ1. The linearized vector was ligated using the annealed oligo insert and transformed into GC10 competent cells (Sigma). Sequencing confirmed the correct inserts.</p><p>For transfection, 2 μg of CRISPR plasmid was transfected in 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> of S2 cells cultured in Schneider's medium (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 25°C using Fugene HD transfection reagent (Promega). Transfections were performed in six-well plate. After 3 days, puromycin was added to final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and cells were transferred to 10 cm dish. After 4 days, cells were transferred to four 96-well plates at different dilutions. Once the cells reached confluency, they were collected, and the genomic DNAs were amplified using primers (GATAATAGTATGCACCGTCAGCCGA) and (AGATTCAGTTGGGGAACTGGCT), followed by sequencing. Western blotting was used to screen the absence of TDRD3 protein in the knockout cells.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-4"><title>Expression and purification of recombinant topoisomerases from different species</title><p>Recombinant EcoTop1 wildtype and mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

RNA topoisomerase assay reaction for TmaTop1 and NeqTop3 was incubated at 50°C. In RNA topoisomerase reaction using reverse gyrase proteins, 1 mM ATP was also included into the reaction buffer. Phenol:choloroform:isoamylalcohol was used to stop the reaction and distinguish the RNA knot from the RNA-protein complex which produces a gel-shift with distinct mobility compared to the RNA knot. It should be mentioned that we cannot convert more than 33% of the circles to knots in our assay. There are at least two possible explanations. First, the topoisomerase can convert not only a circle to a knot, but also a knot to a circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Because the topoisomerase assay used here is a reversible reaction, the extent of the reaction is determined by not only the forward reaction rate, but also the reverse reaction rate. When large amounts of circles are converted to knots, the reverse reaction rate may become larger than the forward reaction, until the reaction reaches an equilibrium. Second, only about 33% the circular substrates may be folded correctly to allow knot formation, whereas the other substrates may be folded into conformations that prevent knot formation.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-7"><title>Polyribosome assay</title><p>The polyribosome assay for human HEK293 cells was done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).

We started with Type IA topoisomerases because they are the most ubiquitous topoisomerases present in nearly all species. The prototype of this family is EcoTop1, which is the first DNA topoisomerase discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Notably, EcoTop1 was reported to lack RNA topoisomerase activity using assays that interconvert a single-strand (ss) RNA between two different topological forms: a circle and a knot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This feature differs from that of its paralog, EcoTop3, which displays RNA activity in the same assays. We found these results puzzling because the two <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerases share high degrees of sequence and structure similarity in their catalytic core domains (Toprim and domains II–IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). We therefore re-examined EcoTop1 in an RNA knotting assay previously employed by our group, which shows that humTop3β can convert an ssRNA circle to a knot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

When one complementary region forms a duplex, the other region requires a strand-passage reaction to form a stable duplex. However, one important difference is that our substrate has complementary regions of 12 bp, which are longer than the 10 bp used in Seeman's study. The longer complementary regions should further stabilize the duplex and make the strand-passage reactions thermodynamically more favorable.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><italic>E. coli</italic> Topoisomerase I has RNA topoisomerase activity that depends on the conserved Type IA core domains but not the non-conserved CTD.

Combined with earlier findings, these data demonstrate that RNA topoisomerase activity is prevalent in all three domains of life. Our data also show that Type IA topoisomerases have evolved from enzymes with dual activities in unicellular organisms (bacteria, archaea and yeast) into multi-protein complexes with restricted activities in animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). For example, two Type IA enzymes from <italic>E. coli</italic> (Top1 and Top3) have dual activities for both DNA and RNA, whereas only one of the two human Type IA paralogs (Top3β) has RNA topoisomerase activity. Moreover, the two human Top3 paralogs comprise distinct complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), with the Top3β complex containing a RBP (FMRP) and the Top3α complex a DNA helicase (BLM). The data suggest that Type IA topoisomerases have evolved into functionally distinct complexes in animals, with only Top3β complex acting on RNA. It should be mentioned that Top3β also has DNA topoisomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and can reduce transcription-induced R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Thus, the Top3β complex may work in both DNA and RNA metabolism.</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Type IA topoisomerases have evolved from enzymes with dual activities in microorganisms to multi-protein complexes with distinct functions in animals; RNA topoisomerases may originate in the RNA world and are conserved through evolution. (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of evolution of Type IA topoisomerases in DNA and RNA metabolism. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, both Type IA enzymes (Top1 and Top3) have dual activities that can catalyze topoisomerase reactions on DNA and RNA. In yeast, the only Type IA enzyme is part of a complex (Top3-Rmi1) that also has dual activities for DNA and RNA. In human, only one of the two Type IA paralogs, Top3β, has RNA topoisomerase activity, whereas Top3α does not. Interestingly, Top3β, but not Top3α, has acquired during evolution a <italic>bona fide</italic> RNA-binding domain (RGG box) that is required for its RNA topoisomerase activity. Moreover, the two Top3 paralogs comprise two distinct complexes, with the Top3β complex containing a RNA binding protein (FMRP), whereas the Top3α complex containing a DNA helicase (BLM). These data argue that Type IA topoisomerases have evolved into two functional distinct complexes in animals, one for RNA and DNA (Top3β-TDRD3-FMRP), and one for DNA only (Top3α-Rmi1-Rmi2-BLM). (<bold>B</bold>) A model of origin and evolution of Type IA topoisomerases and their activity for RNA and DNA. It has been postulated that life starts with a pool of self-replicating RNAs; and there exists an RNA world with RNA genome prior to the current DNA world. We propose that Type IA enzymes may originate in the RNA world to solve topological problems during RNA metabolism. When the RNA world evolved and was eventually replaced by the DNA world, many of these enzymes retained their RNA topoisomerase activity while developing a new activity for DNA. This may explain the prevalence of the RNA topoisomerase activity in Type IA enzymes from all three domains.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkw508fig7"></graphic></fig><p>Type IA enzymes are among very few proteins that are involved in DNA metabolism and are also present in nearly all organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). They have been proposed to exist in the Last Unknown Common Ancestors (LUCAs) for the three domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). It has been postulated that life started with a pool of self-replicating RNAs, and that an RNA world with RNA genome preceded the current DNA world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). It has also been hypothesized that LUCAs may have an RNA genome, or an RNA/DNA hybrid genome, or a DNA genome with an RNA replication intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). The finding that Type IA enzymes possess RNA topoisomerase activity supports these RNA genome-based hypotheses. Moreover, the result implies that Type IA enzymes may have originated in the RNA world to solve RNA topological problems during duplication and segregation of the RNA genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>); these roles may be comparable to those of DNA topoisomerases, which are essential in replication and segregation of the DNA genome. When much of the RNA function was eventually replaced by DNA, many Type IA enzymes retained their RNA activity while developing additional activity for DNA. This could rationalize the prevalence of the RNA topoisomerase activity in Type IA enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-2"><title>RNA and DNA topoisomerases partially overlap in mechanism</title><p>Which domains are required for RNA topoisomerase activity, and is this requirement the same for the DNA topoisomerase activity? Our analyses of EcoTop1 mutants revealed that the conserved Type IA core domains are both necessary and sufficient for its RNA topoisomerase activity, whereas the non-conserved CTD is dispensable. This feature resembles that of EcoTop1 topoisomerase activity in DNA catenation assay, which also depends on the core domain but not on the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Moreover, the strictly conserved catalytic Tyr residue essential for the DNA topoisomerase reaction is also necessary for RNA topoisomerase activity of all Type IA enzymes tested from bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. We infer that DNA and RNA topoisomerase reactions share common mechanisms, including the use of the same catalytic Tyr residue.</p><p>Although the CTD is dispensable for EcoTop1 in RNA topoisomerase reaction, it is required for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA and for rescuing the temperature-sensitivity phenotype of its mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). These results suggest that the DNA relaxation activity may have evolved after the RNA topoisomerase activity. We hypothesize that in the RNA world, the ancestral RNA topoisomerase may have contained only the conserved Type IA core domain, which is sufficient for its RNA topoisomerase activity; and later in the DNA world, the enzyme acquired the CTD domain and developed DNA relaxation activity. The large diversity in CTDs observed in Type IA enzymes from different species is consistent with its late acquisition. The evolution of RNA topoisomerases is further exemplified by findings that although CTD is dispensable for RNA topoisomerase activity of EcoTop1, it is critical for the activity of humTop3β. Moreover, the CTD of humTop3β has a unique RGG RNA-binding motif absent in humTop3α, which is also important for the RNA topoisomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Why does Top3β from animals require its CTD domain for RNA topoisomerase activity, whereas bacterial Top1 does not? One possible explanation is that the Type IA core domains in Top3 homologs of animals (Top3α and Top3β) may have evolved to possess low RNA-binding affinity, in contrast to those from bacterial and yeast that have high RNA affinity. The low RNA-affinity core domains allow animals to use a CTD of high RNA affinity and a CTD of low affinity to distinguish its RNA topoisomerase (Top3β) from its DNA topoisomerase (Top3α), respectively. The advantage of such a system is that it can prevent the DNA topoisomerase (Top3α) from being trapped mistakenly by RNA molecules and mislocalized in non-functional compartments, such as the cytoplasm. Consistent with this hypothesis, only Top3β, but not Top3α, localizes in cytoplasmic RNA stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and stably associates with mRNAs in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-3"><title>RNA topoisomerases from animals have TDRD3-dependent association with polyribosomes</title><p>We and others have recently discovered that human Top3β, together with its interacting partners TDRD3 and FMRP, associate with polyribosomes, the machine of mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Here we extended this analysis and found that Top3β, TDRD3, and FMRP homologs from other animals (chicken and Drosophila) also associate with polyribosomes. In contrast, Top3β homologs from the yeast and bacteria have no detectable association. The data suggest that during evolution, RNA topoisomerases in animals have acquired unique features that allow them to function in mRNA translation as part of polyribosomes. Consistent with this suggestion, Top3β homologs in animals have at least two structural features that are absent in their counterparts in yeast, archaea and bacteria: one, they contain the unique RGG RNA binding motif; and two, they form a stable complex with TDRD3 and FMRP. We further demonstrated that the polyribosome association of Top3β homologs in human, chicken and Drosophila cells all require TDRD3 (but not FMRP). Because TDRD3 is capable of interacting with multiple translation factors through its different protein-binding modules, such as Tudor domain, FMRP-binding motif, and EBM motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), it may act as a bridge that targets Top3β to polyribosomes and other translation components. We propose that Top3β and TDRD3 work coordinately as a complex on polyribosomes to regulate mRNA translation in animals.</p><p>It should be pointed out that although Type IA enzymes can catalyze RNA topoisomerase reactions in vitro and associate with polyribosomes in vivo, it remains to be determined whether they actually catalyze RNA topoisomerase reactions in vivo. Future work is necessary to identify the exact RNA metabolic reactions that require these topoisomerases. In addition, the TDRD3 homologs from plants are structurally different from those of animals in their C-terminal domains: they lack the Tudor, UBA and FMRP-interaction domains, but contain a predicted RGG-RNA-binding motif (Supplemental Figure S7A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), hinting that they may interact with RNA differently compared to their animal counterparts. Whether plant Top3β associates with polyribosome in a TDRD3-dependent manner remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-4"><title>The RNA topoisomerase complex Top3β-TDRD3 originates in unicellular eukaryotes and has evolved into two distinct forms in animals and plants</title><p>Our phylogenetic analyses of the current NCBI database revealed several interesting observations regarding evolution of Top3β–TDRD3 complex. First, while yeast has a single Top3 protein, several species of fungi have two distinctive Top3 paralogs, with one resembling Top3α and the other one Top3β (Supplemental Figure S7A), indicating that Top3β diverged from Top3α in unicellular eukaryotes. Second, we have previously noted that Top3β in animals and plants contains a distinctive RGG box at its C-terminus; and this box is absent in Top3α from animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Here we find that the RGG box is conserved in not only Top3β, but also Top3α, in both fungi and plants (Supplemental Figure S7A and S7B); but it is absent in Type IA enzymes of yeast, bacteria and archaea. These findings imply that the eukaryotic ancestor of Type IA topoisomerases may have acquired the RGG box through gene-fusion prior to its duplication and subsequent divergence into two distinctive Top3 paralogs. In animals, Top3α may have lost its RGG box after the enzyme became an exclusive DNA topoisomerase, so that this RNA-binding box became dispensable. Third, TDRD3 co-exists with Top3β in not only animals and plants, but also several species of fungi (Supplemental Figures S7A, S8, and S9). In contrast, FMRP is present only in animals (Supplemental Figures S7A and S10). The data suggest that the Top3β–TDRD3 complex originated in unicellular eukaryotes and is conserved in both animals and plants, whereas the Top3β–TDRD3–FMRP complex was created later during evolution and existed in only animals. Fourth, TDRD3 homologs in fungi lack the C-terminal Tudor, UBA, and the FMRP-binding motif, which are present in TDRD3 of animals but absent in TDRD3 of plants (Supplemental Figure S7A). Notably, TDRD3 from several species of fungi also contain a predicted RGG box, which is present in TDRD3 of plants but not animals, suggesting that the Top3β–TDRD3 complex in animals may have diverged more from its ancestor than the one in fungi and plants. It would be interesting to study whether both Top3α and Top3β complexes from fungi and plants have RNA topoisomerase activity, which may reveal unique mechanisms of these enzymes in RNA metabolism.</p></sec></sec>
