<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder in which tumors develop due to TSC1/TSC2 loss and activation of mTORC1.

<abstract>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by tumor development in the brain, heart, kidney, and lungs. In TSC tumors, loss of the TSC1/TSC2 protein complex leads to activation of mTORC1 with downstream effects on anabolism and cell growth. Because mTORC1 activation enhances mRNA transcription, we hypothesized that aberrant mTORC1 activation might confer TSC-null cell dependence on transcriptional regulation. We demonstrate that TSC1- or TSC2-null cells, in contrast to their wild-type counterparts, are sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of CDK7. Mechanistic studies revealed that CDK7 inhibition markedly reduces glutathione levels and increases reactive oxygen species due to reduced expression of NRF2 and glutathione biosynthesis genes. Treatment of both <italic>Tsc2<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mice and a TSC1-null bladder cancer xenograft model with a CDK7 inhibitor showed marked reduction in tumor volume and absence of regrowth in the xenograft model. These results suggest that CDK7 inhibition is a promising therapeutic approach for treatment of TSC-associated tumors and cancers with mutations in either <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic>.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome characterized by seizures, autism, and tumors of the brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma), heart (rhabdomyoma), kidney (angiomyolipoma), skin (angiofibroma), and lungs (lymphangioleiomyomatosis [LAM]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Henske et al., 2016</xref>). TSC is caused by germline loss-of-function mutations in either <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Slegtenhorst et al., 1997</xref>), which encode the proteins hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), respectively. Hamartin, tuberin, and TBC1D7 form the TSC protein complex, which negatively regulates the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) via the small GTPase Rheb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dibble et al., 2012</xref>). mTORC1 consists of the core constituent mTOR (product of the <italic>MTOR</italic> gene) and several regulatory proteins and phosphorylates multiple downstream proteins to promote protein, nucleotide, and lipid biosynthesis as well as anabolism and cell growth, while limiting autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hara et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yecies et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Sahra et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of mTORC1 inhibitors for treatment of multiple tumor types seen in TSC, as well as sporadic renal angiomyolipoma and LAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Franz et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bissler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krueger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCormack et al., 2011</xref>). For example, rapamycin (sirolimus), which inhibits mTORC1 by binding FKBP12, has been shown to slow loss of lung function in LAM and decrease the size of TSC-associated angiomyolipoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bissler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCormack et al., 2011</xref>). Everolimus, a rapamycin analogue (“rapalog”), also causes reduction in TSC-associated tumor size and is Food and Drug Adminstration–approved for the treatment of angiomyolipoma and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krueger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Franz et al., 2013</xref>). In vitro studies have shown that rapalogs have a predominantly cytostatic effect on cells with loss of either TSC1 or TSC2, hereafter denoted TSC-deficient cells. In addition, TSC-associated tumors regrow and LAM lung function declines when rapalog therapy is discontinued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Franz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bissler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCormack et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, continuous rapalog therapy appears to be necessary in both adults and children with TSC-associated tumors to maintain tumor growth control. Both short-term and long-term toxicity from rapalogs has led to recognition of a critical need for better, more effective therapies for TSC-associated neoplasms.</p><p>Activated mTORC1 has two primary downstream targets, 4E-BP1 and S6 kinase, which have multiple downstream effects including the promotion of protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hara et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, mTORC1 has major effects on transcription, through phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yokogami et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Onda et al., 2002</xref>), activation and nuclear accumulation of SREBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Düvel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yecies et al., 2011</xref>), activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim and Chen, 2004</xref>), activation of HIF1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brugarolas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El-Hashemite et al., 2003</xref>), and inhibition of transcription factor EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Settembre et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>TFIIH is a 10-subunit protein complex that is highly ancestrally conserved (including yeast) and regulates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rimel and Taatjes, 2018</xref>). Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is a core component of TFIIH and is also part of a dissociable three-subunit kinase module (consisting of MAT1, Cyclin-H, and CDK7) known as the CDK-activating kinase complex. CDK7 phosphorylates Ser5 and Ser7 of a heptapeptide repeat in RNA Pol II in a dynamic, tightly regulated manner to regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Larochelle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, a covalent inhibitor of CDK7, THZ1, was discovered, and studies have suggested that CDK7 is a rational therapeutic target in a number of cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chipumuro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwiatkowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). These studies also showed that THZ1 inhibition of CDK7 led to transcriptional effects on core transcription factors that were highly marked by acetylation at histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac), so-called “superenhancers,” and that this appeared to be an important mechanism for induction of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chipumuro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwiatkowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Since cells and tumors lacking the TSC complex, as well as those with activating mutations in <italic>MTOR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grabiner et al., 2014</xref>), have constitutive mTORC1 activation, and this effect has multiple transcriptional as well as translational effects, we hypothesized that TSC-deficient cells might show selective sensitivity to THZ1. Indeed, treatment of TSC-deficient cells with THZ1 led to profound effects on cell metabolism, growth, and survival in comparison to effects in wild-type or intact derivative cells at similar doses. THZ1 treatment led to marked reduction in expression of NRF2 (encoded by <italic>NFE2L2</italic>) and genes involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis; marked depletion of GSH; and an increase in ROS levels in TSC-deficient cells, leading to cell death. Importantly, THZ1 treatment led to regression of both xenograft and transgenic TSC-deficient tumor models. Overall, our data suggest that inhibition of transcription-associated kinases such as CDK7 in mTORC1-driven tumors leads to enhanced oxidative stress through reduced expression of NRF2 and downstream genes, and that this may be an effective therapeutic approach for TSC-deficient tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>CDK7 inhibition by THZ1 selectively inhibits the growth of TSC-deficient cells</title><p>To investigate whether the proliferation of TSC-deficient cells is sensitive to CDK7 inhibition, we treated paired TSC-deficient/TSC-intact cell lines with increasing concentrations of THZ1. THZ1 showed selective inhibition of proliferation in TSC-deficient cells versus TSC-intact cell lines (<italic>n</italic> = 6 cell line pairs, 4 <italic>TSC2</italic>-null, 2 <italic>TSC1</italic>-null, including both addback and native TSC-intact cell lines; Table S1 and Fig. S1 A) in a standard 96-well plate 5-d growth assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the TSC-deficient cell lines was 8–36-fold lower (median IC<sub>50</sub> 26.5 nM, range 16–39 nM) versus the corresponding TSC-intact lines (median 475 nM, range 190–660 nM; Fig. S1 B). Phase-contrast imaging demonstrated that THZ1 treatment (30 nM, 72 h) resulted in dramatic cell death in TSC-deficient cells compared with TSC-intact cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In addition, low-dilution-plating colony formation assays (10 d) showed that there was a marked reduction in colony formation in TSC-deficient cells in 30 nM THZ1, in contrast to control TSC-intact lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Furthermore, apoptotic cell death was selectively induced by THZ1 treatment of TSC-deficient cells, as assessed by propidium iodide (PI) staining, and production of cleaved caspase 3, again in contrast to TSC-intact cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>; and Fig. S1, C and D).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>THZ1 inhibition of CDK7 leads to selective growth inhibition and apoptosis of TSC mutant cells.

CDK7 is a member of the CDK-activating kinase complex of the TFIIH transcription initiation complex that plays a critical role in regulation of transcription through phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Pol II at multiple sites. TSC-deficient and TSC-intact cell lines displayed a similar dose-responsive reduction in RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation in response to THZ1 treatment without affecting total RNA Pol II levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 F</xref> and S1, E and F), suggesting that neither differential uptake of THZ1 nor differential inhibition of CDK7 explained the genotype-specific effect. Together, these data indicate that THZ1 inhibits growth and induces cell death in a TSC-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>TSC-deficient cells are highly dependent on CDK7 for survival and proliferation</title><p>CDK7, and to a lesser extent CDK12/CDK13, is inhibited by THZ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chipumuro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwiatkowski et al., 2014</xref>).

KO of CDK7 resulted in a marked reduction in growth of both TSC-deficient (Fig. S2 A, 83–86%), and TSC-intact (Fig. S2 A, 58–62%) cell lines. Similarly, CDK7-KO TSC-deficient cell lines showed a near absence of growth in low-dilution-plating colony formation long-term assays, which was much more reduced than was seen for CDK7-KO TSC-intact control lines in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, left two panels). We also used shRNA to decrease expression of CDK7 in paired TSC2-null and TSC2-intact MEF cells, which showed a significant reduction in expression of CDK7, with similar major effects on both proliferation and growth in low-dilution-plating colony formation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>, right panels). Similar results were seen in the TSC2-null 621.101 cell line, using siRNA to CDK7 (Fig. S2 B). To investigate the growth properties of CDK7-KO cells in vivo, we injected two CDK7-KO TSC1-null HCV.29 cell lines, generated with different guide RNAs (gRNAs), into the flanks of nude mice and observed near absence of xenograft formation. In contrast, robust xenograft growth occurred in controls, necessitating mouse sacrifice at 51 d after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

Two different TSC-deficient cell lines showed a differential sensitivity to ML385 in comparison to TSC-intact controls, with a four- to sixfold difference in IC<sub>50</sub> (Fig. S4 L).

Collectively, these tumors have an incidence of near 100% in TSC individuals and require surgical or medical intervention in more than one quarter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Henske et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A major breakthrough in our understanding of the pathogenesis of TSC occurred when the role of the TSC protein complex in the regulation of the rheb GTPase, and of mTORC1, was discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Inoki et al., 2003</xref>). This led to in vitro and in vivo animal model studies proving the benefit of rapalog therapy and rapid introduction of these therapies into TSC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Franz et al., 2006</xref>). Although efficacious in many patients, rapalog therapy has not been shown to exhibit universal benefit in those with TSC. In addition, although tumor regression is seen in response to rapalogs in multiple types of TSC-associated tumors, the degree of response is modest in most cases, rarely meeting RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) v1.1 criteria for response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bissler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Franz et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, multiple side effects of rapalog therapy are common, including aphthous stomatitis, hypercholesterolemia, acne, and nasopharyngitis, leading to treatment discontinuation in 10–20% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bissler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davies et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, rapalog therapy withdrawal in patients with TSC-associated tumors typically leads to rapid regrowth of such tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Franz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bissler et al., 2013</xref>). This limitation necessitates continued administration of rapalog therapy in patients with TSC. Long-term effects of this practice in children and adults are unknown, as this clinical experiment of long-duration rapalog therapy has never been performed previously.</p><p>Due to these limitations to rapalog therapy, a search for alternative therapies for tumors with loss of a functional TSC protein complex and constitutive mTORC1 activation goes on, with several recent efforts focused on downstream metabolic consequences of mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Düvel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parkhitko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Valvezan et al., 2017</xref>).

The TSC-deficient lines showed enhanced growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in response to THZ1, due to elevated global and mtROS, and depletion of GSH. RNA and protein studies showed that this was due to marked reduction in expression of NRF2 (<italic>NFE2L2</italic>), as well as its downstream target genes <italic>GCLC, GCLM,</italic> and <italic>GSR</italic> that are essential for biosynthesis of GSH. In retrospect, this dependence on NRF2 function to produce GSH in TSC-deficient cells might have been predicted based on multiple studies that identified elevated ROS levels in such cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finlay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choo et al., 2010</xref>). H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments showed that the <italic>NFE2L2</italic> promoter region was highly enriched for histone modification marks in TSC-deficient cells compared with intact controls, indicating the importance of NRF2 expression in such cells. The sensitivity of NRF2 expression to THZ1 treatment in TSC-deficient cells is reminiscent of earlier findings that THZ1 leads to inhibition of expression of critical core transcription factor genes in other cancer cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chipumuro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwiatkowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>ROS are known to be increased in many cancer cell types compared with their normal counterparts, which can be due to increased metabolic activity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and/or other oncogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liou and Storz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chio and Tuveson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moloney and Cotter, 2018</xref>). A mild increase in ROS can lead to an adaptive survival response, including expression of NRF2 to increase GSH production, whereas a severe increase in ROS can trigger apoptosis. Hence, it has been recognized for some time that cancer cells are potentially vulnerable to treatments that enhance ROS levels and cause cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trachootham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chio and Tuveson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teppo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moloney and Cotter, 2018</xref>). Several strategies have been employed to induce ROS, including ionizing radiation, inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and perturbing GSH, glucose, and glutamine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gorrini et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Based on the current findings, it is possible that CDK7 inhibition therapy may be broadly effective as a cancer treatment, due to consistent elevation in ROS production in multiple cancer types. Further study is required to assess this possibility. However, homozygous mutations in TSC1 are seen in ∼8% of bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robertson et al., 2017</xref>) and in TSC1 or TSC2 in ∼50% of perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickson et al., 2013</xref>), and activating mutations in <italic>MTOR</italic> are seen in ∼5% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ricketts et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, our TSC1-deficient bladder cancer cell line xenograft model showed a sustained and complete response to THZ1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). These results suggest that CDK7 inhibition therapy may be useful for these cancer types and mutations, in addition to TSC-associated neoplasms.</p><p>In summary, we have discovered a CDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction to NRF2 in TSC-deficient cells, which when disrupted leads to rapid onset of apoptotic cell death both in vitro and in vivo due to depletion of GSH and high ROS.

HCV.29 cells, or genetically modified variants of that cell line, were prepared in 100 µl solution comprised of 70% Dulbecco’s PBS and 30% Matrigel. Suspensions of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were then injected subcutaneously into the left and right flanks of mice. Tumor volumes were measured three times per wk using calipers (volume = length × width<sup>2</sup>/2), along with body weight. Mice with established tumors (after 28 d, mean tumor volume of ∼100 mm<sup>3</sup>) were randomly divided into four groups, which were then treated with vehicle (10% DMSO in PBS); THZ1 (3 mg/ml, prepared in vehicle solution, 10 mg/kg i.p. twice daily); rapamycin (3 mg/kg i.p. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; LC Laboratories; R-5000); or a combination of both. Tumor volume was measured every 2–3 d. Upon harvesting, tumors were cut in half, with one half fixed in formalin overnight and then in 70% ethanol for histopathology analysis, and the other half snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for preparation of lysates.</p><p><italic>Tsc2<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mice on the A/J background were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Woodrum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auricchio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo and Kwiatkowski, 2013</xref>). I.p. injections of vehicle, THZ1 (10 mg/kg twice daily), or rapamycin (3 mg/kg Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) were administered to female (five mice/treatment group) mice beginning at 5.5 mo of age. Mice were treated until day 30, when kidneys were harvested 10 h after the final treatment, fixed in formalin overnight, cut into 1-mm-wide sections, and embedded in paraffin. Following H&amp;E staining, tumor volume measurements were made by two observers (H. Du and D.J. Kwiatkowski) blinded to treatment status, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auricchio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo and Kwiatkowski, 2013</xref>). The total tumor volume per kidney was equal to sum of the tumor volume of each lesion identified, with tumor volume for each cyst/adenoma calculated as percent cellularity multiplied by cyst volume (tumor volume = maximum [percent lesion cellularity, 5%] × π/6 × 1.64 × [tumor length × tumor width] × 1.5).</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>RNA-seq was performed on HCV.29.TSC1<sup>−</sup> and HCV.29.TSC1<sup>+</sup> cells. Cells were plated in 100-mm<sup>3</sup> dishes in triplicate and treated with DMSO or 30 nM THZ1 for 6 h. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and analyzed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer for integrity. RNA-seq libraries were constructed by standard methods; 2 × 75-bp paired-end reads and ∼50 million reads were generated for each sample. Quality trimming on raw reads was performed using Cutadapt before sequence mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martin, 2011</xref>). Sequence reads were aligned to the hg19 human genome build using the STAR aligning program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). A two-pass alignment was performed, and only those reads mapping uniquely to the human genome were maintained for further analysis. Quantification of all genes and their isoforms was performed using fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads normalized values using Cufflinks v2.2.1; differentially expressed genes were identified using the DESeq2 package and manual analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Expression levels for the HCV.29.TSC1<sup>−</sup> and HCV.29.TSC1<sup>+</sup>, treated with control or two doses (30 nM and 100 nM) THZ1, were measured in duplicate. Raw data are provided in Table S4.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>IHC</title><p>IHC staining was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections.

Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling for 10 min in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0, followed by washing in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, then 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min, then ddH<sub>2</sub>O again. 1× Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% normal goat serum (Cell Signaling Technology; 5425) was used as a blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were diluted in Signal Stain Antibody Diluent (Cell Signaling Technology; 8112) and incubated overnight at 4°C: Ki67 (Abcam; ab16667), NRF2 (Cell Signaling Technology; 12721), and pS6<sup>S240/244</sup> (Cell Signaling Technology; 5364). Slides were washed three times for 5 min each in 1× TBST and incubated in Signal Stain Boost IHC Detection Reagent (Cell Signaling Technology; 8114) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by three 5-min washes in 1× TBST. Signal was detected using the AEC Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit (Vector; SK-4200) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). Coverslips were mounted with Permount Mounting solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
