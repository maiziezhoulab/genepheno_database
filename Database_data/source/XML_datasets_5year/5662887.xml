<abstract>
<p>Cow’s milk allergy (CMA) prevails in infants and brings increased risk of developing other allergic diseases. Oral administration of specific β-lactoglobulin (BLG)-derived peptides (PepMix) and a specific blend of short- and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides and <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic> M-16V (FF/<italic>Bb</italic>) was found to partially prevent CMA development in mice. In this study, we aimed to expand the knowledge on the preventive potential and the underlying mechanisms of this approach. Three-week-old female C3H/HeOuJ mice were orally exposed to PepMix±FF/<italic>Bb</italic> prior to a 5-week oral sensitization with whole whey and cholera toxin as an adjuvant. The acute allergic skin response was determined after an intradermal challenge with whole whey protein. Following an oral challenge with whey, regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) in the small intestine lamina propria (SI-LP) and mRNA expression of immune markers in the Peyer’s patches (PP) were investigated. The early impact of PepMix and FF/<italic>Bb</italic> interventions on the immune system during the oral tolerance (OT) induction phase was investigated after the last OT administration. Pre-exposing mice to PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> partially prevented the acute allergic skin response compared to PBS and increased T<sub>regs</sub> and activated T cells in the SI-LP compared to sham-sensitized mice. It also increased the mRNA expression of Tbet over GATA3 in the PP of whey-sensitized mice. Directly upon the 6-day OT phase, FF/<italic>Bb</italic> intervention enhanced cecal content levels of propionic and butyric acid in PepMix-fed mice and the former was positively correlated with Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cell numbers in the colon. In the PP of PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic>-exposed mice, IL-22 mRNA expression increased and IL-10 followed the same tendency, while the Foxp3 expression was increased over GATA3 and RorγT. In the colon, the Tbet mRNA expression increased over GATA3, while IL-22 decreased. In addition, the Foxp3<sup>+</sup>/GATA3<sup>+</sup> and regulatory/effector T cell ratios in the mesenteric lymph nodes and the CD11b<sup>+</sup>/CD11b<sup>−</sup> conventional dendritic cells ratio in the SI-LP were increased. In conclusion, the FF/<italic>Bb</italic> diet facilitates the capacity of the specific BLG-peptides to partially prevent the allergic response after sensitization to whole whey protein, possibly by creating a tolerance-prone environment during the OT phase. Such a dietary intervention might contribute to tailoring successful strategies for CMA prevention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>IgE-mediated food allergy is the most prominent cause of early life anaphylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Even though associated with a high rate of natural tolerance and outgrow within the first 5 years of life, cow’s milk allergy (CMA) is the earliest food allergy in infancy and affects 2–3% of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Both casein and whey proteins from cow’s milk can trigger CMA. In the whey fraction, β-lactoglobulin (BLG) is one of the main allergens. In an increasing number of patients, CMA fails to resolve spontaneously and persists for life which is often associated with a more severe phenotype or increased risk for other allergic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Although allergen-specific immunotherapy is being developed and can lead to desensitization of patients while on therapy, CMA management in the clinic mainly involves the avoidance of the symptom-eliciting food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This may affect children’s growth and impair the quality of life of patients and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>For many years, oral tolerance (OT) has been the focus of research, as it might provide the tool for developing successful preventive as well as therapeutic strategies for CMA. OT is the phenomenon of developing a systemic immune hyporesponsiveness to harmless food proteins encountered <italic>via</italic> the oral route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The mechanisms underlying OT induction remain to be elucidated, but current knowledge suggests it is an active multiple-step process. It involves the uptake of a food antigen, its presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APC), and the induction of anergy, deletion, and/or regulatory T cell (T<sub>regs</sub>) responses in the secondary lymphoid tissues, such as the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). According to literature, the primary cellular mechanism to be induced depends on the amount of antigen ingested, where high-dose antigen results in anergy/deletion and low-dose antigen leads to active induction of T<sub>regs</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In the intestinal mucosa, dendritic cells (DC) are considered crucial mediators driving the T cell polarization toward a regulatory or effector phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). CD103<sup>+</sup> DC play an important role in OT development by inducing allergen-specific T<sub>regs</sub>
<italic>via</italic> a TGF-β and retinoic acid-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). From all different T cell subsets, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> have mostly been researched in the context of OT. Their central and suppressive role in allergy is further supported by research in patients with a non-coding deletion of the <italic>FOXP3</italic> gene who have defective T<sub>regs</sub> frequency and functionality and exhibit a severe food allergic phenotype, especially against cow’s milk proteins (CMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>In the past years, avoidance of the culprit food has been the gold standard for primary CMA prevention. However, this paradigm was challenged as allergen avoidance in early life was associated with increased risk of sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). OT is a strictly antigen-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and oral exposure to antigens in early life might be essential for successful OT development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Therefore, when avoiding the allergen, the normal acquisition of OT is evaded while alternative routes of allergen exposure, such as <italic>via</italic> the skin, may increase the risk of sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). More recently, clinical trials on the early introduction of whole allergen have shown efficacy in reducing the prevalence of peanut allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) while this approach has been less successful for egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Furthermore, the use of intact milk proteins in formulas is not recommended in the first 4 months of life for infants who are genetically predisposed to allergy and are not exclusively breast-fed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), due to the risk of triggering oral sensitization or allergic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). For this reason, current recommendations for primary prevention in high-risk infants who are not exclusively breast-fed include the use of CMP-based partial or extensive hydrolyzed protein formulas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, a recent systematic review reported lack of consistent evidence to support the suggestion that partially and extensively hydrolyzed formulas have a protective role and can reduce the risk of allergic disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This further encourages the search for alternative, safer approaches for inducing OT in at-risk infants.</p>
<p>Specific, T cell-epitope-containing peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) can alternatively be utilized to avoid potential sensitization or allergic symptoms in high-risk infants. Preclinical studies in rodents have demonstrated that the sensitizing capacity of BLG can be reduced when mice are co-immunized with intact BLG and BLG-derived peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Careful selection of specific peptides after hydrolysis and their enrichment in a hydrolyzed protein formula has shown reduction of the allergic response to the naïve protein in a murine CMA model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Furthermore, a mixture of few synthetically prepared BLG-peptides has been reported to reduce the allergic skin response in a mouse model of CMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p>
<p>An adjunctive strategy for early life allergy prevention through dietary interventions is the use of dietary supplements with immunomodulatory properties, such as synbiotics. Such components might contribute by actively improving maturation of the mucosal immune system and facilitating OT induction. Combining non-digestible oligosaccharides, such as short- and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS/lcFOS; FF) with a probiotic strain with an anti-allergic activity, such as <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic> M-16V (<italic>Bb</italic>) into a synbiotic diet (FF/<italic>Bb</italic>), has previously been found to effectively prevent house dust mite-induced allergic asthma in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) as well as to increase the percentage of beneficial bifidobacteria in feces of cow’s milk allergic infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Therefore, an adjunctive dietary intervention with synbiotics is of interest for developing promising strategies for CMA prevention.</p>
<p>In a previous study, we demonstrated a dietary intervention with FF<italic>/Bb</italic>-containing synbiotic blend and a mixture of four short specific BLG-derived peptides to partially induce OT for the whole whey protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). However, the underlying process associated with the preventive capacity of these BLG-peptides and dietary adjunct treatment is not yet understood. Previous studies investigating the antigen-specific approach with protein fragments and/or the immunomodulatory effects of dietary components (e.g., poly-unsaturated fatty acids, non-digestible oligosaccharides, probiotic bacteria, synbiotics) have suggested the involvement of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> in the suppression of the allergic response to cow’s milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Therefore, in the current study, the same CMA mouse model was used to confirm the capacity of BLG-peptides and FF/<italic>Bb</italic> synbiotics to partially prevent the allergic skin response to whole whey. Furthermore, the effects on gut immune parameters and T cell phenotype directly after the OT induction phase were assessed.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="S2-1">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Three-week-old specific pathogen-free female C3H/HeOuJ mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) and housed in the animal facility of Utrecht University. The animal use was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Utrecht University and the Central Commission for Animal use (approval numbers DEC 2013.II.11.116 and AVD108002015262). Animal care and use were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Ethics committee of Utrecht University.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-2">
<title>Peptides and Diet</title>
<p>Four synthetic peptides, consisting of 18-AA from the B variant of BLG, were purchased from JPT Peptide Technologies (Berlin, Germany). Each of the four peptides had a 12-AA overlap with the preceding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). A mixture of the four BLG-derived peptides was prepared by dissolving the lyophilized peptides in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) until each peptide in the mixture was at a concentration of 0.08 mg/mL (further referred to as PepMix).</p>
<p>CMP-free, AIN-93G-based standard mouse chow was composed (control diet) by Research diet Services (RDS, Wijk bij Duurstede, The Netherlands) and supplemented with 1% (wt:wt) of non-digestible scFOS (Raftilose P95, Beneo Orafti S.A., Oreye, Belgium) and lcFOS (Raftiline HP, Beneo Orafti S.A.) in a ratio 9:1 and 2% (wt:wt) 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/g <italic>B. breve</italic> M-16V (Morinaga Milk Industry, Tokyo, Japan) (FF/<italic>Bb</italic> diet). The synbiotic components were mixed through the diet where FF was exchanged for cellulose and <italic>Bb</italic> for maltodextrin and pressed into pellets. Diets were stored at 4°C prior to use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-3">
<title>OT Induction in a Mouse Model of Orally Induced CMA</title>
<p>Upon arrival, mice were fed the control or the FF/<italic>Bb</italic> diet <italic>ad libitum</italic> for a period of 9 days. During the OT phase, they received daily oral gavages with 0.5 mL PBS, PepMix (total 0.16 mg peptides/0.5 mL PBS; 0.04 mg of each BLG-derived peptide) or whole whey protein as a positive control for maximum OT induction (50 mg/0.5 mL PBS; DMV International, Veghel, The Netherlands) for a period of 6 days. In the first study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), following the OT phase, all mice were fed the control diet and orally sensitized for five consecutive weeks with 10 µg cholera toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Inc., CA, USA) as an adjuvant with or without 0.5 mL homogenized whey (40 mg whey/mL PBS). Five days after the last sensitization, mice were challenged intradermally (i.d.) with whey protein and the acute allergic skin response and signs of anaphylaxis were assessed. The same day, mice were orally challenged with 50 mg whey/0.5 mL PBS and were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 18 h thereafter. In the second study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), mice were sacrificed 4 h after the last OT administration to assess markers of immunomodulation during the OT phase.</p>

<title>Assessment of the Allergic Response</title>
<p>To measure the potential allergic response to whey, mice were i.d. challenged in the ear pinnae of both ears with 10 µg whey in 20 µL PBS and the acute allergic skin response [expressed as the Δ ear swelling (μm)] was evaluated. The ear thickness prior to and 1 h after the i.d. challenge of isoflurane-anesthetized mice was measured in duplicate for each ear using a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo, Veenendaal, The Netherlands). To express the net ear swelling, the average basal ear thickness was subtracted from the average ear thickness at 1 h after i.d. challenge. In addition to the acute allergic skin response, the anaphylaxis was scored according to Schouten et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-5">
<title>Cell Isolation from Tissues</title>
<p>Lymphocytes were isolated from the spleen, MLN, and small intestine lamina propria (SI-LP) of mice that were sacrificed just after the OT period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). SI-LP single-cell suspensions were also prepared from mice that were sensitized and challenged after the OT period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). MLN cell suspensions were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Single-cell splenocyte suspensions were obtained by passing the organs through 70 µm cell strainers and lysing the red blood cells with a buffer containing 8.3 g/L NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 1 g/L KHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 37.2 mg/L EDTA. Cells from the SI-LP were isolated from the whole small intestine (SI) after removing the Peyer’s patches (PP), washing the intestine in cold PBS, opening it longitudinally, and mincing it in 0.5 cm fragments. To remove epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes, intestinal fragments were washed in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Invitrogen) containing 15 mM HEPES (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), pH = 7.2 and incubated 4 × 15 min with HBSS supplemented with 15 mM HEPES, 5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-EDTA, 10% FCS, and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 µg/mL), pH = 7.2. Then, samples were washed in RPMI 1640, 5% FCS and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 µg/mL) and digested for 2 × 45 min with an enzyme solution containing 0.5 mg/mL Collgenase type VIII (Sigma-Aldrich). Fragments were vortexed for 10 s after each incubation and poured over a 70 µm cell strainer while collecting the passing cells. SI-LP lymphocytes were purified using a Percol gradient (pH = 7.2). Spleen, MLN, and SI-LP cell suspensions were resuspended in PBS/1% BSA and used for flow cytometric analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-6">
<title>DC and T Cell Subsets Analyzed by Flow Cytometry</title>
<p>Single-cell suspensions from SI-LP, MLN, and/or spleen were obtained and incubated for 15 min with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Mouse BD Fc Block; BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA) in PBS + 1% BSA + 5% FBS buffer to block non-specific binding sites. The following monoclonal antibodies were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to stain surface markers on DC in the MLN and SI-LP of mice sacrificed in the OT phase: CD11c-PerCp-Cy5.5, CD11b-PE, MHC class II-PE-Cy7, CD103-APC or PE, CD8α-FITC, CD40-FITC, CD80-APC, CD86-FITC, and F4/80-APC-Cy7 (all from eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). For analyzing T cell subsets in all three tissues of the OT mice and the SI-LP of whey-sensitized and challenged mice, cells were first extracellularly stained with CD4-PerCp-Cy5.5, and CD25-AlexaFluor488 (all from eBiosciences). For intracellular staining, cells were first fixated and permeabilized with Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) according to manufacturer’s protocol followed by incubation with Tbet-PE, GATA3-PE or Foxp3-PE-Cy7 antibody (eBioscience). Dead cells were excluded by the use of fixable viability dye eFluor780 (eBioscience), except in the SI-LP analysis of whey-sensitized mice where dead cells were excluded by forward/side scatter gating. Results were collected with BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed with FlowLogic software (Inivai Technologies, Mentone, VIC, Australia).</p>

<title>qPCR Analysis of Gene Expression</title>

Non-specific binding was blocked by 30 min incubation with 5% rabbit serum (DAKO, Heverlee, Belgium) in 1% BSA/PBS. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with 10 µg/mL rat anti-mouse Foxp3 purified antibody or rat IgG2a isotype as control in 1% BSA/PBS (both from eBioscience). After washing, slides were incubated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30 min in the dark followed by 1 h-incubation at room temperature with rabbit anti-rat-biotinylated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) in 1% BSA/PBS. Finally, avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) was added for 1 h before developing the color with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) and counterstaining with hematoxylin.

<title>Reduced Allergic Skin Response to Whole Whey Protein in Mice Pretreated with BLG-Derived Peptides while Fed FF/<italic>Bb</italic> Synbotics Prior to Sensitization with Whey</title>
<p>As expected, mice that were fed whole whey protein before sensitization with whey developed tolerance to whey and were prevented from allergic symptoms upon i.d. whey challenge, therefore referred to as the tolerant controls (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A).

<title>The Reduced Allergic Response Was Associated with Increased T Cell Activation and Induction of T<sub>regs</sub> in the SI-LP</title>
<p>In order to investigate whether the prevention of CMA symptoms in the whey allergic mice is associated with changes in T<sub>regs</sub> numbers, SI-LP cells were isolated after the challenge phase and analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A).

<p>The impact of the interventions on the gene expression of regulatory molecules in the PP was studied. IL-10 mRNA expression in the PepMix-fed mice was increased compared to the sham-sensitized group, and a similar tendency was observed in the PepMix+FF<italic>/Bb</italic> group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A), while TGF-β and galectin-9 remained unchanged (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B,C).

<title>FF/<italic>Bb</italic> Enhances Cecal Propionic Acid Concentrations during the OT Phase Which Correlates with Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Cells in the Colon</title>
<p>To examine the effects of the dietary interventions on the early markers of tolerance, samples were collected directly after the 6-day OT exposure to whole whey, PBS, PepMix, FF/<italic>Bb</italic>, or PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> (sacrifice 4 h after the last oral administration) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). As dietary interventions may influence the microbiota colonization in the gut as well as its metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), the concentrations of microbiota metabolites SCFA were measured in the cecal content. Propionic acid increased in mice fed whole whey protein or FF/<italic>Bb</italic> either or not combined with PepMix (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D). Furthermore, FF/<italic>Bb</italic> increased butyrate concentrations in PepMix-exposed mice compared to PepMix mice fed the control diet (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A).

Here, galectin-9 expression was suppressed when mice were administered whole whey protein, while the PepMix tended to lower galectin-9 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>G) and suppressed TGF-β expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>F). On the other hand, FF/<italic>Bb</italic> induced IL-22 expression in the colon, but this was lost in mice that also received PepMix (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>H). Pre-exposure to the FF/<italic>Bb</italic> diet had a tendency (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10) to increase IL-10 expression in the proximal SI compared to PBS control mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A), while IL-10 remained unaffected by the dietary interventions in the colon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>E).</p>

<title>PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> Exposure Preserves the Ratio of T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 Markers in the Colon</title>
<p>The effect of the interventions on transcription factors mRNA expression in the gut was studied. Tbet expression was reduced in the colon of PepMix-exposed mice, whereas this was abrogated in mice that were also fed the FF/<italic>Bb</italic> diet (Figure S2B in Supplementary Material). On the other hand, the expression of GATA3, Foxp3 and RorγT remained unaltered. This resulted in FF/<italic>Bb</italic> restoring the reduced T<sub>h</sub>1 over T<sub>h</sub>2 marker ratio in the PepMix-exposed mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>I). No differences were observed on other T cell ratios in the colon (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>J–L) as well as on transcription marker mRNA expression both in the proximal and middle SI (data not shown). These data indicate that the combination of PepMix and FF/<italic>Bb</italic> increases the T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 balance in the colonic tissue compared to PepMix or FF/<italic>Bb</italic> alone and maintains it at the homeostatic level of the PBS control mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, the efficacy of specific short BLG-derived peptides to induce OT during a dietary intervention with FF/<italic>Bb</italic> synbiotics versus a control diet was studied. The preventive effect of the peptides in a whole whey-induced CMA mouse model as well as the possible underlying mechanisms of immunomodulation was studied in both diet groups. Confirming our previous finding with this intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), a significant reduction of the acute allergic skin response to whole whey protein was observed when mice were exposed to PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> prior to sensitization compared to the PBS-pretreated allergic controls. This result is also in accordance with the findings of Meulenbroek et al. who showed a protective effect of a much higher dose of the same peptide blend alone or in combination with a prebiotic diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Further, we show that PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> protected mice from developing significantly more severe signs of anaphylaxis compared to the sham-sensitized controls after the i.d. challenge with allergen. In addition, the protective effect of the combined intervention was associated with an increase in activated T cells, among which T<sub>regs</sub>, in the SI-LP. T<sub>regs</sub> are extensively researched for their involvement in OT, suggesting that the combination of low dose of BLG-derived peptides and FF/<italic>Bb</italic> diet has the potential of facilitating OT development and hence of reducing the allergic response to whole whey protein.</p>
<p>The current study revealed that the T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 balance was increased in the PP of PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic>-fed whey-sensitized mice, as seen both on transcription factor mRNA as well as cytokine mRNA levels. These data are in accordance with previous findings on the preserved T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 balance in the SI-LP of PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic>-pretreated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Furthermore, reports on the use of dietary synbiotics also suggest their T<sub>h</sub>1-inducing capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), which may partly be contributed to the probiotic bacteria that may increase toll-like receptor activation (TLR) (e.g., TLR9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>).</p>
<p>Elucidating the working mechanisms of the PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> preventive exposure in the CMA model might be hindered by the long time-gap between the OT phase and the measurements in the challenge phase. Therefore, the immunomodulatory effects of the interventions were analyzed in mice directly after the OT phase. Changes in the diet, especially the addition of dietary fibers, are known to alter the composition of gut microbiota and also to influence its metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Microbial products, such as SCFA, are implicated in the maintenance of a tolerogenic mucosal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>) and the protection against food allergy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). SCFA measurements in the cecal content of PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic>-fed mice revealed increased propionic and butyric acid. Butyrate, but not propionate, is shown to protect mice from developing peanut allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), whereas propionate is found to alleviate airway hypersensitivity in a mouse model of house dust mite-induced asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). SCFA are suggested to support gut homeostasis in various ways, such as affecting immune cells directly, maintaining the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cells as well as affecting T<sub>regs</sub> biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Particularly, both propionic and butyric acid are reported to induce <italic>de novo</italic> T<sub>regs</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). In line with this, data from our study show that the enhanced concentration of propionic acid was positively correlated with the number of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells in the colonic tissue. Therefore, the role of propionate (and possibly also butyrate) in enhancing Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells and in preventing CMA development in PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic>-fed mice needs to be further elucidated.</p>
<p>As PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> intervention influenced the mRNA expression in the PP, rather than the spleen, of the whey-sensitized mice, the impact of the dietary interventions on the gut was examined during the OT phase. In contrast to preserving the T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 balance in the PP during the challenge phase, PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> increased the regulatory marker mRNA expression (IL-10 and Foxp3) during the OT phase, suggesting a predominating T<sub>regs</sub> response in this early period. Although dispensable for tolerance induction, the PP is an important site where early immune responses are shaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Interestingly, IL-22 mRNA expression in this inductive site was enhanced upon PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> exposure. IL-22 is suggested to have anti-inflammatory effect on non-immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>) and also to improve the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). Stefka et al. further reported that Clostridia-containing microbiota enhanced IL-22, resulting in reduced allergen access to the blood stream and protection against food allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). On the other hand, IL-22 mRNA expression in colon of PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> mice was differentially affected which might point at a different mechanism of action in the large intestine.</p>
<p>Next to a tolerogenic milieu in the PP, tolerance-related immunomodulation was also observed in the MLN. Oral exposure to PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> deviated the immune cell response away from the T<sub>h</sub>2, as it induced more Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells at the expense of GATA3<sup>+</sup> cells in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>h</sub> population. Focusing on activated cells co-expressing CD25, it was observed that PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> reduced CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T<sub>effs</sub>. Typically in this group, the frequency of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells tended to decrease, while the proportion of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells within the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> subset did increase. This suggests that the PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> dietary intervention contributes to a more regulatory environment by enhancing the T<sub>regs</sub> over T<sub>effs</sub> balance at this inductive site. On the other hand, both activated CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells and T<sub>regs</sub> were reduced in the spleen of whey-treated or PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb-</italic>fed mice. This might implicate that in the early period of tolerance induction depletion of activated T cells as well as T<sub>regs</sub> occurs systemically while <italic>de novo</italic> T<sub>regs</sub> are induced locally at the intestinal inductive sites, such as the MLN.</p>
<p>After initial generation within the MLN of antigen-fed mice, T<sub>regs</sub> are reported to undergo a β7-integrin- and CCR9-mediated gut homing followed by a secondary expansion in the SI-LP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). However, this expansion is suggested to take place over a prolonged period of antigen exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>), which would explain the subtle changes in T<sub>regs</sub> numbers observed in the SI-LP after 6 days of OT. On the other hand, mice exposed to whey sensitization after PepMix±FF/<italic>Bb</italic> OT showed higher T<sub>regs</sub> frequency in the SI-LP, implying that re-exposure to whole antigen might have contributed to the T<sub>regs</sub> expansion. Hence, additional studies are needed to explore whether prolonging the OT phase and the exposure to BLG-peptides and synbiotics would result in more T<sub>regs</sub> and in improved efficiency to prevent CMA.</p>
<p>Further examining the immunomodulatory effects in the gut, it was observed that in the SI-LP there was a shift toward the more T<sub>h</sub>2/T<sub>regs</sub>-inducing CD8a<sup>−</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). As we observed decreased T<sub>h</sub>2 cell and increased Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>h</sub> cell numbers in the MLN of PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb-</italic>fed mice, it can be speculated that those DC stimulated the differentiation of naïve T cells to T<sub>regs</sub> rather than T<sub>h</sub>2 cells. Further, CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells tended to increase in the SI-LP during PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> pretreatment and this elevated pattern remained regardless of their CD103 expression. CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells are reported to have tolerogenic characteristics in different disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>). Even though CD103<sup>+</sup> DC have been described as the main subtype migrating to the intestinal draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), we alike Cerovic et al. have found a proportion of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>−</sup> DC in the MLN, suggesting that they also migrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). Next to the migratory capacity, this CD103<sup>−</sup> DC subset has been reported to share the ability to efficiently prime T cells and to induce gut tropism as evidenced by their CCR7 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). The same group suggested that the main role of these CD103<sup>−</sup> DC was to induce T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>17 response, but a more recent study reveals that oral mucosa CD103<sup>−</sup> DC, similar to intestinal CD103<sup>+</sup> DC, are potent inducers of retinoic acid and Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>regs</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). Also <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with murine DC report high activity of the vitamin A-converting enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase in CD103<sup>−</sup> cDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). Hence, the increased percentage of CD103<sup>−</sup> DC in the SI-LP might be an essential inducer of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the MLN of PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic>-fed mice and their role in OT induction to whey should be further elucidated.</p>
<p>The immune environment in the gut is known to differ according to the location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>). In line with this, we found that PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> enhanced the mRNA expression of the regulatory TGF-β in the first part of the SI but not in the colon. This points to a more tolerogenic environment at the location of antigen uptake in the SI. In the colon, on the other hand, the combined BLG-peptides and synbiotics intervention supports the T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 marker balance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current study confirms the capacity of a dietary intervention combining low-dose BLG-derived peptides and a diet with FF/<italic>Bb</italic> synbiotics to partially prevent the allergic response to whole whey protein. This coincided with an increased percentage of T<sub>regs</sub> in the SI-LP and T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 ratio in the PP in the challenge phase. It further suggests that the FF/<italic>Bb</italic> diet might facilitate a more tolerogenic environment during the OT phase by enhancing propionate and butyrate levels in PepMix-pretreated mice. PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> further stimulates T<sub>regs</sub> over T<sub>effs</sub> markers and frequency, as well as the myeloid over conventional DC ratio, and the percentage of CD103<sup>−</sup> DC. Depending on the location in the intestine, in the PepMix+FF/<italic>Bb</italic> group TGF-β or IL-22 mRNA levels increased which might play role in the facilitation of OT induction by the PepMix. Further refinement of the BLG-peptides and dietary synbiotics approach might contribute to tailoring successful prevention strategies for CMA and possibly also other food allergies.</p>
