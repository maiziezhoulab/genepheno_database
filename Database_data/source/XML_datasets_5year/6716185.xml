<abstract>
<p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic event that involves adding a methyl group to the
cytosine (C) site, especially the one that pairs with a guanine (G) site (ie, CG
or CpG site), in a human genome. This event plays an important role in both
cancerous and normal cell development. Previous studies often assume symmetric
methylation on both DNA strands. However, asymmetric methylation, or
hemimethylation (methylation that occurs only on 1 DNA strand), does exist and
has been reported in several studies. Due to the limitation of previous DNA
methylation sequencing technologies, researchers could only study
hemimethylation on specific genes, but the overall genomic hemimethylation
landscape remains relatively unexplored. With the development of advanced
next-generation sequencing techniques, it is now possible to measure methylation
levels on both forward and reverse strands at all CpG sites in an entire genome.
Analyzing hemimethylation patterns may potentially reveal regions related to
undergoing tumor growth. For our research, we first identify hemimethylated CpG
sites in breast cancer cell lines using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. We then
identify hemimethylation patterns by grouping consecutive hemimethylated CpG
sites based on their methylation states, methylation “M” or unmethylation “U.”
These patterns include regular (or consecutive) hemimethylation clusters (eg,
“MMM” on one strand and “UUU” on another strand) and polarity (or reverse)
clusters (eg, “MU” on one strand and “UM” on another strand). Our results reveal
that most hemimethylation clusters are the polarity type, and hemimethylation
does occur across the entire genome with notably higher numbers in the breast
cancer cell lines. The lengths or sizes of most hemimethylation clusters are
very short, often less than 50 base pairs. After mapping hemimethylation
clusters and sites to corresponding genes, we study the functions of these genes
and find that several of the highly hemimethylated genes may influence tumor
growth or suppression. These genes may also indicate a progressing transition to
a new tumor stage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer is a leading cause of death. In 2019, there will be an estimated 1 762 450 new
cancer cases diagnosed and 606 880 cancer deaths in the United States, according to
the American Cancer Society Cancer Facts and Figures 2019. Among different types of
cancer, about 62 930 new cases of breast carcinoma in situ are expected to be
diagnosed in 2019.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1176935119872959">1</xref></sup> Medical researchers have developed many methods to fight this disease, and
early detection has become a key factor. A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) review of breast cancer cases in the United State has found that
patients diagnosed in the earlier stages of the disease have a significantly higher
chance of survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1176935119872959">2</xref></sup> Common detection methods like self or clinical breast exams and mammograms
are fairly successful means of detecting tumors once they have developed. However,
by the time a tumor has grown large enough to be identified by these methods, the
patient may already be in a late stage of the disease. Thus, methods of detecting
breast cancer at earlier stages have become progressively important. Genetic and
epigenetic biomarkers are especially important and may serve as early indicators of
tumor growth in many cancers including breast cancer.</p>
<p>Epigenetics is a relatively new field of biology that examines how gene activity is
affected by external modifications to DNA and not by changes to the DNA sequence itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1176935119872959">3</xref></sup> One significant epigenetic mechanism is DNA methylation, a biological process
in which a methyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>) is added to the fifth carbon of a
cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CG or CpG site) on a DNA molecule in a mammalian
cell. It is a natural and essential process associated with DNA replication and cell
differentiation. DNA methylation is facilitated by a group of DNA methyltransferases
(DNMTs) and comes in 2 forms: de novo methylation and maintenance methylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1176935119872959">3</xref></sup> In de novo methylation, bare DNA is methylated in a tissue-specific pattern
as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1176935119872959">Figure 1A</xref>.
During maintenance methylation, the new DNA strand formed during DNA replication
becomes methylated at the same CpG sites as the first strand,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1176935119872959">4</xref></sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1176935119872959">Figure
1B</xref>.</p>

<p>Previous researchers have used microarray technologies to study DNA methylation.
Although these technologies allow researchers to study expression levels of numerous
genes, all microarray technologies (except for the Illumina microarray) cannot
generate methylation signals at the single CpG site level. In addition, microarray
technologies lack the ability to separate strands of DNA. As a result of these
weaknesses, many early studies assume symmetric methylation of CpG sites, or
methylation of a CpG site on both the forward and reverse strands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1176935119872959">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1176935119872959">6</xref></sup> Within the last decade,
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have filled these gaps by combining
bisulfite treatment with parallel DNA sequencing processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1176935119872959">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1176935119872959"></xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1176935119872959">7</xref></sup> On a single strand of DNA, with
bisulfite treatment, unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracils while
methylated cytosines remain unchanged. After amplification, the modified DNA is
sequenced with one of several advanced sequencing machines available today.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1176935119872959">8</xref></sup> We can then obtain the methylation signals on the forward and reverse strands
allowing us to investigate asymmetric methylation, or hemimethylation (HM), which
does exist and has been reported in several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1176935119872959">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1176935119872959"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1176935119872959"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1176935119872959"></xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1176935119872959">13</xref></sup> To clarify, we emphasize that
HM in this article means that DNA methylation at a CpG site only occurs on one
strand, not on the other strand. It is not allele-specific methylation that is
common in imprinting, and it is not partial methylation either.</p>
<p>Shao et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1176935119872959">10</xref></sup> report the existence of hemimethylated CpG sites in both carcinomas and
controls when studying CpG sites of the Sat2 gene. They show that HM exists in both
singletons and clusters. Singletons are the hemimethylated CpG sites that are not
formed a cluster with other consecutive CpG sites. Hemimethylation is significantly
more likely to occur in clusters in ovarian cancerous cells than in control or
normal cells. The HM clusters reported in their previous studies exist in 2 forms:
regular (or consecutive) and polarity (or reverse) patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1176935119872959">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1176935119872959">10</xref></sup> Regular (or consecutive) HM
clusters occur when successive CpG sites are hemimethylated on the same strand,
either the forward or the reverse strand as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1176935119872959">Figure 2A</xref>. For example, “MMM-UUU” is an HM
cluster of 3 CpG sites with “MMM” on the forward/F strand and “UUU” on the reverse/R
strand; “MM-UU” is an HM cluster of 2 CpG sites with “MM” on the forward/F strand
and “UU” on the reverse/R strand. On the contrary, polarity (or reverse) clusters
arise when consecutive CpG sites are hemimethylated on opposite strands as shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1176935119872959">Figure 2B</xref>. For example,
“MU-UM” is a polarity HM cluster of 2 CpG sites with “MU” on the forward/F strand
and “UM” on the reverse/R strand; “UM-MU” is an HM cluster of 2 CpG sites with “UM”
on the forward/F strand and “MU” on the reverse/R strand. Both these 2 types of HM
clusters have been found and reported in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1176935119872959">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1176935119872959">10</xref></sup> HM clusters may indicate
different methylation events and may have a more substantial impact on the function
of a particular gene. In addition to HM clusters, there are also individual or
singleton HM CpG sites that are not in a cluster with other CpG sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1176935119872959">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1176935119872959">12</xref></sup></p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1176935119872959-fig2"></graphic>
</fig>
<p>It is both useful and important to study HM. First, a recent study by Xu and Corces
shows that hemimethylated CpG sites are inherited over several cell
divisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1176935119872959">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1176935119872959">13</xref></sup> This finding challenges the previous understanding and model of
methylation and HM, in which HM was thought to be transient. Second, the
identification of HM patterns is crucial for understanding different methylation
events (eg, methylation maintenance and de novo methylation) and the establishment
of different methylation patterns (eg, hypomethylation and hypermethylation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1176935119872959">12</xref></sup> For example, previous studies suggest that hemimethylated CpG sites are
intermediates in active demethylation during carcinogenesis and not just due to a
failure of maintenance methylation during replicative DNA synthesis. Hemimethylation
can help researchers trace the footprints of DNA methylation in cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1176935119872959">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1176935119872959">10</xref></sup> Third, a recent publication
shows that stably inherited HM regulates chromatin interaction and transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1176935119872959">13</xref></sup> Therefore, it is very likely that HM affects gene expression in cancer cells
significantly. Before studying the function or role of HM patterns in cancers, we
should first identify them in a whole genome. Therefore, the identification of
hemimethylated sites is the focus of our current article.</p>
<p>The goal of our research is to use publicly available bisulfite-sequencing data to
study HM in breast cancer cell lines across the entire genome. The HM sites or
patterns we want to identify are singleton HM CpG sites and 2 types of HM clusters
as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1176935119872959">Figure 2</xref>. We
obtain publicly available reduced representation bisulfite-sequencing (RRBS) data
(GSE27003) of 7 breast cancer cell lines (BT20, BT474, MCF7, MDAMB231, MDAMB468,
T47D, and ZR751).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1176935119872959">14</xref></sup> We then identify hemimethylated CpG sites using Wilcoxon signed rank tests
and study the genes and promoters that contain these CpG sites.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-1176935119872959">
<title>Data preparation</title>
<p>We use the hg19 version of the human genome as a reference to align raw
sequencing reads. All data sets in our project have been processed and analyzed
using publicly available software packages: BRAT-bw,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1176935119872959">15</xref></sup> Perl,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1176935119872959">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1176935119872959">17</xref></sup> and R.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1176935119872959">18</xref></sup> The preprocessed methylation sequencing data sets consist of all CpG base
pairs found on the forward and reverse strand for each cell line. In total,
there are 27 999 103 applicable CpG sites in the whole genome. For these 28
million CpG sites, we choose to further analyze those with at least 4
methylation signals among 7 cell lines on each strand (forward and reverse).
There are 464 674 CpG sites (ie, 1.6% of all CpG sites in a human genome)
passing these criteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1176935119872959">
<title>Statistical and bioinformatic analysis</title>
<p>To identify HM CpG sites, we analyze the RRBS data of 7 breast cancer cell lines
using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. This statistical test is used when the
normality (normal distribution) assumption is violated and the sample size is
small. It is often used to determine whether the centers of 2 sets of data are
significantly different from each other. To ensure quality data, Wilcoxon signed
rank tests are performed on CpG sites that have at most 3 missing observation
values in the cancer forward and reverse data. At each CpG site, we use Wilcoxon
signed rank tests to compare the methylation signals of the forward and reverse
strands of 7 breast cancer cell lines. The Wilcoxon test is a rank-based test,
and there are different methods of dealing with tied data and zero values
including the “Wilcoxon” and “Pratt” methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1176935119872959">19</xref></sup> The “Pratt” method first ranks absolute differences including zeros and
then discards all the ranks corresponding to the zero-differences, whereas the
“Wilcoxon” method first deals with the zero-differences and then ranks the
remaining absolute differences. The “Pratt” and “Wilcoxon” methods produce
similar results for all CpG sites and the same results for CpG sites with
<italic>P</italic> value &lt; .05 for our data. For our study, we choose to
use “Wilcoxon” to deal with tied data. Once we get the output of the Wilcoxon
signed rank tests and the <italic>P</italic> value for each CpG site, we
calculate and report the absolute mean difference of the forward and the reverse
strand methylation signals.</p>
<p>We use the mean difference and <italic>P</italic> value to select HM CpG sites.
The mean difference at each CpG site is the difference between the mean/average
methylation signals of the forward and reverse strands. It tells us whether the
cancer cell lines show biologically significant HM signals at a CpG site. We
look for CpG sites whose absolute mean differences are greater than a cutoff
value in cancer cell lines. The <italic>P</italic> value will tell us whether a
CpG site has statistically significant HM signals. As we are looking for CpG
sites that are hemimethylated in cancer, we select CpG sites with
<italic>P</italic> value &lt; .05 and forward and reverse strand methylation
mean difference (absolute value) <italic>d</italic> ⩾ 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8. Then,
we identify HM patterns that meet both biological and statistical significance
criteria by extracting consecutive HM CpG sites based on their methylation
states and further study these HM patterns.</p>
<p>For bioinformatic analysis, we provide annotations for all HM CpG sites by
finding which genes have HM sites in their gene body or promoter regions using
the R code written by ourselves. We then use the GeneCards (a gene database)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1176935119872959">20</xref></sup> and the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1176935119872959">21</xref></sup> to study these genes’ functions. We use the ConsensusPathDB
(CPDB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1176935119872959">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1176935119872959"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1176935119872959"></xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1176935119872959">25</xref></sup> to conduct pathway

<title>Hemimethylated CpG sites and clusters</title>
<p>Using Wilcoxon signed rank tests on cancer cell lines and applying stringent
cutoff values, we have identified HM CpG sites as those with <italic>P</italic>
value &lt; .05 and an absolute mean difference <italic>d</italic> ⩾ 0.4, 0.6,
and 0.8 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1176935119872959">Table

sites that form clusters. The HM CpG sites that are not in a cluster are called
singletons. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1176935119872959">Table 1</xref>
shows that the number of HM CpG sites belonging to clusters decreases as the
mean difference cutoff value increases. When the cutoff value increases, the
number of HM clusters decreases too (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1176935119872959">Table 2</xref>). However, for the 3 cutoff
values, the percentages of HM CpG sites belonging to clusters are relatively
consistent (about 13%-17% as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1176935119872959">Table 1</xref>). This consistency implies that
breast cancer samples may contain a certain number of HM clusters. A more

<p>The first and second columns of Table 3 are cluster patterns and
counts. The third column indicates whether an HM pattern is a
regular or polarity cluster. Four regular clusters are labeled as
“Regular*.” These clusters are classified as regular clusters with
more than 2 CpG sites, but each of them has at least 1 pair of
polarity CpG sites that are embedded in this regular cluster. For
example, “MMU-UUM” is a regular cluster, but its last 2 CpG sites
have the “MU-UM” polarity pattern. Because only 4 of the 1719
clusters are like this, we consider them as regular clusters and
define that a polarity cluster consists of only 2 CpG sites to
simplify our definition. We point these 4 clusters out using the
label “Regular*” to show the complexity of hemimethylation
clusters.</p>

<p>We calculate the length of HM clusters using the physical distance between the
first and the last CpG site in a cluster (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1176935119872959">Figure 3</xref>). For regular HM clusters, 154
of 161 clusters (ie, 95.65%) are less than or equal to 40 base pairs; 101 of 161
(ie, 62.73%) are just about 10 base long. For polarity clusters, 1506 of 1558
(ie, 96.66%) are about 40 to 50 base long. The cluster size or length patterns
may show that when CpG sites are very close to each other (eg, less than
50 bases), they are likely to hemimethylate together. In addition, the
chromosomal locations of hemimethylated clusters span the entire genome (see
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1176935119872959">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>We have mapped the 19 736 HM sites in the cancer cell lines to their
corresponding genes and promoters and have found that 6831 genes and 1399
promoter regions contain HM sites. A more detailed summary of the HM site
distribution for genes and promoter regions is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1176935119872959">Table 4</xref>. This table shows that 2194
genes have only 1 HM CpG site in their gene bodies; 1875 genes have 2 HM CpG
sites; 885 genes have 3 CpG sites, and so on. Approximately 93% of the
identified genes have at most 9 HM CpG sites (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1176935119872959">Table 4</xref>). Even though most of the

or more hemimethylated CpG sites (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1176935119872959">Table 4</xref>). In addition, almost all the

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1176935119872959">Table 7</xref> shows that
only 40% (14 genes out of 35) of known hypermethylated genes are hemimethylated
(or have HM CpG sites in their gene body or promoter regions). The possible
reason is that the RRBS protocol can only sequence a small number of CpG sites,
about 3% to 6% of all CpG sites in a human genome, dependent on the insert size
and alignment rate (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1176935119872959">Table 1</xref> of Doherty and Couldrey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1176935119872959">26</xref></sup>). It is likely that the other CpG sites located in these hypermethylated
genes (gene bodies or promoter regions) are hemimethylated, but the RRBS
protocol does not generate data for these CpG sites, so we cannot determine the
HM patterns for them. If possible, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) may
be a better option because it uses similar bisulfite-sequencing techniques but
generates data for more than 99% of CpG sites. Hemimethylation analysis based on

<p>ConsensusPathDB (or CPDB) is a database-type software package that integrates
different types of functional interactions between physical entities like genes,
RNA, proteins, protein complexes, and metabolites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1176935119872959">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1176935119872959"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1176935119872959"></xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1176935119872959">25</xref></sup> It provides different
types of biological interaction analyses for a given set of genes. For the 45
genes that have at least 25 HM CpG sites, we use the CPDB to identify induced
network modules. Even though the user provides a long list of genes as the input
file, the CPDB produces a network with only the significantly
enriched/represented genes. In our analysis, we focus on finding networks
including genes with significant protein interaction and genetic interaction
(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1176935119872959">Figure 5</xref>). In this
figure, 14 black-colored genes are from our provided seed gene list (ie, about
one third of the 45 genes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1176935119872959">Table 5</xref>). Purple-colored genes are the
intermediate nodes that are not from our provided seed gene list. However, these
intermediate genes associate 2 or more seed genes with each other and overall
have significantly many connections within the induced network module. These
black and purple genes are significantly enriched/represented ones, and the
significance is determined based on the Genes2Networks approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1176935119872959">35</xref></sup> In particular, intermediate genes are ranked and selected according to
the significance of association with the seed gene list. The association is
quantified by a z-score calculated for each intermediate node based on the
binomial proportion test. The default z-score in the CPDB is used for our
analysis.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1176935119872959">Figure 5</xref>, TERT is a
hub gene that has many genetic interactions with other genes; see the blue
lines/connections with other purple-colored genes. Among these purple genes,
estrogen receptor alpha (ER<sub>α</sub> or ESR1) is a typical breast cancer
gene. ER<sub>α</sub> displays gene regulatory interaction with TERT, which is
abnormally active in most cancer cells for its trait of dividing uncontrollably.
Over the years, estrogens have been recognized as an important factor associated
with breast cancers; more than half of all breast cancers overexpress
ER<sub>α</sub>, and 70% of them respond to estrogen hormone therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1176935119872959">36</xref></sup> HDAC4 has protein interactions with a few genes; see the yellow lines
connecting HDAC4 with related genes (the left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1176935119872959">Figure 5</xref>). This gene is said to be
involved in the MTA1-mediated epigenetics regulation of ESR1 expression in
breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1176935119872959">37</xref></sup> MTA1 is a transcriptional coregulator that can perform as a
transcriptional corepressor, and with the combination of other components of
NuRD, MTA1 acts as a transcriptional corepressor of BRCA1 and ESR1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1176935119872959">20</xref></sup> BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene that helps prevent cells from growing
rapidly, and its expression is impeded by MTA1. The biological connections among
genes with at least 25 hemimethylated CpG sites imply that the genes associated
with breast cancer may also be hemimethylated.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we analyze the HM patterns in 7 breast cancer cell lines. The novel
contribution of this article lies in that this is the first-ever thorough analysis
of breast cancer HM. Both HM clusters and singleton sites are identified. On the
contrary, our article has certain limitations. First, there is no statistical
analysis done on a number of control or normal breast samples to compare with breast
cancer cell lines. This is because so far we could not find suitable normal breast
sample sequencing data, except a WGBS data set discussed below. Second, we mainly
focus on using the statistical and bioinformatic data analysis to identify HM sites.
It would be more meaningful to further investigate the genes with a large number of
hemimethylated sites, for example, the methylation events in their gene bodies,
promoters, and enhancer regions. This type of research would require the wet lab
work, which is beyond our capacity. Third, it is also meaningful to study
hemimethylated genes’ expression levels and how these levels are related to the
methylation and HM patterns of these genes. This research is beyond the scope of
this article as new gene expression data of these genes should be generated for
further studies. Fourth, even though RRBS data analysis shows the existence of HM in
various genes, it does not paint the entire picture for us. This is because RRBS
mainly captures CpG rich sections of DNA, leaving out regions with scattered CpG
sites. In fact, for the RRBS cancer cell lines we analyze, there are less than 2% of
the CpG sites with at least 3× coverage in each of the breast cancer cell lines.
With regards to our project, if we had the WGBS data for cancer cell lines, we would
see a better picture of the HM patterns in breast cancer data.</p>
<p>Our focus of this article is to find significant HM CpG sites between breast cancer
forward and reverse strands. In addition, we have compared the 7 breast cancer cell
lines (RRBS data) with a WGBS data set generated from the human mammary epithelial
cell (HMEC), which is considered as a normal breast sample (GSE29127).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1176935119872959">38</xref></sup> As we have only 1 normal breast sample to compare, we do not apply the
Wilcoxon signed rank test to analyze the HMEC. Instead, we filter out the data by
selecting both forward and reverse strands with at least 3× coverage. In addition,
we let the absolute mean difference between the forward and reverse strand
methylation signals be greater than 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 to identify hemimethylated CpG
sites. To find the most significant HM sites, absolute mean difference greater than
0.8 is used on both 7 breast cancer cell lines and the single normal sample (HMEC).
Only 2 hemimethylated CpG sites are identified both in cancer and normal sample as
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1176935119872959">Figure 6</xref>. However,
9477 CpG sites are hemimethylated in cancer cell lines. We choose to show <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1176935119872959">Figure 6</xref> and related results
in the Discussion section rather than the Results section as this comparison is only
based on 1 normal sample. This simple comparison result may not be generalized or
comparable with the comparison results based on multiple normal breast samples.</p>

<p>Comparing HM CpG sites in the HMEC and 7 breast cancer cell lines. HM
indicates hemimethylation; HMEC, human mammary epithelial cell.</p>
<p>In total, 10 136 HM CpG sites are hemimethylated in breast cancer cell lines
(ie, with the Wilcoxon test <italic>P</italic> value &lt; .05 and absolute
mean difference at least 0.8 as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1176935119872959">Table 1</xref>). About 657 of these 10 136
CpG sites are hemimethylated in breast cancer cell lines, but there are no
data in the HMEC sample. “No data in HMEC” means there are no sequencing
reads or not enough sequencing reads covering those CpG sites (ie, &lt;3×
coverage). 9477 of these 10 136 CpG sites are hemimethylated in breast
cancer, but not in HMEC. Only 2 of these 10 136 CpG sites are hemimethylated
in both breast cancer cell lines and HMEC.</p>

<p>Our method uses the Wilcoxon signed rank test with a significance level of .05 on
each base position listed. The more tests we perform with this significance level,
the higher the chance we have of performing a type I error, also known as a false
positive. For our study, this means the possibility that we have identified an HM
CpG site incorrectly is higher if we keep the significance level the same for each
test. Theoretically, we should do a multiple testing correction. However, this is a
challenging task for this type of large genome data with complex features. To
address this issue, we have used both the <italic>P</italic> value and the mean
difference value to select the HM sites. This selection will help us to avoid a high
false positive rate and also make sure the selected sites are both statistically and
biologically significant.</p>
<p>Although DNA methylation plays an important role in gene regulation by affecting gene
expression, the relationship of HM patterns and gene expression in cancer are not
well studied yet. To the best of our knowledge, so far only Xu and Corces report
some related research work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1176935119872959">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1176935119872959">13</xref></sup> They find that hemimethylated sites are inherited over several
cell divisions; stably inherited HM may regulate chromatin interaction. They also
show that gene body HM is associated with increased transcription. According to
these findings, it is important to study the relationship between HM patterns and
gene expression in cancers.</p>
<p>In the past, many studies are conducted to address important questions related to
methylation. These studies include different topics of methylation pattern analysis
and identification, such as integrative data analysis for methylation and other data
(eg, gene expression),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1176935119872959">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1176935119872959"></xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1176935119872959">41</xref></sup> methylation
patterns for noncoding RNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1176935119872959">42</xref></sup> and pan cancer data analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1176935119872959">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1176935119872959">44</xref></sup> Many of the previous
methylation studies are conducted by assuming symmetric methylation (ie, not
considering HM). Because of the existence of HM and its impact on transcription, it
is favorable if a research article states which DNA strand is analyzed after
bisulfite conversion. In the future, it would be optimal if a methylation analysis
is conducted on 2 DNA strands separately as suggested by Naue and Lee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1176935119872959">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 7 breast cancer cell lines we analyzed have their own unique characteristics or
belong to different subtypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1176935119872959">46</xref></sup> For example, 4 (BT474, ZR751, MCF7 and T47D) are ER+, and 3 (BT20, MDAMB231,
and MDAMB468) are ER−; BT474 is luminal B; MCF7, T47D, and ZR751 are luminal A.
Therefore, it is likely that they have different methylation and HM profiles. Our
analysis can identify the hemimethylated sites that are common among these 7 cell
lines, but it does not identify the HM profile for each single cell line or each
breast cancer subtype. With technical replicates of the sequencing data for each
cell line, identifying the HM profile for each subtype can be done in the
future.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we have conducted the first-ever research work on identifying HM in
breast cancer cell lines. Our statistical analysis of RRBS data has shown the
existence of genome-wide HM in breast cancer cell lines. Some of the genes that
contain hemimethylated CpG sites may play a role in tumor growth or suppression. In
addition, some of the hemimethylated genes associated with breast cancer are
connected through biological pathways. Several of the hemimethylated genes are also
known to be hypermethylated in breast cancer. In conclusion, these results suggest
that certain genes in breast cancer cells undergo active methylation or
demethylation, which results in genome-wide HM and may indicate a transition between
different stages of breast cancer. This transition may occur before tumors develop.
Thus, further study of HM may serve as a method to identify breast cancer in earlier
stages and increase the chances of patient survival.</p>
