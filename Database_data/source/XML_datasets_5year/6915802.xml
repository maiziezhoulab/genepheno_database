<title>Summary</title>
<p>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from healthy individuals are important controls for disease-modeling studies. Here we apply precision health to create a high-quality resource of control iPSCs. Footprint-free lines were reprogrammed from four volunteers of the Personal Genome Project Canada (PGPC). Multilineage-directed differentiation efficiently produced functional cortical neurons, cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes. Pilot users demonstrated versatility by generating kidney organoids, T lymphocytes, and sensory neurons. A frameshift knockout was introduced into <italic>MYBPC3</italic> and these cardiomyocytes exhibited the expected hypertrophic phenotype. Whole-genome sequencing-based annotation of PGPC lines revealed on average 20 coding variants. Importantly, nearly all annotated PGPC and HipSci lines harbored at least one pre-existing or acquired variant with cardiac, neurological, or other disease associations. Overall, PGPC lines were efficiently differentiated by multiple users into cells from six tissues for disease modeling, and variant-preferred healthy control lines were identified for specific disease settings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0030">The development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) led to rapid development of many stem cell-based models of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2016</xref>). Despite exponential growth in the application of iPSCs across multiple tissue- and organ-based systems, there remains no consistent consensus about which control lines should be used in disease-modeling studies. Over the past decade, choices for control cells have ranged from: (1) human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that are considered healthy despite a medical history being unavailable, (2) iPSCs from healthy but unrelated individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schwartzentruber et al., 2018</xref>), (3) iPSCs from unaffected family members who may have been phenotyped for the disease of interest, but with unknown broader health profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lan et al., 2013</xref>), and (4) isogenic pairs of iPSC lines derived through CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deneault et al., 2018</xref>), or through non-random X chromosome inactivation status in female cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tchieu et al., 2010</xref>). Hundreds of sources of unrelated and related healthy iPSC lines exist and are widely available from individual labs, biobanks, and large iPSC-focused consortia, such as HipSci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Streeter et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0035">Although there are genetically diverse lines to reflect heterogeneity found within the human population, all control lines are potentially compromised by genetic variants that may predispose to a phenotype or mask it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hollingsworth et al., 2017</xref>). At present, disease modeling has focused on penetrant monogenic disorders that may be relatively unaffected by the presence of concurrent variants. However, we anticipate an emerging need for healthy controls with few disease variants as modeling of complex diseases builds toward assessing the impact of modifier genes or multigenic disorders that may involve multiple variants including noncoding variants in gene regulatory regions.</p>
<p id="p0040">iPSCs carry additional variants compared with donor sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D’Antonio et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gore et al., 2011</xref>). This has made apparent the need for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the full set of potential disease-susceptibility variants present in such control lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D’Antonio et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kilpinen et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Popp et al., 2018</xref>). Although there are some common reprogramming-associated variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yoshihara et al., 2017</xref>), most variants appear to be present in the original mosaic source of cells reprogrammed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abyzov et al., 2017</xref>). Some of these variants could affect downstream differentiations and baseline phenotypes of differentiated lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hoekstra et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, most control lines are recruited for specific studies limited to a single tissue type or disease, and therefore their versatility for multilineage-directed differentiation into many functional cell types required for broad disease modeling research is not firmly established.</p>
<p id="p0045">One way to limit the presence of potentially confounding variants is to reprogram cells from selected donors who have minimal variant load. In both the initial Personal Genome Project (PGP) and Personal Genome Project Canada (PGPC) publications, one aim was to generate iPSCs that would have extensive genomic characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ball et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reuter et al., 2018</xref>). PGPC genotyped and clinically annotated the genomes of 56 apparently healthy individuals who consented to disclosure of their genome sequence and medical traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reuter et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to comprehensive annotation of all classes of constitutional genetic variants, these analyses also included their assessment of the mitochondrial genomes and their pharmacogenetic diplotypes. All healthy PGPC individuals harbor heterozygous variants of unknown significance in disease-relevant genes, but still had no overt disease phenotype at the time of initial assessment or at the start of this study. Here we report the iPSC resource generated from PGPC donors.</p>
<p id="p0050">Our resource comprises multiple iPSC lines derived from two male and two female donors. One line each from both males and one female was subjected to multilineage-directed differentiation into cortical neurons, cardiomyocytes (CMs), and hepatocytes representative of the three germ layers. The morphology and function of the resulting cells were evaluated to assess the versatility of PGPC iPSC lines for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of different tissues. To further evaluate the versatility of the resource, we shared the three best-characterized PGPC lines with pilot users for differentiation into kidney organoids, T lymphocytes, and sensory neurons. CRISPR gene editing of a known cardiomyopathy gene created an isogenic pair of lines for modeling a cardiac disorder. As variant annotation of the donors became available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reuter et al., 2018</xref>), we performed WGS to search for iPSC line-specific variants that were distinct from donor PGPC blood variants, and surveyed off-target mutations in the gene edited line.</p>

<title>Isolation and Pluripotency Characterization of PGPC iPSC Lines</title>
<p id="p0055">We invited PGPC donors to participate in this iPSC study, and selected two male (PGPC3 and PGPC17) and two female donors (PGPC14 and PGPC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reuter et al., 2018</xref>). We collected peripheral blood to isolate and reprogram CD34+ cells using non-integrating Sendai viruses. Approximately 120 clones from each donor were picked and qualitative metrics (colony morphology and low levels of spontaneously differentiated cells) were used to select lines for characterization. iPSC lines were maintained in feeder-free conditions and tested for Sendai virus clearance at passage (P)8 to 10. Sendai virus-negative lines were sent for karyotyping between P13 and P15. At least four karyotypically normal cell lines were found from each donor, with standard characterization results summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S1</xref> and representative data shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>. All cell lines stained positive for both cell surface (SSEA4 and TRA-1-60) and nuclear (OCT4 and NANOG) undifferentiated markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>). We tested functional pluripotency by spontaneously differentiating embryoid bodies followed by staining for markers of all three germ layers—ectoderm (TUBB3), mesoderm (SMA), and endoderm (AFP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>). All female lines had skewed X chromosome inactivation as revealed by androgen receptor assays consistent with preservation of an inactive X chromosome observed in isogenic female lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>). These data confirm basic pluripotency status of our resource and cells were expanded and banked at passages ranging from P14 to P16.</p>
<p id="p0060">We chose to focus on one cell line from the first three donors for deeper characterization as PGPC1 was recruited much later. PGPC3_75, PGPC14_26, and PGPC17_11 were selected for further phenotyping based on qualitative metrics regarding their growth rate, morphology, and relative low rate of spontaneous differentiation. RNA sequencing was analyzed online using Pluritest, and all lines cluster to the pluripotency quadrant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>). As explained in detail below, we validated the pluripotency and explored the versatility of all three lines for multilineage-directed differentiation to excitatory cortical neurons, CMs, and hepatocytes as representatives of cells derived from ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm respectively.</p>
<p id="p0065">At this point the WGS data of all the PGPC participants became available and were annotated for coding variants defined by the American College of Medical Genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Richards et al., 2015</xref>). Two heterozygous variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) associated with electrophysiological alterations in cardiac disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S2</xref>) were identified in PGPC3 (<italic>TRPM4</italic>) and PGPC14 (<italic>KCNE2</italic>), respectively. VUS that could affect neurologic function were found in cells derived from PGPC14 and PGPC17 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S3</xref>). We therefore prioritized PGPC3 as a preferred line for neuronal models and PGPC17 as a variant-preferred line for cardiac models based on their pre-existing variants. The newest PGPC1 female lines are available only with variant annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S2</xref>) and pluripotency characterization as part of the resource.</p>

<title>Ectodermal Differentiation into Active Cortical Neurons</title>
<p id="p0070">To evaluate PGPC iPSC-derived neurons, we infected PGPC lines and a previously published control iPSC line (WT37) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>) with lentivirus bearing doxycycline-inducible <italic>Ngn2</italic> to generate homogeneous populations of excitatory cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Neurons were induced with doxycycline for 1 week and selected with puromycin and cytarabine (Ara-C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deneault et al., 2018</xref>) then re-seeded for morphological analysis in co-cultures with mouse astrocytes after an additional 5 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A). To measure single neurons, we sparsely labeled 6-week cultured neurons by transfection with ubiquitous expressing GFP plasmid in two batches. Neurons were identified by staining with pan-neuronal marker MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B). Soma area, dendritic length, and neuronal complexity of the PGPC neurons determined by Sholl analysis were similar to the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>C–1E).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Active Neurons Generated from PGPC iPSCs Display Similar Dendrite Morphology and Network Circuitry</p><p>(A) Differentiation scheme to generate excitatory cortical neurons by induction of <italic>Ngn2</italic>.

Representative raster plots of PGPC3_75 showed progression of spontaneous activity at 3 weeks compared with development of network bursts at 5 and 7 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>F). At the 7-week time point, we observed synchronous firing across multiple electrodes (minimum 8/16 electrodes) within wells, indicative of neural circuit formation as measured by network burst frequencies. Neurons displayed weighted mean firing rates ranging from 5 to 7.5 Hz and network burst frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 0.35 Hz, which were comparable with or more active (∼5 and ∼0.1 Hz, respectively) than our previously published MEA results from <italic>Ngn2</italic>-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deneault et al., 2018</xref>). To confirm that recorded activity was due to synaptic transmission from glutamatergic excitatory neurons, we treated cells with an α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor inhibitor—6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX)—which abolished network bursting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>G). Network bursting began to recover 2 h after washing out CNQX. These findings demonstrate differentiation of three PGPC lines into neurons and that the variant-preferred PGPC3 line was spontaneously active in network circuits.</p>

All three PGPC CMs had similar average beat rates and amplitudes. To measure contractility of PGPC17_11 in a complementary method and to determine extracellular electrophysiology, an xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) Cardio ExtraCellular Recording (ECR) system was used. In brief, contracting CMs were recorded every 3 h for ∼25 days after reseeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>G). Contractility of CMs was evaluated via impedance readouts as beats per minute (bpm) and beating amplitude (BAmp) defined as the cell index value between lowest and highest points within a beat waveform.

<p id="p0090">For endodermal differentiation we generated hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>A).

<title>Utility of the Resource––Mesodermal Differentiation into Kidney Organoids and T Cells</title>
<p id="p0095">To test the utility of PGPC lines as a resource, we made them available to pilot users. Unlike monolayer differentiations described above, human kidney organoids are 3D structures generated from iPSCs consisting of multiple cell types and resembling early embryonic human kidney tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Takasato et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>A).</p>
<p id="p0100">This protocol entailed a 7-day monolayer culture with directed differentiation toward posterior streak mesoderm (PSM) and subsequently to anterior and posterior intermediate mesoderm (AIM and PIM, respectively). This was accomplished by applying the canonical WNT-signaling activator, CHIR99021 (CHIR), followed by a switch to fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) and heparin. Timing of the FGF9/heparin switch (between D3 and D5 of differentiation) determined the relative proportion of AIM versus PIM and thus fewer or more nephrons. For all experiments, we made this factor switch on D5. During this course, the PSM marker <italic>T</italic> (brachyury) was transiently induced followed by AIM marker <italic>GATA3</italic> and PIM marker <italic>HOXD11</italic> as measured by qPCR and expression was normalized to iPSCs at D0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A). After 7 days of monolayer differentiation cells were aggregated, transferred to Transwell membranes, pulsed with CHIR, and then treated with FGF9/heparin for an additional 5 days. Aggregates began reorganization and formed nephron-like structures. mRNA level analysis of D25 organoids (normalized to D7 pre-aggregated cells) showed induction of markers of different nephron segments, endothelial, and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A). Immunofluorescence imaging of D18 cross-sections of organoids showed glomerular structures—positive for podocyte marker Wilms tumor 1—as well as tubular structures, both proximal—labeled with lectin (LTL)—and distal—positive for E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>B).

<p id="p0105">To evaluate the potential to generate hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mature T cells, we compared the PGPC lines with iPSC11 (Alstem Cell Advancements) in an embryoid body differentiation protocol with feeder-free adaptation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>B). All three PGPC lines gave rise to CD34+ HSPCs with a similar proficiency as iPSC11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>C) and were magnetic-activated cell sorted at D8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>C). PGPC14 and 17 were most enriched for CD34+ HSPCs and cocultured on OP9-DL4 cells. Next, multi-color flow cytometry was used to simultaneously measure different cell populations at D8+14 and D8+42 to assess the ability of HSPCs to differentiate to T lymphocytes, a hallmark of definitive hematopoietic potential of HSPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>D). At D8+14 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>E), early T-lineage progenitor cells (proT cells marked as CD34+ CD7+) could be observed transitioning to more developmentally matured T-lineage cells (CD34– CD7+), with a subpopulation co-expressing a pan-T cell marker (CD7+ CD5+). PGPC14 exhibited a prolonged proT stage (70%), while PGPC17 showed a more rapid transition (17%) compared with iPSC11 (53%). Simultaneous assessment of mature T-lineage markers on culture D8+42 detected the presence of double-positive (DP) CD4+ CD8+ T-lineage cells, T cell receptors (TCR+) and a T cell-specific marker (CD3+). At this time point, the PGPC lines showed similar propensity as iPSC11 to generate TCR α/β (39%–45%) cells, but only PGPC17 produced rare TCR γ/δ bearing (0.1%) DP cells. We conclude that PGPC lines differentiate into HSPC that mature into T cells but with different maturation dynamics that may require line-specific protocol optimization.</p>

<p id="p0115">To further characterize phenotype, we imaged the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses evoked by brief application of various agonists.

At 2 weeks post-induction, 44.6% of neurons responded to the TrpV1 agonist capsaicin, but that number fell to 10% by week 4 (p &lt; 0.00001). TrpV1 is a marker of peptidergic nociceptors, but is broadly expressed among immature PSNs and is developmentally downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cavanaugh et al., 2011</xref>). Our data suggest that iPSC-derived PSNs follow a similar developmental program. Low TrpV1 expression at 4 weeks suggests that repetitive spiking PSNs represent predominantly non-peptidergic nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>), whereas the transient spiking neurons are most likely mechanoreceptors. The proportion of neurons responsive to GABA increased over time (p = 0.0001), as did the proportion responsive to the purinergic receptor agonist ATP (p = 0.042). These results demonstrate that PGPC17 was successfully differentiated into active neurons with a non-peptidergic nociceptor or mechanoreceptor phenotype.</p>

We searched 100 base pairs up- and downstream of each predicted site and found zero novel variants within these regions. When we looked for overall novel genomic variation, 917 new single-nucleotide variants and one intergenic 32-kb deletion (chr18:12,137,685–12,169,689) were found (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). None of these variants were likely pathogenic, similar to our other reported gene edited lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deneault et al., 2018</xref>).<fig id="fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Derivation of <italic>MYBPC3</italic>-knockout iPSC that Display a Cardiomyopathy Phenotype</p><p>(A) Exon 24 of <italic>MYBPC3</italic> was targeted by CRISPR/Cas9 and Sanger sequencing of one clone PGPC17_11-<italic>MYBPC3</italic>#4 (hereby identified as MYBPC3_KO) identified an out-of-frame insertion resulting in an early stop codon.</p><p>(B) Normal karyotype was confirmed before differentiation and characterization.</p><p>(C) Western blot probing for MYBPC3 using iPSC lysate as a negative control and parental CM lysate as a positive control.

<p id="p0130">To examine the consequences of the frameshifts on MYBPC3 protein, we generated CMs as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and collected protein lysates from PGPC17 parental and <italic>MYBPC3_KO</italic> iPSC-CMs. Western blots were unable to detect MYBPC3 protein in the KO clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>C). We matured CMs until D36–D44 to look for phenotypic evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as predicted by loss of MYBPC3. Indeed, xCELLigence assays detected increased BAmp in the MYBPC3_KO-CMs compared with the parental line at D42 (0.08 and 0.04 a.u., respectively) while having similar beat rates (41 to 36 bpm, respectively). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohn et al. (2019)</xref> generated a frameshift in <italic>MYBPC3</italic> using cells from the American PGP and observed similar phenotypes. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PGPC17_11 for gene editing to produce isogenic cell lines for cardiac phenotyping.</p>

<title>WGS Analysis of Publicly Available HipSci Lines</title>
<p id="p0135">Since we found that all our iPSC lines have pre-existing and/or novel variants of potential concern when considering experiments for different lineages, we analyzed downloaded genome sequencing data of five publicly available HipSci lines suggested as healthy controls (HPSI0114i.kolf_2, HPSI0214i.kucg_2, HPSI0214i.wibj_2, HPSI0314i.hoik_1, and HPSI0314i.sojd_3). Across all five samples, 89%–96% of the genome was covered at least 20× (quality metrics in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S4</xref>). We interpreted likely pathogenic variants, loss-of-function constraint gene variants, and VUS as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reuter et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3">Supplemental Information</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0140">Two likely pathogenic variants were found in kolf_2 and one in sojd_3 that were predicted to have clinical relevance if identified in humans and could also affect experimental assays. kolf_2 had a substitution of two adjacent nucleotides, disrupting exon-intron boundaries of one <italic>COL3A1</italic> allele. One variant was within canonical splice site c.3526-1G&gt;A, and likely to cause out-of-frame exon skipping. If splicing was preserved, the second nucleotide change would result in a likely pathogenic missense alteration p.(Gly1176Ser). COL3A1 haploinsufficiency is associated with dysfunctional connective tissue, such as in the vascular system, skin, intestine, lung, and uterus, and causes vascular type (IV) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The same kolf_2 line also harbored a heterozygous 19-bp deletion p.(Pro197Hisfs<sup>∗</sup>12) in <italic>ARID2</italic>. The variant was likely pathogenic for Coffin-Siris syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with variable skeletal and organ manifestations. These likely pathogenic variants were also confirmed in the kolf2-C1 subline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Skarnes et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, sojd_3 harbored a likely pathogenic heterozygous nonsense variant p.(Gln348<sup>∗</sup>) in <italic>BCOR</italic>. This X-linked gene encodes a transcriptional corepressor with important functions in early embryonic development of various tissues. Females with heterozygous <italic>BCOR</italic> defects may exhibit oculofaciocardiodental syndrome. None of these likely pathogenic variants had been previously reported, and we cannot determine if they were present in the donor genomes, or arose during reprogramming, and could therefore be mosaic. We also identified several loss-of-function variants of uncertain significance in constrained genes in hoik_1 and kucg_2, mostly with known functions in early development (as in <italic>PTK2</italic>, <italic>ZNF398</italic>, <italic>UBE3C</italic>, <italic>CDC37</italic>, and <italic>TNS3</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S3</xref>) and many VUS (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3">Supplemental Information</xref>). We did not identify pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in wibj_2, which suggests it is the variant-preferred line among this subset.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="p0145">Here we generated a high-quality resource of versatile iPSC control lines for use in disease modeling studies. These cells have the benefit of both annotated genomic variants and demonstrated multilineage-directed differentiation into functional cortical neurons, CMs, and hepatocytes. Pilot users showed that the lines can be used to generate kidney organoids, T lymphocytes, or to identify specific subtypes of active sensory neurons. We also performed gene editing, which revealed a preliminary phenotype in isogenic <italic>MYBPC3</italic> KO CMs similar to another isogenic pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohn et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0150">Apart from their versatility, the main advantage of these blood-derived footprint-free lines is the clinical annotation of potentially disease-associated variants that may affect cellular phenotypes. Variant analysis in the PGPC participants' blood had revealed heterozygous variants of unknown significance in all individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reuter et al., 2018</xref>). This observation suggests that it may not be possible to isolate universal control lines and reinforces the importance for WGS in characterizing control lines, especially as clinical annotation gains precision with ongoing variant discoveries. WGS has the advantage of allowing detection of coding variants, CNVs, and noncoding variants, although the latter have not yet been fully explored in these lines. Knowledge of the donors' genomes allowed predictions on how to prioritize control lines for use as tissue specific controls. For example, as PGPC3 and PGPC14 had variants that could predispose to altered cardiac channel function, PGPC17 was deemed to be the preferred line for the study of cardiac disease. PGPC3, however, were variant preferred for neurological disorders. Consistent with a precision health approach, this strategy would allow matching of genotyped iPSC controls to the disease being modeled.</p>
<p id="p0155">WGS has previously determined that iPSC lines have variants that differ from those in the donor. Our WGS data reveals that the reprogrammed lines have more than a thousand new SNVs each, whereas only two new CNVs were detected likely due to previous selection for normal karyotype. Most variants were of uncertain significance, with new variants of potential concern found in two of four of the blood (CD34+ cell)-derived PGPC lines (PGPC1_73 and PGPC14_26 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S3</xref>). Genome sequencing of the <italic>MYBPC3</italic> KO line showed more than 900 additional SNVs compared with the unedited iPSC line. None of the new variants were near potential gRNA cut sites, suggesting that they were not off-target and were indeed novel mutations. These analyses highlight that iPSC lines harbor variants of potential concern that are not found in the donor blood. Moreover, our annotation of five healthy control lines from the HipSci consortium that were generated from fibroblasts discovered likely pathogenic variants in two lines and additional loss-of-function variants in constrained genes in two other lines, leaving only wibj_2 as a preferred healthy control line. Since donor WGS is not available for the HipSci lines, it is not possible to determine whether these potentially damaging variants were pre-existing or were captured during fibroblast reprogramming. In contrast, our precision health resource identified &gt;1,000 new variants in each iPSC line, consistent with numbers reported for fibroblast reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abyzov et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that clinical annotation of WGS data is an important quality control measure of iPSC lines, and its expanded use will identify the best source of healthy control cells to reprogram to find additional variant-preferred lines for disease modeling.</p>
<p id="p0160">Disease modeling has generally used two to three lines from each individual to account for variability in reprogramming. To account for 1,000–2,000 novel variants in each line compared with the parental genome, this study provides another rationale for studying multiple lines from each individual. With this in mind, we generated a resource of four to five iPSC lines each from two males and two females, all with standard pluripotency characterization available. We also performed multilineage-directed differentiation on a single line from three individuals, assuming that single lines from three to four individuals can account for inter-individual variability. One highly characterized line is therefore available from three PGPC participants, and preferred lines are likely to be of high utility for gene editing studies that compare the phenotype of isogenic cells. Ultimately, users of the resource will select one or more lines from each PGPC participant depending on their research strategy. Future efforts to apply our precision health approach to the characterization of additional control lines in cell repositories should increase the numbers of variant-preferred iPSC banked for gene editing and disease modeling studies.</p>
<p id="p0165">Overall, our resource upgrades the quality of existing healthy iPSC lines in two ways. First our identification of novel variants of potential concern after reprogramming suggest that a subset of lines may not accurately reflect the phenotype of the original donor in some tissues. To address this concern, our precision health resource provides variant-preferred lines as controls for cardiac or neurological disease modeling and for use in gene editing strategies to create isogenic pairs of mutant and control cells. Second, our exhaustive characterization of multilineage-directed differentiation by pilot users provides strong evidence that the lines can be broadly applied by the disease modeling community.</p>

<title>Experimental Procedures</title>
<p id="p0170">Reprogramming of PGPC iPSCs was performed under the approval of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Stem Cell Oversight Committee, and the Research Ethics Board of The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. Blood cells were reprogrammed with Sendai virus to deliver reprogramming factors, and iPSCs were maintained in feeder-free conditions with mTeSR1 (STEMCELL Technologies); see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3">Supplemental Information</xref>. WGS was performed on Illumina HighSeq X and analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reuter et al., 2018</xref>). A vector-based CRISPR/Cas9 approach was used to mutagenize <italic>MYBPC3</italic>, further described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3">Supplemental Information</xref>. Detailed descriptions of differentiations, characterizations, and functional assays are summarized in figures and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3">Supplemental Information</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>Ngn2</italic> induced iPSCs to differentiate to glutamatergic neurons. Extracellular electrophysiology recordings were collected with an Axion Maestro MEA reader (Axion Biosystems) micro-electrode array as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3">Supplemental Information</xref>. CMs were differentiated using STEMdiff Cardiomyocyte Differentiation Kits (STEMCELL Technologies). CM calcium imaging was captured by loading cells with Fluo-4 dye and taking images at 4 Hz for 30 s. Contractile and electrical activity was recorded with an xCELLigence RTCA CardioECR (ACEA Biosciences). CYP3A7 was measured using a p450-Glo assay kit (Promega) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Whole-cell electrophysiology recordings where made at room temperature with an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices) from borosilicate patch electrodes. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was performed on sensory neurons incubated in Ca<sup>2+</sup> green-1 AM dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature. Images were acquired at 25 Hz using a NeuroCCD-SM256 imaging system (RedShirt Imaging).</p>
