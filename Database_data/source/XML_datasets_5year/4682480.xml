<title>Background</title>
<p>A Callous-Unemotional trait specifier (termed ‘Limited Prosocial Emotions’) was added
to the diagnosis of conduct disorder in DSM-5. The Inventory of Callous-Unemotional
Traits (ICU) is a comprehensive measure of these traits assessing three distinct, yet
correlated dimensions – Callousness, Uncaring, and Unemotional – all thought to reflect
the general Callous-Unemotional construct. The present study was the first to examine
the degree to which the aetiology of these dimensions is shared <italic>v</italic>.
independent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec_a2" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Parent-reported ICU data from 5092 16-year-old twin pairs from the Twins Early
Development Study were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis. Multivariate genetic
modelling was applied to the best-fitting structure.</p>

<sec id="sec_a3" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A general-specific structure, retaining a general factor and two uncorrelated specific
factors (Callousness-Uncaring, Unemotional), provided the best fit to the data. The
general factor was substantially heritable (h<sup>2</sup> = 0.58, 95% CI 0.51–0.65).
Unusually, shared environmental influences were also important in accounting for this
general factor (c<sup>2</sup> = 0.26, 95% CI 0.22–0.31), in addition to non-shared
environmental influences. The Unemotional dimension appeared phenotypically and
genetically distinct as shown by the substantial loadings of unemotional items on a
separate dimension and a low genetic correlation between Unemotional and
Callousness-Uncaring.</p>

<sec id="sec_a4" sec-type="conclusion">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A general factor, indicative of a shared phenotypic structure across the dimensions of
the ICU was under substantial common genetic and more modest shared environment
influences. Our findings also suggest that the relevance of the Unemotional dimension as
part of a comprehensive assessment of CU traits should be investigated further.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Callous-Unemotional (CU) traits refer to a lack of guilt, disregard for others’ feelings
and shallow display of emotions; characteristics that are the hallmark of psychopathy in
adults (Cleckley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">1976</xref>; Hare, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref102">2003</xref>) and also index youth at risk of developing psychopathy and
persistent antisocial behaviour (Frick <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">2014</xref>). CU traits characterize a subgroup of
antisocial youth who show a particularly severe, aggressive, and stable pattern of conduct
problems (Christian <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">1997</xref>; Frick <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">2005</xref>; Vincent <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">2003</xref>; Frick &amp; Dickens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">2006</xref>). This pattern holds for forensic, clinical and
community samples (Frick <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">2003</xref>; Kruh <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">2005</xref>). Based on this extensive body of research, as
well as findings of different aetiology and neurocognitive correlates of conduct problems in
children with CU traits (Viding &amp; McCrory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">2012</xref>), a CU specifier (termed Limited Prosocial Emotions) has been added to the
diagnosis of conduct disorder in DSM-5 (APA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU; Frick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">2003</xref>) is a developmentally appropriate instrument commonly used to measure CU
traits in children, adolescents and young adults. The ICU was originally designed to be a
unidimensional instrument (Frick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">2003</xref>), but
eleven empirical studies (using clinical and community samples) have since examined its
factorial structure. Eight studies have utilized confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; Kimonis
<italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>; Fanti <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">2009</xref>; Roose <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">2010</xref>; Byrd <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">2013</xref>; Ezpeleta <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">2013</xref>; Houghton <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">2013</xref>; Ciucci <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">2014</xref>; Waller <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">2014</xref>; Hawes <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">2014</xref>), two studies have employed both CFA and
exploratory factor analysis (EFA; Essau <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2006</xref>; Feilhauer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">2012</xref>), and one study has used principal components
analysis (PCA; Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2013</xref>). These studies have tested various factorial
structures, including a general-specific model (or bifactor model, as termed in past ICU
studies), which has received the most consistent empirical support.</p>
<p>The general-specific factorial structure assumes that all items load on a general factor,
and, in addition, load on specific factors. In this model, specific factors capture
<italic>residual variance</italic> unaccounted for by the general factor. In other words,
this general-specific structure posits that a general factor underlies individual
differences in the ICU, but also that additional factors tapping unique dimensions are
needed for a full representation of individual differences in ICU. These additional factors
– by virtue of their <italic>specific</italic> quality – are orthogonal to each other and
independent of a general factor. Previous studies have identified the following specific
factors: (1) Callousness (lack of empathy for others and lack remorse for hurting others –
e.g. ‘I do not care whom I hurt to get what I want’, ‘I do not feel remorseful when I do
something wrong’); (2) Uncaring (lack of concern for others’ feelings or little desire to
make others feel good – e.g. ‘I try not to hurt others’ feelings’, reverse scored, ‘I do
things to make others feel good’, reverse scored) and; (3) Unemotional (impoverished,
shallow and altered emotional experience and expression – e.g. ‘I hide my feelings from
others’, ‘I am very expressive and emotional’, reverse scored; Essau <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2006</xref>; Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>; Fanti <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">2009</xref>; Roose <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">2010</xref>; Byrd <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">2013</xref>; Ezpeleta <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">2013</xref>; Ciucci <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">2014</xref>; Waller <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">2014</xref>). While this factorial structure has received
substantial support in CFA studies, it is noteworthy that allocation of items to the various
ICU factors has not been consistent across studies (Essau <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2006</xref>; Feilhauer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">2012</xref>; Houghton <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">2013</xref>; Hawes <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior validation studies with youth and adult samples have shown that the ICU total score
is internally consistent and shows expected associations with relevant external criteria,
i.e. positive associations with conduct problems and delinquency, offence history,
aggression, and psychosocial functioning, as well as negative associations with
agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, prosocial beliefs, empathy, and positive affect
(Essau <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2006</xref>; Fanti <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">2009</xref>; Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>; Roose <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">2010</xref>). However, the internal consistencies of the
dimensions vary considerably and typically range from poor to acceptable. Moreover, all
three dimensions of the ICU have shown significant associations with other self-report
measures of psychopathy, with associations involving Callousness and Uncaring dimensions
being most robust (Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>; Roose <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Key distinctions have also emerged between the ICU dimensions. First, the Callousness and
Uncaring dimensions are typically highly correlated, but the associations between these two
dimensions and the Unemotional dimension are usually weaker (e.g. Roose <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">2010</xref>). Second, both Callousness and Uncaring are
associated with aggression in youth and Uncaring is also linked with the emotional deficits
believed to be at the core of psychopathic traits (e.g. low psychophysiological responding;
Essau <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2006</xref>; Fanti <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">2009</xref>; Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>). In contrast to the Uncaring and Callousness
dimensions, the Unemotional dimension has not demonstrated consistent or robust correlations
with external correlates that are typically associated with psychopathy (Kimonis <italic>et
al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>; Roose <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">2010</xref>; Byrd <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">2013</xref>). Contrary to Callousness and Uncaring, the
Unemotional dimension is not related to delinquency and aggression (Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>; Byrd <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">2013</xref>), and is also not consistently correlated with
externalising behaviours and conduct disorder (Essau <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2006</xref>). These patterns of associations have led
several authors (e.g. Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2013</xref>) to consider two related possibilities: (1)
the Unemotional items might index a dimension partly distinct from the Uncaring and
Callousness dimensions; (2) the Unemotional dimension might not carry a
<italic>specific</italic> risk for later psychopathy.</p>
<p>In brief, there are important phenotypic distinctions between the ICU dimensions. These
distinctions could be due to differential genetic/environmental aetiology, but no study to
date has examined the factorial structure of the ICU in a genetically informative design. To
better understand the aetiology of the different trait dimensions underlying the broader CU
construct, as well as their interrelations, we assessed a large, population-based sample of
16-year-old British twins using parent reports of the ICU. This study had two objectives:
(1) to examine the phenotypic factorial structure of the ICU, and more importantly (2) to
investigate the genetic/environmental aetiology of the ICU factors and their
interrelation.</p>

<p>The data in this study come from 5092 twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study
(TEDS) with 16-year parent-reported CU data (<italic>N</italic><sub>MZ</sub> = 1821;
<italic>N</italic><sub>DZ</sub> = 3271). TEDS is a large population-based longitudinal
study of twins born in England and Wales between 1994 and 1996. The sample and its history
are described in detail elsewhere (Trouton <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">2002</xref>; Oliver &amp; Plomin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">2007</xref>; Haworth <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">2013</xref>). Informed written consent was obtained from all
of the families who agreed to take part in the study. The study and consent procedure were
approved by the Institute of Psychiatry and Maudsley Ethics Committee. The average age of
participants at the time of assessment was 16.32 years (<sc>s.d.</sc> = 0.68 years).
Despite attrition, the TEDS sample that provided data at age 16 is closely matched to the
UK population. Initially, 13 722 families returned data for first contact on TEDS. Of
these families, 91.7% were of European descent, with 35.5% of mothers having A-levels or
higher (A-levels are the national educational examination taken at 18 years in the UK, and
refer to parental educational qualifications) and 43.1% of them being employed.
Characteristics of the study sample were largely similar, with 95.9% of the families being
of European descent, 42.7% of mothers having A-levels or higher and 49% of them being
employed (see Supplementary Table S1 for details on sample demographics).</p>

<title>Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU; Frick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">2003</xref>)</title>
<p>The ICU is a 24-item self-, parent- or teacher-report questionnaire designed to assess CU
traits in youth. The content of the ICU was derived from the six-item CU scale of the
Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD; Frick &amp; Hare, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2001</xref>), shown to designate a distinct subset of antisocial youth who
display characteristics associated with the construct of psychopathy (Frick <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">2000</xref>). The items are rated on a 4-point Likert
scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all true</italic>) to 3 (<italic>definitely
true</italic>). The parent-report version of the ICU was used in the current study.
Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable (Callousness, <italic>α</italic> = 0.73;
Unemotional, <italic>α</italic> = 0.72) to very good (Uncaring, <italic>α</italic> = 0.85;
total scale, <italic>α</italic> = 0.88). Subscale-total correlations ranged between 0.67
and 0.88, and subscale correlations ranged between 0.34 and 0.62 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref> for descriptive statistics and

<p>The factorial structure of the ICU was tested at the item level with CFA. Following
previous work on the ICU (Essau <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2006</xref>; Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2013</xref>; Fanti <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">2009</xref>; Roose <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">2010</xref>), we used a Robust maximum likelihood
(MLR) estimator to account for item non-normality and the corresponding scaled
statistics (Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">1993</xref>).
Following previous CFA research on the ICU (e.g. Essau <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2006</xref>; Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>), a set of alternative factorial
structures was tested: (1) one factor; (2) three correlated factors; (3) two correlated
factors; (4) hierarchical with three subfactors; (5) hierarchical with two subfactors;
(6) general-specific with three specific factors; (7) general-specific with two specific
factors. More details about the models are included in the Supplementary material. To
account for non-independence of observations inherent to twin data, relevant
specifications for twin dyads were included (e.g. variances and factor loadings
equality-constrained across twins and zygosity; Olsen &amp; Kenny, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">2006</xref>). All items were age- and sex-regressed.
Details about the fit indices are provided in the Supplementary material. On the basis
of CFA analyses, we selected the best-fitting factorial structure for genetic
modelling.</p>

<title>Genetic analyses</title>
<p>Genetic modelling was applied to the best-fitting factorial structure of the ICU, i.e.
the general-specific model including the Callousness-Uncaring and the Unemotional
factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The univariate ACE model
decomposes the variance of a phenotype into additive genetic (h<sup>2</sup>), shared
environmental (c<sup>2</sup>), and unique (or non-shared) environmental factors
(e<sup>2</sup>; Neale &amp; Cardon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">1992</xref>).
In the present study, a multivariate genetic model was fitted to assess the
genetic/environmental aetiology of all ICU factors. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, this model may be described as a series of simultaneous
univariate ACE models. This is because, in the general-specific model, no correlation
exists between the general and the specific factors that could be decomposed in ACE
components. The first part of the model assessed genetic/environmental contributions on
the general factor. As all ICU items load on the general factor, this part of the model
provides an indicator of aetiological overlap across the ICU. A second part of the model
tested genetic/environmental contributions to each specific factor. As the specific
factors represent residuals unaccounted for by the general factor and are orthogonal,
this component specifies aetiological independence of each specific factor. More details
about this model are included in the Supplementary material (see also a Cholesky
decomposition of the ICU subscale scores in the Supplementary material; Supplementary
Table S2). Missing data was handled using Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML;
Arbuckle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">1996</xref>). All the analyses were conducted
using the Structural Equation Modelling R package <italic>Lavaan</italic> (R 3.03; R

<p>Fit indices for the CFA analyses are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab02">Table 2</xref>. The three-factor general-specific model showed a better fit than other
models (i.e. one factor, hierarchical with three subfactors, hierarchical with two
subfactors, three correlated factors, two correlated factors). However, the best model fit
was attained with the two-factor general-specific model, which indicates that item
allocation to two factors – rather than three – provides a better fit to the ICU data.

<p>We further examined the data to determine whether particular items contributed to
suboptimal model fit. Item-total correlations indicated that items 2
(<italic>r</italic> = 0.16; ‘What he/she thinks is right and wrong is different from what
other people think’) and 10 (<italic>r</italic> = −0.15; ‘He/she does not let his/her
feelings control him/her’) from the Callousness-Uncaring subset were essentially unrelated
to the remaining items on the scale. Previous studies reported low item-total correlations
and/or factor loadings for these two items (e.g. Essau <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2006</xref>; Hawes <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">2014</xref>). We suspect that item 2 is unspecific as CU
traits are only one among many reasons why the notion of right and wrong may differ in an
individual compared to others. Moreover, the wording of item 10 could be interpreted as
indicating emotional repression or a capacity for self-control. As in Kimonis <italic>et
al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>) and Hawes <italic>et
al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">2014</xref>), we withdrew these items from
our analyses. Each model presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab02">Table 2</xref>
was analysed <italic>without</italic> these items.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tab03">Table 3</xref> presents the factor loadings for the
general-specific model with two specific factors. On average, loadings of the
Callousness-Uncaring items were weaker on the specific factor (−0.05 to 0.50) than on the
general factor (0.21–0.61), which indicates that these items were well represented by the
general factor. All items which loaded highly on the specific Callousness-Uncaring factor
also loaded highly on the general factor. These items were very similar in content in that
they provided indicators of the extent to which the target child tries to do his/her best
at school or at work [e.g. item 3: ‘He/she cares about how well he/she does at school or
work. (R)’; item 20: ‘He/she does not like to put the time into doing things well.’]. The
Unemotional items loaded highly and uniformly on their specific factor. <table-wrap id="tab03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Factor loadings for the general-specific model of the Inventory of

<p>Results from the genetic analyses conducted on the ICU factors are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab04">Table 4</xref>, which includes estimates of genetic
(h<sup>2</sup>), shared environmental (c<sup>2</sup>) and unique environmental

indicative of moderate to high heritability and this was confirmed by genetic modelling
(general factor: h<sup>2</sup> = 0.58; Callousness-Uncaring: h<sup>2</sup> = 0.70;
Unemotional: h<sup>2</sup> = 0.79). The shared environment component was only significant
for the general factor (c<sup>2</sup> = 0.26). Modest to moderate contributions of unique

<italic>e</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.30; Unemotional: e<sup>2</sup> = 0.21). Thus, the

<p>Finally, results from our Cholesky decomposition conducted on the ICU subscale scores
(see the Supplementary material) indicate that 78% of the genetic variance of the
Unemotional score was specific to this factor and not explained by genetic factors
underlying the Callousness-Uncaring subscore. This analysis further underscores that the
Unemotional items define a dimension partly separate from dimensions that are more
representative of the core construct of interest (i.e. those tapped by items from the
Callousness and Uncaring subscales).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a large youth sample, the present study investigated the phenotypic structure and the
genetic/environmental aetiology of Callous-Unemotional traits, as assessed by the ICU. A
general-specific model – comprising a general factor and two specific factors
(Callousness-Uncaring, Unemotional) – fitted the data best. All items, particularly those
from the Callous-Uncaring dimension, loaded on the general factor. Twin analyses, conducted
for the first time with this instrument, indicated that the general factor was substantially
heritable. This suggests a substantial degree of common genetic contributions across the CU
construct as measured by the ICU. Noticeably, shared environmental influences also
contributed to the general factor. In addition, our analyses indicated that in contrast to
the other dimensions, the Unemotional dimension was partly distinct both phenotypically and
also in terms of its aetiology, in particular genetic influences. We will first discuss the
general phenotypic and genetic/environmental structure of the ICU before moving to the
distinctions between the specific factors, Callousness-Uncaring and Unemotional.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2013</xref>) and clinical youth (Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>). Our findings also suggest that a
general-specific model fits the data best, but with two (Callousness-Uncaring and
Unemotional), rather than three factors.</p>
<p>Past behavioural genetic research on CU traits has reported consistent results of moderate
to strong heritability of CU traits (see Viding &amp; McCrory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">2012</xref>). Accordingly, our analyses showed that the general factor is
substantially heritable. As all ICU items load on this general factor, this implies that
there is a degree of shared genetic risk across the whole set of ICU items. Notably, common
genetic effects on the whole ICU scale may imply contributions of one specific class of risk
genes, possibly linked to a limited number of intermediate phenotypes (e.g. reactivity of
brain networks critical for affective/empathic processing) in the development of CU traits.
This one-faceted genetic aetiology may also imply a limited number of temperamental and
cognitive-affective precursors (and early treatment targets) to CU traits. Yet, the
general-specific model also indicates that the ICU measures specific features that differ in
terms of their psychometric features and links to a general construct. In line with this,
unique genetic contributions were also found for the Callousness-Uncaring and Unemotional
factors.</p>
<p>Our twin analyses also revealed that shared environmental influences, i.e. influences that
make twins more similar, contributed to the general factor but not to the specific factors.
The magnitude of the influence on the general factor (26%) is noticeable as a meta-analysis
found estimates ranging from 12% to 21% for different types of mother-reported child and
adolescent psychopathology symptoms (Burt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">2009</xref>).
While a heritable component was expected for CU traits, shared environmental variance is not
commonly found in twin research on CU traits (see Viding &amp; McCrory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">2012</xref>). There may be several reasons for this finding.
First, parent reports more commonly detect shared environmental effects (Burt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">2009</xref>). Second, the ICU measure itself comprises many
items and may be thus more accurate and sensitive in its assessment of CU traits (and their
aetiology) than shorter CU measures deployed in previous studies. These shorter measures may
have been more prone to measurement error, which would end up in the non-shared
environmental variance component). Third, the use of a general-specific structure may also
have reduced measurement error on the general factor, enabling a better detection of the
shared environmental component. If genuine, these shared environmental estimates may reflect
identifiable systematic and relatively persistent influences on psychopathology during
childhood (Burt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">2009</xref>). As such, our results raise
the prospect of identifying reliable shared environmental influences on carefully measured
CU traits. Chaos in the home (i.e. disorganized household) is an example of one such
possible shared environmental influence.</p>
<p>Non-shared environment (i.e. child specific experiences that make the twins different
and/or measurement error) also accounted for variance on all ICU factors, in particular for
the specific factors. Association with a deviant peer group in adolescence is a strong
candidate risk factor that may account for some of these non-shared environment influences
on CU traits (Kimonis <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">2004</xref>), especially as CU traits were assessed at age 16 years in the present study.</p>
<p>In the present study, we examined the previously untested possibility that two rather than
three specific factors were sufficient to account for the ICU structure. A structure with
two specific factors – one grouping Callousness and Uncaring items together and the other
including Unemotional items – provided a better fit than a structure with three specific
factors. Although previous studies had not tested this factorial structure, there were
several indicators of its relevance, notably stronger associations between Callousness and
Uncaring dimensions with each other than with the Unemotional dimension, and uncertainty as
to where – either to the Callousness or the Uncaring subscale – some items should be
allocated. Hawes <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">2014</xref>)
proposed that the separate dimensions of Uncaring and Callousness found in past studies may
have been an artefact of item wording, with the former having items largely worded in the
negative direction and the latter including items largely worded in the positive direction.
A recent study (Ray <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">2015</xref>) provided empirical support for this idea,
showing that positively worded items, composing most of the Callousness subscale: (1) are
less endorsed than negatively worded items; (2) discriminate best at higher levels of CU
traits in item response theory (IRT) analyses, and; (3) are more closely related to
antisocial/aggressive behaviour (Ray <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">2015</xref>). It was therefore concluded that the
general-specific structure identifying three specific factors may be an artefact of
different item properties (Ray <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">2015</xref>). The present results, indicating that
regrouping Callousness and Uncaring items provides a more parsimonious solution, are clearly
in line with this conclusion. Several elements distinguish the two specific factors
identified by our factor analysis. First, the general factor seems to account well for the
Callousness-Uncaring items, as suggested by the presence of strong loadings onto the general
factor. The few items which <italic>also</italic> loaded on the specific Callousness or
Uncaring factors seemed to reflect behaviours that are related to lack of conscientiousness
(e.g. ‘He/she does not care about doing things well’, ‘He/she works hard on everything
he/she does’). This may not be surprising, considering psychopathy is closely related to low
conscientiousness in young adults (Paulhus &amp; Williams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">2002</xref>). Whether this specific factor taps into a construct closely
related to conscientiousness should be further tested in future studies that include a
measure of conscientiousness.</p>
<p>Second, while the general factor accounted well for the Callousness-Uncaring items, the
Unemotional items loaded more strongly on their specific, rather than the general factor.
Hence, those items used to measure Unemotional traits in the ICU represent some aspects of
temperament that are distinct from the more general CU construct. In line with this idea,
additional analyses (see Cholesky decomposition in the Supplementary material) showed that
the genetic factors underlying the Unemotional dimension are to a large degree distinct from
those behind Callousness-Uncaring. This partial aetiological independence of the Unemotional
subscale may explain why this dimension has not consistently demonstrated associations with
the same external correlates than Callousness and Uncaring dimensions (Kimonis <italic>et
al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">2008</xref>; Hawes <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>It has also been suggested that the Unemotional dimension captures a phenotype which does
not <italic>specifically</italic> constitute a risk for persistent antisocial behaviour and
later psychopathy (Kimonis <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2013</xref>). While traditional conceptualizations of
psychopathy include features related to a lack of emotion, there has been less consideration
of precisely what is deemed ‘unemotional.’ For instance, while a lack of emotional
<italic>responsivity</italic> to others' distress has been found indicative of CU
features, there is less support to indicate that individuals displaying these features are
devoid of emotion (e.g. frustration, anger; Blair, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">2013</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that ICU items focusing on emotion are not
sufficiently precise to capture atypical emotional responses related to CU features. The
items that are used to assess the Unemotional dimension in the ICU quantify behaviours that
are also displayed in a large array of phenotypes encompassing autism (e.g. ‘It is easy for
others to tell how he/she is feeling’), depression/anhedonia (e.g. ‘He/she is very
expressive and emotional’), and even anxiety/neuroticism (e.g. ‘He/she expresses his/her
feelings openly’). Our research is in line with past studies, which indicate that the
current Unemotional scale may not fully capture unemotionality as it relates to psychopathic
presentation in youth. For example, one hallmark of psychopathic presentation is not being
moved by other people's distress or joy. It may thus be of interest to formulate a new set
of Unemotional items that specifically relate to unemotionality in interpersonal contexts.
Whether this new set of items would relate more strongly to the Callous and Uncaring
dimension and constitute a specific risk for persistent antisocial behaviour and later
psychopathy (and relate more strongly to Callousness and Uncaring dimensions) could then be
tested. As it stands, the current assessments of CU traits – including the ICU – may capture
a construct best described as Callous-Uncaring rather than Callous-Unemotional.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The present study is the first genetically informative report on the ICU. This study
benefited from a larger sample than those employed in all of the past CFA studies of the
ICU. Yet, several limitations call for cautious interpretation of the present results.
First, the ICU measure in the current study was based on parental ratings. Encouragingly,
recent reports have shown the psychometric properties of the parent-report ICU to be
appreciable in terms of internal consistency (e.g. Latzman <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">2013</xref>) and predictive validity (White <italic>et
al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">2009</xref>). Nonetheless, our results should be
extended to multi-informant genetically informative designs. Second, several items on the
Callousness-Uncaring subscale did not load strongly on any factor, which may have
contributed to suboptimal model fit. While we removed two of them in our analyses (2, 10)
several others (4, 7, 12, 21) did not load highly (&lt;0.30) on any factor. Most of
these items were targeted as problematic in past CFA studies (e.g. Byrd <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">2013</xref>; Hawes <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">2014</xref>). As these items represent virtually one
quarter of the total scale, it may be beneficial to conduct further studies to
systematically investigate item inclusion and possible item rewording.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-2">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The present study highlights the usefulness of a single construct arising from the ICU,
as evidenced by substantial shared genetic and environmental risk (i.e. common aetiology)
across the ICU scale. The general factor is likely useful in distinguishing clinically
meaningful and aetiologically homogeneous subgroups of antisocial youths (i.e. antisocial
youths with high <italic>v</italic>. low CU traits). The present study also questions the
usefulness of Unemotional traits, as currently measured, for assessing CU traits in youth
and adding to the prediction of persistent antisocial behaviour and later psychopathy.
These findings have implications for clinicians, as they suggest that it may be more
beneficial to focus on the Callousness and Uncaring features when subgrouping youth with
conduct problems</p>
