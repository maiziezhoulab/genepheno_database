<abstract>
<p>Acquisition of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is a major hindrance towards the successful treatment of cancers. Over expression of a range of
ATP-dependent efflux pumps, particularly ABCB1 is a widely reported mechanism of cancer cell MDR. Approximately 30% acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) patients demonstrate ABCB1 over expression. Several mechanisms for up regulation of ABCB1 have been proposed. Our
aim was to investigate the role of genomic amplification of the chromosome 7 region with regard to its influence on ABCB1 over expression
in AML cell line. For this, we developed Doxorubicin (Dox) resistant leukemic cell line from K562 cells, demonstrating MDR phenotype.
The chromosomal changes associated with the acquisition of MDR were characterized by array- based comparative genomic hybridization
(aCGH) with the parental K562 cell line as the reference genome. Significant genomic gains in the chromosomal region corresponding to
7q11.21-7q22.1 were observed in Dox selected cell line. Moreover, the amplicon contains the ABCB1 gene locus at 7q21.1 with a copy
number gain of &gt;4. ABCB1 mRNA was found to be up-regulated by54-fold. Our results demonstrate that the development of MDR in
K562/Dox is underlined by a genomic amplification of the chromosome 7 region harboring the ABCB1 gene.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex and heterogeneous
disease with poor clinical outcome, especially in the elderly who
constitute the majority of AML patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>. The treatment strategies
for selected subtypes of AML has recently started to change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>.
However, for the majority of the AML patients, conventional
chemotherapy remains the frontline therapeutic choice. In younger
AML patients, 70-80% achieve complete remission (CR) but most of
them eventually relapse and overall survival (OS) in this group is
only 40-50% at 5 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>. The OS in older patients is worse with a
cure rate of less than 10%. The primary reason for the failure of
AML therapy is drug resistance. Multidrug resistance (MDR),
which is the simultaneous acquisition of resistance to different
chemotherapeutic agents, is a daunting clinical challenge in AML.
Understanding the underlying mechanisms of MDR is therefore
essential to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents as well
as to design newer agents to overcome MDR.</p>
<p>The study of resistant cell lines in-vitro has contributed to the
identification and characterization of important mediators of cancer
cell MDR. MDR phenotype in cultured cells was characterized by
amplification of the genomic segment containing the ATP binding
cassette sub family B member1 (ABCB1) gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>. ABCB1 gene,
cytogenetically mapping to 7q21.12, encodes the ABCB1 efflux
pump that plays a critical role in the active uptake and transport of
several molecules, including anticancer therapeutics across the cell
membrane. ABCB1 over expression is a widely reported
mechanism of MDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>. In AML, increased expression of ABCB1 is
associated with therapy resistance and poor prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>.</p>
<p>Human chromosome 7 is approximately 159Mb in length and
contains 1150 genes and 940 pseudogenes. Aberrations in
chromosome 7 are implicated in the pathogenesis of several
diseases such as cystic fibrosis, deafness, autism, andcancer. Several
cancer models have reported genetic changes and unstable regions
in chromosome 7. A number of oncogenes including epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor
and MET proto-oncogene (c MET) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog B1B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine
kinase (BRAF) are located on chromosome 7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>. Thus, chromosome
7 copy number changes i.e. aneuploidy/polysomy/monosomy or
gene abnormalities due to mutation/amplification plays a crucial
role in different malignancies including solid tumors, lung, colon,
and head and neck carcinomas. Changes in chromosomal 7 regions
were also reported in gastric cancer disease modeling and
progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>. The study characterized the genes undergoing
significant copy number variations in gastric cancer tissue, as protooncogenes
and genes involved in signal transduction pathways
regulating proliferation, metabolism, transport, inflammatory
response, and proteolysis. Furthermore, several studies have
reported amplification of the chromosome 7q region containing
ABCB1 gene in MDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>.</p>
<p>In AML, chromosome 7 aberration, specifically monosomy and
deletion of the long arm, is singularly observed in approximately 4-
5% newly diagnosed AML patients, the incidence being higher as a
part of complex karyotypic AML feature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>. Patients with
chromosome 7 deletion in the absence of other abnormalities are
considered under intermediate risk group while chromosome 7
monosomy, either alone or combined with other chromosomal
abnormalities, present a more adverse prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>. A study by
Slovak et al showed the clinical outcome of patients with complex
karyotype containing abnormalities of chromosomes 7 i.e.
deletion/monosomy was poor and associated with lower CR and
survival rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>. Another study reported drug resistance and
early death in 77.8% AML patients with the associated
chromosomal 7 aberrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. Abnormalities in chromosome 7
are also frequently encountered with therapy related AML,
particularly with the use of alkylating agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>. This is further
evident by several studies wherein deletion affecting the long arm
of chromosome 7 was recurrently acquired at relapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> and
presented as a marker of poor prognosis at diagnosis, thereby
underlining its significance in therapy resistance and refractory
AML. The exact pathogenic role of chromosome 7
monosomy/deletion in leukemogenesis is, however, unclear and is
largely hypothesized to be related to loss of a critical tumor
suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>. Association between chromosome 7
abnormalities and ABCB1 over expression was also reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>.</p>
<p>There are a limited number of studies mapping the chromosomal
changes contributing to disease relapse in AML. An insight into the
associated chromosomal alterations is hence, integral in
understanding mechanisms of acquired resistance and potential
targets to overcome MDR. Comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH) enables the detection and localization of genome-wide
chromosomal aberrations i.e. amplifications and deletions of a test
sample relative to a reference. Genomic DNA from the resistant and
parental cell line was comparatively hybridized that enabled the
identification of genetic aberrations contributing to drug resistance.
In the present study, we have focused on chromosome 7
amplification in the development of MDR resistance in Doxorubicin
(Dox) selected AML cell line.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Dox sensitivity in K562 and Dox resistant K562 cell line:</title>
<p>Dox-resistant cell lineK562/Dox was derived from K562 parental
cells by culturing the cells in gradually incremental doses of Dox
(10nM -200nM) followed by clonal selection. Dox cytotoxicity in the
parental and resistant cells was determined by CellTiter-Blue cell
viability assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, the IC50, which is the mean
inhibitory concentration producing 50% cell death, for K562/Dox
was 3.06 ± 0.266µM as compared to the Dox-sensitive parental K562
cell line, which showed a relatively low IC50 of 0.117 ± 0.003µM.
Thus, Dox resistant cell line K562/Dox demonstrating 26-fold
higher resistance to the parental K562 cells was obtained. The
cytotoxicities of other anthracyclines - daunorubicin and idarubicin
werealso assessed in K562 and K562/Dox cell lines.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref> and 1c, K562/Dox showed varying levels of
cross-resistance to daunorubicin and idarubicin i.e. 6.8-fold and
1.44 -fold respectively when compared to K562 cells. We next tested
the cross-resistance to a structurally unrelated, non-anthracycline
drug: etoposide, which is a topoisomerase II inhibitor. K562/Dox
demonstrated significant increase in etoposide IC50 values from 2.4
± 0.071µM in K562 to 5.247 ± 0.077µM in K562/Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>).
Since the resistance was not limited to Dox alone and the resistant
cell line displayed significantly higher levels of resistance to
structurally related and unrelated drugs and to drugs it was not
primarily exposed to, it was established that K562/Dox is an MDR
cell line. Addition of 5µM verapamil, a calcium ion channel blocker,
and a known ABCB1 modifier, decreased K562/Dox fold resistance
to 14-fold while complete restoration of Dox sensitivity was
observed in K562/Dox upon treatment with 100nM tariquidar,
which is a highly potent and specific inhibitor of ABCB1 (
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).
Moreover, K562 and K562/Dox did not show a significant
difference in the IC50 of cisplatin, an ABCG2 substrate (data not
shown). These observations indicate an underlying role of ABCB1
efflux transporter in contributing to the MDR of K562/Dox.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>ABCB1 genomic amplification was observed in Dox-resistant cells:</title>
<p>In order to characterize the genomic aberrations associated with the
development of MDR whole-genome aCGH was performed for
K562/Dox, using parental K562 as the reference genome. Multiple
minor genomic aberrations i.e. both gains and losses were observed
in chromosome 1, 4, 5, 7, 12 and 16 in K562/Dox, as compared to
K562. A major aberration was observed in chromosome 7. The copy
number profile revealed gain in the q11.21~q22.1 region of
chromosome7, with the amplicon spanning around 39Mb. In
particular, high-level amplification was observed for q21.1~q22.1
region displaying &gt;4 copy number gains. The most prominent gene
in this region was ABCB1 mapping to the 7q21.12 locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).
This was most relevant to our previous findings, explaining the
relative resistance of K562/Dox to Dox, daunorubicin, idarubicin,
and etoposide, as all the chemotherapeutic drugs are well known
substrates of the ABCB1 protein. Thus, ABCB1 copy number gain
was recognized as the molecular basis of acquired chemoresistance
demonstrated by K562/Dox cell line.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Dox-resistant cell line overexpress ABCB1 gene:</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the increase in ABCB1 gene expression,qRTPCR
was performed using the parental K562 as control and
GAPDH as the reference gene. ABCB1 mRNA levels were
quantified in the parental and resistant cell lines - K562 and
K562/Dox. Relative gene expression was calculated by ΔΔCt 
method. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, K562/Dox overexpressed ABCB1
mRNA by 54-fold when normalized to the parental K562 cells. Thus,
ABCB1 gene overexpression was confirmed as the predominant
mechanism of acquisition of resistance.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ABCB1 over expression is a widely reported mechanism of cancer
cell MDR, occurring in approximately 30% of AML patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>[6].
About 70% of secondary AML patients also show up regulation in
the ABCB1 gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. Cells exposed to ABCB1 substrate
chemotherapeutics frequently demonstrate enhanced ABCB1
expression via multiple mechanisms. Our aim was to investigate
the role of chromosome 7amplification with regard to its influence
on ABCB1 over expression and consequent development of MDR
phenotypein AML in-vitro. K562/Dox cell lines derived by
culturing K562 cells in gradually increasing doses of Dox displayed
varying levels of cross resistance to ABCB1 substrates i.e.
daunorubicin, idarubicin, and etoposide and not to cisplatin, an
ABCG2 substrate. Moreover, the addition of known ABCB1
inhibitors such as verapamil and tariquidar restored Dox sensitivity
in K562/Dox cells. These observations strongly indicate the role of
ABCB1 in mediating the observed MDR of K562/Dox.</p>
<p>Genomic amplification of chromosome 7 harboring the ABCB1
gene has been reported in MDR in different types of cancers
including lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, breast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, neuroblastoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>,
esophageal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> and ovarian cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>. ABCB1 genomic locusalterations
have been previously reported in AML cell lines that
involved translocation of MDR1 gene to chromosome 2 and
subsequent amplification under cytotoxic stress. The removal of the
ABCB1 gene from its original chromosomal site was considered an
important early event that released the normal regulatory control of
chromosome 7 facilitating the observed amplification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>. Increase
in copy number of the 7q21~q22 region has also been reported for
vincristine selected leukemic cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>. In the present study,
both low-level gains and high-level amplification were observed in
the chromosome 7q region of K562/Dox by aCGH analysis.
Particularly, the genomic region containing the ABCB1 gene
demonstrated high copy number gain of &gt;4. This was consistent
with the ABCB1 expression at the RNA level and the results in cell
viability experiments wherein K562/Adr showed co-resistance to
ABCB1 substrate chemotherapeutics.</p>
<p>Genomic profiling of the ABCB1 amplicon enables the elucidation
of the role of nearby genes in the development of MDR. In
K562/Dox cell line, the amplicon spanning around 39Mb
comprised of several genes in addition to the ABCB1 gene. Further
exploration of additional genes within the amplicon that are
conferring or contributing to the MDR phenotype is justified. Some
of the genes in the amplicon that have been previously described in
MDR include ABCB4, Carnitine O-octanoyl transferase (CROT) and
TP53TG1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>. ABCB4 is a member of ABC transporter sharing
82% nucleotide sequence homology to the ABCB1 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>.
ABCB4is often co-amplified with ABCB1 because of their close
genomic proximity and is particularly selective for paclitaxel and
vinblastine resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>. However, the exact role of ABCB4
transporter in MDR is still unclear, as silencing of ABCB4 did not
restore sensitivity whereas silencing of ABCB1 completely restored
sensitivity in taxane-resistant ovarian cancer cell line. Similarly,
CROThas been shown to be co-amplified with ABCB1 in taxaneresistant
ovarian and breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>. TP53TG1 encodes p53-
induced lncRNA, activated upon DNA damage and its up
regulation has been reported in T-lymphocytes after exposure to
ionizing radiation, cisplatin-resistant colon cancer and docetaxelresistant
breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. The TP53TG1 lncRNA binds to YBX1
protein and prevents the activation of oncogenes. Although cellular
lncRNA may increase under cytotoxic stress, it is assumed that
epigenetic silencing of the promoter leads to MDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>. On the other
hand, TP53TG1 is shown to promote cell proliferation and
migration in glioma cells under glucose deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus, co-activation of proximal genes may not be a chance
consequence of genomic amplification and it is probable that the
amplified genes may have an important independent or concerted
role in inducing MDR. This is further evident by the study by Wang
et al. that reported activation of a cluster of 22 genes in the 7q21.11-
13 chromosomal region in several taxane-selected ovarian cancer
cell lines which was not essentially the result of copy number
alterations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>.</p>
<p>Gene expression is regulated by different mechanisms such as
genomic amplification, enhanced transcription, mRNA stabilization,
post-transcriptional regulation and epigenetic modifications. In the
present study, K562/Dox showed remarkably high ABCB1 gene
expression as compared to the parental cell line. This was consistent
to the observations in paclitaxel resistant lung cancer cell line,
wherein ABCB1 gene expression increased upto 1000-fold, while a
copy number gain of only 12 was found in the ABCB1 genomic
region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. Thus, it is evident that apart from chromosomal copy
number changes, other mechanisms such as chromatin remodeling
and DNA or histone modifications of the 7q21 region may
contribute to ABCB1 genomic amplification.</p>

<sec id="s5">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our data highlight that the genomic amplification of the
chromosome 7 region containing ABCB1 results in the up
regulation of ABCB1 and hence MDR in K562 human erythro
leukemia cells. Involvement of additional genes amplified in the
amplicon in the context of drug resistance needs to be investigated.</p>
