<abstract>
<p>The 1.6 Mbp deletion on chromosome 3q29 is associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, microcephaly, and intellectual disability. Despite its importance towards neurodevelopment, the role of individual genes, genetic interactions, and disrupted biological mechanisms underlying the deletion have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we used quantitative methods to assay <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> models with tissue-specific individual and pairwise knockdown of 14 homologs of genes within the 3q29 region. We identified developmental, cellular, and neuronal phenotypes for multiple homologs of 3q29 genes, potentially due to altered apoptosis and cell cycle mechanisms during development. Using the fly eye, we screened for 314 pairwise knockdowns of homologs of 3q29 genes and identified 44 interactions between pairs of homologs and 34 interactions with other neurodevelopmental genes. Interestingly, <italic>NCBP2</italic> homologs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<italic>Cbp20</italic>) and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> (<italic>ncbp2</italic>) enhanced the phenotypes of homologs of the other 3q29 genes, leading to significant increases in apoptosis that disrupted cellular organization and brain morphology. These cellular and neuronal defects were rescued with overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitors <italic>Diap1</italic> and <italic>xiap</italic> in both models, suggesting that apoptosis is one of several potential biological mechanisms disrupted by the deletion. <italic>NCBP2</italic> was also highly connected to other 3q29 genes in a human brain-specific interaction network, providing support for the relevance of our results towards the human deletion. Overall, our study suggests that <italic>NCBP2-</italic>mediated genetic interactions within the 3q29 region disrupt apoptosis and cell cycle mechanisms during development.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Rare copy-number variants, or large deletions and duplications in the genome, are associated with a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders. The 3q29 deletion confers an increased risk for schizophrenia and autism. To understand the conserved biological mechanisms that are disrupted by this deletion, we systematically tested 14 individual homologs and 314 pairwise interactions of 3q29 genes for neuronal, cellular, and developmental phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> models. We found that multiple homologs of genes within the deletion region contribute towards developmental defects, such as larval lethality and disrupted cellular organization. Interestingly, we found that <italic>NCBP2</italic> acts as a key modifier gene within the region, enhancing the developmental phenotypes of each of the homologs for other 3q29 genes and leading to disruptions in apoptosis and cell cycle pathways. Our results suggest that multiple genes within the 3q29 region interact with each other through shared mechanisms and jointly contribute to neurodevelopmental defects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rare copy number variants (CNVs), including deletions and duplications in the human genome, significantly contribute to complex neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, intellectual disability/developmental delay, autism, and epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref002">2</xref>]. Despite extensive phenotypic heterogeneity associated with recently described CNVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref003">3</xref>], certain rare CNVs have been linked to specific neuropsychiatric diagnoses. For example, the 22q11.2 deletion (DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome), the most frequently occurring pathogenic CNV, is found in about 1–2% of individuals with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref005">5</xref>], and animal models of several genes within the region show neuronal and behavioral phenotypes on their own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref007">7</xref>]. Similarly, the 1.6 Mbp recurrent deletion on chromosome 3q29, encompassing 21 genes, was initially identified in individuals with a range of neurodevelopmental features, including intellectual disability, microcephaly, craniofacial features, and speech delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref009">9</xref>]. Further studies have implicated this deletion as a major risk factor for multiple disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref010">10</xref>]. In fact, the deletion confers a &gt;40-fold increase in risk for schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref012">12</xref>] as well as a &gt;20-fold increase in risk for autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref013">13</xref>]. More recently, two studies have reported decreases in body and brain sizes as well as a range of behavioral and social defects in mouse models of the entire deletion, mimicking the human developmental phenotypes associated with the deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Identifying the biological underpinnings of the 3q29 deletion is contingent upon uncovering the conserved molecular mechanisms linking individual genes or combinations of genes within the 3q29 region to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in individuals with the entire deletion. Recent studies have suggested a subset of genes in the 3q29 region as potential candidates for these phenotypes based on their established roles in neuronal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref017">17</xref>]. For example, <italic>DLG1</italic> is a scaffolding protein that organizes the synaptic structure at neuromuscular junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref018">18</xref>], affecting both synaptic density and plasticity during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref019">19</xref>]. However, mouse models of <italic>Dlg1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> did not recapitulate the behavioral and developmental phenotypes observed in mice with the entire deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref014">14</xref>], suggesting that haploinsufficiency of <italic>DLG1</italic> by itself does not account for the wide range of phenotypes associated with the deletion. Given that genes within rare pathogenic CNV regions tend to share similar biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref020">20</xref>] and interact with each other to contribute towards developmental phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref022">22</xref>], it is likely that multiple genes within 3q29 jointly contribute to these phenotypes through shared cellular pathways. Therefore, an approach that integrates functional analysis of individual genes within the 3q29 deletion and their combinatorial effects on neuronal and cellular phenotypes is necessary to understand the pathways and mechanisms underlying the deletion.</p>
<p>Systematic testing of genes within 3q29 towards developmental and cellular phenotypes requires model systems that are amenable for rapid phenotypic evaluation and allow for testing interactions between multiple dosage-imbalanced genes without affecting the viability of the organism. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> provide such powerful genetic models for studying conserved mechanisms that are altered in neurodevelopmental disorders, with the ability to manipulate gene expression in a tissue-specific manner in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref023">23</xref>] and examine developmental defects in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref024">24</xref>]. Both model systems contain homologs for a majority of disease-causing genes in humans, and show a high degree of conservation in key developmental pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref027">27</xref>]. For example, <italic>Drosophila</italic> knockdown models of the candidate schizophrenia gene <italic>DTNBP1</italic> showed dysregulation of synaptic homeostasis and altered glutamatergic and dopaminergic neuron function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref029">29</xref>], and fly models for <italic>UBE3A</italic>, the gene associated with Angelman syndrome, showed sleep, memory and locomotor defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref030">30</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> models have been widely used to identify morphological and neuronal defects associated with developmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref024">24</xref>], such as dendritic connectivity defects with overexpression of <italic>MECP2</italic>, the causative gene for Rett syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref031">31</xref>]. Thus, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> models of individual CNV homologs and their interactions would allow for a deeper dissection of the molecular mechanisms disrupted by the deletion, complementing the phenotypes documented in mouse models of the entire deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we used a mechanistic approach to understand the role of individual homologs of 3q29 genes and their interactions towards the cellular processes underlying the deletion. We systematically characterized developmental, cellular, and nervous system phenotypes for 14 conserved homologs of human 3q29 genes and 314 pairwise interactions using <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and validated these phenotypes using <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic>. We found that multiple homologs of genes within the 3q29 region, including <italic>NCBP2</italic>, <italic>DLG1</italic>, <italic>FBXO45</italic>, <italic>PIGZ</italic>, and <italic>BDH1</italic>, contribute to disruptions in apoptosis and cell cycle pathways, leading to neuronal and developmental defects in both model systems. These defects were further enhanced when each of the homologs were concomitantly knocked down with homologs of <italic>NCBP2</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<italic>Cbp20</italic>) and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> (<italic>ncbp2</italic>), resulting in increased apoptosis and dysregulation of cell cycle genes. Our results support an oligogenic model for the 3q29 deletion, and implicate specific cellular mechanisms disrupted by genes in the deletion region.</p>

<title>Reduced expression of individual homologs of 3q29 genes causes global developmental defects</title>
<p>We used reciprocal BLAST and orthology prediction tools (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>) to identify fly homologs for 15 of the 21 genes within the 3q29 deletion region (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s015">S1 Table</xref></bold>). We note that the genes and crosses tested in this study are represented as fly gene names along with the human counterparts at first mention in the text, i.e. <italic>Cbp20</italic> (<italic>NCBP2</italic>), and fly genes with allele names in the figures, i.e. <italic>Cbp20</italic><sup><italic>KK109448</italic></sup>. We found that the biological functions of these 15 genes were also conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans, as 61 of the 69 Gene Ontology (88.4%) annotations for the human genes were also annotated for their respective fly homologs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s028">S1 File</xref></bold>). For example, <italic>dlg1</italic> (<italic>DLG1</italic>) and <italic>Cbp20</italic> (<italic>NCBP2</italic>) share the same roles in both flies and vertebrates, as a scaffolding protein at the synaptic junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref032">32</xref>] and a member of the RNA cap binding complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref033">33</xref>], respectively. We used RNA interference (RNAi) and the <italic>UAS-GAL4</italic> system to knockdown expression levels of fly homologs of genes within the 3q29 region ubiquitously and in neuronal, wing and eye tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref034">34</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). A stock list of the fly lines used in this study and full genotypes for all experiments are provided in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s029">S2 File</xref></bold>. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed partial knockdown of gene expression for each of the tested homologs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s016">S2 Table</xref></bold>); fly lines for <italic>CG5359</italic> (<italic>TCTEX1D2</italic>) were excluded from further analysis after additional quality control assessment (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). To identify genes essential for organism survival and neurodevelopment, we first assessed the effect of ubiquitous knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes using the <italic>da-GAL4</italic> driver (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). Seven of the 14 homologs, including <italic>dlg1</italic>, <italic>Cbp20</italic>, and <italic>Tsf2</italic> (<italic>MFI2</italic>), showed lethality or severe developmental defects with ubiquitous knockdown, suggesting that multiple homologs of 3q29 genes are essential for viability during early development. Similarly, wing-specific <italic>bx</italic><sup><italic>MS1096</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4</italic> knockdown of <italic>Tsf2</italic>, <italic>Cbp20</italic>, <italic>CG8888</italic> (<italic>BDH1</italic>), and <italic>Pak</italic> (<italic>PAK2</italic>) showed severe wing defects, and wing-specific knockdown of <italic>dlg1</italic> showed larval lethality (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Strategy for identifying cellular phenotypes and genetic interactions of homologs of 3q29 genes.</title>
<p>We first knocked down individual or pairs of 14 <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs of human genes in the 3q29 region using tissue-specific RNAi. After screening for global phenotypes of RNAi lines for individual homologs of 3q29 genes, we tested 314 pairwise gene interactions using the fly eye, and found that <italic>Cbp20</italic> (<italic>NCBP2</italic>) enhanced the phenotypes of other homologs of 3q29 genes and also interacted with homologs of known neurodevelopmental genes outside of the 3q29 region. Next, we assayed for deeper cellular and neuronal phenotypes of flies with individual and pairwise knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes, and observed cellular defects due to disrupted apoptosis and cell cycle mechanisms. We confirmed our results by rescuing cellular phenotypes with overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitor <italic>Diap1</italic> and by analyzing genes differentially expressed with knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes. Finally, we tested a subset of three homologs of 3q29 genes in the <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> vertebrate model system by injecting two- or four-cell stage embryos with GFP and morpholinos (MOs) for <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> homologs of 3q29 genes to observe abnormal eye morphology, as well as injecting one cell with GFP and MOs at the two-cell stage to observe abnormal brain morphology. We found similar developmental defects in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> to those observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including increased apoptosis that was enhanced with pairwise knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes and rescued with overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitor <italic>xiap</italic>. <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> embryo diagrams were produced by Nieuwkoop and Faber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref117">117</xref>] and adapted from Xenbase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref120">120</xref>].</p>

<p>Several fly homologs for genes within the 3q29 region have previously been associated with a range of neuronal defects during fly development (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s017">S3 Table</xref></bold>). For example, loss of <italic>dlg1</italic> contributed to morphological and physiological defects at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), as well as increased brain size, abnormal courtship behavior, and loss of gravitaxis response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref037">37</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>Pak</italic> mutant flies exhibited extensive defects in the axonal targeting of sensory and motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref039">39</xref>], in addition to abnormal NMJ and mushroom body development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref041">41</xref>]. We sought to determine whether fly homologs for other genes in the 3q29 region also contribute to defects in neuronal function, and therefore performed climbing assays for motor defects and staining of larval brains for axonal targeting with pan-neuronal knockdown of the fly homologs. Interestingly, <italic>Elav-GAL4</italic> mediated pan-neuronal knockdown caused larval or pupal lethality in <italic>dlg1</italic>, <italic>Tsf2</italic>, and <italic>CG5543</italic> (<italic>WDR53</italic>) flies (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>), and about 30% of adult flies with knockdown of <italic>dlg1</italic> did not survive beyond day 5 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>), indicating an essential role for these genes in neuronal development. Furthermore, we found that flies with pan-neuronal knockdown of several homologs of 3q29 genes, including <italic>dlg1</italic> and <italic>Cbp20</italic>, exhibited a strong reduction in climbing ability over ten days (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s033">S1</xref> Video</bold>), suggesting that these genes could contribute to abnormalities in synaptic and motor functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref042">42</xref>]. We next examined the axonal projections of photoreceptor cells into the optic lobe by staining third instar larval brains with anti-chaoptin. We found that <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic> mediated eye-specific knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic>, <italic>dlg1</italic>, <italic>Pak</italic> and <italic>Fsn</italic> (<italic>FBXO45</italic>) showed several axonal targeting defects (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s018">S4 Table</xref></bold>). Our results recapitulated the previous findings in <italic>Pak</italic> mutant flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref038">38</xref>], and were similar to targeting defects observed in models of other candidate neurodevelopmental genes, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs for human <italic>DISC1</italic> and <italic>FMR1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref044">44</xref>].

Because of this, we first performed eye-specific RNAi knockdown of fly homologs of genes in the 3q29 region using <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic>, and measured the rough eye phenotype of each knockdown line using <italic>Flynotyper</italic>, a quantitative tool that calculates a phenotypic score based on defects in ommatidial arrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref053">53</xref>]. We found that eye-specific knockdown of 8/13 homologs of 3q29 genes showed significant external eye phenotypes compared with control <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic> flies, while knockdown of <italic>Tsf2</italic> caused lethality (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). For example, knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> resulted in a severe rough eye phenotype that was comparable to knockdown of other neurodevelopmental genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref053">53</xref>], such as <italic>Prosap</italic> (<italic>SHANK3</italic>) and <italic>kis</italic> (<italic>CHD8</italic>) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s019">S5 Table</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To examine the cellular mechanisms underlying the rough eye phenotypes observed with knockdown of fly homologs of 3q29 genes, we first measured changes in area and ommatidial size of the adult eyes. We found a significant reduction in eye size with knockdown of <italic>CG8888</italic> and <italic>Cbp20</italic>, while the eyes of flies with knockdown of <italic>dlg1</italic> were significantly larger than <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic> controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g002">Fig 2D</xref></bold>). Similarly, we observed decreases in ommatidial diameter with knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> and <italic>CG8888</italic>, suggesting that these genes may also contribute to abnormal cell growth phenotypes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). We also assessed the cellular structure of 44 hour-old pupal eyes by staining the ommatidial and photoreceptor cells with anti-DLG, a septate junction marker, and Phalloidin, a marker for F-actin at cell boundaries (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). We found that knockdown of 11/12 tested homologs of 3q29 genes caused disorganization or loss of the photoreceptor neurons and ommatidial cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s020">S6 Table</xref></bold>). For example, pupal eyes with knockdown of <italic>CG8888</italic>, <italic>dlg1</italic>, <italic>Cbp20</italic> and <italic>CG5543</italic> all showed defects in cone cell orientation and ommatidial rotation compared with control <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic> flies. Furthermore, <italic>Cbp20</italic> and <italic>dlg1</italic> knockdown flies showed hexagonal defects and severe disorganization of photoreceptor neurons, while <italic>Cbp20</italic> knockdown flies also showed fused secondary cells and <italic>dlg1</italic> knockdown flies showed a complete loss of bristle cells.</p>
<p>We next hypothesized that abnormal proliferation and apoptosis could contribute to the cellular defects observed with knockdown of fly homologs of 3q29 genes. To test this, we stained the third instar larval eye discs for select knockdowns of individual homologs of 3q29 genes with anti-pH3 (phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10)) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> caspase-1 (dcp1), markers for proliferating and apoptotic cells, and quantified the number of cells posterior to the morphogenetic furrow (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). We observed a significant decrease in pH3-positive cells for <italic>CG8888</italic> knockdown flies and trends towards increased pH3-positive cells for <italic>PIG-Z</italic> (<italic>PIGZ</italic>) knockdown flies compared with <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic> controls (p = 0.165) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>), while knockdown of <italic>dlg1</italic> led to significant increases in cells stained with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker for replicating cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). Flies with knockdown of <italic>Cbp20 or dlg1</italic> also showed a significant increase in apoptotic dcp1-positive cells compared with controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g002">Fig 2G</xref></bold>), which we validated using TUNEL assays for these lines (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). We further tested for proliferation and apoptosis in the third instar larval wing discs of flies with knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes using the <italic>bx</italic><sup><italic>MS1096</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4</italic> driver, and observed changes in both processes with knockdown of <italic>dlg1</italic>, <italic>CG8888</italic> and <italic>Cbp20</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>). Knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> in particular showed dcp1-positive staining across the entire wing pouch in the larval wing disc. These data suggest that knockdown of multiple fly homologs of genes in the 3q29 region contribute to defects in apoptosis and proliferation during early development, leading to the observed defects in cell count and organization (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008590.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Interactions between fly homologs of 3q29 genes enhance neuronal phenotypes</title>
<p>As knockdown fly models for homologs of multiple 3q29 genes showed a variety of neuronal, developmental, and cellular defects, we hypothesized that these genes could interact with each other to further disrupt cellular processes during development. We therefore generated <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic> recombined lines for nine fly homologs of 3q29 genes, and crossed these lines with multiple RNAi or mutant lines for other homologs to generate 161 two-hit crosses for testing 94 pairwise gene interactions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s021">S7 Table</xref></bold>). We found a significant enhancement in eye phenotypic severity, measured using <italic>Flynotyper</italic> and validated with a second line when available, for 39 pairwise knockdowns compared with recombined lines crossed with control flies (represented in the figures as <italic>Cbp20</italic><sup><italic>KK109448</italic></sup>/<italic>Control</italic>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s007">S7 Fig</xref></bold>). In fact, we found that 19 out of 21 pairwise interactions involving <italic>Cbp20</italic> as either a first or second-hit gene resulted in more severe eye phenotypes, suggesting that reduced expression of <italic>Cbp20</italic> drastically modifies the morphological phenotypes of other homologs of 3q29 genes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g003">Fig 3B–3D</xref></bold>). For further validation, we compared pairs of reciprocal crosses (i.e. <italic>Fsn/CG8888</italic> versus <italic>CG8888</italic>/<italic>Fsn</italic>) and confirmed concordant results for 19/26 reciprocal interactions, including 14/16 reciprocal interactions involving <italic>Cbp20</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s021">S7 Table</xref></bold>). We also found a non-significant increase in severity for <italic>dlg1/Pak</italic> knockdown flies using both RNAi and mutant lines, concordant with enhanced neuromuscular junction and circadian rhythm defects observed in mutant <italic>dlg1/Pak</italic> flies described by Grice and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref054">54</xref>].</p>

<p>As <italic>Cbp20</italic> knockdown enhanced the rough eye phenotypes of multiple other homologs, we next tested for enhancement of neuronal defects among flies with knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> and homologs of other 3q29 genes. We found that simultaneous knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> with <italic>dlg1</italic> or <italic>Fsn</italic> led to an increase in severity of axon targeting defects (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g003">Fig 3E</xref></bold>). For instance, while knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> mostly led to mild-to-moderate axon targeting defects, such as loss of R7-R8 axon projection into the medulla, we observed more severe loss of projection for all axons with simultaneous knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> and <italic>dlg1</italic> or <italic>Fsn</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s018">S4 Table</xref></bold>). We also tested pan-neuronal <italic>Elav-GAL4</italic> knockdown of select pairs of homologs, and found that both <italic>Cbp20/dlg1</italic> and <italic>Cbp20/Fsn</italic> significantly enhanced the climbing defects observed with knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> alone (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g003">Fig 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s034">S2 Video</xref></bold>). Overall, these data show that <italic>Cbp20</italic> interacts with other homologs of genes in the 3q29 region to enhance the observed cellular and neuronal defects (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008590.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To further characterize the functional effects of interactions between homologs of 3q29 genes, we analyzed changes in gene expression by performing RNA-sequencing of heads from flies with select pan-neuronal knockdown of individual (<italic>Cbp20</italic>, <italic>dlg1</italic>, <italic>Fsn</italic>, and <italic>Pak</italic>) and pairs (<italic>Cbp20/dlg1</italic> and <italic>Cbp20/Fsn</italic>) of homologs of 3q29 genes. We identified differentially-expressed genes in each of the tested fly models compared with <italic>Elav-GAL4</italic> controls, and performed enrichment analysis on both differentially-expressed fly genes and their corresponding human homologs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s030">S3 File</xref></bold>). We found that knockdown of each individual homolog showed enrichment for dysregulation of cellular and developmental processes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s008">S8 Fig</xref></bold>). For example, flies with knockdown of <italic>dlg1</italic> and <italic>Cbp20</italic> showed enrichment for dysregulation of homologs for human synaptic transmission genes, such as <italic>Glt</italic> (<italic>NLGN1</italic>) and <italic>nAChRβ3</italic> (<italic>HTR3A</italic>). Furthermore, flies with knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> were enriched for dysregulated fly genes related to metabolic processes, while knockdown of <italic>Fsn</italic> led to dysregulation of fly genes involved in response to external stimuli and immune response. We also found that homologs of key signaling genes dysregulated in mouse models of the 3q29 deletion, reported by Baba and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref015">15</xref>], were differentially expressed in our fly models for homologs of 3q29 genes. In fact, knockdown of <italic>Fsn</italic> led to altered expression for each of the “early immediate” signaling genes dysregulated in the deletion mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref015">15</xref>]. While dysregulated genes in <italic>Cbp20/dlg1</italic> knockdown flies showed enrichments for protein folding and sensory perception, <italic>Cbp20/Fsn</italic> knockdown flies were uniquely enriched for dysregulated homologs of cell cycle genes, including <italic>Aura</italic> (<italic>AURKA</italic>), <italic>Cdk1</italic> (<italic>CDK1</italic>), <italic>lok</italic> (<italic>CHEK2</italic>), and <italic>CycE</italic> (<italic>CCNE1</italic>) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s008">S8 Fig</xref></bold>). We similarly found 17 differentially-expressed homologs corresponding to human apoptosis genes in <italic>Cbp20/Fsn</italic> knockdown flies, including the DNA fragmentation gene <italic>Sid</italic> (<italic>ENDOG</italic>) and the apoptosis signaling genes <italic>tor</italic> (<italic>RET</italic>) and <italic>Hsp70Bb</italic> (<italic>HSPA1A</italic>). Furthermore, we found a strong enrichment for fly genes whose human homologs are preferentially expressed in early and mid-fetal brain tissues among the dysregulated genes in <italic>Cbp20/Fsn</italic> knockdown flies (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s008">S8 Fig</xref></bold>). These data suggest that <italic>Cbp20</italic> interacts with other homologs of genes in the 3q29 region to disrupt a variety of key biological functions, including apoptosis and cell cycle pathways as well as synaptic transmission and metabolic pathways (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008590.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Finally, to complement the interactions among homologs of 3q29 genes that we identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we examined the connectivity patterns of 3q29 genes within the context of human gene interaction databases. Gene interaction networks derived from co-expression and protein-protein interaction data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref056">56</xref>] showed large modules of connected genes within the 3q29 region, including a strongly-connected component involving 11/21 3q29 genes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref></bold>). However, the average connectivity among 3q29 genes within a brain-specific interaction network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref057">57</xref>] was not significantly different from the connectivity of randomly-selected sets of genes throughout the genome (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g004">Fig 4C</xref></bold>), suggesting that a subset of genes drive the complexity of genetic interactions within the region. This paradigm was previously observed among genes in the 22q11.2 deletion region, where interactions between <italic>PRODH</italic> and <italic>COMT</italic> modulate neurotransmitter function independently of other genes in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref058">58</xref>]. In fact, five genes in the 3q29 region, including <italic>NCBP2</italic>, <italic>PAK2</italic>, and <italic>DLG1</italic>, showed significantly higher connectivity to other 3q29 genes compared with the average connectivity of random sets of genes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g004">Fig 4D</xref></bold>). Interestingly, <italic>NCBP2</italic> showed the highest connectivity of all genes in the region, further highlighting its role as a key modulator of genes within the region.</p>

<title>Interactions between <italic>Cbp20</italic> and other homologs of 3q29 genes enhance apoptosis defects</title>
<p>Cell death and proliferation are two antagonistic forces that maintain an appropriate number of neurons during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref059">59</xref>]. In fact, both processes have been previously identified as candidate mechanisms for several neurodevelopmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref062">62</xref>]. While knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> with other homologs of 3q29 genes likely disrupts multiple cellular processes that contribute towards the enhanced cellular defects, we next specifically investigated the role of apoptosis towards these defects, as larval eye and wing discs with knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> showed strong increases in apoptosis. We observed black necrotic patches on the ommatidia in adult eyes with knockdown of <italic>Cbp20/dlg1</italic> and <italic>Cbp20/Fsn</italic>, indicating that an increase in cell death occurs with these interactions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s009">S9 Fig</xref></bold>). In fact, significantly larger regions of necrotic patches were observed in flies homozygous for <italic>Cbp20</italic> RNAi and heterozygous for <italic>dlg1</italic> RNAi (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s029">S2 File</xref></bold> for full genotype annotation), suggesting that the knockdown of both homologs contributes to ommatidial cell death (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we found an enhanced disruption of ommatidial cell organization and loss of photoreceptors in pupal flies with concomitant knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> with <italic>dlg1</italic>, <italic>Fsn</italic> or <italic>CG8888</italic>, emphasizing the role of these genes in maintaining cell count and organization (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s009">S9 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s022">S8 Table</xref></bold>). Based on these observations, we next assayed for apoptotic cells in the larval eye discs of flies with knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> and other homologs of 3q29 genes.

<p>To validate apoptosis as a candidate mechanism for the cellular defects of flies with knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes, we crossed recombined fly lines for <italic>Cbp20</italic> and <italic>dlg1</italic> with flies overexpressing <italic>Diap1</italic> (death-associated inhibitor of apoptosis). <italic>Diap1</italic> is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets <italic>Dronc</italic>, the fly homolog of caspase-9, and prevents the subsequent activation of downstream caspases that lead to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref063">63</xref>]. We found that overexpression of <italic>Diap1</italic> rescued the adult rough eye phenotypes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>) and increased the eye sizes of <italic>Cbp20</italic> and <italic>dlg1</italic> flies (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>).

Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>Diap1</italic> led to significant reductions in the number of TUNEL and dcp1-positive cells in the larval eye discs of flies with knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> and <italic>dlg1</italic>, confirming the rescue of apoptosis defects in these flies (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>).

We further confirmed these mechanistic findings by observing increased severity in cellular phenotypes upon overexpression of <italic>Dronc</italic> in <italic>Cbp20</italic> and <italic>dlg1</italic> knockdown flies. For example, we observed black necrotic patches (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref></bold>) and exaggerated apoptotic responses (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>) in <italic>Cbp20</italic> knockdown flies with overexpression of <italic>Dronc</italic>.

<title>Reduction of 3q29 gene expression causes developmental defects in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></title>
<p>After identifying a wide range of neurodevelopmental defects due to knockdown of fly homologs of 3q29 genes, we sought to gain further insight into the conserved functions of these genes in vertebrate embryonic brain development using the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> model system. We examined the effect of targeted knockdown of <italic>ncbp2</italic>, <italic>fbxo45</italic>, and <italic>pak2</italic>, as homologs of these genes displayed multiple severe phenotypes with reduced gene expression in flies. Knockdown of <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> homologs for each 3q29 gene was accomplished using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) targeted to early splice sites of each homolog (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> embryos were injected at either the two- or four-cell stage with various concentrations of MO for each homolog or a standard control, and knockdown of each homolog was validated using qPCR (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s012">S12 Fig</xref></bold>). As knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic>, <italic>Fsn</italic>, and <italic>Pak</italic> each resulted in neuronal defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we first examined the effects of knockdown of these homologs on <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> brain development at stage 47. To test this, we knocked down each gene in half of the embryo at the two-cell stage, and left the other half uninjected to create a side-by-side comparison of brain morphology (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g008">Fig 8A</xref></bold>). We performed whole-mount immunostaining with anti-alpha tubulin and found that reduced expression of <italic>ncbp2</italic>, <italic>fbxo45</italic>, and <italic>pak2</italic> each resulted in smaller forebrain and midbrain size compared with controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref></bold>). We also found that simultaneous knockdown of <italic>ncbp2</italic> with <italic>fbxo45</italic> caused a significant decrease in forebrain size and a trend towards decreased midbrain size (p = 0.093) compared with <italic>ncbp2</italic> knockdown (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref></bold>). Knockdown of <italic>pak2</italic> with <italic>ncbp2</italic> showed a similar trend towards decreased forebrain size (p = 0.051). Interestingly, the reduced brain volumes we observed with knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> recapitulate the reduced brain volume observed in 3q29 deletion mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref015">15</xref>], suggesting that multiple genes in the 3q29 region contribute to this phenotype. We further examined the effect of knocking down homologs of 3q29 genes on <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> eye development at stage 42, and found that knockdown of these homologs caused irregular shapes and decreased size compared with controls (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s013">S13 Fig</xref></bold>). The reductions in eye size were rescued to control levels when mRNA was co-injected along with MO for each homolog (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s013">S13 Fig</xref></bold>). Together, these data show that individual and pairwise knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> leads to abnormal brain and eye morphology, confirming the conserved role of these genes during vertebrate development.</p>

<p>To determine if the knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes also disrupted apoptotic processes in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic>, we tested whether overexpression of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis gene (<italic>xiap</italic>) could rescue the observed developmental defects. We found that overexpression of <italic>xiap</italic> rescued the midbrain and forebrain size deficits observed with <italic>ncbp2</italic> knockdown to control levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref></bold>).

To further validate these findings, we performed a western blot following knockdown of <italic>fbxo45</italic> and <italic>ncbp2</italic> using anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) as a marker for apoptosis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s012">S12 Fig</xref></bold>). We found that reduction of <italic>fbxo45</italic> and <italic>ncbp2</italic> expression each led to an increase in cleaved caspase-3 levels compared with controls, which were restored to control levels with concomitant overexpression of <italic>xiap</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g008">Fig 8E</xref></bold>).

Overall, these results suggest involvement of apoptotic processes towards the developmental phenotypes observed with knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes in a vertebrate model (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008590.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using complementary <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> models, we interrogated developmental effects, cellular mechanisms, and genetic interactions of individual homologs of genes within the 3q29 region. Our major findings were recapitulated across both model systems (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008590.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>) and could also potentially account for the developmental phenotypes reported in mouse models of the entire deletion. Several themes have emerged from our study that exemplify the genetic and mechanistic complexity of the 3q29 deletion region.</p>
<p><italic>First</italic>, our analysis of developmental phenotypes with knockdown of homologs for individual 3q29 genes showed that a single gene within the region may not be solely responsible for the effects of the deletion. In fact, we found that knockdown of 12 out of 14 fly homologs showed developmental defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, while every fly homolog showed an enhanced rough eye phenotype when knocked down along with at least one other homolog (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>). Although our study is limited to examining conserved cellular phenotypes of homologs of 3q29 genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic>, evidence from other model organisms also supports an oligogenic model for the deletion. In fact, knockout mouse models for several 3q29 genes have been reported to exhibit severe developmental phenotypes, including axonal and synaptic defects in <italic>Fbxo45</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and embryonic lethality in <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Pcyt1a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref071">71</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s017">S3 Table</xref></bold>). Notably, although <italic>Dlg1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> or <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice showed a range of neuronal phenotypes compared with control mice, they did not recapitulate the major developmental and behavioral features observed in mouse models of the entire deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref072">72</xref>], suggesting that the deletion phenotypes are contingent upon haploinsufficiency of multiple genes in the region (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s024">S10 Table</xref></bold>). Furthermore, several 3q29 genes including <italic>PAK2</italic>, <italic>DLG1</italic>, <italic>PCYT1A</italic>, and <italic>UBXN7</italic> are under evolutionary constraint in humans, based on gene pathogenicity metrics (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s028">S1 File</xref></bold>). Two genes in the 3q29 region without fly homologs, <italic>CEP19</italic> and <italic>TFRC</italic>, are also under evolutionary constraint in humans, with <italic>TFRC</italic> having been implicated in neural tube defects and embryonic lethality in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref073">73</xref>]. While no common variants associated with neurodevelopmental traits have been observed in the 3q29 region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref074">74</xref>], rare variants of varying effects in 9/21 genes have been identified among patients with different developmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref075">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref077">77</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s028">S1 File</xref></bold>). These data, combined with our findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic>, implicate multiple genes within the 3q29 region as potential candidates for neurodevelopmental defects.</p>
<p><italic>Second</italic>, our screening of 161 crosses between pairs of fly homologs of 3q29 genes identified 44 interactions that showed enhanced rough eye phenotypes, suggesting that complex interactions among genes in the 3q29 region could contribute towards developmental defects (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g009">Fig 9A</xref></bold>). While we only tested a subset of all possible interactions among the non-syntenic homologs of 3q29 genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, our results highlight conserved mechanistic relationships between “parts”, or the individual genes, towards understanding the effects of the “whole” deletion. For example, knockdown of <italic>Cbp20</italic> enhanced the phenotypes of 11 out of 12 other fly homologs, suggesting that <italic>NCBP2</italic> could be a key modulator of other genes within the region. <italic>NCBP2</italic> encodes a subunit of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), which binds to the 5’ end of mRNA and microRNA in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref078">78</xref>]. Given the role of the CBC in post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated decay, alternative splicing and mRNA transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref080">80</xref>], it is possible that disruption of this complex could result in changes to a broad set of genes and biological processes. In fact, our analysis of differentially-expressed genes in <italic>Cbp20</italic> knockdown flies showed disruption of synaptic transmission, cellular respiration, and several metabolic pathways. In contrast to other proposed candidate genes in the 3q29 region, <italic>NBCP2</italic> is not predicted to be pathogenic on its own in humans (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s028">S1 File</xref></bold>) and does not have identified deleterious mutations in sequencing studies of neurodevelopmental disease cohorts so far, indicating its potential role as a modifier of the other candidate genes in the region (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g009">Fig 9B</xref></bold>). Our results also complement previous reports of synergistic interactions among fly homologs of 3q29 genes in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref054">54</xref>], representing another hallmark of an oligogenic model for the deletion. As these genetic interactions may vary across different species, developmental timepoints, and tissues, the role of these interactions should be more deeply explored using mouse and human cell culture models.</p>

<p><italic>Third</italic>, we identified disruptions to several cellular processes due to both single and pairwise knockdown of homologs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> models (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008590.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>). For example, simultaneous knockdown of homologs of <italic>NCBP2</italic> and <italic>FBXO45</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> led to enhanced cellular disorganization (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g005">Fig 5</xref></bold>) and altered expression of cell cycle and apoptosis genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s008">S8 Fig</xref></bold>), as well as enhanced morphological defects and increased caspase-3 levels in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g008">Fig 8</xref></bold>). We further found that overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitors <italic>Diap1</italic> and <italic>xiap</italic> rescued the cellular and neuronal phenotypes observed with knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g006">Fig 6</xref></bold>), providing important validations for the potential involvement of apoptosis in the deletion (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008590.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>). We propose that <italic>NCBP2</italic> could modify several cellular and molecular processes that may not be directly related to apoptosis, but could instead lead to a cascade of biological events that ultimately result in apoptosis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g009">Fig 9B</xref></bold>). Apoptosis mechanisms are well-conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic>, and humans, with key genes such as <italic>XIAP</italic> (<italic>Diap1</italic>), <italic>CASP2</italic> (<italic>Dronc</italic>), <italic>CASP3</italic> (<italic>DrICE</italic>), and <italic>CASP7</italic> (<italic>Dcp-1</italic>) sharing the same roles in programmed cell death across the three organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref081">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref083">83</xref>]. In fact, we found that fly homologs of human genes annotated for apoptosis function in the Gene Ontology database were also enriched for apoptosis function (n = 1,063 fly homologs from 1,789 human apoptosis genes; p = 5.30×10<sup>−13</sup>, Fisher’s Exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Although we focused on testing apoptosis phenotypes with knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes, we note that apoptosis is potentially one of many cellular pathways disrupted by the 3q29 deletion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008590.g009">Fig 9B</xref></bold>). In fact, our data implicated knockdown of several homologs of 3q29 genes, including <italic>dlg1</italic> and <italic>CG8888</italic> (<italic>BDH1</italic>), towards abnormal cell proliferation during development. Furthermore, several 3q29 genes have been previously associated with apoptosis or cell cycle regulation functions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s028">S1 File</xref></bold>). For example, <italic>DLG1</italic> is a tumor suppressor gene whose knockdown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to neoplasms in the developing brain and eye disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref084">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref085">85</xref>], while <italic>PAK2</italic> is a key downstream mediator of the ERK signaling pathway for neuronal extension and is activated by caspases during apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref086">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref087">87</xref>]. Our results recapitulate the role of <italic>DLG1</italic> towards cell cycle regulation, and also implicate <italic>NCBP2</italic> and its interactions towards multiple cellular and developmental phenotypes.</p>
<p>More broadly, genes involved with apoptosis and cell proliferation have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, we previously observed disrupted cell proliferation upon knockdown of <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs of genes in the 16p11.2 deletion region, as well as an enrichment of cell cycle function among connector genes between pairs of 16p11.2 genes in a human brain-specific network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref021">21</xref>]. Furthermore, abnormal apoptosis in the early developing brain has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the decreased number of neurons observed in individuals with autism and schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref088">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref089">89</xref>]. For example, increased apoptosis was observed in both postmortem brain tissue from autism patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref090">90</xref>] and primary fibroblasts from schizophrenia patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref091">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref092">92</xref>]. We found further support for the role of apoptosis in these disorders by identifying significant enrichments for genes associated with apoptotic processes among candidate genes for autism (empirical p&lt;1.00×10<sup>−5</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref077">77</xref>], intellectual disability (p&lt;1.00×10<sup>−5</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref093">93</xref>], and schizophrenia (p = 0.014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref076">76</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s025">S11 Table</xref></bold>). In fact, out of the 525 neurodevelopmental genes involved in apoptosis, 20 genes were present within pathogenic CNV regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref094">94</xref>], including <italic>CORO1A</italic>, <italic>MAPK3</italic> and <italic>TAOK2</italic> in the 16p11.2 region as well as <italic>TBX1</italic>, the causative gene for heart defects in DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref095">95</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s031">S4 File</xref></bold>). In addition to neuropsychiatric disorders, apoptosis has also been implicated in syndromic forms of microcephaly in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref096">96</xref>] as well as decreased brain size in animal models of microcephaly genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref097">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref098">98</xref>]. For example, a mouse model of the Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene <italic>NBN</italic> exhibited increased neuronal apoptosis, leading to microcephaly and decreased body mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref099">99</xref>]. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of cell cycle-related processes, particularly apoptosis and proliferation, towards modulating neuronal phenotypes that could be responsible for developmental disorders.</p>
<p>In this study, the use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> models, both of which are amenable to high-throughput screening of developmental phenotypes, allowed us to systematically examine the conserved cellular and mechanistic roles of homologs of 3q29 genes and their interactions. Follow-up studies in more evolutionarily advanced systems, such as mouse or human cell lines, will be useful to overcome limitations of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> models, including testing the neurodevelopmental phenotypes and interactions of 3q29 genes without fly homologs. Collectively, these results emphasize the utility of quantitative functional assays for identifying conserved pathways associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, which will hopefully allow for future discoveries of treatments for these disorders.</p>

<p>Using reciprocal BLAST searches and orthology predictions from the DRSC Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (<italic>DIOPT</italic>) v.7.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref100">100</xref>], we identified 15 fly homologs for the 21 human genes within the chromosome 3q29 region (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s015">S1 Table</xref></bold>). No fly homologs were present for six genes, including <italic>LRRC33</italic>, <italic>CEP19</italic>, <italic>RNF168</italic>, <italic>SMCO1</italic>, <italic>TFRC</italic>, and <italic>TM4SF19</italic>. We used a similar strategy to identify homologs for other neurodevelopmental genes tested for interactions in this study. Gene Ontology-Slim (GO-Slim) terms for each human gene and fly homolog were obtained from PantherDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref101">101</xref>] and are provided in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s028">S1 File</xref></bold>. RNAi lines for fly homologs were obtained from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref102">102</xref>] (VDRC), including both KK and GD lines, and the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (BDSC) (NIH P40OD018537). A list of fly RNAi lines used in this study is provided in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s029">S2 File</xref></bold>. Fly RNAi lines for homologs of 3q29 genes were tested for gene knockdown using quantitative PCR (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s015">S1 Table</xref></bold>). As the available KK line for CG5359 (<italic>TCTEX1D2</italic>) showed a wing phenotype consistent with <italic>tiptop</italic> overexpression due to RNAi insertion at the 5’UTR of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref103">103</xref>], which we confirmed using qPCR analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s032">S5 File</xref></bold>), we excluded this gene from our experiments.

<p>All fly stocks and crosses were cultured on conventional cornmeal-sucrose-dextrose-yeast medium at 25°C, unless otherwise indicated. RNAi lines were crossed with a series of <italic>GAL4</italic> driver lines to achieve tissue-specific knockdown of genes, including <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup><italic>;da</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> (Scott Selleck, Penn State) for ubiquitous, <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup><italic>;dCad-GFP</italic>,<italic>GMR-GAL4/CyO</italic> (Zhi-Chun Lai, Penn State) and <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup><italic>;GMR-GAL4</italic>;<italic>UAS-Dicer2</italic> (Claire Thomas, Penn State) for eye-specific, <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>,<italic>bx</italic><sup><italic>MS1096</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4;;UAS-Dicer2</italic> (Zhi-Chun Lai, Penn State) for wing-specific, and <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>,<italic>Elav</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> (Mike Groteweil, VCU) and <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>,<italic>Elav-GAL4;;UAS-Dicer2</italic> (Scott Selleck, Penn State) for pan-neuronal knockdown of gene expression.

Adult fly heads at day 3 were separated by vortexing, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was prepared using the qScript cDNA synthesis kit (Quantabio, Beverly, MA, USA). Quantitative PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems Fast 7500 system with SYBR Green PCR master mix (Quantabio) to estimate the level of gene expression. All experiments were performed using three biological replicates of 35 fly heads each. Primers were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref106">106</xref>], with primer pairs separated by an intron in the corresponding genomic DNA. A list of primers used in the experiments is provided in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s016">S2 Table</xref></bold>.

<title>Climbing assay</title>
<p>We set up fly crosses at 25°C with <italic>Elav</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> to obtain pan-neuronal knockdown for select homologs of 3q29 genes. For each RNAi line tested, groups of ten female flies were first allowed to adjust at room temperature for 30 minutes and then transferred to a climbing apparatus, made by joining two vials, and allowed to adjust for 5 minutes. The flies were tapped down to the bottom, and the number of flies climbing past the 8 cm mark measured from the bottom of the apparatus in 10 seconds was then counted (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s033">S1 Video</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s034">S2 Video</xref></bold>). This assay was repeated nine additional times for each group, with a one-minute rest between trials. The sets of 10 trials for each group were repeated daily for ten days, capturing data for 100 replicates from day 1 until day 10, starting the experiments with 1-2-day old flies.

<p>We crossed RNAi lines with <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic> and reared at 29°C for eye-specific knockdown and <italic>bx</italic><sup><italic>MS1096</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4</italic> at 25°C for wing-specific knockdown. For eye imaging, adult 2-3-day old female progenies from the crosses were collected, immobilized by freezing at -80°C, mounted on Blu-tac (Bostik Inc, Wauwatosa, WI, USA), and imaged with an Olympus BX53 compound microscope with LMPLan N 20X air objective using a DP73 c-mount camera at 0.5X magnification and a z-step size of 12.1μm. (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). We used CellSens Dimension software (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) to capture the images, and stacked the image slices using Zerene Stacker (Zerene Systems LLC, Richland, WA, USA). All eye images presented in this study are maximum projections of 20 consecutive optical z-sections. Adult wings were plucked from 2–5 day old female flies, mounted on a glass slide, covered with a coverslip and sealed with clear nail polish. The wings were imaged using a Zeiss Discovery V20 stereoscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) with ProgRes Speed XT Core 3 camera (Jenoptik AG, Jena, Germany) using a 40X objective, and wing images were captured with ProgRes CapturePro v.2.8.8 software.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry of eye and wing discs</title>
<p>Third instar larval and 44-hour-old pupal eye discs, reared at 29°C, and third instar larval wing discs, reared at 25°C, were dissected in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. The eye and wing discs were then washed thrice in PBT (PBS with 0.1% Triton-X) for 10 minutes each, treated with blocking solution (PBS with 1% normal goat serum (NGS) for eye discs, or 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for wing discs) for 30 minutes, and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C. Rabbit anti-cleaved <italic>Drosophila</italic> dcp1 (Asp216) (1:100; 9578S, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), a marker for cells undergoing apoptosis, and Mouse anti-phospho-Histone H3 (S10) antibody (1:100; 9706L, Cell Signaling Technology), a mitotic marker for measuring proliferating cells, were used to assay cell proliferation and apoptosis defects in larval eye and wing discs. Mouse anti-DLG (1:200; 4F3, DSHB, Iowa City, Iowa, USA), a septate junction marker, and Rhodamine Phalloidin (1:200; R415, Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA), an F-actin marker, were used to visualize and count ommatidial cells and photoreceptor cells in pupal eyes. Mouse anti-chaoptin (1:200; 24B10, DSHB) was used to visualize retinal axon projections. Preparations were then washed thrice with PBT for 10 minutes, and incubated for two hours with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa fluor 568 goat anti-mouse (1:200) (A11031), Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (1:200) (A11029), Alexa fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit (1:200) (A21245), and Alexa fluor 647 goat anti-mouse (1:200) (A21236), Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA)) with gentle shaking.

<title>Bromouridine staining</title>
<p>Third instar larval eye discs were dissected in 1X PBS and immediately transferred to Schneider’s Insect Media (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The tissues were then incubated in 10 μM BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) at 25°C for one hour with constant agitation to allow for incorporation of BrdU into DNA of replicating cells during the S-phase of cell cycle. The samples were washed thrice with PBS for five minutes each and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. To denature DNA, the tissues were acid-treated in 2N HCl for 20 minutes, neutralized in 100 mM Borax solution for 2 minutes, washed thrice in 10X PBT (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) for 10 minutes, and treated with blocking solution (PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% NGS) for one hour. The tissues were then incubated in mouse anti-BrdU (1:200; G3G4, DSHB, Iowa City, Iowa, USA) and diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. The next day, the tissues were washed thrice in PBT for 20 minutes each and incubated in Alexa fluor 568 goat anti-mouse (1:200, Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for two hours with constant agitation.

<title>Confocal imaging and analysis</title>
<p>Confocal images of larval and pupal eye and wing discs were captured using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus America, Lake Success, NY). Maximum projections of all optical sections were generated for display. As DLG staining was only used to visualize cell boundaries in the pupal eye and not for any expression or quantitative analysis, we increased the laser intensity from 400-490V in control flies to 530-570V in flies with knockdown of <italic>dlg1</italic> to account for decreased DLG expression. Acquisition and processing of images was performed using the Fluoview FV10-ASW 2.1 software (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and the z-stacks of images were merged using ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref108">108</xref>]. The number of pH3, BrdU, TUNEL, and dcp1-positive cells from larval eye discs were counted using two ImageJ plugins, AnalyzeParticles and Image-based Tool for Counting Nuclei (ITCN). As we found a strong correlation (Pearson correlation, r = 0.736, p&lt;2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>) between the two methods (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>), all cell counts displayed for eye data were derived from ITCN analysis. Proliferating cells in larval wing discs stained with pH3 were counted using AnalyzeParticles, and apoptotic cells in wing discs stained with dcp1 were analyzed using manual counting. Images stained with anti-chaoptin were manually scored as having either “mild” (minor axon disorganization compared with control), “moderate” (partial loss of axon projection. i.e. loss of R7-R8 projection into the medulla), or “severe” (loss of projections for most axons at the lamina) axon targeting defects.</p>

<p>We used a human brain-specific gene interaction network that was previously built using a Bayesian classifier trained on gene co-expression datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref057">57</xref>]. We extracted interactions between pairs of genes with predicted weights &gt;2.0 (containing the top 0.5% most likely interactions) and measured the length of the shortest paths connecting pairs of 3q29 genes within the network, excluding genes not present in the network from final calculations. As a control, we also measured the connectivity of 500 randomly selected genes with 100 replicates each of 20 other random genes. All network analysis was performed using the NetworkX Python package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref118">118</xref>].</p>

<title>Overlap between neurodevelopmental and apoptosis gene sets</title>
<p>We obtained a set of 1,794 genes annotated with the Gene Ontology term for apoptotic processes (GO:0006915) or children terms from the Gene Ontology Consortium (AmiGO v.2.4.26) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref119">119</xref>], and overlapped this gene set with sets of 756 candidate autism genes (SFARI Gene Tiers 1–4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref077">77</xref>], 1,854 candidate intellectual disability genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref093">93</xref>], and 2,546 curated candidate schizophrenia genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref076">76</xref>]. Genes in these three sets that were annotated for apoptosis function are listed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008590.s031">S4 File</xref></bold>. To determine the statistical significance of these overlaps, we performed 100,000 simulations to identify the number of apoptosis genes among groups of genes randomly selected from the genome, and determined the percentiles for each observed overlap among the simulated overlaps as empirical p-values.</p>

<title>Examination of cellular phenotypes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye.</title>
<p>We tested individual and pairwise knockdown of fly homologs of 3q29 genes for cellular phenotypes in the adult, pupal and larval eyes. (<bold>A</bold>) We first used the <italic>Flynotyper</italic> software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref053">53</xref>] to quantify the degree of ommatidial disorganization leading to rough eye phenotypes in adult flies, as represented by the distance and angles between adjacent ommatidia (yellow arrows). (<bold>B</bold>) We next stained pupal eyes with anti-DLG to observe changes in the number and arrangement of ommatidial cells, including cone cells (c), bristle cells (b), and primary, secondary and tertiary cells (1,2,3). We also examined the organization of the photoreceptor cells (R1-R7, with R8 not visible) in each ommatidium by staining the pupal eyes with Phalloidin. (<bold>C</bold>) We finally stained larval eye discs with markers for cellular processes, such as pH3 for proliferating cells and dcp1 for apoptosis. As the progression of the morphogenetic furrow (MF) across the larval eye discs leads to proliferation and differentiation of photoreceptor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008590.ref121">121</xref>], we examined changes in the number of stained cells posterior to the MF. (<bold>D</bold>) Scatter plot of dcp1, pH3, TUNEL, and BrdU-positive cell counts in larval eye discs with knockdown of homologs of 3q29 genes quantified using two ImageJ plugins, AnalyzeParticles and Image-based Tool for Counting Nuclei (ITCN). As the two methods showed a strong correlation with each other (Pearson correlation, n = 285, r = 0.736, p&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>), we used ITCN counts to display cell count data in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: The paper entitled NCBP2 modulates neurodevelopmental defects of the 3q29 deletion in Drosophila and X. laevis models focuses on a series of putative gene interactions identified by examination of the 3q29 deletion, which has been associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. The authors suggest that the loss of multiple genes from within the deletion can be synergistically deleterious, resulting in more significant phenotypes in 44 of the tested pairwise knockout animals. Of particular note was the gene NCBP2, which appeared to enhance the phenotypes of other 3q29 genes when both were lost simultaneously. The authors also noted that many of the observed phenotypes appeared to be the result of defects in cellular organization and apoptosis, and found that the defects could be, at least partially, rescued by the expression of apoptosis inhibitors. In support of these claims, the authors provided the following evidence:</p>
<p>1. Knock-down of 3q29 homologues (when available, using the daughterless Gal4 line) in Drosophila results in global developmental defects, including lethality.</p>
<p>2. Knock-down of 3q29 homologues in the Drosophila eye (using GMR-Gal4) resulted in cellular organization defects consistent with other known neurodevelopmental genes</p>
<p>3. Pairwise knockdown of 3q29 homologues results in more extreme eye phenotypes, as identified by flynotyper software.</p>
<p>4. A subset of the 3q29 genes appear to be highly interconnected, based on mined gene interaction data.</p>
<p>5. Pairwise knockdown of the NCBP2 homologue Cbp20 and other 3q29 homologues results in enhanced apoptosis.</p>
<p>6. Pairwise knockdown of Cbp20 and known neurodevelopmental genes increased the number and severity of ommitidial necrotic patches.</p>
<p>7. Knock down of 3q29 genes using morpholono oligonucleotides in a Xenopus model was sufficient to cause developmental defects on the injected side of the animal.</p>
<p>The work presented as part of this manuscript is an interesting initial exploration of the genes contained within the 3q29 deletion. By examining the loss of both single genes and pairs from within the 3q29 locus, the authors provide evidence that a small subset of genes and their interactions may impact specific biological processes relevant to nervous system development. In particular, it would appear that NCBP2 is of particular importance, as loss of the fly homologue (Cbp20) resulted in more severe eye phenotypes when it was knocked out in a pairwise manner with 11 of the 12 other 3q29 homologues. This form of functional validation is of particular importance, because, according to the authors NCBP2 is not predicted to be pathogenic and does not have identified deleterious mutations. The authors also proposed that genes within the 3q29 locus could alter multiple cellular processes, including control of the cell cycle and apoptosis, which they then demonstrate in Drosophila and Xenopus models. More broadly, the work presented in this manuscript provides indirect evidence in support of the idea that abnormal regulation of apoptosis may be a key contributor to neurological disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. While the authors do not identify a specific mechanism as a potential culprit for any of the 3q29 associated neuropsychatric disorders, they do identify several potential interaction partners, and highlight some of the more essential genes within the 3q29 locus.</p>
<p>While I do have some concerns (denoted below) with some of the data provided, I believe this manuscript to be a generally positive contribution to our understanding of the importance of the 3q29 locus.</p>
<p>Requested Revisions / Experiments / Explanations:</p>
<p>1. We are concerned about the use of the terms “pathogenicity” and “causative” in several places throughout the manuscript. The American College for Medical Genetics defines criteria for determing the pathogenicity of specific sequence variants for medical genetics. The deletions being discussed in this paper are often already considered pathogenic in patients without the data presented by the authors here. The authors seem to use the term pathogenicity when they mean the potential for underlying mechanism in gene interactions, but fundamentally this paper does not address a disease mechanism therefore this is not demonstrated pathogenicity. We would request that they remove entirely any use or reference of their work in flies using pairwise crosses to denote pathogenicity defined in humans. The first example includes within the abstract “These cellular and neuronal defects were rescued…suggesting that apopotosis is one of several potential biological mechanisms for pathogenicity of the deletion.” AND “Overall our study suggests that NCPB2-mediated genetic interactions disrupt apoptosis and cell cycle mechanisms during development, contributing to the neurodevelopmental features of the 3q29 deletion.” These statement make too many assumptions about the shared processes between flies and humans. The authors need to scale back these expansive clinical conclusions and simply describe their data. They should remove “pathogenicity” from every instance in this manuscript.</p>
<p>2. Figure 2C: The phenotype scores reported in figure 2C for dlg1 and Cbp20 do not reflect what is reported in other figures. For example, 2C reports an average score of ~40 for Cpb20, while it has an average score of ~30 in figure 3B. This is concerning, and calls into question the inter-experiment accuracy of flynotyper.</p>
<p>3. Figure 2E / Line 1319-1320: “To account for reduced DLG expression in pupal eyes with knockdown of dlg1, images were taken at a higher intensity than control images”. All images should be taken with a standardized protocol to allow for accurate comparison.</p>
<p>4. Line 231-232: The wording here is somewhat confusing in relation to the figure 2E. Does this not cover the entire area reported in the figure? If not, why was the region “adjacent” to the morphogenic furrow chosen as opposed to the entire developing eye?</p>
<p>5. Line 233-234: Please report the p-value for the PIG-Z and dlg1 “trends towards increased pH3-positive cells”.</p>
<p>6. Line 256-258: Please report the nature of the enhancement in phenotypic severity in the eye, such as the distance or angle OD score.</p>
<p>7. Figure S4: How are the axon phenotypes scored? What is the difference between mild/moderate/severe?</p>
<p>8. Figure S10A: The panel displaying the cell organization of animals overexpressing Dronc is missing.</p>
<p>9. Figure 7B / Line 398-390: Please provide a quantification of the necrotic patches shown in addition to the representative figures.</p>
<p>10. Figure 8D: The western blot for apoptosis markers appears to have multiple caspase-3 bands for the fbxo45 knockdown and fbxo45/ncbp2 knockdown, which are absent in other lanes. Is there an explanation of these bands? Is it possible there could be an error the measurement of band intensity due to their presence?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Your manuscript is very interesting both in terms of genetic screens and for the identification of candidate genes for the 3q29 region. Nevertheless I have a few questions regarding the validation of the down-regulation of the 3q29 homologs genes.</p>
<p>You only showed the s2 table for Elav-Gal4 but did you perform the validation of the levels of expression using other GAL4 drivers in drosophila or with morpholinos in Xenopus L? Can you show some validation experiments and in particular have you done it while performing gene interaction study? Were you able to find your gene of interest down-expressed using the RNAseq experiments in fly? It is of particular importance because as you stated in mouse heterozygous animals for Dlg1 and Pak2 do no show any phenotype.</p>
