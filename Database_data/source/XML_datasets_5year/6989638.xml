<p id="Par1">mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT in a hydrophobic motif site that is a biomarker of insulin sensitivity. In brown adipocytes, mTORC2 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, however the mechanism has been unclear because downstream AKT signaling appears unaffected by mTORC2 loss. Here, by applying immunoblotting, targeted phosphoproteomics and metabolite profiling, we identify ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) as a distinctly mTORC2-sensitive AKT substrate in brown preadipocytes. mTORC2 appears dispensable for most other AKT actions examined, indicating a previously unappreciated selectivity in mTORC2-AKT signaling. Rescue experiments suggest brown preadipocytes require the mTORC2/AKT/ACLY pathway to induce PPAR-gamma and establish the epigenetic landscape during differentiation. Evidence in mature brown adipocytes also suggests mTORC2 acts through ACLY to increase carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) activity, histone acetylation, and gluco-lipogenic gene expression. Substrate utilization studies additionally implicate mTORC2 in promoting acetyl-CoA synthesis from acetate through acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). These data suggest that a principal mTORC2 action is controlling nuclear-cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA synthesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">A cell’s capacity to sense and respond to nutrients is essential for metabolic homeostasis and losing this flexibility is a hallmark of diabetes and cancer. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is a master regulator of intracellular metabolism that responds to insulin signaling and nutrient availability. Its biochemical functions are split between two complexes called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which contains the essential subunit Raptor, and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which contains the essential subunits Rictor and Sin1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Amino acids and insulin stimulate mTORC1 to promote protein, lipid, and nucleic acid synthesis through well-defined downstream signaling networks. mTORC2 promotes glycolysis and lipid synthesis; however, its regulation and downstream mechanisms are less well defined.</p>
<p id="Par4">The best understood biochemical function of mTORC2 is to phosphorylate the hydrophobic motif (HM) site in AKT (S473 in AKT1; S474 in AKT2; S472 in AKT3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. HM phosphorylation cooperates with 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)-dependent phosphorylation in the T-loop (T308 in AKT1; T309 in AKT2; T307 in AKT3) to maximally stimulate AKT catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Growth factors facilitate AKT phosphorylation by stimulating AKT and PDK1 recruitment to the plasma membrane through pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). mTORC2 and PDK1 additionally co-regulate the related AGC family kinases SGK and PKCα<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These substrates lack PH domains, thus their interaction with mTORC2 and PDK1 is likely facilitated by a different mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, the temporal and spatial regulation of mTORC2 signaling remains poorly understood.</p>
<p id="Par5">Many models show mTORC2 as an obligatory AKT activator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>; however, its exact function in downstream AKT signaling in vivo remains elusive because, in many tissue-specific conditional <italic>Rictor</italic> knockout (KO) models, mTORC2 loss has seemingly minimal-to-no effect on the phosphorylation of several AKT substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. For example, conditionally deleting <italic>Rictor</italic> in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (e.g., with <italic>ucp1-cre</italic> or <italic>myf5-cre</italic>) or in white adipose tissue (WAT) (with <italic>adiponectin-cre</italic>) ablates AKT HM phosphorylation without obviously impairing AKT activity toward classic substrates, including PRAS40, TSC2, GSK3β, AS160, and FoxO1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Yet, despite seemingly normal AKT signaling, <italic>Rictor</italic> loss profoundly downregulates transcription of ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FASN), which catalyze de novo lipogenesis (DNL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. <italic>Rictor</italic> loss also reduces glucose uptake and inhibits the expression of ChREBPβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, which is a constitutively active isoform of the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) transcription factor that stimulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolic gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Similarly, inducible deletion of <italic>Rictor</italic> in brown preadipocytes has seemingly no effect on downstream AKT signaling, yet renders these cells incapable of differentiating in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, expressing recombinant AKT1 containing a phospho-mimetic S473 residue in <italic>Rictor</italic>-deficient preadipocytes rescues differentiation. The latter observation suggests that mTORC2 may be more essential for some AKT actions that are required for brown adipocyte differentiation and <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis, but dispensable for many others.</p>
<p id="Par6">ACLY cleaves extra-mitochondrial citrate to generate acetyl-CoA, which is the precursor for glucose-dependent de novo lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Acetyl-CoA is also used to acetylate lysine residues on histones and metabolic proteins to regulate gene expression and enzyme activity, respectively. ACLY serine 455 lies within a basophilic phosphorylation motif (RxxS) that is similar to the AKT consensus motif (RxRxxS/T). Phosphorylation of this site stimulates ACLY activity; however, the serine 455 kinase remains controversial as AKT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, PKA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, mTOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, or the branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> can reportedly phosphorylate this site. Nevertheless, because ACLY functions at the interface of glucose-dependent DNL and epigenetic control of gene expression, it is poised to be a key link between hormonal signaling and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in adipocytes.</p>
<p id="Par7">Here we test the hypothesis that mTORC2 promotes brown adipocyte differentiation and glucose-driven DNL (gluco-lipogenesis) through a distinctly mTORC2-dependent AKT pathway. To do this, we analyzed mTORC2-regulated AKT phosphosites and metabolites by mass spectrometry. This led us to identify a subset of AKT substrates and metabolites that are regulated by mTORC2, including the enzyme ACLY and its product acetyl-CoA. We provide evidence that ACLY functions downstream of a uniquely mTORC2-dependent AKT pathway required for DNL, differentiation, histone acetylation, and ChREBPβ and gluco-lipogenic gene expression. Substrate utilization studies suggest an additional role for mTORC2 in promoting acetyl-CoA synthesis from acetate through acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (ACSS2). These data uncover a previously unappreciated selectivity in mTORC2-dependent AKT signaling in <italic>Rictor</italic>-deleted brown adipocytes and reveal mTORC2’s central role in controlling nuclear–cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA synthesis.</p>

<title>Stratification of AKT substrates by mTORC2 sensitivity</title>
<p id="Par8">To test the hypothesis that some AKT substrates are more sensitive to mTORC2 loss than for others and to identify the mechanism by which mTORC2 drives brown preadipocyte differentiation, we conducted a targeted phosphoproteomics assay comparing the insulin response between <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic> precursor brown adipocytes (<italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>PBAs</italic></sup>) and isogenic control brown preadipocytes. We designed the assay to quantify phosphopeptides encompassing regulatory phosphorylation sites on AKT, previously reported AKT and SGK substrate sites, and other potential mTORC2 effectors. <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>PBAs</italic></sup> maintain growth-factor-stimulated AKT<sup>T308</sup> phosphorylation, albeit at lower levels, and seemingly normal phosphorylation of AKT substrates [Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1A</xref>], as previously observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>PBAs</italic></sup> and their vehicle-treated isogenic controls were then serum deprived, or serum deprived and then stimulated with insulin for 15 min. Phosphopeptide-enriched samples were analyzed with parallel reaction monitoring targeted mass spectrometry, a highly sensitive quantitative technique. The assay quantified 31 known AKT substrates, of which 17 increase phosphorylation at least 1.5-fold in response to insulin in wild-type (WT) cells at Benjamini–Hochberg 5% false detection rate (FDR), indicating that they are likely targets of insulin-stimulated AKT action. Of the 17 insulin-upregulated phosphopeptides, 9 contain AKT substrate motifs for which the phosphorylated residue can be localized with high confidence. The other eight contain phosphorylated residues with ambiguous localization within at most three residues away from the predicted AKT substrate site.</p>
<p id="Par9">Based on quantitative differences between conditions, we stratified phosphopeptides into three classes, all with a 5% FDR from analysis of variance (ANOVA; see “Methods”): Class I contains phosphosites that are highly dependent upon mTORC2; Class II contains phosphosites that are insensitive to mTORC2 loss; and Class III contains phosphosites that are partially sensitive to mTORC2 loss [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>]. Among the Class I peptides, we identified the known direct mTORC2 target sites pAKT1<sup>S473</sup>, pAKT2<sup>S474</sup>, and pAKT3<sup>S472</sup> as insulin stimulated and highly sensitive to mTORC2 loss [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2A</xref>]. We also identified a Class I peptide from NDRG1 with phosphorylation on either S364 or T366 that was not significantly stimulated by insulin but is highly dependent of mTORC2 [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>]. This difference is not explained by changes to NDRG1 protein levels as measured by mass spectrometry. pNDRG1<sup>T366</sup> is known to be phosphorylated by SGK, a kinase from the same family of AKT that requires mTORC2-dependent HM phosphorylation for its activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These findings confirm our ability to identify phosphorylation sites that occur with or without insulin stimulation for which mTORC2 is essential.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Identification of mTORC2-sensitive phosphorylation sites, including S455 in ATP citrate lyase (ACLY).</title><p><bold>a</bold> Phosphoproteomics work flow and analysis in <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>PBAs</italic></sup>.

<p id="Par10">Among the Class II substrates, for which mTORC2 is dispensable, we identified several AKT target sites, including pPRAS40<sup>T246</sup> and pGSK3β<sup>S9</sup> [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2B</xref>], validating our previously observed immunoblot analyses using phospho-specific antibodies [Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1A</xref>]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Also included in Class II are pTSC2<sup>S939</sup> and pTSC2<sup>S981</sup>, two well-known AKT phosphorylation events that stimulate the mTORC1 pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2B</xref>]. Consistently, ribosomal protein S6 peptides containing phosphorylation at S235 or S236 and at S240 (often used as an mTORC1 activity reporter) are also Class II substrates [Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2B</xref>]. We additionally identified several predicted AKT substrates that fall into Class III, showing partial sensitivity to mTORC2 loss [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2C</xref>]. One peptide is from a region in phosphofructo kinase-2 (PFK2) containing either the annotated AKT substrate site S486 or the nearby S489, and another is from a region in ACLY containing the S455 site [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>]. We also identify mTORC2-sensitive sites on BAD (S155) and vimentin (S39) [Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2C</xref>]. These data suggest that there is selective inhibition of AKT signaling pathways following induced <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion in brown preadipocytes.</p>
<p id="Par11">Immunoblotting with commercially available phosphosite-specific antibodies independently uncovered serum and insulin-stimulated pACLY<sup>S455</sup> as an AKT substrate showing mTORC2 dependency [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1B</xref>]. We were unable to detect pPFK2<sup>S486</sup> using a commercially available antibody. Importantly, pACLY<sup>S455</sup> and pPRAS40<sup>T246</sup> (an mTORC2-insensitive AKT substrate in our assays [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c, f</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1B</xref>]) are both sensitive to the AKT inhibitor MK2206 [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1B</xref>]. This argues against an AKT compensatory kinase acting in the absence mTORC2. Serum or insulin-stimulated pACLY<sup>S455</sup>, but not pPRAS40<sup>T246</sup>, is also mTORC2 dependent in HEK293E cells deleted for <italic>Rictor</italic> using CRISPR/Cas9, while both sites are sensitive to MK2206 [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1C</xref>]. We also expressed recombinant Rictor in the <italic>Rictor</italic>-deleted HEK293E cells to confirm that this restores ACLY<sup>S455</sup> phosphorylation [Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1D</xref>]. Thus selectivity may be relevant in other <italic>Rictor</italic>-deleted cell types.</p>

<title>mTORC2 regulates acetyl-CoA availability</title>
<p id="Par12">The identification of pACLY<sup>S455</sup> and pPFK2<sup>S486/S489</sup> as mTORC2-sensitive AKT substrates is interesting because they function at key rate-limiting regulatory steps in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from glucose [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>].

However, this alternative pool of acetyl-CoA is reportedly not efficiently used for histone acetylation unless high levels of exogenous acetate are supplemented likely explaining why <italic>Acly-iKO</italic><sup><italic>PBAs</italic></sup> cannot differentiate at physiological acetate levels [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d–e</xref>]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par25">In contrast, despite <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>PBAs</italic></sup> having nearly a 50% drop in total acetyl-CoA levels, they fail to trigger compensatory ACSS2 induction; in fact, ACSS2 levels are reduced in <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>PBA</italic></sup> cells [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>].

<title>ACLY is a key mTORC2 effector in mature brown adipocytes</title>
<p id="Par26">Our prior in vivo observations show that chronic mTORC2 loss (caused by conditionally deleting <italic>Rictor</italic> in mature brown or white adipocytes with congenitally expressed Cre drivers) attenuates ACLY, ACC, and FASN mRNA and protein expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par27">To investigate the temporal effect of acute vs prolonged <italic>Rictor</italic> loss on gluco-lipogenic gene expression, we performed a time-course analysis of ACLY phosphorylation and gene expression following tamoxifen-induced <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion in mature brown adipocytes (hereafter <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>MBAs</italic></sup>).

This is indicated by the fact that phosphorylation of many AKT substrates is unimpaired by <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion while ACLY phosphorylation is reduced. (2) mTORC2/AKT-dependent ACLY phosphorylation promotes acetyl-CoA synthesis and primes de novo lipogenesis downstream of glucose uptake and glycolysis. (3) The increased flux to acetyl-CoA additionally stimulates histone acetylation. In brown adipocyte precursors, this coincides with <italic>pparγ</italic> induction to drive differentiation; in mature brown adipocytes, this coincides with ChREBPβ activity to increase expression of gluco-lipogenic genes. (4) Gluco-lipogenic gene expression then provides a positive feedback effect on glucose transport and de novo lipogenesis. (5) mTORC2 may also stimulate acetate metabolism to acetyl-CoA by regulating the expression and/or activity of ACSS2.

<p id="Par30">Thus, while the effects of deleting <italic>Rictor</italic> or <italic>Acly</italic> during brown adipocyte differentiation are largely overlapping, their loss in mature brown adipocytes has opposite effects on ACSS2 expression, downstream DNL pathway expression, and lipid droplet content.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par31">Prior studies implicate adipocyte mTORC2 in controlling insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and DNL (gluco-lipogenesis). However, the mechanism has been enigmatic because most AKT substrates examined appear to be phosphorylated normally when <italic>Rictor</italic> is deleted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Solving this mystery is important because a similar state of adipose tissue “selective insulin resistance” in which insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, but not AKT activity per se, is defective, occurs in several models of adipocyte insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Moreover, DNL in human BAT and WAT positively correlates with thermogenesis and insulin sensitivity, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In this study, we uncover a previously unappreciated selectivity in mTORC2-dependent AKT signaling toward ACLY that provides a plausible mechanistic underpinning for why mTORC2 loss impairs brown adipocyte glucose-dependent lipogenesis and differentiation.</p>
<p id="Par32">One limitation of this study is that it does not address why ACLY<sup>S455</sup> is different from other AKT substrates. Although our inducible KO system results in rapid loss of <italic>Rictor</italic> and AKT HM phosphorylation, it remains possible that a compensatory mechanism stabilizes T308 phosphorylation maintaining AKT activity toward most substrates. A selective mTORC2 inhibitor (i.e., which does not inhibit mTORC1) would be valuable in determining the acute effects of mTORC2; however, such a molecule is not yet available. Nevertheless, why would ACLY phosphorylation differ from other AKT substrates in its mTORC2 dependency? One possibility is that intrinsic differences in the ACLY S455 motif may demand higher AKT activity, or a different biochemical conformation dependent on HM phosphorylation, to be efficiently phosphorylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Aligning mTORC2 dependent and independent phosphosites identified in this study to the AKT consensus motif indicates that more dependent sites are less conserved [Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2D</xref>]. Alternatively, the mTORC2 dependency of ACLY phosphorylation could relate to its localization and/or temporal dynamics of phosphorylation. For example, ACLY phosphorylation may occur distal to the plasma membrane and/or membrane PIP3 and therefore may require HM phosphorylation to recruit PDK1, which is how other AGC family kinases lacking PH domains are regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Indeed, evidence suggests that AKT is regulated by both PH-domain-dependent and -independent mechanisms in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Proteomics and western blotting data also indicate that mTORC2 loss decreases ACLY phosphorylation during serum deprivation suggesting that mTORC2 might regulate acetyl-CoA synthesis in multiple nutritional states. Another possibility is that mTORC2 may suppress an ACLY phosphatase.</p>
<p id="Par33">Two studies comparing temporal dynamics of the insulin-stimulated phosphoproteome and metabolome in 3T3-L1 adipocytes show that total citrate levels acutely decrease, and acetyl-CoA levels increase, roughly when ACLY S455 phosphorylation is stimulated and that this occurs prior to maximum glucose transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. This suggests that mTORC2-dependent ACLY stimulation may be an early insulin action that mobilizes metabolites downstream of glucose transport, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle to both relieve citrate’s allosteric inhibitory effect on PFK1 and prime gluco-lipogenesis. Data from this study further suggest that mTORC2-dependent ACLY phosphorylation additionally creates an overflow of acetyl-CoA that is siphoned toward histone acetylation, thereby providing an insulin-coupled secondary epigenetic signal that is a direct readout of systemic nutrient (glucose) availability. We suggest a model that, in brown adipocyte precursors, this pathway provides a license for differentiation, while in mature brown adipocytes, it potentiates glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lipid synthesis by upregulating and/or maintaining ChREBP activity and the gluco-lipogenic transcriptional program [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d</xref>]. Thus mTORC2-simulated acetyl-CoA synthesis may provide a key missing link between systemic glucose availability and setting the genetic program that determines the glucose- and lipid-handling capacity of brown adipocytes.</p>
<p id="Par34">mTORC2 also promotes <italic>Chrebpβ</italic> expression, which drives gluco-lipogenic gene expression including that of <italic>Acly</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>Chrebpβ</italic> expression is also ACLY dependent in white adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> consistent with ChREBPα/<italic>β</italic> functioning downstream of mTORC2/ACLY in a positive feedback loop. Thus ChREBP could also be the key target of mTORC2/ACLY in gluco-lipogenic gene regulation. In fact, hepatocyte ChREBP transcriptional activity is reportedly regulated by acetylation and <italic>O</italic>-GlcNacylation, which both require acetyl-CoA precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The most likely scenario is that histone acetylation and ChREBP activity are interconnected, and further resolving how ChREBP is regulated by mTORC2 and ACLY will be important. The mTORC2/ACLY pathway might additionally regulate other posttranslational modifications or allosteric regulatory roles linked to DNL metabolites, such as palmitoylation, which is implicated in Glut4 trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The potential role of DNL as a source of signaling metabolites in adipocytes has been underappreciated, but it is tempting to speculate that defects in their second messenger functions could be key steps in the early onset of insulin resistance.</p>
<p id="Par35">That mTORC2 additionally regulates acetyl-CoA synthesis from acetate indicates a broader role of mTORC2 in controlling nuclear–cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA synthesis. The role of acetate as a metabolic substrate in adipocytes is not well understood. However, the differential effects on ACSS2 expression caused by <italic>Rictor</italic> loss vs <italic>Acly</italic> loss could explain why <italic>Adiponectin-Cre;Rictor</italic><sup><italic>l/l</italic></sup> mice have a more severe metabolic phenotype compared to <italic>Adiponectin-Cre;Acly</italic><sup><italic>l/l</italic></sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In conclusion, the identification of ACLY and ACSS2 as key targets of mTORC2 action in brown adipocytes fills an important gap in our understanding of this more mysterious mTOR complex. These findings may be relevant to understanding mTORC2 action in other tissues and in the pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes.</p>

Cells stably expressing recombinant proteins were obtained either by using lentiviral (TRCN 0000055214-17) and Rictor (addgene: P1853/1854) shRNA experiments or retroviral systems (e.g., Glut-1, HK, Akt, and Acly experiments). For brown adipocyte differentiation, cells were seeded and allowed to proliferate to confluence in the presence of differentiation medium that includes 20 mM of insulin and 1 nM of T<sub>3</sub>. At day 4, cells were treated with induction medium containing 20 mM of insulin, 1 nM of T<sub>3</sub>, 0.125 mM of indomethacin, 2 μM/mL dexamethasone, and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine (IBMX) for 2 days. Then the induction medium was replaced with differentiation medium that was changed every 2 days until day 14. Deletion of <italic>Rictor</italic>, <italic>Acly</italic>, <italic>Akt1</italic>, and/or <italic>Akt2</italic> was achieved by treating the cells with two doses of 4-OHT (1 μM) prior to the start of differentiation (to obtain <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>PBA</italic></sup> cells) or one dose at day 8 of differentiation (to obtain <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>MBA</italic></sup> cells) depending on the experiment. Control cells received an equivalent dose of ethanol (vehicle). To analyze insulin or fetal bovine serum (FBS) signaling, cells were serum deprived for 12 h and then stimulated with insulin (150 nm) or 10% FBS for 15 min. To analyze AKT dependency, cells were treated with or without AKT inhibitor MK2206 (10 μM). For metabolite rescue experiments, pyruvate (2.5 mM), citrate (2.5 mM), or sodium acetate (5 mM) was added in every media change to the corresponding differentiation or induction media. For Myc-ACLY-WT, Myc-ACLY-S455A, and Myc-ACLY-S455D overexpression experiments in <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>MBA</italic></sup>, cells were infected at day 10 of differentiation and collected at day 14.

<title>Chromatin extraction</title>
<p id="Par40">Chromatin extraction was performed prior to the western blot analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Briefly, cells were collected at day 2 of the differentiation assay, before <italic>Pparγ2</italic> induction, resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 0.05% NP-40, and a protease (Biotool Cat.

<title>Phosphoproteomics</title>
<p id="Par42">Control and <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic> cells were serum deprived for 12 h (unstimulated samples) and then some were treated with 150 nM insulin for 15 min (stimulated). All cells were washed 3 times with cold PBS, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed in a lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris pH 8.2, 75 mM NaCl, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, and 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Each well of a 6-well plate was scraped in 125 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer, and 2 wells were pooled for each replicate. Lysates were probe-sonicated two times, and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic>. Protein content was measured by a BCA assay (Pierce). Samples were reduced for 45 min at 55 °C using 5 mM dithiothreitol, alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at room temperature, and quenched with an additional 5 mM of dithiothreitol at room temperature for 15 min. Urea was diluted to 1.5 M using 50 mM pH 8.2 Tris, and protein was digested for 16 h using 5 μg/mL trypsin at 37 °C. Digested peptides were de-salted using 50 mg Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters) and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Phosphopeptides were enriched using PureCube Fe-NTA magnetic beads (Cube Biotech) in a KingFisher magnetic bead processor (Thermo). Dried phosphopeptide samples were prepared for analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) by dissolution in 4% formic acid and 3% acetonitrile.</p>
<p id="Par43">To screen for mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation, we designed a targeted, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry method that was informed by manual literature curation and prior preliminary experiments. To design the list, we curated a preliminary list of 228 phosphopeptides representing previously characterized AKT substrates, regulatory phosphorylation sites on AGC kinases, phosphorylation sites on proteins with known regulatory function in insulin signaling and/or brown fat, and phosphorylation sites with potential mTORC2 dependence according to preliminary, unpublished data. According to a previously reported method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, we referenced an in-house database of mouse phosphoproteome data gathered from several different tissues using data-dependent acquisition (DDA) to determine the best phosphopeptide(s) with which to represent each phosphorylation site. Specifically, for each phosphorylation site, we determined which charge state and peptide cleavage form was the most frequently observed in the DDA data. Importantly, this database also enabled accurate prediction of the chromatographic retention time. In some cases, phosphorylation sites were represented by multiple peptides in the preliminary target list because it was not obvious which peptide form to choose. To refine the preliminary target list, three separate PRM assays were used to measure these phosphopeptides in insulin-stimulated WT cells with wide (+/−2.5 min) windows for retention time prediction. Peptides that were not detected or contained complete overlap of phosphorylation sites with another detected peptide were removed from the list, and all retention time predictions were re-calibrated. This final target list was then used for PRM analysis of all the samples with narrow (+/−1.5 min) windows for retention time prediction.</p>
<p id="Par44">Targeted phosphoproteomic analysis of preadipocyte phosphorylation sites was performed using LC-MS/MS. To normalize for injection amount during LC-MS/MS analysis, we measured all samples using DDA and identified 12 phosphopeptides that correlated strongly with the total MS signal and spanned most of the retention time space. DDA analysis was performed on a Thermo QExactive mass spectrometer connected to a Thermo Easy-nLC II. Chromatographic separation was performed on a 30-cm length column with a 100-μm internal diameter, packed with Reprosil 1.9 μm C18 beads (Dr. Maisch GmbH). The LC method consisted of a 49-min linear gradient from 9% to 25% acetonitrile in 0.15% formic acid. Data were acquired throughout a 70-min total time. Full MS scans were acquired from 300 to 1500 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> at 70,000 resolution with an AGC target of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> and a maximum injection time of 240 ms. The top 20 most abundant precursors per MS scan were isolated with a 2-<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> window, an AGC target of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup>, a maximum injection time of 120 ms, and 40 s dynamic exclusion. Isolated precursors were fragmented by high-energy collision-induced dissociation at a normalized collision energy of 27%, and MS/MS were acquired at 17,500 resolution. Targeted LC-MS/MS using PRM was performed on the same instrument set-up as for DDA. The instrument methods were mostly the same as for the DDA analysis, except that MS/MS spectra were acquired according to the predefined schedule of precursors representing the phosphopeptide target list, as described above. Every 20 scans, a full MS scan was acquired as described above for DDA. All MS and MS/MS spectra for DDA and PRM experiments were collected in centroid mode. PRM data were analyzed using Skyline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, and all chromatographic peaks and phosphorylation site localizations were manually inspected. For additional verification of phosphorylation site localization, PRM data were searched using Comet (v2015.02.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and filtered at 1% FDR using Percolator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Each MS/MS spectrum was scored for localization using Ascore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Ascore values representing confidence of site localization were plotted vs retention time and manually compared to the fragment chromatographic elution peaks in Skyline. Phosphorylation sites were stratified into three categories of mTORC2 sensitivity by calculating ANOVA statistics to determine the significant effects of <italic>Rictor</italic> loss and correcting to <italic>q</italic>-values using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Class I sites had <italic>q</italic> ≤ 0.05 and at least a 2-fold difference between control and <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>PBA</italic></sup>. Class III sites had <italic>q</italic> ≤ 0.05 and at least a 1.33-fold difference between control and <italic>Rictor-iKO</italic><sup><italic>PBA</italic></sup>.

<p id="Par46">Cells were cross-linked with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched for 5 min at room temperature by adding 0.125 M glycine. After three washes with 1× PBS, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% SDS, 20 mM EDTA pH 8, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) supplemented with protease and deacetylase (TSA) inhibitors. Lysates were sonicated on ice using a Diagenode Bioruptor<sup>TM</sup> UCD200 sonicator (for 15 min total at high setting in intervals of 45 s on–20 s off and kept on ice during the whole sonication process).

Soluble chromatin (1%) was kept as input control. Soluble chromatin was precleared with 2.5 μg/mL of protein-A-Sepharose at 50% at 4 °C in rotation for 1 h and beads were spin down at 5900 × <italic>g</italic> for 3 min at 4 °C.
