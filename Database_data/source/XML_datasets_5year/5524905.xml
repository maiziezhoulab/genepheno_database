<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">The cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (<italic>CDKL5</italic>) gene has been associated with rare neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by the early onset of seizures and intellectual disability. The CDKL5 protein is widely expressed in most tissues and cells with both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. In post-mitotic neurons CDKL5 is mainly involved in dendritic arborization, axon outgrowth, and spine formation while in proliferating cells its function is still largely unknown. Here, we report that CDKL5 localizes at the centrosome and at the midbody in proliferating cells. Acute inactivation of CDKL5 by RNA interference (RNAi) leads to multipolar spindle formation, cytokinesis failure and centrosome accumulation. At the molecular level, we observed that, among the several midbody components we analyzed, midbodies of CDKL5-depleted cells were devoid of HIPK2 and its cytokinesis target, the extrachromosomal histone H2B phosphorylated at S14. Of relevance, expression of the phosphomimetic mutant H2B-S14D, which is capable of overcoming cytokinesis failure in HIPK2-defective cells, was sufficient to rescue spindle multipolarity in CDKL5-depleted cells. Taken together, these results highlight a hitherto unknown role of CDKL5 in regulating faithful cell division by guaranteeing proper HIPK2/H2B functions at the midbody.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">CDKL5 is a serine-threonine kinase that was identified through a transcriptional mapping study aimed at identifying disease causing genes in the Xp22 region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The subsequent identification of mutations in the <italic>CDKL5</italic> gene in patients with the Hanefeld variant of Rett syndrome or early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM #300672) suggested the involvement of this gene in human brain functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In agreement, the two existing <italic>Cdkl5</italic> knock-out mouse models are characterized by impaired learning and memory, autistic-like features, and motor deficits reconciling several aspects of the clinical spectrum present in patients with mutations in <italic>CDKL5</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">The <italic>CDKL5/Cdkl5</italic> gene is widely transcribed and the protein can be detected in most tissues and cells, both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, CDKL5 expression reaches highest levels in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and because of the evident brain-associated functions, most studies have focused on the neuronal roles of CDKL5. In the brain CDKL5 expression is low at embryonic stages but a significant induction can be observed in the neuronal compartment in the first post-natal days supporting a role during neuronal maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In post-mitotic neurons the levels and distribution of CDKL5 are regulated by neuronal activity indicating that the protein responds promptly to external stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Of relevance, neurons devoid of the kinase are characterized by defects in axon formation and outgrowth, dendritic arborization, spine morphology, and synaptic transmission, underscoring the importance of CDKL5 for brain development and functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">While the functions of CDKL5 in post-mitotic neurons are under continuous investigation, its role in proliferating cells is still largely unknown. CDKL5 overexpression induces cell cycle arrest in neuroblastoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> whereas CDKL5 inhibition, by RNAi or targeted gene disruption, was shown to increase bromodexoyuridine incorporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Although these data suggest the involvement of CDKL5 in cell proliferation, no information is available regarding the functions and the subcellular localization of the kinase during the cell cycle. In the current study we examined the localization of CDKL5 in interphase, mitosis, and cytokinesis of proliferating cells. Besides the typical nuclear punctuate staining of CDKL5 in interphase cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, we also found CDKL5 to be localized at the centrosomes and at the midbody.</p>
<p id="Par5">In animal cells, centrosomes form when a pair of orthogonally positioned centrioles assemble and organize a matrix of proteinaceous pericentriolar material around themselves. Centrioles act as the centrosome organizer and their duplication controls centrosome number. Like DNA, centrioles duplicate semi-conservatively exactly once per cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The centrosome serves as the main microtubule-organizing center that contributes to cell adhesion, motility, and polarity in interphase and to bipolar spindle formation and timely mitotic progression in mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. During mitosis, the presence of two centrosomes per cell ensures the bipolar nature of the spindle and the equal segregation of chromosomes to two daughter cells. Quantitative or qualitative centrosome defects may lead to multipolar spindle formation and, eventually, loss of mitotic fidelity and acquisition of chromosome instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">The midbody is the narrow intercellular bridge containing bundles of microtubules derived from the mitotic spindle that connects the two daughter cells in cytokinesis. A complex network of components impacting on vesicle and membrane trafficking, cytoskeleton, chromosomes, cell cycle and lipid rafts affects midbody formation and cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Among the numerous midbody components, we have shown that HIPK2, an evolutionary conserved kinase whose large number of substrates includes the Rett syndrome associated factor MeCP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, localizes at the midbody and is required for faithful cytokinesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. HIPK2 contributes to abscission, the last step of cell division, by phosphorylating extrachromosomal histone H2B at serine 14 (S14) at the midbody. In HIPK2-defective cells, expression of a phosphomimetic H2B-S14D mutant overcomes the cytokinesis failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par7">By biochemical and functional assays, we confirmed the presence of CDKL5 both at centrosomes and at the midbody and highlighted the involvement of CDKL5 in cell division through the regulation of HIPK2/H2B functions.</p>

<title>CDKL5 localizes at the centrosome and midbody</title>
<p id="Par8">To investigate the function(s) of the ubiquitously expressed CDKL5 in proliferating cells we started evaluating the subcellular localization of the kinase during the cell cycle. The distribution of endogenous CDKL5 was analyzed in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence (IF) during interphase, mitosis, and cytokinesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). We observed a quite dynamic localization of CDKL5 at different mitotic and cytokinetic subcompartments. In prophase and metaphase, CDKL5 is detectable at the mitotic spindle poles where it colocalizes with the centrosomal marker γ-tubulin. As cells progress in telophase, CDKL5 is no longer detectable at the centrosome but localizes at the midzone. In the subsequent steps of cytokinesis CDKL5 is clearly detectable at the midbody, where it remains during abscission. As expected, in interphase we observed the typical punctuate nuclear staining of CDKL5, which corresponds to nuclear speckles enriched in mRNA splicing factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CDKL5 localizes at the centrosome and at the midbody in proliferating cells. HeLa cells were stained with Abs against CDKL5 (polyclonal, green) and γ-tubulin (red) and, to visualize DNA, with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 10 µm.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e479" xlink:href="41598_2017_5875_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p id="Par9">Next, through additional studies we validated the centrosomal and midbody localization of CDKL5 suggested by the above IF results.</p>
<p id="Par10">Regarding the centrosomal localization, we confirmed the overlapping staining of CDKL5 and γ-tubulin in different cells, such as SV40-transformed COS7 cells and human fibroblasts, MRC-5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). In the latter cells, the centrosomal localization of CDKL5 could be detected also in interphase by using two different antibodies (Abs) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S1a,b</xref>). The specificity of the result was further confirmed through siRNA mediated silencing of CDKL5, which led to a significant reduction of the centrosomal CDKL5 staining (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S1b,c</xref>). Similar to endogenous CDKL5, exogenous green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged CDKL5 can be detected at the centrosome in metaphase cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). Finally, the presence of CDKL5 at the centrosome was verified by biochemical fractionation of centrosomal proteins obtained from nocodazole/cytochalasin B-treated HeLa cells transfected with a CDKL5 specific siRNA (siCDKL5) or the relative control (siCtr). Western blot (WB) analyses show the presence of endogenous CDKL5 in the γ-tubulin positive centrosomal fractions from siCtr cells but not from siCDKL5 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). Considering the importance of the centrosome for neuronal functions, we also analyzed whether CDKL5 is present at the centrosome in cultured neuronal progenitors and post-mitotic primary hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, CDKL5 is detectable at the centrosome in both cell types (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>CDKL5 is localized at the centrosome. (<bold>a</bold>) The indicated cells were stained as in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>.

(<bold>c</bold>) HeLa cells were transfected with siCDKL5#1 or a control siRNA (siCtr.); centrosomes were purified 60 h post-transfection and the obtained fractions analyzed by WB with Abs against CDKL5 and γ-tubulin.

</p>
<p id="Par11">To validate the midbody localization, we first performed IF to confirm the co-staining of CDKL5 with two midbody markers, α-tubulin and PLK-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> in different cell types using two different anti-CDKL5 Abs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S2</xref>). As above, the specificity of the Ab was tested by silencing CDKL5 expression in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). As biochemical approach, we isolated and purified midbodies from proliferating HeLa cells enriched in telophase by nocodazole treatment, mitotic shake off, and release after nocodazole washout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Successful midbody isolation was assessed by IF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>, lower panel). Midbody extracts (MID) were analyzed by WB and compared with total cell extracts (TCE) from the same number of cells in interphase (TCE-I) and telophase (TCE-T). WB for the mitotic kinases Aurora A and cytoplasmic AKT was used to validate the fractionation protocol. In line with the results obtained by IF, endogenous CDKL5 can be detected in the midbody extracts both by WB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>) and by immunoprecipitation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). Finally, similar to endogenous CDKL5, exogenous GFP-CDKL5 is detectable at the midbody by IF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>) and in midbody extracts by WB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>CDKL5 localizes at the midbody.

(<bold>b</bold>) HeLa cells were treated as in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref> and silencing of CDKL5 expression was verified by western blotting 60 h post siRNA transfection (left).

<p id="Par12">Altogether, these results show that, beside its well-defined nuclear and cytoplasmic localization, CDKL5 also localizes at the centrosome and midbody in different cell types.</p>

<title>CDKL5 depletion triggers mitotic spindle multipolarity by centrosome accumulation</title>
<p id="Par13">We then evaluated the phenotype of CDKL5-depleted cells during cell division. IF analyses were performed with HeLa cells 60 h after siRNA transfection when CDKL5 expression is strongly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). Compared with siCtr, siCDKL5 HeLa cells showed a significant increase in the number of cells with multipolar spindles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>) associated with different chromosome segregation defects including anaphase/telophase chromosome bridges, micronucleation, and binucleated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). In addition, a significant increase in the number of cells positive for the mitotic marker phosphorylated histone H3-S10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>) supported that an increased number of cells accumulate in mitosis. Similar defects were observed also in siCDKL5 MRC-5 cells (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S3</xref>). To exclude that the observed phenotypes were due to off-target effects, we performed rescue experiments in which siRNA-resistant CDKL5 was co-expressed with GFP from a bicistronic cassette in silenced HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e–g</xref>, cells re-expressing CDKL5 have a percentage of multipolar spindles similar to siCtr cells expressing only GFP.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Silencing of CDKL5 is associated with multipolar spindle formation and chromosome segregation defects.

<p id="Par14">Spindle multipolarity can be due to defects in microtubule (MT) dynamics or to numeral and structural centrosome alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To assess the underlying cause of multipolarity in CDKL5 depleted cells, we first evaluated whether silencing of CDKL5 impairs MT dynamics in COS7 and MRC-5 cells by analyzing the regrowth of MTs after their nocodazole mediated disruption. No significant difference was observed in the aster size of newly formed MTs between siCtr and siCDKL5 cells, suggesting that CDKL5 depletion does not alter the microtubule nucleation activity of these cells (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S4</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par15">We proceeded evaluating whether CDKL5 depletion might lead to loss of centrosome integrity.

Furthermore, a significant increase of interphase cells with supernumerary centrioles (more than four per cell) was detected in siCDKL5 compared to siCtr cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Altogether, these data support the hypothesis that spindle multipolarity might be due to supernumerary centrosomes rather than to the loss of structural centrosome integrity.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Spindle multipolarity in CDKL5 depleted cells is due to centrosome accumulation.

<title>CDKL5 depletion impairs HIPK2/H2B midbody activity</title>
<p id="Par20">The midbody localization of CDKL5, the longer cytokinesis time, and the increment of binucleated cells upon silencing of CDKL5 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a,b</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3c</xref>) support the hypothesis that depletion of the kinase might affect cytokinesis. Thus, to get insight into the molecular mechanism involved in the observed cytokinesis failure, we evaluated whether CDKL5-depleted cells show any midbody defects. The localization of different structural and functional midbody factors including kinases (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., Aurora B, PLK1, HIPK2) and microtubule-associated proteins (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., MKLP1, MgcRacGap1, PRC1, and Spastin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> were assessed by IF in siCtr and siCDKL5 HeLa cells. Among the analyzed factors, we found only HIPK2 to be absent from the midbody in a high percentage of siCDKL5 cells compared with the siCtr cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S6</xref>). HIPK2 contributes to cytokinesis through the phosphorylation of extrachromosomal histone H2B at S14 at the midbody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, using a phospho-specific Ab we analyzed the presence of phosphorylated H2B-S14 at the midbody in cells silenced for CDKL5. Consistently with the delocalization of HIPK2, we did not detect any phosphorylation of H2B-S14 at the midbody in a high percentage of CDKL5-depleted cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>) suggesting that CDKL5 contributes to cytokinesis by regulating HIPK2/H2B activity at the midbody.</p>
<p id="Par21">The most evident phenotype we have observed in the CDKL5 depleted cells is spindle multipolarity, which we linked to polyploidization and centrosome accumulation. Moreover, we observed a cytokinesis failure that is known to depend on HIPK2/H2B activities at the midbody. Thus, we hypothesized that loss of HIPK2 and H2B-S14 phosphorylation at the midbody might trigger a cascade of events starting from cytokinesis failure leading to centrosome accumulation and the formation of multipolar spindles. We thus asked whether spindle multipolarity in siCDKL5 HeLa cells could be rescued by the expression of a phosphomimetic H2B-S14D derivative, which was previously shown to be capable of overcoming cytokinesis failure in HIPK2-defective cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>, the expression of H2B-S14D significantly reduced the number of cells with multipolar spindles in siCDKL5 cells indicating that CDKL5 contributes to cytokinesis through HIPK2-mediated H2B phosphorylation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par22">In the last ten years genetic lesions in <italic>CDKL5</italic> have been found in patients with neurologic disorders characterized by the early onset of often intractable seizures, intellectual disability, and impaired motor control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Given the huge repercussion of <italic>CDKL5</italic> mutations on brain functions, most studies have so far focused on the role of this kinase in neurons and very few pieces of information are yet available regarding its role in proliferating cells. Few data have suggested that CDKL5 is involved in cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, but the subcellular localization and the function of this kinase during the cell cycle are still missing.</p>
<p id="Par23">Here we present evidence that CDKL5 contributes to faithful cell division. Indeed, we found that the acute ablation of CDKL5 leads to multipolar spindle formation and cytokinesis failure in HeLa and in MRC-5 cells. The increase in the duration of prometaphase and the presence of micronucleated cells suggest that chromosome segregation occurs with reduced fidelity in these cells and that genome instability might be linked to CDKL5 dysfunctions. Therefore, it might be relevant to investigate further genome stability in <italic>Cdkl5</italic>-null or defective backgrounds.</p>
<p id="Par24">In accordance with a role of CDKL5 in cell division, we observed that its subcellular localization is highly dynamic throughout mitosis and cytokinesis. Indeed, we found an accumulation of CDKL5 at the centrosome from prophase to anaphase and at the midbody in cytokinesis. Among the various midbody factors that we analyzed, only HIPK2 was absent from the midbody in CDKL5 depleted cells. The concomitant reduction of phosphorylated H2B at the midbody and the capacity of the phospho-mimetic H2B-S14D to rescue multipolarity in CDKL5 deficient cells suggest a causative link between the midbody defects and the aberrant mitotic spindles. This is reinforced by the increased number of centrosomes that appear to arise through accumulation rather than through centrosome duplication defects and by the observation that multipolarity appears to be strictly associated with polyploidy after CDKL5 depletion in the diploid MRC-5 cells (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3d and e</xref>). Even if further studies are warranted to explore the precise mechanism through which CDKL5 depletion leads to the midbody deprivation of HIPK2, our results highlight a novel function of CDKL5 in cytokinesis through the regulation of HIPK2/H2B at the midbody.</p>
<p id="Par25">At this point, we cannot ruled out that CDKL5 has additional roles in early mitotic stages (prometaphase and metaphase). Indeed, the longer prometaphase time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a,b</xref>) and the higher frequency of chromosome bridges and micronuclei compared to the reduced number of binucleated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>) that we observed in siCDKL5 cells suggest that CDKL5 depletion might also induce defects in chromosome alignment and/or segregation. Such defects cannot only be linked to midbody alterations.</p>
<p id="Par26">Conversely, we do not observe any apparent structural centrosome defects in CDKL5 deficient cells. However, this does not preclude the existence of centrosome-associated CDKL5 functions that may emerge from further studies. Interestingly, it is to note that the large group of proteins that have been functionally linked to the centrosome includes MeCP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, the main cause of Rett syndrome and an interactor and <italic>in vitro</italic> substrate of CDKL5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Whether a cross-talk between CDKL5 and MeCP2 exists at the centrosome still remains to be understood. Of note, the reduced MT nucleation capacity of centrosomes in MeCP2 deficient cells, but not in cells silenced for CDKL5, indicate that the two proteins have at least some separate functions in this organelle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par27">Previous loss- and gain-of-function studies in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells suggested that CDKL5 inhibits cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In agreement, in the developing mouse brain, genetic inactivation of <italic>Cdkl5</italic> increases BrdU and Ki67 positivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Even if we observed an increased positivity for phosphorylated H3-S10 in our CDKL5-depleted cells, we did not find any increase in cell proliferation (data not shown), suggesting that the phospho-H3 positivity might be due to a prolonged cell division time. Our results, showing a role of CDKL5 in cell division, suggest that the influence of CDKL5 on cell proliferation might be linked to its effects on genome stability. This would be in agreement with the observation made in neuroblastoma patients, in which high expression of CDKL5 correlates with an increased overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, the action of CDKL5 in tumorigenicity is definitively more complex since, at variance with neuroblastomas, in glioblastomas, CDKL5 was shown to be required for tumor cell survival and increased CDKL5 expression was found to be associated with reduced overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Future studies will be essential to investigate the role of CDKL5 in tumorigenesis.</p>
<p id="Par28">Although defects in CDKL5 have mainly been associated with a neurological disease we consider likely that its influence on cell cycle progression may be of relevance also in the pathology. In fact, it is well known that the precise control of the cell cycle critically regulates neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and defects in neuronal progenitor proliferation and differentiation seem to be a convergence point in many neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Of interest, defects in centrosomal proteins are known to impinge on neuronal migration and axon formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We thus speculate that the defects in radial neuronal migration and axon specification that have previously been associated with CDKL5 knock-down may be linked to a function of CDKL5 at this organelle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Altogether, a further understanding of the precise role of CDKL5 in cell cycle progression and at the centrosome might be relevant to recognize the origin of some features of the human pathology associated with CDKL5.</p>

<title>Midbody purification</title>
<p id="Par41">HeLa cells were enriched in telophase by treatment with nocodazole (100 ng/ml) for 4 h followed by mitotic shake-off. Nocodazole was washed out and the collected cells incubated for 80 min to reach telophase. Midbodies were isolated as described by Kuriyama <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and extracted in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% NP40, 5 mM EDTA) supplemented with protease- (Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase-inhibitors (Roche, Diagnostiics). Total cell extracts (TCE) from asynchronous and telophase enriched cells were analyzed in parallel.</p>
