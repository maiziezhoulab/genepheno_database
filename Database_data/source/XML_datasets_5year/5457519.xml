<abstract>
<p>Although lysyl oxidase-like 1 (<italic>LOXL1</italic>) is known as the principal genetic risk factor for pseudoexfoliation (PEX) syndrome, a major cause of glaucoma and cardiovascular complications, no functional variants have been identified to date. Here, we conduct a genome-wide association scan on 771 German PEX patients and 1,350 controls, followed by independent testing of associated variants in Italian and Japanese data sets. We focus on a 3.5-kb four-component polymorphic locus positioned spanning introns 1 and 2 of <italic>LOXL1</italic> with enhancer-like chromatin features. We find that the rs11638944:C&gt;G transversion exerts a <italic>cis</italic>-acting effect on the expression levels of <italic>LOXL1</italic>, mediated by differential binding of the transcription factor RXRα (retinoid X receptor alpha) and by modulating alternative splicing of <italic>LOXL1</italic>, eventually leading to reduced levels of <italic>LOXL1</italic> mRNA in cells and tissues of risk allele carriers. These findings uncover a functional mechanism by which common noncoding variants influence <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression.</p>

<body>
<p>Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. It represents a neurodegenerative disease complex comprising heterogeneous subtypes that share a common pathogenic pathway, that is, progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve axons resulting in visual field defects. Within this multifarious disease spectrum, pseudoexfoliation (PEX) glaucoma is considered a frequent and progressive subtype accounting for 25–70% of open-angle glaucoma and involving a high risk of blindness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. It is thought to be caused by the obstruction of the aqueous humour outflow pathways because of the deposition of extracellular protein aggregates leading to intraocular pressure elevation and subsequent glaucomatous optic nerve damage. This abnormally produced material appears in the course of a common age-related, generalized disorder of the extracellular matrix termed PEX syndrome, which affects up to 30% of the elderly population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Based on the systemic nature of the underlying connective tissue disorder, PEX syndrome has been associated not only with glaucoma but also with cardiovascular diseases including cardiomyopathy and abdominal aortic aneurysms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the incidence of PEX syndrome is clearly influenced by environmental factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, there is a strong genetic component to the disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. A genome-wide association study in Scandinavian populations identified lysyl oxidase-like 1 (<italic>LOXL1</italic>) on chromosome 15q24.1 as a principal genetic risk factor for PEX syndrome/glaucoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, a finding that has been replicated in multiple populations worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Two common non-synonymous protein-coding variants in exon 1, rs1048661G&gt;T (Arg141Leu) and rs3825942G&gt;A (Gly153Asp), and one intronic variant (rs2165241T&gt;C), conferring a 20-fold increased risk for PEX, were initially considered as the causal variants in this susceptibility locus. However, risk alleles were reversed between Caucasians and other ethnic populations, that is, Asian and black South African populations, and—although a biological effect on LOXL1 protein processing was suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>—the exact functional roles of these missense variants in the pathogenesis of PEX have not yet been ascertained<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. ‘Flipping' of risk alleles and lack of compelling evidence for their functionality prompted further search and led to identification of additional PEX-associated risk variants, rs16958477 and rs12914489, in the <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Recently, Hauser and colleagues identified PEX-associated variants at the exon 1–intron 1 boundary of <italic>LOXL1</italic> in black South African, US Caucasian, German and Japanese patients, which were suggested to modulate the expression of <italic>LOXL1</italic> antisense RNA 1 (<italic>LOXL1</italic>-AS1), a long non-coding RNA of <italic>LOXL</italic>1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). However, these variants had no effect on <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression which is known to be markedly dysregulated in tissues of PEX patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Collectively, a substantial gap remains between the numerous reports on PEX-associated sequence variants and our understanding of how these variants contribute to disease.</p>
<p><italic>LOXL1</italic> encodes a member of the lysyl oxidase family of enzymes (LOX, LOXL 1 to 4), which catalyses the generation of lysine-derived cross-links in extracellular matrix molecules such as collagen and elastin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The currently best known function of LOXL1 is cross-linking of tropoelastin monomers into elastin polymers during the formation and maintenance of elastic fibres<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Current evidence supports a fundamental role for both LOX and LOXL1 in connective tissue homeostasis and stability. Their dysregulated expression has been linked to both fibrotic and elastotic-degenerative connective tissue disorders including lung emphysema, aneurysms, and pelvic organ prolapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Dysregulated expression of <italic>LOXL1</italic> also appears to play a key role in PEX pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Notably, reduced expression of LOXL1 in elastin-rich, load-bearing tissues such as the lamina cribrosa has been suggested as a major susceptibility factor for PEX glaucoma because of the accompanying elastotic and biomechanical tissue alterations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, and may be also a predisposing factor for cardiovascular complications including aortic aneurysms in PEX patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Thus, deciphering the mechanisms of <italic>LOXL1</italic> regulation is vital to understanding the aetiology of PEX syndrome and its potentially sight- and life-threatening complications.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests that intronic variants may have a role in common disease susceptibility by influencing transcriptional output of gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The aim of this study was to identify potential regulatory variants in the <italic>LOXL1</italic> locus and functionally characterize their impact on <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression regulation. On the basis of a genome-wide association study in a German cohort of PEX patients we select a cluster of 14 common SNPs within introns 1 and 2 of <italic>LOXL1</italic> in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with known variants, and confirm their association with PEX in European and Asian populations. Using models of disease-relevant cell types, we provide experimental evidence for a functional PEX-associated variant, rs11638944:C&gt;G. Located in a genomic region with regulatory potential downstream of the canonical <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter, this variant exerts allele-specific effects on <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression through differential transcription factor binding and alternative pre-mRNA splicing in a cell type-specific manner. Here, we show that increased transcriptional activity at the risk sequence is associated with reduced binding of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) and with enhanced alternative splicing coupled with nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), which altogether reduces the levels of <italic>LOXL1</italic> mRNA in cells and tissues of risk allele carriers, underlining a functional link between <italic>LOXL1</italic> genetic variation and regulation of <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression.</p>

<title>Selection of <italic>LOXL1</italic> candidate variants</title>
<p>To capture potentially functional regulatory variants in the <italic>LOXL1</italic> gene locus, we first performed a genome wide association study using DNA samples from a German cohort of patients with PEX syndrome/glaucoma (<italic>n</italic>=771) and healthy subjects (<italic>n</italic>=1,350). As expected, we detected multiple SNPs in high LD at the <italic>LOXL1</italic> locus on chromosome 15 showing strong evidence for association with PEX, with rs2028386 as example for main association signal (<italic>P</italic>=7.62E−22, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Within this locus spanning ∼19 kb around exon 1, intron 1, exon 2 and intron 2 of the <italic>LOXL1</italic> gene (chr15:74,218,178–74,237,946, GRCh37/hg19), a total of 46 SNPs showed genome wide significant association (<italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−8</sup>) with PEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). These 46 SNPs include the two non-synonymous variants rs1048661 (p.(Arg141Leu)) and rs3825942 (p.(Gly153Glu)) and the intronic variant rs2165241 identified in the original publication by Thorleifsson <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></p>
<p>Out of the 46 SNPs, we focused on a cluster of 14 SNPs showing the most significant <italic>P</italic>-values (<italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These 14 SNPs include the known intronic index SNP rs2165241 and are distributed throughout intron 1 and the start of intron 2 of <italic>LOXL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, according to the UCSC genome database, some of these SNPs are positioned within putative regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), suggesting that the functional risk variants may reside within this block. Haplotype analysis including the two index non-synonymous SNPs confirmed that they are located on the same risk haplotype (previously defined by the two non-synonymous and the intronic index SNPs), which is also the more frequent one (ca. 73%) in the German population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of the same <italic>LOXL1</italic> region in an Italian cohort (421 cases and 1,505 controls) confirmed significant association for these 14 SNPs with PEX syndrome/glaucoma (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Allelic prevalence of the PEX-associated risk alleles was about 80% in cases and about 40% in controls. In addition, all 14 SNPs were significantly associated with PEX syndrome/glaucoma in a Japanese cohort (1,484 cases and 1,188 controls), although risk alleles were completely reversed between the two European and Japanese populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). However, in all three cohorts analysed, the 14 selected variants are located within the most frequent haplotype representing the risk haplotype in each specific population as exemplified for the German and Italian cohorts (haplotype 4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Conditional analysis to test for independent association between the selected SNPs and the two non-synonymous index SNPs, rs3825942 and rs1048661, revealed no independent association signal among the 14 SNPs in German and Italian cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Correlation of SNPs with LOXL1 tissue expression levels</title>
<p>First, we assessed whether the 14 SNP risk haplotype correlated with tissue expression levels of LOXL1. DNA samples of various post-mortem ocular tissues isolated from 52 individuals with manifest PEX syndrome/glaucoma and 51 individuals without PEX were used for genotyping the 14 intronic SNPs (together with the two non-synonymous SNPs rs1048661 and rs3825942), while mRNA expression levels of <italic>LOXL1</italic> were analysed by quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR. All 103 samples were stratified by their genotypes (risk, non-risk, heterozygous). The 14 SNP risk haplotype (14sR: GTTCTCGCGTAGCG) in the homozygous state was overrepresented (64.7%) in ocular tissue samples derived from PEX patients compared with those (21.2%) obtained from normal donors without PEX, whereas the non-risk haplotype (14sN: ACCGCAAGCCGCTA) was clearly underrepresented in PEX samples (5.8%) compared with control samples (27.6%); heterozygous allele combinations were present in 29.4% of PEX and in 51.1% of control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The presence of the 14 SNP risk haplotype was invariably associated with the presence of the risk haplotype GG of rs1048661 and rs3825942 (haplotype 4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), whereas the 14 SNP non-risk haplotype was associated with haplotypes TG and GA (haplotypes 1 and 5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) of the two non-synonymous variants.</p>
<p>Tissue expression levels of <italic>LOXL1</italic> were found to correlate with the 14 SNP haplotype, with significantly reduced expression levels (−40 to 50%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) in homozygous risk allele carriers compared to non-risk allele carriers throughout all ocular tissues examined, including iris (<italic>n</italic>=103), ciliary body (<italic>n</italic>=103) and lamina cribrosa (<italic>n</italic>=30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b–d</xref>). Reduced-expression levels of LOXL1 (−30%; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), indicated by a specific band at 52 kDa corresponding to a processed form of LOXL1, could be also confirmed at the protein level for homozygous carriers of the risk variants (<italic>n</italic>=6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).

<title>Determination of disease-relevant tissues and cell types</title>
<p>To analyse the impact of candidate SNPs on transcriptional activity of <italic>LOXL1</italic>, we aimed to determine appropriate disease-relevant cell types, in which the SNPs could exert their regulatory effects. For that purpose, we compared mRNA expression levels of <italic>LOXL1</italic> in intra- and extraocular tissues in different subsets of donors with manifest PEX syndrome and age-matched control subjects carrying the 14 SNP risk and protective haplotypes, respectively. Using qRT-PCR, we observed significantly lower (30–60%) expression levels of <italic>LOXL1</italic> in all tissues of the anterior eye segment, that is, Tenon's capsule (<italic>n</italic>=5), cornea (<italic>n</italic>=6), trabecular meshwork (<italic>n</italic>=17), iris (<italic>n</italic>=32) and ciliary body (<italic>n</italic>=32) (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). In posterior segment tissues, reduced expression levels of <italic>LOXL1</italic> were confined to the lamina cribrosa (<italic>n</italic>=20) of PEX eyes, whereas retina, choroid and sclera samples (<italic>n</italic>=20 each) showed no differential expression levels between PEX and control subjects. In addition, aortic wall specimens (<italic>n</italic>=5) derived from PEX patients showed also significantly reduced expression levels of <italic>LOXL1</italic> compared with control specimens (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). These differential expression patterns, which might be explained by tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms, are consistent with previous observations of dysregulated tissue expression of LOXL1 as a hallmark of PEX disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. For functional validation of putative regulatory variants in <italic>LOXL1</italic>, we therefore selected human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts (hTCF), corneolimbal epithelial cells (hLEPC), trabecular meshwork cells (hTMC), nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells (hNPEC), optic nerve head astrocytes (hONHA) and aortic smooth muscle cells (hASMC) as disease-relevant and 3T3 fibroblasts and HEK293T cells as unrelated cellular models.</p>

<title>Effect of SNPs on <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter activity <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To analyse the allele-specific effects of candidate SNPs on transcriptional activity of the human <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter, 738 bp fragments were constructed containing the haplotypes of all 14 risk (14sR) and non-risk alleles (14sN) and cloned into pGL4.10 luciferase reporter plasmids upstream of a <italic>LOXL1</italic> minimal promoter (nucleotides −1,438/+1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Haplotype-specific reporter constructs were transiently transfected into all cell types used. Dual luciferase reporter assays showed a significantly lower reporter activity (35–45%; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) for the 14sR haplotype constructs compared with the 14sN constructs in hTCF, hTMC, hNPEC, hONHA and hASMC, but no effect on <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter activity in hLEPC, HEK293T cells and 3T3 fibroblasts indicating a cell-type specificity of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Further transfections comparing <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter activity in hTCF derived from different donors (age&lt;20 years vs. age&gt;65 years, presence vs. absence of PEX, German vs. Japanese origin) did not show any statistically significant differences in the decrease of reporter activity by the 14sR/N constructs between subgroups precluding any modulating effect of age, ethnicity or PEX disease in this cell model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, several deletion constructs of pGL4.10-LOXL1-14sR/N were transfected into hTCF showing that the reduction in <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter activity (41%; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) was achieved by constructs (14sR11–14) including the risk haplotype of the distal four SNPs 11–14. In contrast, constructs including SNPs 1–5 (14sR1–5) or SNPs 6–10 (14sR6–10) failed to differentially affect <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter activity in hTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,c</xref>). Control transfections with empty basic pGL4.10 vector and basal <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter construct showed only little background luciferase activity and no obvious enhancer activity over core promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Thus, haplotype constructs served as useful indicator of a potential regulatory region including SNPs 11–14 of <italic>LOXL1</italic>.</p>
<p>To ultimately assess a difference in transcriptional activities between individual SNPs included within the effective pGL4.10-LOXL1-14sR/N11-14 constructs, we generated eight distinct reporter plasmids containing each of the four risk or non-risk alleles of SNPs 11–14 in their unaltered genomic context and transiently transfected them into various cell types. Statistically significant allele-dependent effects on reporter activity were observed for SNP 12 and SNP 14 in a cell type-specific manner in hTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), hASMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>), hTMC, hNPEC and hONHA but not in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>). However, in contrast to the haplotype constructs, the risk alleles increased transcriptional activity compared to non-risk alleles (SNP 12: 35–75%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.005; SNP 14: 25–45%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), and the risk sequence of SNP 12 even enhanced transcription up to 120% (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.005) from minimal core promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). From these findings, which we believe to reflect the true function of these variants in their genomic context better than the engineered haplotypic combinations, we conclude that the risk allele of SNP 12 located at the end of intron 1 of <italic>LOXL1</italic> has enhancer-like function increasing transcriptional activity compared to non-risk alleles in disease-relevant cell types.</p>

<title>Effect of SNPs on <italic>LOXL1</italic> transcriptional activity <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Since reporter-based assays fail to account for the native chromatin context of the regulatory region, we analysed allele-specific effects of intronic SNPs 11–14 on <italic>LOXL1</italic> transcriptional activity in heterozygous cell lines by allelic expression imbalance assay, which is considered a robust <italic>in vivo</italic> measure of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants. To discriminate between the two alleles, we used a highly sensitive Taqman SNP Genotyping Assay available for SNP 13 (rs12441130:T&gt;C) serving as a marker SNP for cDNA generated from pre-mRNA transcribed from each chromosomal allele and genomic DNA from the same samples as a control. Pre-mRNA analysis from hTCF (<italic>n</italic>=15) heterozygous at all four SNPs 11–14 showed distinct allelic imbalance compared to genomic DNA with an allelic shift towards the risk allele C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The relative abundance of the risk allele C was threefold increased over that of the non-risk allele T (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>These changes in relative allelic rates of transcription could be confirmed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-ChIP, which was performed with cross-linked chromatin from heterozygous hTCF (<italic>n</italic>=2) using antibodies against Pol II, histone H3 and acetylated histone H3K26Ac (positive controls), and non-immune rabbit IgG (negative control), and allele-specific Taqman SNP Genotyping Assay for rs12441130 (SNP 13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Almost twofold increased relative amounts of DNA containing the risk alleles were precipitated with the Pol II antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>), suggesting that the transcriptional activity at the risk sequence is increased over that of the non-risk sequence. Antibodies against histone H3 did not show any difference between both alleles. Fidelity of the ChIP assay was confirmed by PCR of immunoprecipitated complexes and by qPCR showing sixfold enrichment of Pol II over IgG control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the risk haplotype correlated with reduced total <italic>LOXL1</italic> mRNA expression levels in post-mortem tissue samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b–d</xref>), as a next step we examined whether increased transcriptional activity at the risk sequence is associated with post-transcriptional regulation of steady-state gene expression levels by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. ENSEMBL database indicated the presence of an alternative transcript (<italic>LOXL1</italic>-002: ENST00000566011; Havana project, version 1: transcript OTTHUMT00000419872.1), which is characterized by selective inclusion of an additional exon (E1A) between exon 1 and exon 2 of the <italic>LOXL1</italic> gene introducing a premature termination codon in exon 2 via frameshift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). The premature termination codon is localized 100 nucleotides upstream of the exon 2–exon 3 junction thus fulfilling the requirements (&gt;50 nucleotides upstream of an exon/exon junction complex) for a NMD target<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Transcript levels of <italic>LOXL1-E1A</italic> were determined by qPCR using exon 1-specific forward and E1A-specific reverse primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>.2) and identity of qPCR fragments was confirmed by sequence analysis (Eurofins Genomics). Treatment of hTCF with the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin, which is known to selectively stabilize NMD transcripts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, increased the level of <italic>LOXL1-E1A</italic> fivefold (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), whereas levels of wild-type <italic>LOXL1</italic> mRNA were decreased fourfold (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). In contrast, levels of <italic>LOXL1-AS1</italic> were not significantly changed by puromycin. RT-PCR using primers spanning E1A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3.3</xref>) produced a prominent band for wild-type <italic>LOXL1</italic> at 147 bp and a weaker band for <italic>LOXL1-E1A</italic> at 331 bp after treatment with puromycin in hTCF cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Genotype–phenotype correlations showed that hTCF cell lines homozygous for the risk allele C of the marker SNP 13 express significantly higher constitutive levels of <italic>LOXL1-E1A</italic> (1.75-fold; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) and significantly lower levels of wild-type <italic>LOXL1</italic> mRNA (−1.65-fold; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) than cell lines homozygous for the protective allele T, whereas levels of <italic>LOXL1-AS1</italic> did not correlate with the genotype of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). To ultimately confirm that <italic>LOXL1-E1A</italic> is a direct target of NMD, we inhibited NMD through transient knockdown of UPF1 (Up Frame Shift Protein 1), a central component of the NMD pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, leading to a significant increase in <italic>LOXL1-E1A</italic> in hTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>).</p>
<p>From these experiments we conclude that alternative splicing of <italic>LOXL1</italic> pre-mRNA coupled with NMD is significantly influenced by the genotype of SNPs 11–14 located in close proximity to the splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Higher rates of NMD lead to reduced steady-state levels of <italic>LOXL1</italic> in risk allele carriers compared to non-risk allele carriers. This common mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> may explain downregulation of total <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression levels in cells and tissues of risk allele carriers despite of increased transcriptional activity at the risk sequence.</p>

<title>Effect of SNPs on transcription factor binding affinity</title>
<p>Since transcription factors have been found as primary mediators of sequence-specific regulation of gene expression in a context-dependent manner, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to determine allele-specific differences in transcription factor–DNA interactions. Using biotinylated 228–292 bp DNA fragments containing the risk and non-risk alleles of individual SNPs 11–14 and nuclear extracts from disease-relevant cell types (hTMC, hNPEC, hTCF), all probes yielded one or two specific shifted bands, which could be competitively inhibited by unlabelled oligonucleotides up to 100% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the shifted bands relative to the unshifted bands from 5 independent experiments revealed that the risk sequences of rs12905253 (SNP 11) and rs12441130 (SNP 13) showed greater binding affinity to nuclear proteins (35–57%; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) compared to the non-risk sequences. In contrast, the risk sequences of rs11638944 (SNP 12) and rs11631579 (SNP 14) showed lower binding efficiency (−25%) than the non-risk sequences. These allelic differences were statistically most significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.005) for SNP 12-containing probes, which also showed the greatest binding affinity to nuclear proteins of all probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). No allele-specific differences were observed with nuclear extracts from hLEPC, HEK293T and 3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>In silico</italic> analysis using rSNP-MAPPER software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> identified several putative transcription factor binding sites potentially affected by the sequence variant differences. Among sites with high predicted difference for an allelic effect on binding were: LXRα:RXRα, myogenin/NF-1, Roaz, ZID, NR2F1, NFκB, PPARα:RXRα and HNF-4α in the region of rs11638944 (SNP 12) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8A</xref>). Supershift assays using DNA probe S12R and antibodies against candidate transcription factors did not show any specific binding of antibodies against LXRα, myogenin, NF-1, Roaz, NR2F1, NFκBp50, NFκBp65 (RELA), PPARα, PPARγ and HNF-4α, whereas antibodies against RXRα (retinoid X receptor alpha) and ZID (zinc finger protein with interaction domain) disrupted the protein–DNA complexes in EMSA experiments and produced supershifted bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Because mRNA expression of lysyl oxidases is known to be regulated by retinoic acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, we further focused on the nuclear retinoic acid receptor RXRα, which mediates retinoic acid-induced gene activation. Comparison of risk and non-risk sequences of all four SNPs in supershift experiments with anti-RXRα antibody showed increased supershifted band densities for the risk sequences of SNP 11 and SNP 13 by 25–150%; differences were, however, statistically not significant. In contrast, binding affinity of RXRα antibody to the risk sequences of SNP 12 (−26%; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) and SNP 14 (−17%; NS) was decreased compared to the non-risk sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), although predicted binding scores were higher for the risk than for the non-risk sequences of SNP 12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>In view of this discrepancy, specific binding of both recombinant RXRα protein fragment containing the DNA-binding domain (in a concentration-dependent manner) and full-length RXRα protein was used as positive control and resulted in shifted bands corresponding to their respective molecular sizes, whereas recombinant RXRα fragment containing the ligand-binding domain was not effective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10A</xref>). A biotinylated control oligonucleotide containing a RXR consensus binding site was further used as positive control in EMSAs using hTCF, hTMC and hNPEC nuclear extracts and resulted in shifted bands which could be competitively inhibited by unlabelled probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10B</xref>). Moreover, RXRα binding to SNP 12 region <italic>in vivo</italic> was verified by RXRα-ChIP, which was performed with cross-linked chromatin from hTCF (<italic>n</italic>=2) using two different antibodies against RXRα, H3 (positive control) and non-immune IgG (negative control). Fidelity of the ChIP assay was confirmed by PCR of immunoprecipitated complexes and by qPCR showing fourfold enrichment of RXRα over IgG control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). Because a specific Taqman Genotyping Assay for SNP 12 was not commercially available to assess allele-specific differences in RXRα binding, we performed luciferase assays using both risk and non-risk genotypes of SNP 12 without or with co-transfection of RXRα-specific siRNA in hTCF. These experiments showed that the allele-specific differences in transcriptional activity were abolished by knockdown of RXRα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>), providing additional evidence for an allele-specific binding of RXRα and a role for this transcription factor in <italic>LOXL1</italic> gene regulation.</p>
<p>RXRα was found to be expressed in nuclear fractions of all disease-relevant cell types including hTCF, hTMC, hNPEC and hASMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9c</xref>). siRNA-mediated knockdown of RXRα in hTCF resulted in a significant upregulation (40%; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.005) of <italic>LOXL1</italic> mRNA expression compared to mock-transfected control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9d</xref>). Stimulation with all <italic>trans</italic>-retinoic acid (2 μM for 24 h) significantly increased <italic>RXRα</italic> expression but reduced <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression in disease-relevant cell types, such as hTCF and hASMC, compared with non-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9e</xref>). These data provide direct evidence that RXRα influences <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression by functioning as a transcriptional repressor.</p>
<p>Sequence inspection of the DNA probes using rSNP-MAPPER software predicted binding motifs for RXRα:LXRα and RXRα:PPARα heterodimers in the region of SNP 12, which overlapped the SNP position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8B</xref>). However, antibodies against known heterodimeric partners for RXRα, that is, RARα, LXRα/β, PPARα/γ, VDR, TRα/β and ERα, did not result in supershifted bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>) suggesting either homodimeric RXRα binding or another not yet identified heterodimeric binding partner. Nevertheless, the present findings identified RXRα as candidate transcription factor showing significantly reduced binding to the risk sequence of rs11638944, which may be important for retinoic acid sensitivity of this regulatory region and for the suppressive effect of retinoic acid on <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Genetic and pathogenetic analyses have confirmed a highly significant and direct role for LOXL1 in the pathophysiology of PEX syndrome and its associated ocular and systemic complications. Dysregulated tissue expression of LOXL1 has been shown to be a hallmark of PEX syndrome, contributing to disease development and predisposing to ocular and systemic complications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Reduced tissue expression levels of LOXL1 have been related to pronounced structural elastotic and biomechanical alterations of elastin-rich connective tissues, such as the lamina cribrosa and blood vessel walls, thereby increasing the risk for pressure-induced optic nerve damage and cardiovascular complications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Accordingly, our group and others have described a significant association between PEX and systemic disorders of elastic tissues, that is, aortic aneurysms, coronary artery ectasia, renal artery stenosis and pelvic organ prolapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Changes in <italic>LOXL1</italic> gene expression have been observed in many other conditions, including aging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> and disorders involving weakening of elastic connective tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the discovery of <italic>LOXL1</italic> as the principal genetic risk factor for PEX dates back to 2007 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and has been subsequently replicated by multiple studies in various geographical populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, it is currently not known how associated variants contribute to disease. So far, no single causal variant has been identified. In fact, the precise analysis of the <italic>LOXL1</italic> locus is still at a rudimentary stage, and the translation of genetic findings into molecular mechanisms remains a hitherto unmet need and challenge. Here, we provide experimental evidence that a common risk variant, located in a genomic region of intron 1 of <italic>LOXL1</italic> with regulatory potential, exerts a <italic>cis</italic>-acting effect on <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression, mediated by differential transcription factor binding and differential alternative pre-mRNA splicing in a cell type-specific manner. We show that increased transcriptional activity at the risk sequence is associated with reduced binding of RXRα and with increased levels of an alternatively spliced <italic>LOXL1</italic> transcript sensitive to NMD, possibly by allele-specific interaction with splicing factors, and, seemingly contradictory, with decreased levels of normal <italic>LOXL1</italic> mRNA in cells and tissues of risk allele carriers.</p>
<p>However, significant inconsistencies in pre-mRNA and mRNA expression levels have been described for many genes and indicate a post-transcriptional mode of regulation frequently involving the NMD pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. The NMD pathway is a common translation-dependent mRNA degradation pathway that controls levels of alternatively spliced unproductive mRNA variants to regulate gene expression. In the case of constitutive unproductive splicing, which may be influenced by sequence variation close to splice sites, the combined effect of alternative splicing coupled to NMD reduces total message abundance by a more or less constant factor, which has been also observed in cells and tissues of risk allele carriers in the present study. Moreover, coupling of alternative splicing and NMD has been reported as a general mode of controlling gene expression in a dynamic, developmental stage- and cell type-specific manner, promoting cellular adaptation in response to a variety of cellular stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Preliminary data have shown that <italic>LOXL1-E1A</italic> activity is modulated by distinct forms of stressors and metabolites, including oxidative stress, to regulate <italic>LOXL1</italic> gene expression. Thus, we have identified allele-specific effects on <italic>LOXL1</italic> gene regulation at the transcriptional (RXRα binding), co-transcriptional (pre-mRNA splicing) and post-transcriptional (mRNA decay) level, together resulting in a downregulation (40–50%) of <italic>LOXL1</italic> gene expression levels in cells and tissues of risk allele carriers. The findings are further supported by known functions of RXRα generally behaving as constitutive repressor of transcription in the absence of ligand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> through interaction with a diverse repertoire of canonical and non-canonical binding elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.</p>
<p>Although high LD in the region makes it difficult to distinguish the polymorphism(s) driving the causal association, rs11638944:C&gt;G (SNP 12) showed most significant enhancer-like activities and allelic effects on transcription factor binding, suggesting that rs11638944 functions as primary <italic>cis</italic>-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of <italic>LOXL1</italic>. The SNP is located in a region of intron 1 with enhancer-like chromatin features, such as specific histone modifications marking active enhancers (H3K27Ac), DNase I hypersensitivity sites and transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8A</xref>), which are compatible with predictions of functional regulatory elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Further confirmation arises from eQTL data sets, such as the BROAD Institute's GTEx portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.gtexportal.org/</ext-link>), revealing a significant eQTL for this SNP in pituitary tissue. These findings are also in line with current concepts of regulatory variants affecting gene expression as major contributors to common disease risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Disease-associated variants in noncoding regions, particularly those that map to enhancer elements specific to disease-relevant cell types, have been estimated to explain a greater proportion of the heritability for some disorders than variants in coding regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.</p>
<p>There are, however, some limitations of the study.
<list id="l1" list-type="order"><list-item><p>The PEX-associated risk alleles were identical in two European populations, but completely reversed in Japanese populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), which seems to be a principle for all <italic>LOXL1</italic> variants identified so far<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Allelic reversal in Japanese patients may be explained by allelic heterogeneity, the existence of different SNPs tagging the same not yet identified causal variant in all populations, or multi-locus effects implying a change in LD pattern between the two markers in two populations of different ancestry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. Such flip–flop associations, probably caused by multi-locus effects, have already been reported for other complex diseases including Alzheimer's disease and autism as well as obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. SNP function may be also context-dependent and the cause of the disparity between European and Japanese populations may be related to a combination of genetic architecture and environmental risk factors causing a similar phenotype. Although this enigma cannot be solved by the present study, potential regulatory differences at the DNA level as well as potential differences in <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression quantitative phenotypes and their relation to variations in PEX prevalence between European and Japanese populations will be the subject of future studies.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Other potential mechanisms that are critical to regulation of gene expression and may be modulated by genetic variation, such as epigenetic modifications, disruption of chromatin interactions, action of noncoding RNAs, and mRNA processing and stability have not been investigated in this analysis. DNA hypermethylation of the <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter has been shown to occur in PEX patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and reported to downregulate <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression in skin fibroblasts in a case with cutis laxa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and in human bladder cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. A functional SNP, rs45008784A&gt;C, in the promoter region of <italic>LOXL1</italic> impacting gene expression has been identified, but was not associated with disease (pelvic organ prolapse) and did not reveal any differential transcription factor binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> have identified a region of peak association at the <italic>LOXL1</italic> exon 1–intron 1 junction, which contains a promoter of a long non-coding antisense RNA, <italic>LOXL1-AS1</italic>, which is modulated by a haplotype of three functional risk variants associated with PEX in a South African population. However, this region does not enhance <italic>LOXL1</italic> promoter activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and has not been functionally linked to PEX pathophysiology <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the authors suggested that dysregulated expression of <italic>LOXL1-AS1</italic> plays a role in PEX pathogenesis, particularly in cellular response to stresses.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Despite the limitations mentioned above, we were able to establish a functional link between <italic>LOXL1</italic> genetic variation and regulation of the expression of <italic>LOXL1</italic> through identification of an eQTL in intron 1 explaining part of the genetic variance of the <italic>LOXL1</italic> expression phenotype. The present findings also highlight the importance of context-specificity in resolving the mechanisms of action of regulatory variants. We further suggest molecular mechanisms by which sequence variation modulates transcriptional output on two levels of gene expression regulation, that is, differential transcription factor binding and alternative pre-mRNA splicing, and identified the transcription factor RXRα and regulated coupling of alternative splicing and NMD as a mechanism involved in <italic>LOXL1</italic> gene regulation; their precise functional roles and mechanisms of action will be scrutinized in future studies. Since we were not able to untangle the flipped allele phenomenon observed between Caucasian and Asian populations, targeted resequencing of the risk haplotype in both populations and further context-specific research is required to determine how <italic>LOXL1</italic> variants actually contribute to PEX pathophysiology. Ultimately, the functional translation of genetic information to the tissue level and a detailed understanding of <italic>LOXL1</italic> gene regulation will guide improved risk prediction and future treatment strategies for a common disease and its potentially sight- and life-threatening complications.</p>

<p>This study utilized three case–control data sets from two European (German, Italian) and one Asian (Japanese) cohort. Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of the Medical Facultiy of the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg (Germany), the Medical Faculty of the University of Siena (Italy), the Monfalcone Hospital (Italy), Hayashi Eye Hospital (Fukuoka), Mizoguchi Eye Hospital (Nagasaki), Oita University Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Ideta Eye Hospital (Kumamoto), the Sing Health Centralised Institutional Review Board Singapore as well as three sites in Miyazaki, that is, Shinjo Eye Clinic, Miyata Eye Hospital and Ozaki Eye Hospital. All participants had given written informed consent, and investigations were performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients with PEX syndrome showed manifest PEX material deposits on anterior segment structures in mydriasis on slitlamp biomicroscopy. Secondary open-angle glaucoma due to PEX was defined, if elevated intraocular pressure, characteristic visual field defects and characteristic optic disc atrophy were observed in the presence of an open chamber angle and typical PEX deposits.

<p>To investigate the association between PEX and SNPs in chromosomal region [chr15: 74,218,178-74,237,946 (hg19)] encompassing exon 1, intron 1, exon 2 and part of intron 2 of <italic>LOXL1</italic> (19 kb), we used SNP array-derived data (Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0) of 771 German patients with PEX (PEX syndrome: 309; PEX glaucoma: 462) and 1,350 healthy individuals from a population-based control cohort (KORA). These patients and controls formed the discovery part of our study. To replicate association results of selected SNPs, we used SNP array-derived data (Illumina OMNI Chip) of 473 Italian PEX patients (421 with age and gender information) and 1,545 healthy individuals (1,505 with age and gender information) from an Italian population-based control cohort (Hypergene) as well as 1,484 Japanese PEX patients and 1,188 healthy individuals from a Japanese population-based control cohort.</p>

<title>Genotyping and association analysis</title>
<p>Genotyping of German patients and control subjects was performed on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. Italian patients were genotyped on the Illumina OmniExpress Bead Array-12 v.1.1, Italian control subjects on the Illumina 1M Duo. Stringent quality checks for the German data set were performed on a per-SNP and per-sample basis, with removal of SNPs showing a genotyping success rate of &lt;95% or a minor allele frequency of &lt;1% as well as deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1 × 10<sup>−3</sup> for deviation). Samples were similarly checked, and those with a genotyping success rate of &lt;97% were removed. A principal component analysis performed with EIGENSTRAT version 3.0 had shown that German and Italian PEX cases and controls appeared to be well matched in terms of ancestry as well as in overall assessment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 12 and 13</xref>). Quality control criteria for Japanese and Italian data sets have been described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. Both German and Italian genotypes were imputed into the 1,000 genomes data set (March 2012 haplotypes) using IMPUTE2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>). Association analyses on the imputed data were performed with SNPTEST v2.5.2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>).</p>
<p>A logistic regression model using gender and age as covariates in German and Italian samples and the first six principal components of genetic stratification in Japanese as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref> was used to determine the per-allele, additive effect of the SNPs with a score-based, frequentist algorithm in SNPTEST2. By adding the dosages of rs3825942 and rs1048661 as additional covariates, we tested for independence of our 14 associated SNPs from the two SNPs (rs3825942 and rs1048661) of the original published locus.

To break up cross-links between proteins and DNA, probes, samples were sequentially incubated in 5 M NaCl and in 0.5 M EDTA, 1 M Tris and 40 μg Proteinase K. After phenol–chloroform extraction, the precipitated DNA was dissolved in Nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O. Samples were analysed by qPCR using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay for SNP 13.</p>

<title>Electrophoresis mobility (super)shift assays</title>
<p>A nuclear extraction kit (NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents, Thermo Scientific) was used to prepare cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from primary hTCF, hTMC, hNPEC, hLEPC, hASMC, HEK293T and 3T3 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p>Biotinylated DNA probes were amplified by PCR using 5′-biotinylated 20–23 bp primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3.3</xref>) (Eurofins Genomics) using tissue samples from genotyped individuals homozygous for the risk and non-risk haplotypes as templates. All binding reactions were carried out using the non-radioactive LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the binding reaction mixture (total volume 20 μl) containing 2 μl of nuclear extract (at a concentration of ∼2 μg μl<sup>−1</sup>) was pre-incubated with 50 ng μl<sup>−1</sup> of poly [d(I-C)] in binding buffer (10 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.0) on ice for 10 min. After addition of 20 fmol biotin-labeled target DNA, the binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. For competition experiments, a 200-fold molar excess (4 pmol) of unlabelled oligonucleotides were included in the pre-incubation mixture. Subsequently, all reactions were loaded onto a 4% (supershift) or 6% (EMSA) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and run for 1 h in 0.5 × TBE running buffer (45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3). After electrophoresis, complexes were transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane, ultraviolet crosslinked at 120 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup>, probed with streptavidin-HRP conjugate and incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (ECL; Thermo Scientific). Gel shifts were quantitatively analysed with the LAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Düsseldorf, Germany) chemiluminescence detection system and software (Multi Gauge V1.1, Fujifilm).</p>
<p>For supershift assays, 1 μg of antibodies against NFκB p50 (sc-7178X), NFκB p65 (sc-7151X), PPARα (sc-9000X), PPARγ (sc-7196X), NR2F1 (sc-6575X), HNF-4α (sc-8987X), myogenin (sc-13137X), ROAZ (sc-514748X), NF1 (sc-74445), RXRα (sc-46659X), RXRβ (sc-742X), RXRγ (sc-365252 X), RARα (sc-551X), LXRα-β (sc-13068X), VDR (sc-9164), TRα-β (sc-772X) and ERα (sc-8005X), all purchased from Santa Cruz, and against ZID/ZBTB6 (ab67628) purchased from Abcam was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to addition of the biotinylated probe.</p>
<p>Recombinant proteins of full-length human RXRα (TP310311, OriGene, Rockville, MD), DNA-binding domain (aa 11-228; pro-437, Prospec, Rehovot, Israel) and ligand-binding domain (aa 198–462; 31135, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) of RXRα as well as a RXR consensus oligonucleotide (sc-2547, Santa Cruz) were used as positive controls.</p>
