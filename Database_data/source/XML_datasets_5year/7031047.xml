<p id="P3">Increased production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate the severity of sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. BCL11A represses the genes encoding HbF and regulates human hemoglobin switching through variation in its expression during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying the developmental expression of BCL11A remain mysterious. Here we show that BCL11A is regulated at the level of mRNA translation during human hematopoietic development. Despite decreased BCL11A protein synthesis earlier in development, <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA continues to be associated with ribosomes. Through unbiased genomic and proteomic analyses, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding protein LIN28B, which is developmentally expressed in a reciprocal pattern to BCL11A, directly interacts with ribosomes and <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA. Furthermore, we show that <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA translation is suppressed by LIN28B through direct interactions, independent of its role in regulating let-7 microRNAs, and BCL11A is the major target of LIN28B-mediated HbF induction. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism underlying human hemoglobin switching that illuminates new therapeutic opportunities.</p>

<body>
<p id="P4">The developmental switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin in humans has been extensively studied and is of substantial interest for developing approaches to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) to treat sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Through functional and genetic follow up of genome-wide association studies for HbF levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, BCL11A has been identified as a key regulator of both developmental hemoglobin switching and silencing of HbF in the adult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. BCL11A protein levels are developmentally regulated in humans such that, at the earlier developmental stages when HbF is highly expressed in erythroid cells, there is little or no BCL11A protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In contrast, BCL11A protein is robustly expressed in adult erythroid cells that have low levels of HbF expression. Despite extensive studies, the basis of this developmental regulation of BCL11A protein expression and thereby the upstream regulators of human hemoglobin switching remain undefined.</p>
<p id="P5">Consistent with earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, we found that BCL11A protein showed a gradient in expression across fetal, newborn, and adult erythroid cells at all stages of maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">d</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">h</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">i</xref>). Surprisingly, there was no substantial change in <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA expression between fetal, newborn, or adult erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">e</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">g</xref>), suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism underlying the observed variation in protein expression. This difference in protein levels between the developmental stages could not be attributed to variation in the maturation state of cells or to differences in <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">One possible post-transcriptional mechanism underlying the observed variation in protein expression could involve BCL11A protein being more readily degraded at the earlier developmental stages, as compared with adult erythroid cells. Since newborn erythroid cells had some, albeit lower, expression of BCL11A protein, we could directly compare the rates of protein degradation by arresting protein synthesis with cycloheximide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. No difference was observed in BCL11A protein degradation between newborn or adult erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">d</xref>). Thus, alteration in protein synthesis appeared to be a more likely mechanism to account for the variation in BCL11A protein levels. To directly measure protein synthesis rates, we metabolically labeled newly synthesized proteins with the methionine analog L-azidohomoalanine (L-AHA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Newborn and adult erythroid cells showed similar global L-AHA incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). By immunoprecipitation, we also noted similar levels of L-AHA labeled GATA1 protein, a key erythroid transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In contrast, we observed a two-fold reduction in newly synthesized BCL11A levels in newborn vs. adult erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Importantly, our immunoprecipitation procedure was effective at capturing nearly all detectable BCL11A and GATA1 protein from cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">We reasoned that assessing translation by examining the distribution of <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA across polysomes might allow us to identify mechanisms for the observed variation in protein synthesis rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, we noted that <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA occupied actively translating ribosomes in polysome fractions with overlapping distributions in the newborn and adult erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). This finding demonstrates that, while BCL11A has a lower rate of overall protein synthesis in newborn erythroid cells, its mRNA was bound by multiple ribosomes. To more clearly define whether there may be altered ribosome occupancy at specific regions of <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA, we conducted ribosome profiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Consistent with our findings from polysome profiling, we found that the overall translational efficiency (TE) – a metric of the number of ribosomes bound across the entire mRNA normalized to total mRNA levels – was comparable in stage-matched newborn and adult proerythroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). However, specific regions of the <italic>BCL11A</italic> transcript showed reduced ribosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>, white arrows), while other regions showed more consistency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>). This variation in the pattern of ribosome occupancy may suggest ineffective ribosome elongation as a cause of reduced protein synthesis in newborn erythroid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Reduced translational elongation can be mediated through interactions of an mRNA with RNA-binding proteins, as is seen with the fragile X mental retardation protein, FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In an analogous manner, we reasoned that an RNA binding protein expressed in erythroid cells at the earlier developmental stages might bind to the <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA and prevent its effective translation. In the case of FMRP, altered translation elongation is mediated through direct interactions with the ribosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. We therefore sought to identify ribosome-associated RNA-binding proteins in human erythroid cells that displayed appropriate developmental expression.</p>
<p id="P8">We conducted an unbiased survey of ribosome-interacting proteins in human erythroid cells through the use of the RNA antisense purification (RAP) method targeting the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cells (SILAC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, among the most enriched proteins in the 18S RAP experiment was the RNA binding protein LIN28B, which showed similar enrichment as ribosomal proteins known to interact with the 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">2</xref>). This finding was validated through LIN28B co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In cord blood-derived erythroid cells, a substantial fraction of LIN28B was localized to the cytoplasm and associated with translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Treatment of cell lysates with RNase A prior to polysome fractionation revealed some continued, albeit reduced, interactions of LIN28B with ribosomes, suggesting potential direct interactions beyond those that are RNA-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Importantly, LIN28B showed a gradient of expression across fetal liver, newborn, and adult erythroid cells for both its mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). LIN28B is an attractive upstream candidate regulator of BCL11A due to its documented role in binding numerous mRNAs and modulating their translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Despite these studies, LIN28B has not been previously appreciated as a ribosome-associated protein. Motivated by the observed differences in LIN28B expression between fetal and adult hematopoietic cells, a recent study suggested that LIN28B may promote the reprogramming of hematopoietic progenitors into a fetal-like state and may thereby elevate HbF levels, but no specific mechanisms for these activities were identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In addition, LIN28B has been shown to be a key regulator at the early stages of developmental hematopoiesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P10">We therefore tested whether the repression of <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA translation may be mediated by LIN28B. Initial experiments suggested that lentiviral-mediated LIN28B expression resulted in extremely high levels of LIN28B, far exceeding what was seen physiologically, which was also the case in a previous study and which may have confounded this prior analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. To obtain physiologically relevant LIN28B levels, we devised a strategy to sort cells based on expression of a GFP marker linked to the <italic>LIN28B</italic> cDNA transcript through an internal ribosomal entry site. By separating cells into GFP high and low expressing fractions, we were able to obtain differentiating hematopoietic progenitor cells that expressed LIN28B at levels comparable to what was observed in normal physiology at the earlier stages of human erythroid development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">b</xref>). While unregulated high-level LIN28B overexpression showed a reduction in <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA and a concomitant upregulation of γ-globin (encoded by <italic>HBG1/2</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">c</xref>), expression of LIN28B at physiologically relevant levels in adult erythroid cells resulted in a ~2-fold reduction in BCL11A protein levels without an appreciable change in its mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">d</xref>). Importantly, physiologically relevant expression of LIN28B was sufficient to robustly induce γ-globin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>) to a similar extent as higher-level expression and without perturbation of erythroid differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>h).</p>
<p id="P11">While these results show that LIN28B can suppress BCL11A protein synthesis, the underlying mechanisms were unclear, particularly given the pleiotropic functions of LIN28B. LIN28B can both negatively regulate the production of let-7 microRNAs and directly bind mRNAs with either a positive or negative impact on their translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Most studies on the role of LIN28B in hematopoiesis have focused on its role in let-7 microRNA biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Our observation of a LIN28B-ribosome interaction in erythroid cells suggests that let-7 independent roles might be important in this context. To decipher the mechanisms of LIN28B-mediated BCL11A regulation, we initially explored whether the well-characterized let-7 microRNA pathway downstream of LIN28B may have a role in regulating human BCL11A expression and hemoglobin switching. Given that all let-7 family microRNAs harbor the same seed targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>), we introduced mimics of the let-7 microRNA, let7g, into cord blood-derived erythroid cells (where let-7 is absent or lowly expressed, while LIN28B is robustly expressed) and observed appropriate suppression of a known let-7 mRNA target, <italic>HMGA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, there was no change in BCL11A protein or γ-globin mRNA levels despite increased let-7 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">j</xref>). To bolster these findings, we introduced LIN28B into adult hematopoietic progenitors and differentiated the cells toward the erythroid lineage. Concomitant introduction of let-7 mimics successfully suppressed the LIN28B-mediated upregulation of <italic>HMGA2</italic> mRNA, but failed to suppress the LIN28B-mediated induction of γ-globin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">l</xref>). Together, these experiments show that the LIN28B-mediated suppression of BCL11A protein expression and concomitant HbF induction are independent of let-7 microRNA activity.</p>
<p id="P12">An alternative possibility is that LIN28B directly influences <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA translation through direct interactions, as previously described for other mRNA targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We therefore immunoprecipitated LIN28B from primary newborn erythroid cells after formaldehyde cross-linking and fractionation of the cells. We observed an enrichment of <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA relative to input, which was also seen for <italic>HMGA1</italic>, a known direct binding target of LIN28B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, but not for several non-target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). However, formaldehyde crosslinking cannot discriminate direct interactions from indirect RNA-protein binding events. To overcome this limitation, we applied ultraviolet cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) together with massively parallel sequencing to map endogenous LIN28B binding sites in newborn erythroid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We generated size-matched input libraries to calculate the enrichment of each peak over background. Using this approach, we identified 20,001 distinct binding sites of LIN28B that covered a total of 5,640 mRNAs in these cells at a 1% irreproducible discovery rate (IDR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). LIN28B-bound mRNAs showed a range of translational changes when comparing ribosome profiles from newborn and adult erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9f</xref>), consistent with prior studies that demonstrate disparate modes of regulation among LIN28 bound mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Notably, we identified a 139-bp LIN28B-binding site in the 3’ coding region of the <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This peak in <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA was among the top 1% of all of the observed binding peaks in the newborn erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). This region contained three instances of a previously reported LIN28B binding motif (GGAG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and overlapped with the coding sequence that is unique to the XL isoform of BCL11A, which is critical for HbF silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P13">To assess the functional importance of the LIN28B binding site on BCL11A, we disrupted all three GGAG motifs in the LIN28B binding site of <italic>BCL11A</italic> cDNA by synonymous base changes (G&gt;A), which resulted in an increase in BCL11A protein synthesis in the presence of LIN28B expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Importantly, further elevating LIN28B expression further suppressed protein production from the wild-type but not the triple GGAG motif-mutated form of BCL11A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). We have previously shown that the difference between mouse and human hemoglobin switching is mediated through alterations in BCL11A protein expression in definitive erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Crucially, the first GGAG motif (termed site 1 here) displays a synonymous change in the orthologous position in mouse and human <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, underlined). Strikingly, mutation of this single position from G&gt;A was sufficient to enable increased protein production of BCL11A in the presence of LIN28B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), suggesting that this distinct region of <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA underlies the developmental differences between mice and humans in BCL11A protein expression and hemoglobin switching.</p>
<p id="P14">While these results emphasize a major role for LIN28B in the regulation of BCL11A translation and human hemoglobin switching, we sought to assess the degree to which the suppression of <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA translation results in the observed HbF induction by LIN28B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). When we simultaneously expressed LIN28B and BCL11A in primary adult hematopoietic progenitors undergoing erythroid differentiation, γ-globin levels were reduced to nearly the extent that is seen at baseline conditions in these adult erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>). In addition, we examined the levels of various let-7 microRNAs and observed no significant change after increasing the expression of BCL11A in the setting of LIN28B transduction, reinforcing the independence of the observed translational regulation from the well-characterized functions of LIN28B in regulating let-7 family microRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Together, our results show that LIN28B is expressed in a developmental stage-specific manner during the ontogeny of human erythropoiesis, such that at earlier developmental stages LIN28B is able to directly bind <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA and prevent its effective translation. The absence of LIN28B expression in adult erythroid cells allows effective BCL11A protein synthesis and γ-globin expression is thereby suppressed. The observed graded translational inhibition of <italic>BCL11A</italic> mRNA by LIN28B thus promotes the gradual shift from fetal to adult hemoglobin expression during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Our findings provide important new insights into the upstream regulators of hemoglobin switching and suggest a simplified model for the regulation of this process. In addition, we show that alterations of the LIN28B regulatory axis by modulating an individual evolutionarily divergent interaction site are sufficient to confer species-divergent BCL11A protein expression and hemoglobin switching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, our study illuminates a key role for translational regulation of BCL11A in human development, beyond previously well-studied roles that depend upon the let-7 microRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. This finding is one of the first examples of a physiologic function of LIN28B that does not depend upon its regulation of let-7 microRNAs and that acts through alteration of translation of a distinct mRNA by direct interactions. It is likely that further studies may reveal additional targets that are regulated in a similar manner and that may impact other development processes. This newly uncovered translational regulatory mechanism or upstream regulators of LIN28B may represent unique targetable opportunities to induce HbF for the treatment of sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p id="P35">Co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) was carried out in the K562 cell line, which expresses LIN28B. Dynabeads were washed in PBS, supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 hour with LIN28B antibody (4196, Cell Signaling) and IgG (2729S, Cell Signaling) as control. Cells were lysed in RIPA (Millipore), supplemented with Protease inhibitors and 0.1 mM DTT. 5% was saved as input and the lysate was incubated with dynabeads-antibody at 4 °C for overnight. The beads-antibody-antigen complex was washed three times at 4 <sup>o</sup>C with RIPA, supplemented with 0.1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors. For RNase digestion, experimental conditions were adapted from published protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Briefly, the dynabeads-antibody complex was washed three times at 4 <sup>o</sup>C with RIPA containing RNAseA (Ambion). Samples were rocked at 25 <sup>o</sup>C for 10 minutes in between washes. The final wash was done with RIPA containing Superase In RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen), and rocked for 10 minutes at 25 <sup>o</sup>C, before eluting in RIPA added with 4x Laemmli buffer (BioRad) and protease inhibitors. Samples were directly loaded on to SDS-PAGE, and probed for protein distribution through western blots, as described above.</p>

<title>Lentiviral infections</title>
<p id="P36">HSPCs undergoing erythroid differentiation were transduced with control, LIN28B, or BCL11A lentiviral constructs on day 2 of differentiation. 293T cells for lentivirus production were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Approximately 24 hours before transfection, the 293T cells were seeded, without antibiotics, in 6-well plates. Cells were co-transfected with the packaging vectors pVSVG, pΔ8.9, and the lentiviral genomic vector of interest. The media was changed to base media on the day following transfection, and the viral supernatant was collected approximately 48 hours post-transfection, filtered with a 0.45-μm filter and used for infection of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. Where the virus needed to be concentrated, the 293T cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes, the viral supernatant was filtered and centrifuged at 24,000 rpm for 2 hours at 4 °C. 200,000–300,000 CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were infected in 6-well plates with 8 μg/mL polybrene (Millipore), and spun at 2,000 rpm for 1.5 hours at room temperature, and incubated in the viral supernatant overnight at 37 °C. Virus was washed off one day after infection, and infected cells were selected for by GFP or RFP expression driven by IRES-GFP or IRES-RFP in the HMD vector in the particular construct. GFP<sup>+</sup>, RFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup>RFP<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in a sterile manner and cultured for further analysis.</p>
