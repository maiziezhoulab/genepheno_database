<abstract>
<p>Optogenetics has provided a revolutionary approach to dissecting biological phenomena. However, the generation and use of optically active GPCRs in these contexts is limited and it is unclear how well an opsin-chimera GPCR might mimic endogenous receptor activity. Here we show that a chimeric rhodopsin/β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR) is similar in dynamics to endogenous β<sub>2</sub>AR in terms of: cAMP generation, MAP kinase activation and receptor internalization. In addition, we develop and characterize a novel toolset of optically active, functionally selective GPCRs that can bias intracellular signalling cascades towards either G-protein or arrestin-mediated cAMP and MAP kinase pathways. Finally, we show how photoactivation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR <italic>in vivo</italic> modulates neuronal activity and induces anxiety-like behavioural states in both fiber-tethered and wireless, freely moving animals when expressed in brain regions known to contain β<sub>2</sub>ARs. These new GPCR approaches enhance the utility of optogenetics and allow for discrete spatiotemporal control of GPCR signalling <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<body>
<p>Over the past decade, optogenetics and chemogenetics have made significant contributions to probing biological questions. Traditional optogenetic approaches however, utilize expression of depolarizing (channelrhodopsins)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and hyperpolarizing (halorhodopsins and archaerhodopsins)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> ion channels to selectively turn on/off neurons in the presence of light. Chemogenetic approaches, such as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, have high utility for their modulation of GPCR signalling, but similar to other ligand-mediated responses, can sometimes be limited by pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics making them difficult to use to examine real-time kinetics of receptor activity, particularly <italic>in vivo.</italic> Thus, the development of optically active G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) allows for more fine tuned modulation of cellular activity. Through manipulation of the light stimulus, we can modulate the activity of optically active GPCRs in an ‘optodynamic' manner. This, in combination with the spatiotemporal control offered through optogenetics, provides a more refined <italic>in vivo</italic> GPCR toolkit than is currently possible with chemogenetics and traditional pharmacology.</p>
<p>The chimeric rhodopsin/β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR) has been shown to activate cAMP, presumably through Gαs-mediated signalling, and to modulate neuronal excitability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, it is unclear whether opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR behaves similarly to endogenous β<sub>2</sub>AR. Here we fully evaluated the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR and β<sub>2</sub>AR by examining the temporal kinetics of cAMP and MAP kinase activation in addition to receptor internalization and desensitization, and demonstrate that opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR mimics the dynamic signalling profile of β<sub>2</sub>ARs.</p>
<p>Over the past few years the tenets of GPCR pharmacology have been challenged by the concept of ‘functional selectivity' or ‘biased agonism,' demonstrating that ligands exert varying levels of efficacies on intracellular signalling mechanisms and that G-proteins may not be the sole determinants of intracellular activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. While arrestin was canonically thought to only terminate GPCR-mediated signalling through inactivation and internalization of the receptor, it is now widely accepted that arrestin acts to scaffold several intracellular signalling cascades, particularly MAP kinases. Several receptors, including opioid receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, angiotensin II<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, V2 vasopressin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and βAR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> display arrestin-dependent MAP kinase activation. In an effort to combine spatiotemporal control of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR with biased GPCR signalling, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR to generate optically active, functionally selective GPCRs.</p>
<p>Mutation of three key residues in β<sub>2</sub>AR (β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>T68F,Y132G,Y219A</sup> or β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>TYY</sup>) generate an arrestin-biased mutant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, while modification of C-terminal serines prevents arrestin binding by blocking G-protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation resulting in a G-protein-biased mutant (β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>S355A,S356G</sup> or β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Analogous residues were altered in opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR to generate an arrestin-biased receptor, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>L72F,Y136G,Y224A</sup> or opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> and a G-protein-biased receptor, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>S362A,S363G</sup> or opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup>. Here we determined the dynamic optical properties of these novel optically active, functionally selective receptors.</p>
<p>Heterologous expression systems are essential in characterization of receptor activity. They offer the ability to dissect receptor function not possible in more complex environments. However, to truly understand endogenous activity, it is essential to ultimately look at <italic>in vivo</italic> function. To that end, we determined whether opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR could be used <italic>in vivo</italic> since it has yet to be utilized for inducing a significant behavioural phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. We expressed opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR in a biologically relevant neural circuit known to be under the influence of noradrenergic signalling and that expresses β<sub>2</sub>ARs and its signalling moieties, the basolateral amygdala (BLA). The presence of all nine adrenergic receptor subtypes within the amygdaloid complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> has precluded determination of their roles and signalling pathways <italic>in vivo</italic> due to the fact that pharmacological isolation of these receptors is difficult within the amygdala. These caveats are true for many GPCRs, due to the lack of spatiotemporal control of receptor function, isolation of specific cell types, and control of select noradrenergic or other modulatory inputs. To isolate noradrenergic GPCR signalling <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR and demonstrated that <italic>in vivo</italic> photoactivation of β-adrenergic signalling produced excitation of BLA neurons resulting in anxiety-like states in both fiber-tethered and wireless, freely moving animals.</p>
<p>Here we have fully evaluated the utility of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR in mimicking endogenous β<sub>2</sub>AR activity; we developed novel, optically active, functionally selective receptors to bias β<sub>2</sub>AR intracellular signalling mechanisms and we used opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR <italic>in vivo</italic> and define its ability to initiate a series of real-time behavioural responses.</p>

<title>Optical control of β-adrenergic signalling</title>
<p>We first fully characterized a unique optical tool for activating β-adrenergic signalling and compared its pharmacodynamic properties with β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>AR). The opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR receptor is a chimeric protein that includes transmembrane and extracellular components of bovine rhodopsin, with intracellular domains and loops of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Photostimulation of HEK293 cells expressing opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR caused a real-time, light-power-dependent increase in cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), a canonical product of the Gαs signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>), similar to isoproterenol-induced concentration-dependent cAMP generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. This real-time cAMP increase in response to light was absent in untransfected HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Furthermore, the kinetics of cAMP activation (<italic>τ</italic><sub>on</sub>) and inactivation (<italic>τ</italic><sub>off</sub>) are strikingly similar between opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR and endogenous β<sub>2</sub>AR in HEK293 cells suggesting that although the extracellular regions of the receptors differ greatly, the conformational change required to initiate intracellular signalling are maintained, making these receptors kinetically similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). In addition, cAMP triggers activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated nonspecific cation channels. Here we show opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR causes a robust increase in intracellular Ca<sup>+2</sup> in response to light stimulation, with similar results obtained for β<sub>2</sub>AR following isoproterenol bath application, while untransfected HEK293 cells show no response to light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to cAMP, extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation has been examined extensively in β<sub>2</sub>AR, showing a rapid, yet transient peak within 2–5 min of isoproterenol-induced activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. To determine whether opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR also activates ERK 1/2 kinases, we stimulated opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR with a 1 min light pulse and generated a time course of ERK phosphorylation (pERK). Similar to isoproterenol-induced pERK in β<sub>2</sub>AR, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR showed a rapid and transient increase in pERK that peaks within 2–5 min and then rapidly declines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref> for full time course). The kinetic effects seen in β<sub>2</sub>AR were the same whether in the continued presence of isoproterenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>) or following a 1 min pulse with isoproterenol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b,c</xref>). We also show that levels of total ERK in β<sub>2</sub>AR remain constant over a two-hour trial period, suggesting the kinetics of pERK are not due to degradation of total ERK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d,e</xref>). In addition, the extent of ERK activation in opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR displayed a light-power-dependent relationship that was absent in untransfected HEK293 control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f,g</xref>). The frequency of the light pulse showed the most effect on pERK at full (not pulsed) light or at 5 s on/5 s off (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2h</xref>), while light pulse length had little effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2i</xref>), suggesting that opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR activity can be modulated via manipulation of the light stimulus (that is, optodynamic). These kinetically parallel data sets suggest that photoactivation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR induces rapid and transient increases in receptor signalling known to be mediated through β-adrenergic, Gαs-dependent pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that rhodopsin and some chimeric GPCRs display dark activity, or are constitutively active in the absence of light<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. To test this, we quantified levels of pERK in HEK293 cells stably expressing opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR and untransfected controls. In the absence of light stimulation, both cell types showed similar levels of pERK, suggesting that the presence of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR does not induce constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2j</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p>

<title>Opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR internalization and desensitization</title>
<p>We also determined if opto-β<sub>2</sub>ARs are regulated through their receptor internalization and desensitization kinetics in a manner similar to β-adrenergic receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Photostimulation (1 min) of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR resulted in rapid receptor internalization within 2–5 min following light exposure (<italic>τ</italic><sub>on</sub>=2.8 min) that peaked within 15 min and returned to baseline levels 90 min later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). In the continued presence of isoproterenol (1 μM), β<sub>2</sub>AR internalization was temporally matched (<italic>τ</italic><sub>on</sub>=2.8 min) to opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR and yielded values similar to those obtained by other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. To better mimic the optodynamic stimulation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR, β<sub>2</sub>AR cells were treated with a 1 min isoproterenol pulse. β<sub>2</sub>ARs internalized with similar kinetics (<italic>τ</italic><sub>on</sub>=2.2 min) as opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR, yet in contrast to continuous agonist exposure, β<sub>2</sub>ARs return to baseline more rapidly following a 1-min pulse of agonist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c,d</xref>). If we compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>, there are significant differences at the 60, 90 and 120 min time points suggesting that β<sub>2</sub>ARs return faster to the membrane in the absence of agonist, than in its presence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>). These kinetic differences in receptor internalization and recycling highlight a significant limitation of traditional pharmacological approaches, as it can be difficult to rapidly remove ligand from the cell media/bath, or in particular following <italic>in vivo</italic> infusion. This dynamic function of the optically active GPCR, highlights the utility of these types of optical approaches that mimic GPCR activity at time scales matched to endogenous neuromodulator (NE) uptake and degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p>
<p>We next determined the functional recovery from desensitization of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR in a real-time cAMP assay. Following an initial light pulse (P1), cells produced less cAMP in response to a second light pulse (P2) at short interstimulus intervals (ISI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Varying ISIs showed complete functional recovery of cAMP over time (<italic>τ</italic><sub>rec</sub>=49 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e–g</xref>). We also observed that the reduced cAMP responses seen at short ISIs are not due to degradation of the 9-<italic>cis</italic> chromophore, but rather internalization and desensitization of the receptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. These results suggest that opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR has optodynamically matched kinetics and signal transduction profiles to β<sub>2</sub>AR and is a useful tool for spatiotemporal control of β-adrenergic signalling.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Functionally selective opto-β<sub>2</sub>ARs receptors</title>
<p>Rhodopsin and βARs are both Class A GPCRs and hence share similar sequence homology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). It is this high homology that facilitated the generation of chimeric opto-β<sub>2</sub>ARs to mimic βARs intracellular signalling. In an effort to combine the spatiotemporal control of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR with biased intracellular signalling cascades, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR to generate optically active, functionally selective, G-protein-coupled receptors.</p>
<p>Opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR was altered to generate the putative arrestin-biased, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>L72F,Y136G,Y224A</sup> or opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup>, and the putative G-protein-biased, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>S362A,S363G</sup> or opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). It has been proposed and demonstrated by several groups that G-protein-mediated signalling is rapid and transient while arrestin-mediated signalling is slow and prolonged<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Here we show that activation of endogenous βAR in HEK293 cells with isoproterenol shows a rapid and transient increase in cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In contrast, HEK293 cells overexpressing the arrestin-biased, β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>TYY</sup> shows a marked reduction in cAMP. This reduction is suggestive of a decrease in G-protein interaction, and may also indicate a potential dominant negative effect of the mutant receptor on endogenous βAR. In contrast, HEK293 cells overexpressing the G-protein-biased β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> had an exaggerated response in the continued presence of isoproterenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Interestingly, HEK293 cells overexpressing β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>WT</sup> show a longer and sustained cAMP response in the presence of isoproterenol as compared to endogenous βAR in HEK293 cells. These kinetic differences are also clearly seen when repeated at 25 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Further, all three receptor types show similar kinetic responses to forskolin, a general activator of adenylate cyclase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), suggesting these kinetic differences are mediated through Gαs signalling and not due to cAMP sensor expression.</p>
<p>In response to a 5-s pulse of blue light, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR shows a rapid and transient increase in cAMP, while the arrestin-biased, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup>, shows an attenuated response to photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). When we repeat this experiment at 25 °C, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> does show a small response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>), yet is still significantly reduced from opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR, similar to the differences we and others have seen with β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>TYY</sup> following agonist treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. We next used an inhibitor of the Gαs subunit (NF 449). Using a concentration shown to effectively reduce isoproterenol-induced cAMP in β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>WT</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>), we show that NF 449 (100 μM) reduces peak cAMP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b,d</xref>). However, due to the potential for off target activity at purinergic receptors, we used a nonselective P2 purinergic antagonist, suramin (100 μM), and showed no reduction in peak cAMP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c,d</xref>), suggesting the effect is not due to purinergic receptor interaction but likely to Gαs inhibition. This reduction in real-time cAMP activity is similar to the profile of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>), and suggests that the reduction in cAMP is likely due to reduced association between the Gαs subunit and the receptor.</p>
<p>In contrast, the G-protein-biased, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> yields an exaggerated and prolonged cAMP response following photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>); an effect that is also reproduced at 25 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). Comparatively, β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> show a significant robust enhancement of cAMP responses when compared to WT, whereas both β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>TYY</sup> and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> show a significant reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>
<p>The differences seen between receptors in activation (<italic>τ</italic><sub>on</sub>) and deactivation (<italic>τ</italic><sub>off</sub>) time constants attest to the unique kinetics of each receptor type at both 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>) and 25 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). These kinetic differences may be amplified at cooler temperatures due to a reduction of cellular metabolism, and/or variations in the temperature sensitivity of the ligand-induced conformation versus photoisomerization of retinal. However, we did identify significant differences in the deactivation time constants (<italic>τ</italic><sub>off</sub>) for both β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup>, which were significantly slower when compared with β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>WT</sup> and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). These slower rates suggest a lack of G-protein coupled receptor kinase and arrestin recruitment to the membrane prolonging the activity of the receptor and yielding more cAMP output. In contrast, the reduced cAMP levels produced by both β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>TYY</sup> and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> is potentially due to inefficient coupling to the G-proteins that are required to initiate cAMP production. It is also unlikely that these kinetic differences are due to different light transduction properties of each receptor type as all three opto-β<sub>2</sub>ARs light power response curves yield similar EP<sub>50</sub> values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e,f</xref>), although we did note that the efficacy for generation of cAMP by opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR is not completely recapitulated comparedwith β<sub>2</sub>AR. This is most likely due to the presence of endogenous β-adrenergic receptors expressed in HEK293 cells.</p>
<p>To confirm that the kinetic cAMP differences observed between opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> are due to biased intracellular signalling and not receptor expression levels, we quantified cell surface receptor expression. Using on-cell westerns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> with a rhodopsin antibody, we show that rhodopsin expression is not only significantly elevated in the three cell lines in comparison to untransfected HEK293, but are also equal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5g,h</xref>). We also calculated receptor surface expression as a percent of total fluorescence and show that both opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> have increased surface expression compared to opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5i</xref>). The reduction in opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR surface fluorescence is most likely due to the higher levels of diffuse internalized receptor at baseline (see 0-min time point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>).</p>
<p>Activation of MAP kinase cascades also shows dramatic kinetic differences reminiscent of the model proposed by Luttrell and Getsey–Palmer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In the presence of isoproterenol, β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>WT</sup> and β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> show a marked increase in ERK phosphorylation that peaks within 2–5 min and is rapidly attenuated, suggesting a G-protein phase of activation, while β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>TYY</sup>, shows a significantly reduced level of pERK that is prolonged and sustained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Likewise, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> show a comparable temporal profile in the initial phase of ERK activation while opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> remains significantly slower and sustained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>), in a similar manner to the kinetics of β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>TYY</sup>. Further, when examined as fold increase over baseline, the effects on pERK by β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>WT</sup> and β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup>, show a marked increase in ERK phosphorylation that peaks within 2–5 min and is rapidly attenuated, while β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>TYY</sup> shows a reduced and sustained level of pERK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). Likewise, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> differed significantly from opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR, particularly in the initial stages of ERK activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>). The kinetics of both cAMP and ERK activity are remarkably similar between β<sub>2</sub>AR, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR, and their respective G-protein-biased and arrestin-biased mutants strongly supporting the current proposed model of rapid and transient G-protein-mediated signalling, and slower sustained arrestin-mediated signalling.</p>

<title>Functionally selective opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR mutant internalization</title>
<p>Activity of GPCRs is usually terminated following phosphorylation via G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) followed by subsequent recruitment of arrestin, leading to receptor internalization via clathrin coated pits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. To ascertain the characteristics of optically active, functionally selective mutant opto-β<sub>2</sub>ARs following desensitization we captured a time course of receptor internalization following photostimulation. Opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> did not internalize at any time point tested following light stimulation, suggesting that the ability of arrestin to initiate internalization is significantly compromised in this receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Conversely, the arrestin-biased mutant, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> was able to internalize rapidly following light stimulation, peaking at 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). In comparison to opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR at the 15-min time point, we see that opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> is significantly slower in reaching maximal internalization suggesting less efficient coupling with G-protein subunits that facilitate GRK recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). In addition, previous studies looking at β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>TYY</sup> also demonstrated a decrease in recruitment of arrestin which could also explain why opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> does not reach the same levels of internalization as opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating a lack of internalization for opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup>, we determined whether opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> receptors functionally desensitize. Following an initial pulse of light (P1), opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> displayed a typical real-time cAMP response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Following a subsequent light pulse (P2), opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> showed a mild reduction in cAMP, only at the earliest time point tested (P1 versus P2 at 5 min, <italic>P</italic>=0.0308 via Student's paired <italic>t</italic>-test). However, overall opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> did not show a significant reduction in P2-mediated cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f–h</xref>). In comparison, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR displayed a significant reduction in cAMP suggesting that the receptor functionally desensitized, and eventually recovered function within 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2e–g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4g</xref>). Opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> also did not lose its ability to generate cAMP at most time points tested, unlike opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR, which had a dramatic loss in cAMP signalling at shorter interstimulus intervals. Due to the absence of a detectable cAMP signal at 37 °C, no functional recovery data were collected for opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup>. These data suggest that the putative G-protein-biased opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> does not couple to arrestin as it is not internalized and desensitized following photostimulation, yet the putative arrestin-biased opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup> mutant interacts with arrestin since it is robustly internalized following photostimulation.</p>

<title>Photostimulation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR promotes neuronal firing</title>
<p>This series of <italic>in vitro</italic> data allowed us to illustrate that β<sub>2</sub>AR and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR share similar properties of cAMP generation, MAP kinase activation and receptor internalization. In addition, utilizing optically active, functionally selective receptors, we gained additional insight into how these tools bias receptor function towards G-protein or arrestin-mediated signalling effects in cAMP, MAP kinase activation, and receptor internalization/desensitization. Therefore, we next examined how opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR functions in a biologically relevant neuronal context known to be modulated through endogenous noradrenergic activation.</p>
<p>We first determined whether photoactivation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR in cells known to express wild-type βARs, the BLA, could promote time-locked signalling effects <italic>in vivo</italic> and subsequent excitation of BLA neurons. We virally targeted opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR-mCherry to excitatory neurons under the control of the CaMKIIα promoter to the BLA (opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a–d</xref>). Utilizing a 16-channel optrode array in the BLA for single-unit extracellular recordings we delivered light stimulation (20-s pulse) <italic>in vivo</italic> and demonstrated a significant increase in neuronal firing of BLA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e–j</xref>). Repeated light pulses (both 5- and 20-s constant light) also showed sustained activity over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a,b</xref>), whereas photostimulated cells in control virus (empty-vector lenti-virus) injected mice showed no effect on neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5i,j</xref>). In some instances, cells did not respond to light stimulation or showed inhibitory effects of photoactivation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup> (5% and 9%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>). These differences in neuronal activity may potentially be due to lack of expression of the viral construct, or lateral inhibition from local inhibitory neurons in this region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In addition, we show that activation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup>
<italic>in vivo</italic> showed a slow onset of activation (<italic>τ</italic><sub>on</sub>) and inactivation (<italic>τ</italic><sub>off</sub>), similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. We also confirmed that the presence of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup>
<italic>in vivo</italic> does not induce constitutive activity and alter neuronal activity as baseline firing rates between opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup> (<italic>n</italic>=41 units) and viral control (<italic>n</italic>=11 units) neurons are not different (<italic>P</italic>=0.2593 via unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5j</xref>).

<title>Photostimulation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR promotes anxiety-like behaviour</title>
<p>We next explored whether spatiotemporal activation of β-adrenergic signalling <italic>in vivo</italic> was sufficient to promote robust behavioural effects. We bilaterally expressed opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup> in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 10a,b and 11</xref>) and photoactivated (5 s on, 5 s off) animals during two different yet widely used rodent anxiety-like behavioural models, the elevated zero maze (EZM) and the light–dark box (LDB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Photoactivation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup> signalling in the BLA produced rapid and sustained anxiogenic-like behaviour with mice spending significantly more time in the closed arm of the EZM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5k,l</xref>), with no changes in locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5m</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10c,d</xref>). We next examined the effects of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup> activation on rapid acute anxiety-like behaviour using the LDB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. In this 10 min assay, rapid entry into a dark box from a light chamber and increased time spent in the dark box are measures of anxiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. This model consists of an enclosed dark environment with a small doorway inaccessible to fiber optic implants, we therefore utilized our recently developed wireless optogenetic approach to drive microscale inorganic light emitting diodes (μ-ILEDs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5n</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12a–d</xref>). Here we developed and utilized a ‘wireless 2.0' version, that is much smaller allowing for even more unrestricted animal activity, to remotely photoactivate opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup> injected mice. In these experiments, photoactivation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup> caused mice to rapidly enter the dark chamber as demonstrated by both a significant decrease in latency to enter the dark, and significantly more time spent in the dark during the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5o–q</xref>) with no effect on locomotor behaviour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12e,f</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that activation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR signalling <italic>in vivo</italic> can robustly modulate behavioural responses in βAR expressing regions. Furthermore, this can be done in a wireless manner, providing a unique method for spatiotemporal engagement of GPCR signalling <italic>in vivo</italic> in an unrestricted manner, such as the home cage, or other more diverse behavioural environments.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Manipulation of endogenous intracellular GPCR signalling <italic>in vivo</italic> has historically required pharmacological techniques. To some degree, optogenetics has filled this niche by allowing cell-type specificity in addition to spatiotemporal control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. However, a vast majority of optogenetic studies utilize light sensitive ion channels or pumps providing only binary control of neural activity. Here we show for the first time, that a chimeric rhodopsin/β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR) behaves in a kinetically similar manner, in a host of signalling readouts, to the human β<sub>2</sub>AR. We show that opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR activates GPCR signalling in a power dependent manner, mimicking the concentration dependence of isoproterenol on β<sub>2</sub>AR. Importantly, we also report that the kinetic responses of these two receptors are similar and that opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR not only internalizes following stimulation, but also functionally desensitizes, sharing the same kinetics as β<sub>2</sub>AR. Taken together these data strongly support using opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR as a tool to mimic β<sub>2</sub>AR activity (see summary data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In addition to modelling β<sub>2</sub>AR at the receptor level, incorporation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR as a tool allows for modelling the kinetics of endogenous NE release as the activation and deactivation of this receptor is controlled instantly through optogenetic techniques. In contrast, small molecules may confound analysis at the circuit level, as drug clearance becomes an issue and systemic half-life makes conclusions regarding kinetics of behavioural onset/offset difficult to interpret. Conversely, it must be taken into account that opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR is not identical to β<sub>2</sub>AR, and it is not currently known whether the trafficking and recycling pathways are the same <italic>in vivo</italic>. Future studies will need to further characterize the intracellular dynamics of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR <italic>in vivo</italic> using real-time imaging approaches.</p>
<p>In addition to showing the utility of optically activated GPCRs, we show here for the first time, optically active, functionally selective GPCRs. The concept of functional selectivity or biased agonism is becoming increasingly important to understand GPCR biology and in the development of novel therapeutics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Here we show two functionally distinct receptors: the arrestin-biased, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup>, and the G-protein-biased, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup>. Through an array of biochemical analyses we show that opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>LYY</sup>: mobilizes less cAMP, shows reduced and prolonged activation of ERK and internalizes in response to light stimulation in comparison to opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR. Conversely, opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup>: shows enhanced and transient cAMP signalling, shows elevated transient activation of ERK, lacks internalization, and shows little desensitization as compared with opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR. These optically sensitive, functionally selective GPCRs provide the advantages of not requiring a biased ligand and have direct spatiotemporal control over receptor activation and deactivation (see summary data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The information gathered from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies regarding the intracellular characteristics of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR in a heterologous expression system provided confidence that opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR closely mimics the pharmacological properties of β<sub>2</sub>AR. To expand on this potential utility, we further validated this approach <italic>in vivo</italic>, in a biologically relevant anxiety circuit known to be modulated through noradrenergic activation, the BLA. Given that the BLA is composed mostly of excitatory neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, we packaged opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR under the control of the CaMKIIα promoter to drive robust expression in the BLA (opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup>). Photostimulation of opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup>
<italic>in vivo</italic> altered the baseline firing properties of BLA neurons and revealed a heterogeneous population of cells. While the majority of cells increased firing rate, some exhibited no change and some showed a reduction in firing rate. Utilizing traditional pharmacological approaches would not allow for the isolation of a cell type within a given anatomical region and hence the roles of individual cell types, and adrenergic receptor subtypes were not previously possible.</p>
<p>When opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup> was activated <italic>in vivo</italic>, mice exhibited an anxiety-like phenotype. Anxiogenesis was demonstrated in two commonly used models of anxiety-like behaviour in rodents, the EZM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and the LDB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Utilization of the LDB was only possible due to new wireless optogenetic technology recently developed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Here we also demonstrate for the first time, real-time wireless control of GPCR signalling. Opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>BLA/CaMKIIα</sup> expressing mice, when stimulated wirelessly, displayed an anxiety-like phenotype in the LDB assay. This technology allowed us to use a common model of anxiogenic behaviour, but also sets the stage for important future work utilizing wireless manipulation of GPCR signalling <italic>in vivo</italic> allowing for a large expansion of GPCR-mediated behaviours that can be paired with current optogenetic techniques. That being said, optogenetics comes with certain caveats. It is possible that photostimulation in the BLA also activates axon collaterals, and hence confound subsequent behavioural output, or that more complex cell types and expression patterns are needed to truly hone in on β<sub>2</sub>AR signalling in real-time, <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, this is a unique first approach, and as additional mouse genetic tools and targeting schemes become available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, further isolation of cell types and GPCR signalling in neural circuits will become increasingly possible.</p>
<p>Taken together our data demonstrate that chimeric, optically active GPCRs can behave in a similar manner to their endogenous counterparts, making them particularly useful for both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> applications. Future studies will utilize these tools to engage the diversity of GPCR signalling <italic>in vivo</italic> and determine if spatiotemporal control of biased signalling promotes a series of pluridimensional behavioural phenotypes. In this report, we were able to show that the integration of the excitatory noradrenergic influence in the BLA is mediated via activation of β-adrenergic pathways that ultimately promotes anxiogenic-like behavioural states. Some exciting additional extensions include using them for examining the role of signalling inside cells, since the light used to activate these receptors can penetrate the cell membrane. Recent work from von Zastrow and colleagues has shown that Gαs-coupled receptors have multi-phasic signalling properties, one that is membrane bound, and another that occurs from endosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Other uses of these receptors include a means to better understand the process of G-protein activation without confounds of ligand binding. These findings have broad implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of GPCR signalling <italic>in vivo</italic> and in the development of novel therapeutics that depend on interactions with GPCRs.</p>

<title>Real time cAMP assay</title>
<p>Stable HEK cell lines containing opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR, β<sub>2</sub>AR and their respective mutants were transfected with the pGloSensor-22F cAMP plasmid (Promega E2301) using JetPrime (Polyplus) transfection reagent per manufacturer's instructions. Stable co-transfected cells were maintained under both G418 (400 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>) and hygromycin (200 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>) selective pressure. The day before an experiment, cells were plated on 96-well tissue culture treated plates (Costar) and allowed to recover overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Optimal results were obtained when β<sub>2</sub>AR (and respective mutants) were plated at 20 K cells per well and when opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR (and respective mutants) were plated at 100 K cells/well. The next day, media was replaced with 2% GloSensor reagent (Promega) suspended in CO<sub>2</sub>-independent growth medium (Gibco) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C or 25 °C depending on experiment. For real time cAMP, a baseline was first obtained with no treatment by recording relative luminescent units (RLUs) every 6 s for 1 min using a SynergyMx microplate reader (BioTek; Winooski VT; USA). Drug or light would then be used to stimulate the cells, and subsequent RLUs recorded every 6 s for 5–10 min depending on experiment. For data expressed as cAMP (fold baseline), RLUs for 1 min of baseline were averaged and all subsequent RLUs were then divided by this average. For data expressed as cAMP (% max), raw RLUs were entered into GraphPad Prism (v5.0d, GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA) and the normalization function used to assign the lowest RLU a value of 0% and the highest RLU a value of 100%. Time constants were calculated in GraphPad Prism using one-phase association (<italic>Y</italic>=Y0+(Plateau−Y0) × (1−exp(−K × <italic>x</italic>))) and one-phase decay (Y=(Y0−Plateau) × exp(−K × <italic>X</italic>)+Plateau) nonlinear regression analyses yielding a time constant value (<italic>τ</italic>).</p>

<title>Concentration/power response curves</title>
<p>For β<sub>2</sub>AR experiments, baseline relative luminescence recordings were taken and cells exposed to varying concentrations of isoproterenol in serial half log dilutions diluted from 10 mM stock in DMSO. Raw RLUs were normalized to the peak response evoked by isoproterenol and represented as cAMP (% max). Subsequent concentration response curves were fit using standard nonlinear regression to obtain EC<sub>50</sub> values using GraphPad Prism and expressed as mean±s.e.m., with triplicate data points averaged per experiment with a total of six individual experimental replicates. For opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR experiments, individual wells were exposed to a 5-s blue light pulse (473 nm) at varying powers to generate a power response curve with data normalized to maximal cAMP response. Subsequent power response curves were fit with standard nonlinear regression to obtain EP<sub>50</sub> values using GraphPad Prism. Data are expressed as mean±s.e.m.</p>

<title>Recovery from desensitization</title>
<p>Opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>WT</sup> and opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>SS</sup> cells grown in 96-well plates were individually exposed to a single 5-s blue light pulse (473 nm, 1 W cm<sup>−2</sup>) called P1 (pulse 1) with the subsequent cAMP response recorded. After varying interstimulus intervals (0, 2.5, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min) each well was then re-exposed to a second light pulse (P2), and subsequent cAMP response recorded. Peak RLU for P2 were then divided by peak RLU for P1. These points were then fit with a one-phase association (Y=Y0+(Plateau−Y0) × (1−exp(−K × <italic>x</italic>))) curve in GraphPad Prism to obtain a time constant of recovery from desensitization (<italic>τ</italic><sub>rec</sub>).

<title>Immunoblots</title>
<p>Western blots for phospho-MAPKs were performed as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Cells were grown overnight in 6- or 12-well plates, then serum-starved a minimum of 4 h before treatment to avoid serum growth factor-induced MAPK activation. Cells were treated at various time points at 37 °C and then collected in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1:100 of phosphatase inhibitor mixture set 1 (Calbiochem), and 1:100 of protease inhibitor mixture set 1 (Calbiochem) on ice. Lysates were sonicated for 15 s, centrifuged for 20 min (14,000 rcf at 4 °C), then stored at −20 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Pierce BCA (Thermo Scientific) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Each gel contained the same amount of total protein and varied between 20–40 μg, depending on experiment. Nondenaturing 10% bisacrylamide precast gels (Invitrogen) were run at 180 V for 1 h. For determination of molecular weights, pre-stained molecular weight ladders (Life Technologies; Novex Sharp Protein Standard; LC5800) were loaded along with protein samples. Blots were transferred to nitrocellulose (Whatman, Middlesex, UK) for 1.5 h at 30 mV, blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h, incubated overnight at 4 °C with goat anti-rabbit phospho-ERK 1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr- 204) antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling) and mouse β-actin (1:20,000, Abcam). Membranes were then washed 4x for 10 min in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 1% Tween 20) and then incubated with the IRDyeTM 800 (1:5,000, donkey anti-rabbit) and 700 (1:20,000, donkey anti mouse) conjugated affinity purified IgG in a 1:1 mixture of 5% milk/TBS and Li-Cor blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Membranes were then washed three times for 10 min in TBST then once for 10 min in TBS to remove Tween. Immunoblots were scanned using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences). Band intensity was measured using Odyssey software following background subtraction and integrated intensity measured for each band in high-resolution pixels. All pERK bands were normalized to β-actin, as an equal protein loading control. For data expressed as pERK (fold baseline), raw pERK/actin values were normalized to the 0-min time point. For data expressed as pERK (% max), raw pERK/actin values were entered into GraphPad Prism (v5.0d, GraphPad Software, San Diego CA, USA) and the normalization function used to assign the lowest pERK/actin a value of 0% and the highest raw pERK/actin a value of 100%. Data are expressed as mean±s.e.m. Concentration-response data were fit using nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism. Positive controls are cell lysates obtained from HEK293 cells stably expressing the Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ Opioid Peptide Receptor (NOPR) harvested following a 5-min incubation in nociceptin (1 μM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>.

<title>Stereotaxic surgery</title>
<p>Mice were anaesthetized in an induction chamber (5% isoflurane) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Model 1900) where they were maintained at 1–2% isoflurane throughout the procedure. Following craniotomy mice were injected bilaterally with 1.2 μl of either lenti-EF1α-GFP or lenti-CaMKIIα-optoβ<sub>2</sub>AR-mCherry in the BLA at stereotaxic coordinates: −1.3 mm posterior to bregma; ±2.9 mm lateral to bregma and −4.9 mm ventral to bregma. For wireless μ-ILED BLA studies, animals were injected unilaterally, not bilaterally. Mice were then implanted with chronic fiber optic implants or μ-ILED wireless devices with coordinates adjusted from viral injection to: −1.3 mm posterior to bregma; ±2.9 mm lateral to bregma and −3.9 mm ventral to bregma. For bio-dissolvable samples, the device was implanted at the desired target, ACSF was applied to the portion of the device that remained outside of the skull to facilitate dissolution of the adhesive, and then the epoxy needle was removed after a delay of 15 min<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>.

<p>Spontaneous single unit activity was recorded following previous published protocols<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Briefly, mice were lightly anesthetized (1% isoflurane), placed in a stereotactic frame and two skull screws were placed on either side of the midline to ground the electrode array. The recording apparatus consisted of a 16-channel (35-μm tungsten wires, 150-μm spacing between wires, 150-μm spacing between rows, Innovative Physiology) electrode array. This array was epoxied to a fiber optic and lowered into the BLA (stereotaxic coordinates from bregma: −1.3 mm (AP),±2.9 mm (ML) and −4.9 mm (DV). Spontaneous and photostimulated neuronal activity was recorded from each electrode, bandpass-filtered with activity between 250 and 8,000 Hz, and analysed as spikes. Voltage signals were amplified and digitally converted using Omniplex and PlexControl (Plexon). For opto-β<sub>2</sub>AR<sup>WT</sup>, 5 s constant light, followed by 5-s no light was repeated for 12 cycles or 20-s constant light (on) followed by 1-min recovery with no light (off) was repeated for 12 cycles. Principle component analysis and/or evaluation of <italic>t</italic>-distribution with expectation maximization were used to sort spikes using Offline Sorter (Plexon).

<title>Wireless powering and RF scavenger for wireless optogenetics</title>
<p>Wireless powering of the μ-ILED devices was performed following previously published protocols<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. The wireless power transmitter includes an RF signal generator (Agilent N5181A), a power supply (Agilent U8031A), a RF power amplifier (Empower RF Systems 1119-BBM3K5KHM), an RF signal splitter (RF Lambda RFLT2W0727GN), and two panel antennas (ARC Wireless ARC-PA2419B01). The RF signal generator is internally modulated to delivery sufficient power to light the μ-iLEDs at the given stimulation protocol (10 Hz, 50-ms pulse widths). The RF power amplifier that is powered by the power supply enlarges the modulated RF signal from the RF signal generator. The RF power is then transmitted from the panel antenna to the headstage power harvesters. The RF signal generator has a power output from −10 to 0 dBm at 1.5 GHz, optimized daily to ensure equivalent light power throughout the space of the LDB assay. Mice with chronically implanted μ-ILED devices were acutely connected to the headstage power harvesters immediately before any wireless photostimulation.</p>
