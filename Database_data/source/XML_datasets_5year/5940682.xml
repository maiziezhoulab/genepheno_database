<p id="Par1">The small-GTPase Rac1 is a key molecular regulator linking extracellular signals to actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Loss-of-function mutations in RAC1 and other genes of the Rac signaling pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Intellectual Disability (ID). The Rac1 activity is negatively controlled by GAP proteins, however the effect of Rac1 hyperactivity on neuronal networking <italic>in vivo</italic> has been poorly studied. ArhGAP15 is a Rac-specific negative regulator, expressed in the main subtypes of pyramidal cortical neurons. In the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic>, cortical pyramidal neurons show defective neuritogenesis, delayed axonal elongation, reduced dendritic branching, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These phenotypes are associated with altered actin dynamics at the growth cone due to increased activity of the PAK-LIMK pathway and hyperphosphorylation of ADF/cofilin. These results can be explained by shootin1 hypo-phosphorylation and uncoupling with the adhesion system.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Intellectual Disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant impairments in both intellectual functioning and in adaptive skills. ID patients show defects in network connectivity and altered excitation/inhibition balance of cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and these alterations may result in abnormal information processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">Mutations of <italic>RAC1</italic> and of genes involved in the Rac-GTPase pathway such as <italic>PAK3</italic>, <italic>ARHGEF9</italic> and <italic>ARHGEF6</italic> (also known as α<italic>PIX</italic>) have been identified in patients with ID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Collectively, the genetic variants identified in ID patients are all of the loss-of-function type, implying that a hypoactive main Rac pathway is the pathogenic cause of these conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, although the identification of the endophenotype underlying ID is far from being clarified.</p>
<p id="Par4">Rac-GTPases are key molecular switches that link extracellular signals to actin cytoskeleton dynamics. They cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound state, a binary switch that is tightly regulated by several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Over the past several years, it has become clear that Rac-GTPases and their regulators control the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, inducing stabilization and destabilization of the actin filament network, needed to transduce extracellular cues into vectorial flow of information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Rac1 acts by controlling actin dynamics at the growth cone and leading edge on immature neurons, through actin filament polymerization/disassembly, acto-myosin contractility and engagement of intracellular adhesion and anchoring mechanisms via regulation of actin-binding proteins (ABP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">A large body of experimental evidence has documented the role of aberrant function of components of the Rac1 signaling pathway in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ID, however our current knowledge on Rac-GTPases function is obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> by overexpressing the constitutively active or dominant-negative Rac1 mutant proteins, which may have significant drawbacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. On the other hand, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have been focused on the analysis of mice with loss-of-function mutations of <italic>Rac1/Rac3</italic>, pointing out specific functions of these GTPases during development of both the excitatory and the inhibitory networks. For instance in the mouse, the <italic>synapsin1-cre</italic>-mediated conditional deletion of <italic>Rac1</italic> in neurons (<italic>Rac-N</italic>), also in combination with <italic>Rac3</italic> deletion, leads to migration, differentiation and connectivity defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A complete knowledge of Rac1 regulation during neuronal network formation is still lacking. For instance, little is known about the role of the several neuronal-specific positive and negative regulators of Rac1, or the effect of Rac hyperactivity on neuronal networking, <italic>in vivo</italic>. Notably, the loss of function of the Rho-specific GAP <italic>oligophrenin-1</italic> in humans is responsible for X-linked syndromic ID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par7">ArhGAP15 is a Rac-specific GAP that negatively regulates Rac1/3 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In human, loss of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> has been associated to cognitive disorders, in the Mowat-Wilson disease, characterized by severe neurological and cognitive deficits, severe ID and speech impairment, and in most cases epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In the most severe variants of the Mowat-Wilson syndrome, the loss of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> accompanies the deletion of <italic>Zeb2</italic>, the known disease gene. Thus the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> in humans might contribute to severe the pathological condition. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the over-expression of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> results in increased actin stress fibers and cell contraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, suggesting that properly regulated inhibition of the Rac1 pathway is essential for cytoskeletal reorganization.</p>
<p id="Par8">In this work we addressed the question of whether the loss of a Rac-specific negative regulator may affect neuronal development and axon outgrowth during development of the nervous system, through the hyperactivation of the Rac1 downstream pathway. To do this, we analyzed the molecular and cellular consequences of the genetic deletion of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We find that the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> results in defective neuritogenesis, dendritic complexity and axon elongation of cortical pyramidal neurons, and reduced synaptic density. These phenotypes are associated with altered actin dynamics at the growth cone due to increased activity of the PAK-LIMK pathway and hyperphosphorylation of ADF/cofilin. Functionally, <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibit altered electroencephalographic rhythms and cognitive deficits.</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> in the postnatal mouse brain</title>
<p id="Par9">We previously showed that in the early postnatal brain, ArhGAP15 is expressed in the olfactory bulbs, cortex and hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Xgal staining of newborn (P1) <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>+/−</sup> brains showed abundant βgal-expressing cells in the somatosensory and somatomotor cortical areas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A,B</xref>). We characterized the expression in pyramidal neurons by double immunostaining of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>+/−</sup> brains at the age P1 with anti-βgal (detecting ArhGAP15-expressing cells) and either Ctip2, Cux1 or Tbr1 (markers, respectively, of pyramidal neurons in layer V, layers II-III and layer VI). The use of anti-βgal is justified by the fact that existing antibodies directed against ArhGAP15 also detect unspecific signal, and cannot be reliably used. βgal/ArhGAP15 was detected nearly exclusively in Ctip2+ neurons in layer V, while it was not detected in Cux1+ and Tbr1+ neurons in other layers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C–G</xref>). Quantification of the double-stained neurons indicated that only a fraction (40% ± 3.84%) of the Ctip2+ neurons is βgal+ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1O</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Expression of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> in early postnatal and adult mouse brain.

<p id="Par10">In young adults (P60) we carried out RNA::RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on coronal sections of WT brains, to detect the <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> mRNA; expression was observed in the olfactory bulbs, cortex and hippocampus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1H</xref>). Similarly, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with a probe detecting the <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA on <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>+/−</sup> brains showed an identical expression pattern. We then carried out Xgal staining of coronal sections of P60 <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>+/−</sup> brains and again we observed expression of βgal in all regions of the cerebral cortex as well as the hippocampus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1I</xref>). Finally, we carried out Xgal staining and the <italic>lacZ</italic> RNA::RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to compare <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> brains, and observed no difference between the two genotypes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1A,B</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par11">To examine the expression of ArhGAP15 in young adult pyramidal neurons in more details, we carried out double immunostaining on <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>+/−</sup> brains at the age P45, to detect βgal and either Ctip2, Cux1 and Tbr1, markers of layer-specific and target-specific subclasses of cortical pyramidal neurons. In the adult <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>+/−</sup> brain βgal/ArhGAP15 was detected in a fraction of all pyramidal neuron subtypes (Ctip2/βgal 43% ± 4.80%; Cux1/βgal24% ± 2.38%; Tbr1/βgal 28% ± 7.45%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1J–O</xref>). In summary ArhGAP15 is expressed postmitotically, in a time-dependent manner, in a fraction of most subtypes of cortical pyramidal neurons, the first ones being Ctip2+ neurons in layer V.</p>

<title>Cortical organization is normal in <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice</title>
<p id="Par12">Xgal staining and <italic>lacZ</italic> RNA::RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization showed no evident difference between normal and <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> brains in terms of distribution of the reporter-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1A,B</xref>), indicating that the <italic>ArhGAP15/lacZ</italic> expressing cells are not lost or grossly mislocalized in the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic>. In addition, immunostaining of P1 brain sections for Ctip2 showed no difference in the neuron number and position (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1C,D</xref>). Furthermore, staining of coronal sections of the early post-natal or adult animals with TUNEL for the detection of apoptotic cells revealed no significant change in the number and position of TUNEL+ cells, thus we exclude a loss of specific cell populations.</p>
<p id="Par13">To better evaluate the genesis and cyto-architecture of cortical pyramidal neurons in the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic>, we pulse-labeled proliferating neuroblasts with a single injection of EdU at E14.5 and then determined the number and distribution of EdU+, Satb2+ and Tbr1+ neurons detected at birth. Satb2 is a postmitotic determinant for upper-layer cortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, while Tbr1 is preferentially expressed in layer VI neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We observed no difference in either the laminar organization of Satb2 or Tbr1 pyramidal neurons or in the number/position of EdU-labeled neurons between the two genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). We conclude that, at birth, in the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> pyramidal neurons are normally generated and positioned.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Genesis and organization of cortical pyramidal neurons in <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.

<title>Loss of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> affects neuronal morphology and neuritogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p id="Par14">The small-GTPase Rac1 is critical for the acquisition of neuronal morphology and for neuritogenesis during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. To determine whether loss of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic>, hence hyperactive Rac1/Rac3, affects neuronal morphology, neurite elongation, branching and overall neurite complexity, we examined primary cultures of neurons dissociated from cortices of WT and <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos, at the age E15.5, electroporated with a <italic>Green Fluorescent Protein</italic> (<italic>GFP</italic>) expressing vector and maintained 3 DIV (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2A</xref>). First, we categorized neurons on the basis of the number of main neurites, and classified them as unipolar (having one visible neurite), bipolar (two neurites) and multipolar (&gt;two neurites) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2B–D</xref>). We found that the fraction of unipolar cells was significantly increased (WT 5% vs. KO 12%) in cultures of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cortices, while the fraction of bipolar cells was diminished (WT 21% vs. KO 14%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>). The fraction of multipolar neurons was unchanged in the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, however the number of their neurites is reduced in <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons, compared to WT (WT 6 ± 0.18 vs. KO 5 ± 0.23) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> is required by immature neurons to achieve a more elaborated morphology, and in the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> the formation of the first extension might be delayed.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Loss of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> affects neuronal morphology and neuritogenesis of cortical pyramidal neurons.

Therefore we examined whether the observed inefficient neuritogenesis might be linked to altered actin dynamics at the growth cone of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons. We established primary cultures of cortical neurons, and electroporated the dissociated cells with RFP-Lifeact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, a vector expressing a protein conjugated with RFP and able to bind dynamic actin (a strategy widely used to visualize sites of active actin polymerization/depolymerization in neurons) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3A,B</xref>). Nearly 100% cells stained positive for βIII-tubulin, an early pan-neuronal marker (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3C</xref>).

<title>Loss of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> results in increased cofilin phosphorylation via the PAK-LIMK pathway</title>
<p id="Par21">We have previously shown that the genetic disruption of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> leads to complete absence of the ArhGAP15 protein and that, as consequence of the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic>, Rac1 activity is 1.7-fold (E15.5) and a 2- fold (P2) increased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Rho-GTPases are linked to the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton via the control of the actin-binding and actin-severing phosphoprotein ADF/cofilin. We therefore examined the levels of phospho-cofilin in protein extracts from WT or <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neonatal cortices (P2), by Western blot analyses. In samples from <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cortices, we observed a significant increase of the phospho-cofilin/total cofilin ratio, while the total cofilin level was unchanged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5C</xref>). Considering that one of the best studied pathways involved in the phosphorylation (and inactivation) of ADF/cofilin is the Rac-PAK-LIMK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, we examined the phosphorylation state of LIMK1/2 and PAK1-3. In protein samples from <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cortices both LIMK1/2 and PAK1-3 were significantly hyperphorphorylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5D</xref>). Finally we examined the activation state of slingshot-1L (SSH1L), an ADF/cofilin phosphatase which is activated by phosphorylation. In protein samples from <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cortices we observed a significant reduction in SSH1L phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5D</xref>), indicating that this phosphatase is hypoactive. In conclusion, Rac1 hyperactivity consequent to the loss of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic>, results in ADF/cofilin inactivation via the increased activity of the PAK-LIMK pathway, and reduced activity of the SSH1L phosphatase.</p>
<p id="Par22">In order to link the increased ADF/cofilin phosphorylation (hence inactivation) with the increased retrograde actin flow and with shorter and less complex neurites in <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons, we reasoned that loss of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> may result in decreased phosphorylation of shootin1 and reduced coupling with L1 adhesion. Indeed, increased retrograde flow of the actin network may result from the combined effect of higher actin polymerization and increased myosin II motor function not accompanied by active association of actin-binding proteins with adhesion complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, shootin1 phosphorylation downstream of Rac1/Rac3 has been recognized as a key mechanism to couple enhanced actin flow with increased efficacy of adhesion on L1 substrates, needed for actual neurite elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We examined the phosphorylation state of shootin1 in protein samples from WT and <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cortices, by Western blot analyses. We observed a significant reduction in the phosphorylation state of shootin1 in <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5D</xref>). With inactive shootin1, thus an altered engagement of the “clutch” system linking actin filament elongation with L1 dependent adhesion, explains both the increased retrograde actin flow and the inefficient neurite elongation of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> null neurons.</p>

In order to confirm our previous findings, we carried out recording of the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) of adult WT and <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> animals at two ages: P40 and P180. At P40, the power spectrum of mutant animals (N = 9), compared to the WT animals (N = 10) showed a significant increase of the relative α- (8–12 Hz), of the β- (12–30 Hz) and of the γ-activity (&gt;30 Hz) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7A,B</xref>). The overall θ-activity (4–8 Hz) appeared unchanged, however when we subdivided the θ-waves in a high (6–8 Hz) and a low (4–6 Hz) range, we detected a significant increase in the θ low activity in <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7C</xref>).

At P180 the <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (N = 3 for both genotypes) showed an increase in the relative power of the α, β, and γ frequency oscillations, similar to what we observed in 6-weeks old animals, while no change of the MDF was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7D,E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par26">Hereditary forms of ID in humans are caused by mutations in genes coding for regulators of the Rac1 small-GTPase, or components of the Rac-PAK-LIMK main pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and recently mutations in Rac1 have been reported in few ID individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. All these mutations are of loss-of-function type, thus expected to cause hypo-activity of the Rac-PAK-LIMK transduction pathway and aberrant actin dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. How altered actin dynamics result in cognitive deficits in human is still largely unclear, although by examining the roles of different genes in many strains of (loss-of-function) mutant mice, it is generally assumed that cognitive deficits are linked to altered synaptic networking and plasticity, as well as excitation/inhibition imbalance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par27">One aspect that has remained poorly studied is whether any misregulation of Rac activity, e.g. hyper- or hypo-, would alter actin dynamics in ways that present common features and thus result in related cognitive deficits. There are substantial similarities with the phenotypes of mice with a conditional loss of <italic>Rac1</italic> or of <italic>Rac1</italic>+ <italic>Rac3</italic>; specifically the single and combined <italic>Rac1/Rac3</italic> mutant animals show defective axonal elongation, altered synaptic density and plasticity, associated with memory and learning deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, similar to the <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> ones. This observation indicates that the hypo-activity and the hyper-activity of Rac1 can induce similar neuronal defects, and suggests that a fine regulation of the Rac1 activity is necessary to attain the full complexity and functioning of cortical neuronal network.</p>
<p id="Par28">Considering that, in human, mutations in <italic>Oligophrenin1</italic> (a Rho GAP) cause X-linked ID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and that the loss of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> (a Rac GAP) is linked to rare variants of the Mowat-Wilson disease with severe neurologic and cognitive deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, here we examined a mouse model in which Rac1 is hyperactive as the consequence of loss of the Rac-specific GAP protein <italic>ArhGAP15</italic>. We observe delayed axonal lengthening, reduced neuronal complexity and altered synaptic density on cortical pyramidal neurons, associated with their mild hyperexcitability. We also observe an increase in the relative power in the α, β, and γ ranges, accompanied by cognitive/learning deficits in the adult animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Frequency oscillations could reflect disturbed neuronal synchronization, e.g., caused by a dysfunctional GABA/glutamate system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Altogether, the synchronous occurrence of θ, α, β and γ activity indicates the existence of distributed oscillatory systems which are linked with sensory and cognitive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Of interest, a diminished cortical γ activity has been linked to impaired inhibitory input from fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, and we observe indeed a reduced density of GABA synapses. On the contrary, an increased γ activity has been linked to increased excitability of pyramidal neurons which enhances the inhibitory function of parvalbumin neurons via local circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> this second mechanism seems prevalent, although the number, distribution and activity of inhibitory neurons in the <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cortex will have to be examined in details.</p>
<p id="Par29">Recent studies have demonstrated that GAP proteins, by modulating the Rac1 activity, regulate nearly all aspects of brain development, being essential for the regulation of neurogenesis, neuronal morphology, axon growth, synapse formation and plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Indeed mutations in GAP molecules (specific for Rho-class GTPases) cause axonal, dendritic and synaptic defects. Rho-class GTPases, control actin cytoskeleton reorganization in complex ways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The best studied pathway involves the PAK1/3-dependent phosphorylation of LIMK and consequent phosphorylation (and inactivation) of ADF/cofilin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Protein kinases and phosphatases responsible for cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play crucial roles in regulating actin cytoskeleton reorganization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, and indeed the levels of cofilin phosphorylation drastically change in response to various extracellular stimuli that affect actin dynamics, cell migration and morphogenesis. Here we show that Rac hyperactivity results in a higher level of ADF/cofilin phoshorylation via the increased activity of the PAK-LIMK pathway, and reduced activity of the SSH1L phosphatase. Increased ADF/cofilin phosphorylation, usually associated with reduced actin dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, can explain the inefficient neuritogenesis and branching that we observed in the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic>.</p>
<p id="Par30">We show that in the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> retrograde actin flow at the growth cone is increased. This should facilitate neurite formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, however this occurs upon coupling of actin retrograde flow with cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) via an efficient linking bridge, known as “clutch”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Among the molecules participating in the “clutch”, shootin1 is a brain-specific protein that interacts both with the F-actin network and with L1-CAM in axonal growth cones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Shootin1 phosphorylation enhances its interaction with the actin network, promoting filopodia and axon extension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. On the contrary, silencing or hypophosphorylation of shootin1 uncouples the actin flow from membrane adhesion and inhibits neurite elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. In the absence of <italic>ArhGAP15</italic>, we observe reduced shootin1 phosphorylation indicating that, in the presence of hyperactive Rac1, shootin1 fails to efficiently couple the F-actin flow with cell adhesion, and this “clutch disengagements” results in shorter and simpler neurites.</p>
<p id="Par31">Current knowledge on the role of Rac1 for correct neuronal positioning, wiring and connectivity derives largely from the use of either constitutively active (CA) or dominant-negative (DN) Rac1 variants, or the generation of transgenic animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Such an approach, however, does not provide the ideal experimental setting to study the function of the GTPase. In fact, CA forms require continuous GTP-binding/GTP-hydrolysis cycling for effective signaling flow of the GTPase, while DN forms drastically interfere with endogenous functions. Likewise, the elimination of GTPases, such as their genetic knockouts, alters their amount but not their activity. Not surprisingly <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results have led to contradictory conclusions. For example, hyperactive cdc42 <italic>in vitro</italic> promotes dendritic arbor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, while the deletion of the cdc42-GAP <italic>NOMA-GAP in vivo</italic> results in hyperactive cdc42 and reduced (not increased) complexity of dendritic arborization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Thus, the approaches of directly interfering or eliminating Rac1 appear inadequate to fully comprehend the physiological role of active vs. inactive GTPases and the neuronal bases of human ID in the presence of mutant GTPase regulators. Instead, manipulating Rac1 regulators offers a better opportunity to alter Rac1 activity in ways that more closely recapitulates the condition of hereditary forms of ID.</p>
<p id="Par32">Defining the impact of modest misregulation of GTPases activity on the construction, function and plasticity of cortical networks is a main scientific and medical issue, that will require addressing the role of each neuronal-specific GTPase regulator in improved models, such as human iPSC-derived neurons and brain organoids. Relevant information may open ways to pharmacologically modulate Rac activity for therapeutic purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>

<p id="Par45">WT, <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>+/−</sup> or <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos at the age E15.5 were used to establish primary cultures of cortical neurons. Embryonic heads were dissected in sterile conditions in cold Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium (Gibco, Life Technologies), the cortices were dissected free of the rest of the brain, deprived of the meninges and dissociated. For the dissociation, Neurobasal B27 (Neurobasalmedium, Glutamine 1/100, B27 1/50, Gentamicine 1/1000) was used, first with mechanical shearing and then by adding trypsin for 15 minutes at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation and resuspension in culture medium. Two cellular pools, WT and <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, were thus obtained. Each pool of cell suspension was quantified through Countess (Life Technologies) and 7 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells from each pool was nucleofected (i.e. electroporated) with PGK-eGFP vector (2 μg) or with the LifeAct-RFP vector (2 μg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> using Nucleofector 2b (Nucleofector System, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) with the electroporation code O-005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>.</p>

A minimum of 150 WT and <italic>ArhGAP15</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons were counted. To perform this analysis, we used the basic functions of ImageJ software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, measuring the length of the main neurite of each neuron and the number of secondary neurites, departing from the main neurite.

Seven and 12 sections (from at least 3 independent brains) were examined for, respectively, the WT and the <italic>ArhGAP15</italic> mutant genotypes. The fluorescence intensity (F.I.) and the thickness (T) of the callosal bundle of axons was measured at various distances (from 0 to 1612 μm) from the callosal commissure, set as distance = 0.

EEG power was computed in the selected frequency ranges: δ range (0.5–4 Hz), θ range (4–8 Hz), α range (8–12 Hz), β range (12–30 Hz) and γ range (30–50 Hz). To normalize the data, EEG power (μV<sup>2</sup>) for each frequency bin within each epoch was calculated as a percentage of the total EEG power (1–56 Hz) of all epochs.</p>
