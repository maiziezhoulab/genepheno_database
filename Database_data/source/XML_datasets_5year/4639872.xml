<p>COMMD protein family member COMMD9 regulates the endosome to plasma membrane trafficking of Notch through a unique COMMD–CCDC22–CCDC93 (CCC) complex.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Notch family members are transmembrane receptors that mediate essential developmental programs. Upon ligand binding, a proteolytic event releases the intracellular domain of Notch, which translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. In addition, Notch trafficking across the endolysosomal system is critical in its regulation. In this study we report that Notch recycling to the cell surface is dependent on the COMMD–CCDC22–CCDC93 (CCC) complex, a recently identified regulator of endosomal trafficking. Disruption in this system leads to intracellular accumulation of Notch2 and concomitant reduction in Notch signaling. Interestingly, among the 10 copper metabolism MURR1 domain containing (COMMD) family members that can associate with the CCC complex, only COMMD9 and its binding partner, COMMD5, have substantial effects on Notch. Furthermore, <italic>Commd9</italic> deletion in mice leads to embryonic lethality and complex cardiovascular alterations that bear hallmarks of Notch deficiency. Altogether, these studies highlight that the CCC complex controls Notch activation by modulating its intracellular trafficking and demonstrate cargo-specific effects for members of the COMMD protein family.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Copper metabolism MURR1 domain containing (COMMD) proteins are a group of highly conserved factors defined by the presence of a unique C-terminal homology domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burstein et al., 2005</xref>). Ten family members can be identified from mammals to unicellular protozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maine and Burstein, 2007</xref>), but little is known about their cellular functions and the underlying reason for their conservation and diversification. Most of our understanding is centered on <italic>COMMD1</italic>, the first identified member of this family that was initially noted to be the site of a recessive mutation that results in copper toxicosis in a particular dog breed, the Bedlington terrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van de Sluis et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism for the accumulation of copper in these animals was initially unclear; however, an interaction between COMMD1 and the copper transporter ATP7B was reported early on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tao et al., 2003</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that COMMD1 regulates the endosomal sorting of the copper transporter ATP7A, such that in the absence of COMMD1, ATP7A is trapped in endosomal vesicles and lacks copper-dependent trafficking to the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to its control of ATP7A/7B trafficking, COMMD1 has been linked to the regulation of other transporters, including epithelial sodium channel, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biasio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drévillon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). However, whether these other transporters are similarly regulated at the level of endosomal sorting remains to be examined. Furthermore, COMMD1 has also been linked to other pathways that are seemingly not connected to the endolysosomal system, including nuclear factor κB regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maine et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Starokadomskyy et al., 2013</xref>) and hypoxia adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van de Sluis et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The role of COMMD1 in endosomal sorting is linked to its incorporation into a larger complex containing the coiled-coil proteins CCDC22 and CCDC93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>). This COMMD–CCDC22–CCDC93 (CCC) complex localizes to endosomes through interactions between CCDC22 and CCDC93 with FAM21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harbour et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freeman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>), a component of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and scar homolog (WASH) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Derivery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomez and Billadeau, 2009</xref>). WASH is a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family of actin nucleation-promoting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rottner et al., 2010</xref>). Through its ability to recruit and activate the ubiquitously expressed Arp2/3 complex, WASH promotes endosomal actin deposition and is required for the maintenance of the architecture of the endolysomal system and to facilitate receptor trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Derivery et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomez and Billadeau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>COMMD proteins are known to interact with each other through their COMM domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burstein et al., 2005</xref>); moreover, all COMMD family members have been shown to interact with the CCC complex component CCDC22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Starokadomskyy et al., 2013</xref>). However, whether other COMMD proteins form distinct CCC entities and can mediate unique functions that distinguish them from COMMD1 has not been elucidated. At the present time, studies addressing functions of other COMMD proteins are scant and include roles in epithelial sodium channel regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), regulation of cell proliferation and repair in kidney injury models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devlin et al., 2003</xref>), effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>), and regulation of IκB protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Starokadomskyy et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we performed an extensive functional analysis of <italic>COMMD9</italic>, a COMMD family member that is frequently deleted in WAGR syndrome (MIM 194072), a congenital condition caused by a microdeletion and haploinsufficiency at 11p13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). We report that COMMD9 is incorporated into the CCC complex and plays a critical role in endosomal sorting of Notch family members. Upon ligand binding, Notch proteins undergo proteolytic cleavage to release the Notch intracellular domain, which in turn translocates to the nucleus and along with cofactors binds gene-promoter regions of chromatin to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kopan, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, extensive work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other models has uncovered that trafficking of Notch proteins through the endolysosomal system is critically important in regulating their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilkin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fortini and Bilder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kandachar and Roegiers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Troost et al., 2012</xref>). Here we describe that in the absence of COMMD9, Notch expression is reduced at the cell surface and Notch2 is missorted into cytosolic vesicles from where it can reach lysosomes, resulting in reduced Notch-dependent signaling. Furthermore, we show that <italic>Commd9</italic> is critically required during mammalian development and that it functions as part of a unique CCC complex.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03" sec-type=""><title>Identification of the COMMD9 interactome</title><p>To begin to understand what unique function COMMD9 might mediate, we used tandem affinity purification to define its protein interactome. To that end, COMMD9 was doubly tagged with a tandem HA tag in its N terminus and a short biotinylation sequence in its C terminus. The protein was immunopurified with an HA antibody first, and on elution, it was purified again using streptavidin resin. The final material, when resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with silver nitrate, demonstrated several unique bands in addition to the purified bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). These bands were excised and subjected to trypsin digestion for proteomic identification by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). This analysis identified 37 interacting proteins with high confidence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp1" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201505108/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). CCDC22, CCDC93, and COMMD5, components of a recently identified regulator of endosomal protein sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Starokadomskyy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>), were found in this purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The Rab proteins RAB5C, RAB7A, and RAB11B, which are present in different endosomal subcompartments, were also found. In addition, several transmembrane surface proteins were also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Among these proteins, Notch2 was identified through four peptides mapping to both the N-terminal extracellular portion of the receptor and its C-terminal tail. This receptor was of interest to us because of its important developmental roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">High and Epstein, 2008</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of COMMD9-interacting proteins.</bold> (A) Tandem affinity purification of COMMD9 (HA and TB tagged) in HEK293 cells was followed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining.

Furthermore, COMMD9 also coimmunoprecipitated Notch1, another family member (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>); in comparison, Notch3 was not coprecipitated to a significant degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s05" sec-type=""><title>COMMD9 and the CCC and retromer complexes regulate surface levels of Notch2</title><p>The CCC complex is a regulator of endosomal sorting events mediated by retromer and WASH, including the endosome-to-surface recycling of the copper transporter ATP7A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>). With this in mind, we reasoned that COMMD9 might similarly regulate the recycling of Notch2 to the plasma membrane. To assess this possibility, we screened a series of Notch2 antibodies and cell lines to identify suitable reagents that allow immunofluorescence staining of the endogenous protein. Among different laboratory variants of HeLa cells, we identified a subline with high expression of Notch2 that is suitable for immunofluorescence staining. Next, we derived <italic>COMMD9</italic> knockout clones of this cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology using two separate guide RNA sequences targeting exon 1 of <italic>COMMD9</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp2" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201505108/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). All three clones had no detectable protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), and genomic analysis demonstrated short deletions in the targeted region (Fig. S1, B and C). In these cells, we identified that the normal surface staining pattern of Notch2 was largely lost, and instead, this was replaced by prominent intracellular vesicular staining for Notch2 in all three clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Furthermore, although the overall Notch2 protein expression was only modestly decreased in these cells, surface protein biotinylation demonstrated a substantial reduction of Notch2 in this fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>), consistent with the reduced plasma membrane staining pattern noted by immunofluorescence staining. In addition, we also examined the nature of the intracellular Notch2 accumulation seen in <italic>COMMD9</italic>-deficient cells. The intracellular Notch2 puncta in <italic>COMMD9</italic>-deficient cells partly colocalized with EEA1, and to a lesser extent with VPS35 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp3" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201505108/DC1">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>). Consistent with the notion that these puncta represent early endosomes, Rab5 colocalized with Notch2 in <italic>COMMD9</italic>-deficient cells, whereas the colocalization with the recycling endosome marker Rab11 was poor (Fig. S2 C).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>COMMD9 regulates the surface localization of Notch2.</bold> (A) Generation of COMMD9-deleted HeLa cells with CRISPR/Cas9 technology (Cr-COMMD9).

Surface biotinylation experiments demonstrated that the rescued lines had increased Notch2 levels at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>), indicating that this cellular phenotype is rescued by COMMD9 re-expression. Furthermore, silencing of CCDC93 or C16orf62 (two additional components of the CCC complex) also led to reduced plasma membrane staining for Notch2, a pattern also observed on silencing of VPS35 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp4" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201505108/DC1">Fig. S3, A and B</ext-link>), a subunit of the retromer complex which is important for WASH recruitment and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harbour et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jia et al., 2012</xref>). Altogether, these findings indicate that the absence of COMMD9 and associated factors results in the accumulation of Notch2 in the early endosomal compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s06" sec-type=""><title>COMMD9 is required for optimal Notch signaling</title><p>Next we assessed the effects of COMMD9 on Notch-dependent gene expression. <italic>COMMD9</italic>-deficient HeLa cell clones displayed decreased basal expression of several Notch-dependent genes, but this HeLa subline proved to be poorly responsive to stimulation with exogenous Jagged1 ligand (unpublished data). Therefore, we used alternative models to investigate this question. First, U2OS cells with stable silencing or stable overexpression of COMMD9 were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Using Jagged1 as ligand for Notch stimulation, we noted that COMMD9 silencing led to reduced induction of <italic>HEY1</italic>, a Notch target gene, whereas overexpression of COMMD9 had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Furthermore, these cells were transfected with a Notch-responsive luciferase reporter containing a promoter with multimerized RBPj binding elements. Here we observed that the effects of COMMD9 expression on the Notch reporter were concordant with the observed effects on <italic>HEY1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>), consistent with the notion that endogenous <italic>HEY1</italic> gene expression was indeed affected through a Notch-dependent event.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>COMMD9 deficiency impairs Notch-dependent gene expression. </bold>(A) U2OS cells stably deficient in COMMD9 or expressing HA-COMMD9 were generated using lentiviral vectors.

Several other morphologic changes were noted, most notably in the cardiovascular system. Hypoplasia of the heart was a universal finding at E10.5 and beyond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>), with foci of focal wall necrosis and pericardial bleeding noted by E11.5 (Fig. S4 F). Furthermore, mutant embryos displayed several vascular changes, including focal narrowing of the dorsal aortas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Whole-mount immunohistochemistry staining for the endothelial marker Pecam1 revealed additional alterations in cranial blood vessels, particularly a dramatic reduction in truncal vessels connected to the distal capillary networks (Fig. S4 G). Further analysis with markers of arterial (Cx40) and venous (Apj) vessels revealed normal arterial structures but substantial changes in venous vasculature formation, with ectatic dilations noted in the embryo’s head (Fig. S4 H). To assess if these changes were at least in part related to altered Notch signaling, we isolated heart mRNA from somite-matched embryos at E10.5.

Therefore, despite the similarities between these proteins, they serve nonredundant developmental functions that cannot be compensated by other COMMD proteins. To try to understand the potential basis for the specific effects noted for COMMD9 deficiency, we examined whether COMMD9 exists in a complex that is distinguishable from COMMD1. A side-by-side comparison of endogenous COMMD proteins associating with COMMD9 and COMMD1 indicated that both proteins coimmunoprecipitated with each other and result in similar recovery of several COMMD proteins, such as COMMD2, COMMD4, COMMD6, and COMMD8 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp6" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201505108/DC1">Fig. S5 A</ext-link>). However, COMMD5 and COMMD10 bound preferentially to COMMD9 over COMMD1. This suggested that COMMD9 and COMMD1 might coexist in overlapping but not identical complexes, and in agreement with this, different ratios of COMMD9 and COMMD1 recovery were noted in each immunoprecipitation (Fig. S5 A).</p><p>In an additional analysis, five COMMD proteins were immunoprecipitated, demonstrating once again that COMMD9 was best immunoprecipitated by COMMD5 and COMMD10 (Fig. S5 B). Furthermore, COMMD5 was also more abundant in COMMD9 and COMMD10 immunoprecipitations, and the equivalent observation was made regarding COMMD10 (Fig. S5 B). In contrast, COMMD4 and COMMD6 only coimmunoprecipitated minimal amounts of COMMD5, COMMD9, and COMMD10. Corresponding to these interactions, COMMD9 and COMMD5 were found to colocalize in cytosolic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

Collectively, these data suggest that COMMD9 forms unique COMMD heterocomplexes in cells that are required for the trafficking of Notch receptors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study sheds light into a previously unappreciated role for COMMD9 in vesicular sorting and the delivery of Notch proteins to the cell surface. Absent COMMD9, Notch is mislocalized in intracellular early endosomes, and the response to Notch ligands is substantially attenuated. Furthermore, our studies indicate that Notch is not only mislocalized but also undergoes lysosomal degradation. Interestingly, we found that similar phenotypes are observed in cells deficient in CCC components CCDC93 and C16orf62 and the retromer subunit VPS35. This latter complex, which is critically important for the endosomal recycling of a large number of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seaman et al., 2013</xref>), has not been previously linked to Notch trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The observation that COMMD9-dependent effects on Notch trafficking can dramatically affect signaling is in line with a large body of literature that demonstrates that trafficking through the endolysosomal system is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to regulate Notch activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baron, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kandachar and Roegiers, 2012</xref>). Notch is constantly endocytosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGill et al., 2009</xref>), and the signaling outcome arising from this internalized pool of Notch is carefully controlled by several factors. On the one hand, the protein Numb is a conserved inhibitor of the pathway that acts at this level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Couturier et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reichardt and Knoblich, 2013</xref>). This factor interacts with components of the AP-2 complex and prevents endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling of Notch; in addition, Numb also promotes the lysosomal degradation of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGill et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, Deltex, an E3 ligase, has been shown to promote Notch signaling in a ligand-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sakata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilkin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hori et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Troost et al., 2012</xref>). Acting in concert with the homotypic fusion and protein sorting complex and Rab7, Deltex promotes the trafficking of Notch to late endosomes. Interestingly, in this pathway, the localization of Notch is restricted to the limiting membrane of late endosomes, preventing the entry of the receptors into the multivesicular body. From this location, a ligand-independent cleavage event is thought to occur, resulting in pathway activation. Countering Deltex are HECT domain–containing ligases, such as Itch in mammals and Suppressor of Deltex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chastagner et al., 2006</xref>), which promote the entry of Notch into the multivesicular body, resulting in its degradation.</p><p>Another intriguing observation made here is that the CCC complex, previously shown to regulate retromer/WASH-dependent endosomal trafficking, can have distinct configurations dictated by the incorporation of specific COMMD protein complexes. We show that COMMD5 and COMMD10 interact preferentially with COMMD9 and depend on this protein for their interaction with the CCC complex. The data further suggest that COMMD9–COMMD5 complexes are particularly important for Notch trafficking and can bind with the cytoplasmic tail of Notch2 in vitro. This raises the possibility that distinct CCC subcomplexes are generated to regulate specific cargoes and that perhaps COMMD proteins assist in cargo selection in this pathway.</p><p>In addition, it is reasonable to speculate that COMMD9 is likely to regulate many more receptors besides Notch. The identification of additional COMMD9-regulated cargoes will require proteome-wide analyses, such as those recently used to uncover retromer-regulated cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>). This information would likely provide key insights that will be important to understand the developmental phenotypes resulting from <italic>Commd9</italic> deficiency. Our analysis identified several vascular and cardiac alterations, but the phenotype could not be ascribed entirely to the deficiency of a singular Notch receptor. For example, Notch1 deficiency has more prominent effects on arterial fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lawson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gridley, 2010</xref>) rather than the phenotype in the venous vasculature observed here. Isolated <italic>Notch2</italic> deficiency is embryonically lethal at about the same stage as <italic>Commd9</italic> deficiency and is also associated with cardiac hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamada et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCright et al., 2006</xref>), but only a small percentage of these mutant embryos exhibit neural and abdominal hemorrhages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), as we routinely saw in <italic>Commd9</italic>-deficient embryos. Although <italic>Notch3</italic> deficiency is viable, combined <italic>Notch2/Notch3</italic> recapitulated more aspects of the phenotype of <italic>Commd9</italic>-deficient embryos. For example, concurrent deficiency of these factors results in frequent obstructions of the dorsal aortas and also leads to frequent cerebral and abdominal hemorrhages, as we saw here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). However, this phenotype in <italic>Notch2/Notch3</italic>-deficient embryos is largely driven by smooth muscle–dependent signals; in contrast, smooth muscle deletion of <italic>Commd9</italic> did not recapitulate the embryonic lethality. Altogether, our interpretation is that the developmental phenotypes in <italic>Commd9</italic>-deficient embryos are likely the result of alterations in additional receptors. In this regard, the fact that <italic>COMMD9</italic> is frequently included in the genomic interval deleted in WAGR syndrome highlights the biomedical importance of understanding these events. Patients with WAGR are affected by a high risk for Wilms’ tumors and have several congenital anomalies, including aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, intellectual disability, and frequent cardiac anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischbach et al., 2005</xref>). We examined our heterozygote mice for any of these phenotypes and found no overt pathology, but cooperation between <italic>COMMD9</italic> and other genes may be relevant to the human condition.</p><p>In summary, this study identifies that COMMD9, acting in concert with the CCC and retromer complexes, regulates the endosomal sorting of Notch and its delivery to the cell surface. This constitutes a regulatory step in the Notch pathway that has not been previously appreciated. Future studies are likely to uncover that members of the COMMD protein family play similarly critical roles in the endosomal sorting of other important cell-surface receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s13" sec-type=""><title>Mouse strains</title><p>Mice were housed in conventional facilities and fed a standard diet.

A series of bacterial expression vectors were generated through conventional cloning techniques and include pET30a-His-COMMD1 (expressing His-tagged COMMD1), pGEX-4T1-GST-COMMD6 (expressing GST-tagged COMMD6), pRSF-His-COMMD9 (expressing His-tagged COMMD9), and p15Cool2-MBP-COMMD5 (expressing MBP-tagged COMMD5. The Notch reporter plasmid Notch-CBF1 contains multimerized RBPj binding sites and was shared by L. Lum with permission from the original developers of the construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baladrón et al., 2005</xref>). The pcDNA-human Notch2FL vector, which expresses full-length untagged Notch2, was provided by Artavanis-Tsakonas Lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zagouras et al., 1995</xref>). pEBB-2xHA-human Notch2 C terminus (intracellular domain) was PCR amplified from pcDNA-human Notch2FL and cloned into BamHI–NotI sites of pEBB-2xHA vector. For lentiviral expression of HA-tagged COMMD9, we used the lentiviral FG9 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wright and Duckett, 2009</xref>). After cloning into the XbaI sites, we generated the FG9-PuroR-HA-COMMD9 vector. A “CRISPR-resistant” version of COMMD9 was introduced into a lentiviral vector (FG9-HygroR-2xHA-Crispr resistant COMMD9) after introducing silent mutations in COMMD9 (site-directed mutagenesis kit; Agilent Technologies) using the following primer: 5′-GCAAGATGGCTGCCCT<underline>A</underline>AC<underline>G</underline>GC<underline>A</underline>GAGCATTTTGCAGCAC-3′ (mutated nucleotides are underlined). The siRNA duplexes used in this study are described in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp7" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201505108/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>. Stable shRNA-mediated silencing was performed using the lentiviral vector pLKO.TRC. CRISPR-mediated inactivation of COMMD9 was performed through stable expression of a targeting guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9, using the pLENTI-CRISPR vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>). Deleted clones were isolated through limiting dilution and screened for COMMD9 expression by immunoblot. Genomic DNA was isolated from individual clones, and genomic regions around the targeted area were amplified using the following primers: forward (5′-TCTCGGGGTTTAGTCATCCAGCC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGCAGGAGGTTGTATTGCGCCT-3′). These PCR products were cloned into PCR 2.1 TA vector (Life Technologies), and individual clones were sequenced. Nested PCR to obtain a shorter 283-bp product was performed using primers as forward (5′-ACCACAACCGAAACGCCTTCCC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGCAGCAGAGTTGTGGCTCCAA-3′). The resulting amplified products were resolved in 3% Nu-Sieve agarose gels. All targeting sequences used in the various approaches mentioned here are noted in Table S2.</p></sec><sec id="s16" sec-type=""><title>Transfection and viral transduction</title><p>The following transfection reagents were used: calcium phosphate (for plasmids and siRNA in HEK293T cells), Fugene (Roche, for plasmids in U2OS cells), and RNAiMAX (for siRNA in HeLa cells; Life Technologies). Lentiviral production was achieved through transient transfection of HEK293T cells with packaging and expression lentiviral vectors. Culture supernatants containing viral particles were harvested 48 h later, and after filtration through a 0.45-µm filter, this supernatant was applied to the intended cell target. The lentiviral expression vectors used here included puromycin or hygromycin resistance as selection markers, which were used to select stably transduced cells as described previously in more detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maine et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s17" sec-type=""><title>RNA extraction and RT-PCR</title><p>RNA extraction from cultured cells was performed using the Trizol method (Life Technologies) according to standard protocols.

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using a Triton X-100 lysis buffer (25 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). All Western blots presented in this paper are representative of at least three independent iterations for each experiment. Luciferase assays were performed by transfecting the luciferase reporter plasmid vector (Notch-CBF1) into U2OS cells. After 24 h, the cells were lysed, and 10 µl whole-cell lysate was loaded onto a 96-well luminometer plate. Luciferase substrate (Promega) was injected, and light emission was measured using a luminometer plate reader (EnVision; PerkinElmer), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burstein et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s19" sec-type=""><title>In vitro binding assay</title><p>Bacterial expressing plasmids were individually transformed or cotransformed into to <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells (Invitrogen). All cells were grown in LB at 37°C with appropriate antibiotics until OD600 reached 0.6, and they were then shifted to 25°C for at least 30 min. Proteins were expressed at 25°C for 12–16 h by induction with 0.4 mM IPTG. Cells were resuspended in PBS buffer supplied with β-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min. For MBP-COMMD5, MBP-COMMD5/His-COMMD1, and MBP-COMMD5/His-COMMD9, clarified supernatant was purified using Amylose resin (NEB). For His-COMMD1/GST-COMMD6, supernatant was purified using glutathione agarose affinity resin (Molecular Probe). After incubation at 4°C for 30 min, the resin was washed four times with PBS buffer. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with maltose and glutathione.</p><p>pEBB-2xHA-Notch2 C terminus was expressed in HEK293T cells, and Notch2-C was immunoprecipitated with HA-affinity beads (Roche). After extensive washing, the protein was eluted from the column with excess HA peptide (Anaspec). GST and His-COMMD1/GST-COMMD6 elution were rebound to glutathione resin. MBP, MBP-COMMD5, and MBP-COMMD5/His-COMMD9 elution were rebound to Amylose resin. The beads bound to these recombinant COMMD complexes were blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h at 4°C. Eluted Notch2-C was then mixed for 1 h at 4°C with COMMD complexes immobilized onto beads. After extensive washing of these beads, the material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with HA antibody to detect 2xHA-Notch2 C terminus. The SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Coomassie blue.</p></sec><sec id="s20" sec-type=""><title>Antibodies</title><p>All other antibodies used in this study are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp9" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201505108/DC1">Table S4</ext-link>. COMMD protein antibodies were generated by immunizing rats (COMMD1, COMMD2, and COMMD3), rabbits (COMMD4, COMMD5, COMMD9, and COMMD10), and guinea pigs (COMMD8) with recombinant GST fusion proteins encoding the N-terminal regions (proximal to the COMM domains) of the respective COMMD proteins (Cocalico Biologicals). The obtained sera were thereafter affinity purified using a His<sub>6</sub>-tagged version of the respective immunogen (AminoLink Coupling Resin and Immobilization kit; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The antibodies were characterized by testing their ability to recognize FLAG-tagged protein expressed in HEK293 cells without cross reactivity to other COMMDs and to recognize endogenous protein (using siRNA as an additional control). Previously made custom antibodies to COMMD1, COMMD6, and COMMD9 have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Starokadomskyy et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s21" sec-type=""><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p>Cell staining was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015</xref>).

The fluorochromes used in the secondary antibodies used for staining were Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen). Images were obtained at room temperature using any of the following confocal microscopes: LSM 510 (63×/1.4 oil immersion objective lens; Carl Zeiss), LSM 710 (63×/1.4 oil immersion objective lens; Carl Zeiss), or A1R (60×/1.4 oil immersion objective lens; Nikon).

In brief, NHSSS-biotin (Pierce) dissolved in biotinylation buffer (10 mM triethanolamine, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 8.0) was used for surface labeling at 4°C for 30 min. The biotinylated antigens were precipitated using NeutrAvidin agarose resin (Pierce). Precipitated protein-containing beads were then resuspended in LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies) with 250 mM DTT. Proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and membranes were probed for Notch2 and N-cadherin.</p></sec><sec id="s23" sec-type=""><title>Tandem affinity purification</title><p>This was performed by sequential purification through HA binding resin (Roche) and Streptavidin agarose (Pierce). In brief, 10 plates of seeded HEK 293 cells (15 cm each) were transfected with pEBB-2xHA-TB or pEBB-2xHA-COMMD9-TB. Two days later, a cell lysate was prepared in Triton X-100 lysis buffer as described in the Protein extraction section. The lysate was incubated with HA binding resin at 4°C for 2 h. At that point, the bait was eluted three times using excess HA peptide (1 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA). This pooled eluate was applied to a streptavidin agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C. Subsequently, the beads were washed extensively, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie stain, bands were excised and submitted to the Proteomics core at University of Texas Southwestern for trypsin digestion and peptide identification through LC/MS-MS analysis protein identification. A repeat iteration of this experiment was performed nearly identically except that most of the precipitated material bound to beads was submitted to the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility. A small aliquot of the precipitated material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained using silver nitrate (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s24" sec-type=""><title>Embryological analysis</title><p>Timed pregnancies were setup to allow embryo harvesting at specified embryologic stages. Yolk sacs were used as a source of DNA for genotyping. For conventional histologic analysis (HE sections), the embryos were rinsed in PBS and then fixed in 4% PFA in 1× PBS overnight at 4°C with gentle rocking. Thereafter, embryos were dehydrated and stored in 75% ethanol at −20°C. For paraffin embedding, embryos were washed twice in 100% ethanol and xylene for 1 h each, followed by a series of rinses in 100% Paraplast Plus tissue embedding medium (McCormick) at 60°C. Subsequently, these embryos were paraffin embedded, sectioned, and stained according to standard techniques. For immunofluorescence, fixed embryos were rehydrated in stepwise fashion to 1× PBS and rinsed in 30% sucrose overnight at 4°C. The embryos were then embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound and sectioned at 10 µm using a cryostat. Antigen retrieval was performed using Buffer A solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences). The slides were washed in 1× PBS and blocked for 1 h in Cas-Block (Invitrogen) before primary antibodies were added for overnight incubation at 4°C. Signals were detected the following day using fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. The slides were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen). Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). In brief, the fixed embryos were treated with proteinase K, fixed in a 0.25% glutaraldehyde and 4% PFA solution, and prehybridized at 60°C for 1 h. The samples were transferred into hybridization mix, containing a digoxigenin-labeled probe. Further in situ hybridization steps were performed with a series of washing buffer, and then development of color reaction was done using BM purple (Roche). RNA probes were generated from the following clones: Apj (BC039224; Open Biosystems) and Cx40 (BC053054; Open Biosystems). Whole-embryo images were obtained with a Stemi 2000-C stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss) at magnification of 12.5, using a Canon PowerShot G10 camera and AxioVision Rel 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss).
