<title>Background</title>
<p>Moebius Sequence (MS) is a rare disorder defined by bilateral congenital paralysis of the abducens and facial nerves in combination with various odontological, craniofacial, ophthalmological and orthopaedic conditions. The aetiology is still unknown; but both genetic (de novo mutations) and vascular events in utero are reported. The purpose of present study was through a multidisciplinary clinical approach to examine children diagnosed with Moebius-like symptoms. Ten children underwent odontological, ophthalmological, obstetric, paediatric, orthopaedic, genetic, radiological and photographical evaluation. Five patients maintained the diagnosis of MS according to the diagnostic criteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>All five patients had bilateral facial and abducens paralysis confirmed by ophthalmological examination. Three of five had normal brain MR imaging. Two had missing facial nerves and one had missing abducens nerves. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) showed normal scores in three of five patients. Interestingly, two of five children were born to mothers with uterine abnormalities (unicornuate/bicornuate uterus). In the odontological examination three of five showed enamel hypomineralisation. All five had abnormal orofacial motor function and maxillary prognathism. Two patients had adactyly, syndactyly and brachydactyly. None of the five patients had Poland anomaly, hip dislocation or dysplasia but all had a mild degree of scoliosis. We observed congenital club-feet, calcaneovalgus deformities, macrodactyly of one or more toes or curly toes. Pedobarography showed plantar pressures within normal ranges.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Adherence to standard diagnostic criteria is central in the diagnosis of MS. An accurate diagnosis is the basis for correct discussion of other relevant concomitant symptoms of MS, genetic testing and evaluation of prognosis. The multidisciplinary approach and adherence to diagnostic criteria taken in present study increases the knowledge on the relationship between genotype, phenotype and symptomatology of MS.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Moebius Sequence (MS) (OMIM 157900), previously known as Moebius syndrome, is a rare disorder defined by congenital paralysis of the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> cranial nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The disorder is congenital with chronic consequenses and is previously diagnosed after birth or during early infancy by the child’s facial features. Paralysis of other cranial nerves, malformations of orofacial structures, and limb anomalies may also be present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The incidence of MS varies from 0.00002 to 0.002% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with a sex ratio of 1:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], although a Swedish study found a female-male-ratio of 1:3 and a high occurrence of misdiagnosis. The term <italic>sequence</italic> is preferred to <italic>syndrome</italic> since it defines a cascade of secondary events after an initial insult during the embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in addition to a possible genetic aetiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A large heterogenic group of syndromes with variable symptoms of uni- or bilateral facial and abducens paralysis in conjunction with a range of other systemic anomalies have been described. Different opinions on how to differentiate between these conditions have resulted in varying diagnostic criteria for MS and consequently a bias in published case reports and studies on MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. MS belongs to a large group of similar syndromes called “Oro-Mandibular-Limb hypogenesis syndrome” (OMLH) characterised by varying cranial nerve palsies and craniofacial and limb anomalies sometimes combined with aplasia of the pectoral muscle (Poland anomaly) among others Robin complex, Moebius-like syndrome, Carey-Fineman-Ziter Syndrome, Hanhart, hypoglossia-hypodactyly and glossopalatinus ankylosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The aetiology of MS is unknown. Most cases are sporadic but familial occurrence has been reported. Both genetic and non-genetic factors are believed to be significant for the development of MS. Non-genetic causes are primarily thought to involve vascular events with interruption or alteration of the blood supply of the embryo causing damage to cranial nerve centres leading to an abnormal positioning of the foetus causing unusual pressure in parts of the developing brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Secondary causes include exposure to teratogens in early pregnancy (benzodiazepines, misoprostols, thalidomide, cocaine, alcohol, hyperthermia, hypoxia and rubella) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Regarding the genetics factors of MS two different loci for MS at 3q21-q22 and 10q, respectively, have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recently, Tomas-Roca et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] reported de novo mutations in MS patients affecting the <italic>PLXND1</italic> and <italic>REV3L</italic> genes which cause a defect in the facial branchiomotor neuron migration supporting these genes as causative for a proportion of MS cases.</p>
<p>Other concomitant symptoms in MS include paralysis of other cranial nerves, malformation of the orofacial skeleton and anomalies of the extremities, most often club-feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Oral manifestations may present as hypodontia, cleft palate, mandibular hypoplasia, abnormal tongue movements and incompetent lip closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Functional abnormalities of face and mouth have been reported: lack of facial expression, difficulties in speaking, eating, swallowing and restricted mouth opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Comorbidities of MS include language difficulties, no ability to smile and a risk of a wrongful diagnosis of mental retardation. A study found that patients with MS had the same intelligence, memory and ability to concentrate as the background population. In addition almost all school-age children with MS below 17 years children were found to attend normal elementary or secondary schools indicating normal developmental milestones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Other studies have reported a notably higher incidence of autism in patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>MS is complex and entails lifelong treatment and knowledge of the disorder is sparse. A multidisciplinary clinically approach is necessary in order to optimize the diagnosis, treatment and advice given to these patients. In the present study, we invited all patients in the Western part of Denmark known to have MS or a Moebius-like Syndrome to a multidisciplinary evaluation including odontological, ophthalmological, obstetric, paediatric, orthopaedic, genetic, radiological and photographical evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>On initial search in the Danish National Patient Register, our clinical practices and the Danish Moebius Patients’ Association, 21 patients were identified and 16 patients from the western part of Denmark were invited to participate in the present study. The study was approved by the Central Denmark Region Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics no. 2010-41-5212 and the Danish Data Protection Agency. Six patients declined to participate due to logistic factors and ten patients accepted. Informed written consent from both parents was obtained. In total ten children were enrolled in this study at Aarhus University Hospital from 2012 to 2013. The inclusion process is presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>. In this study we define MS as congenital bilateral paralysis of the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> cranial nerves.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Consort 2010 Flow Diagram of the inclusion process</p></caption><graphic id="MO1" xlink:href="13023_2016_559_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p>A multidisciplinary set-up including paediatrics, ophthalmology, odontology, genetics, obstetrics, radiology and orthopaedics examined all patients. Data were obtained from interviews and questionnaires by patients and parents as well as from clinical examination of the patient including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Cognitive aspects (development disorders, mental retardation and autism) and neuro-psychiatric aspects were assessed by a parent questionnaire (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires, SDQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore medical records were reviewed.</p>
<p>Genetic evaluation included drawing up a pedigree for each family and collection of information on Moebius-like symptoms in relatives and parental consanguinity. Results from previous genetic tests were obtained from medical records, and the results of chromosome analysis from the Danish Cytogenetic Central Register.</p>
<p>Obstetric and neonatal evaluation included information on maternal exposure and complications in pregnancy and birth (in particular the foetal presentation, instrumental and active delivery methods e.g. McRobert manoeuvre, vacuum- and forceps delivery and caesarean section). Data were obtained on birth weight, birth length and head circumference, Apgar score, umbilical pH measure, nutritional problems (including use of stomach tube), icterus, hypoglycaemia, antibiotics and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.</p>
<p>Ophthalmological examinations included a full eye examination focusing on eye motility as well as full standard ophthalmological and orthoptic examination.</p>
<p>The odontological and craniofacial examination was clinical and radiological. The clinical examination included a visual assessment of dental anomalies, dental status (number of teeth, decayed, missed or filled surfaces due to caries (DMFS)), presence of dental erosion, dental occlusion (molar occlusion, horizontal overbite (HOB), and vertical overbite (VOB) in mm), gingival health (no. of incisors and first molars with bleeding on probing), and morphological characteristics of the tongue. In addition, the mouth opening capacity (MOC) (i.e., maximal interincisal distance on unassisted mouth opening + VOB) was compared to a reference value (the mean value in 20719 unselected children, 4–17 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and signs of temporomandibular dysfunction were assessed. The orofacial motor function was tested by The Nordic Orofacial Test- Screening (NOT-S) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The radiological examination included a visual assessment of radiological signs on dental or craniofacial anomaly and pathology of the temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ). A cephalometric evaluation of the craniofacial morphology was performed according to a modification of the method by Bjørk and Solow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Orthopaedic examinations included a complete history of orthopaedic complaints and previous surgery. Physical examination included visual evaluation of known deformities, range of motion testing, height and weight measurements. Assessments of limb hypoplasia, adactyly, syndactyly, camptodactyly, brachydactyly, Poland anomaly, scoliosis, leg length discrepancies, talipes equinovarus, pes calcaneovalgus, pes cavus, macrodactyly, curly toes, general malformations and hip dislocation were made. Four of five patients were examined with both static and dynamic pedobarography using the HRMAT Tekscan (Clin Seat Type 5315 Sensor, Tekscan, Boston, Mass, USA) to assess balance parameters as well as total and regional plantar pressure, area and force.</p>
<p>Clinical appearance was documented with clinical photographs of full body (back and front), hands (dorsal and ventral aspects), feet, standing (dorsal, anterior and posterior aspects), face (front, 45° right/left, 90° right/left), eyes (relaxed, closed, attempting to look right/left) and teeth (front, 45° right/left, upper, lower).</p>
<p>Radiological examinations included x-rays of the feet standing (dorsal and lateral aspects), hands (dorsal aspect), thorax (PA aspect), pelvis (PA aspect) and spine (PA, lateral). If the patient had undergone a recent radiographic examination the relevant view was omitted.</p>

<title>Patients not meeting MS diagnostic criteria defined for this study</title>
<p>In five patients, the diagnosis of MS was withdrawn after examination by the multidisciplinary team since they did not have bilateral facial and abducens paralysis (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patients not meeting MS diagnostic criteria defined for this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Facial paralysis</th><th>Abducens paralysis</th><th>Symptoms/findings</th><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>No. 6</td><td>Unilateral</td><td>No</td><td>Hypermetropia, Achilles contracture</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td>No. 7</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Fibrotic eye muscles, divergent strabismus, bilateral clubfeet, leukomalasia of the cerebrum with periventricular pathologies</td><td>Congenital Fibrosis of Extraocular Muscles type 3A (OMIM #600638) and Artrogryposis Multiplex Congenita</td></tr><tr><td>No. 8</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Congenital vocal cord paralysis</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td>No. 9</td><td>Affected</td><td>Unilateral</td><td>Apraxia of the oculomotor nerves, midfacial hypoplasia, unilateral club-foot, anisomelia, Poland</td><td>Artrogryposis Multiplex Congenita.</td></tr><tr><td>No. 10</td><td>Unilateral</td><td>No</td><td>Congenital syringomelia, anal atresia, hypospadia, fibula atresia, cruciate ligament aplasia</td><td>Unknown</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>In this study we define MS as congenital bilateral paralysis of the facial and abducens nerves</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>

<title>Genetic findings</title>
<p>After evaluation five patients maintained the diagnosis of MS. All five patients were isolated cases without a family history of Moebius-like symptoms, and without parental consanguinity. Normal karyotypes were registered for all five patients using standard chromosome analysis in Q-banding of cultured lymphocytes from peripheral blood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">
<title>Obstetric findings</title>
<p>The obstetric outcomes for the children with a MS diagnosis were generally normal (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>). All children were conceived spontaneously. Four out of five children were born to nulliparous women at term. However, two children were born late preterm in week 35 and 36, respectively. Four out of five children were born vaginally in cephalic presentation. One child was delivered by cesarean section in breech presentation. Successfully versio externa in pregnancy was performed in patient no 4. Four out of five children had an Apgar score of 10 at five minutes. Breastfeeding was established in two out of five children during hospital stay. All mothers had good physical and mental health in the pre-pregnancy period as well as during pregnancy. However, it is noteworthy that two of the mothers had been diagnosed with uterine abnormalities; a unicornuate (patient no. 5) and bicornuate uterus (patient no. 4), respectively.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of symptomatology in five patients with MS</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th></th><th>No. 1</th><th>No. 2</th><th>No. 3</th><th>No. 4</th><th>No. 5</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6">Baseline demographics</td></tr><tr><td> Age (yrs)</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>18</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td> Sex (M: Male, F: Female)</td><td>M</td><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr><tr><td> Height (cm)</td><td>103</td><td>137</td><td>166.5</td><td>167</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td> Weight (kg)</td><td>16.5</td><td>30.3</td><td>47.5</td><td>60</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Mental and developmental</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"> Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)</td></tr><tr><td>  Overall Stress (0–13)</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>14</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>  Emotional distress (0–2)</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>  Behavioural difficulties (0–3)</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>  Hyperactivity and concentration difficulties (0–5)</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>  Difficulties getting along with other children (0–2)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>  Kind and helpful behavior (7–10)</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>  Impact of any difficulties on the child’s life (0)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"> Diagnostic predictions LR: Low Risk, MR: Medium Risk</td></tr><tr><td>  Any disorder</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td><td>MR</td><td>LR</td></tr><tr><td>  Emotional disorder (anxiety, depression etc.)</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td><td>MR</td><td>LR</td></tr><tr><td>  Behavioural disorder</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td></tr><tr><td>  Hyperactivity or concentration disorder</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td><td>LR</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Obstetrics</td></tr><tr><td> Conception (S:Spontaneous)</td><td>S</td><td>S</td><td>S</td><td>S</td><td>S</td></tr><tr><td> Mothers parity (0:nullipara, 1:multipara)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td> Mothers uterus</td><td>normal</td><td>normal</td><td>normal</td><td>bicornuate</td><td>unicornuate</td></tr><tr><td> Gestational age (weeks)</td><td>41</td><td>40</td><td>35</td><td>39</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td> Birth weight (grams)</td><td>3240</td><td>3600</td><td>1950</td><td>3500</td><td>2135</td></tr><tr><td> Fetal presentation (C:cephalic, B: breach)</td><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td> Delivery mode (V: vaginal, CS: caesarean section)</td><td>V</td><td>V</td><td>V</td><td>V</td><td>CS</td></tr><tr><td> Apgar Score (1 &amp; 5 min)</td><td>5/10</td><td>10/10</td><td>10/10</td><td>10/10</td><td>6/7</td></tr><tr><td> Breastfeeding Established</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Ophthalmology</td></tr><tr><td> Abducens paralysis</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td> Facial paralysis</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td> Previous strabismus surgery</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td> Lacrimation abnormality</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Odontology</td></tr><tr><td> DMFS <sup>a</sup>

<title>Mental and developmental findings</title>
<p>None of the children with a MS diagnosis were diagnosed with a mental or developmental disorder according to <italic>The International Classification of Diseases</italic> (ICD). Results from <italic>The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</italic> (SDQ) revealed that three out of the five children had a normal SDQ score. One child had a slightly elevated score on “impact of any difficulties on the child’s life” which is not found to indicate any level of risk in the diagnostic predictions. Another child had elevated scores on four items (overall stress, emotional distress, difficulties getting along with other children, and impact of any difficulties on the child’s life). Transformed to diagnostic predictions, the child was considered to have a medium risk for “any disorder” and “emotional disorder” such as anxiety and depression (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>).</p>

<title>Ophthalmological findings</title>
<p>All five patients underwent ophthalmological examination but in some of the patients full assessments were not possible or difficult to obtain. Ophthalmological examination revealed bilateral 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> nerve palsies in all five patients, verifying the diagnosis of MS. The visual acuity of separate eyes ranged from 0.08 to 1.6. Three of five had previously undergone strabismus surgery (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>). All five had lagophthalmus. Two of five patients had abnormal tearing with one patient (patient no. 4) having a lacrimation abnormality known as ‘crocodile tears’ (tearing due to gustatory stimuli) and one patient (patient no. 5) having severely decreased lacrimation and needed treatment. Four patients could cooperate with a corneal examination and had normal corneal sensibility.</p>

<sec id="Sec11">
<title>Odontological findings</title>
<p>All five participants underwent dental and orthodontic clinical examination. Patient no 1 could not comply with the cephalometric examination.</p>
<p>The main odontological and cephalometric results are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>. Furthermore, agenesis of a maxillary lateral incisor was revealed in one patient (patient no. 3), and in one patient, the dentition was affected by erosion (patient no. 5). The temporomandibular function was assessed in the four girls, only. None had temporomandibular dysfunction. During the NOT-S-interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], two patients reported some oral habits (e.g., nail-biting and sucking of lip- or cheek), two patients reported daily drooling, and one patient reported both dryness of the mouth and difficulties in chewing and swallowing. During the NOT-S-examination, three patients had deviations in their face at rest (asymmetry, permanently disclosed lips), and two patients were not able to perform nose-breathing during lip closure. Four patients had poor facial expression (unable to close their eyes tightly, to smile, or to whistle/blow), and three patients had poor orofacial motor function (restricted movements of the tongue, unable to “blow up” their cheeks, or unable to elevate uvula and the soft palate). Only one patient had affected speech according to NOT-S. Except for patient no. 1, none of the patients were able to close their lips. They were able to force the lower lip into contact with the upper incisors, but the labial surfaces of the upper incisors remained partly uncovered by the upper lips (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>The radiological assessment revealed no craniofacial anomaly and no signs of TMJ deformity. In comparison with reference-values, all cephalometrically assessed patients had a large maxillary prognathism in relation to the anterior cranial base (ACB) thus, having relatively retrognathic mandibles. In addition, the mandibular alveolar prognathism in relation to the mandibular base was large. Two patients had marked divergent jaw-bases (patient no. 4 and 5). In one of them this was caused by a marked reduction of the maxillary inclination in relation to the ACB resulting in an anterior open bite. In the other patient, it was caused by an increased mandibular inclination in relation to ACB but with a normal overbite (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Conebeam CT scanning with 3D-reconstruction of craniofacial structures of two patients with Moebius.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study we have set up diagnostic criteria and examined all patients with MS or a Moebius-like diagnosis. Only half of the examined patients could maintain the diagnosis of MS. This adheres to a recent study by MacKinnon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], who found that 19% of the enrolled patients did not meet the minimum diagnostic criteria (MDC) which they defined as ‘a congenital, uni- or bilateral, nonprogressive facial weakness and limited abduction of the eye(s) and full vertical motility’. Opposite, the diagnostic criteria for present study were defined as <italic>bilateral</italic>, congenital facial and abducens paralysis, which even further reduces the number of patients maintaining the diagnosis of MS.</p>
<p>The advantage of the present study is the multidisciplinary approach taken, which gives a thorough analysis of all symptoms in the evaluated group of patients with validated MS. An immense range of symptoms have been reported relating to MS but only a few are diagnostically relevant. Bilateral facial and abducens paralysis are of importance since accurate diagnosis is the basis for correct discussion of other relevant concomitant symptoms of MS, genetic testing and evaluation of prognosis. Therefore, the present study proposes more stringent diagnostic criteria for MS, which increases the potential that MS is the correct diagnosis. Some case reports on patients with MS are, in our opinion, not reports of classical MS, but more likely a part of the heterogenic group of syndromes called “Oro-Mandibular-Limb hypogenesis syndrome” (OMLH) characterised by varying cranial nerve palsies and craniofacial anomalies and limb anomalies sometimes combined with aplasia of the pectoral muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These cases should only be compared to classical patients with MS with caution since the symptomatology; phenotype and cause might be a completely different entity. This is in accordance to Miller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], who state that due to differences of opinions regarding findings required to make the diagnosis of MS evaluations of cases reported in the literature is sometimes difficult. In one of the five patients not meeting the diagnostic criteria the genetic testing revealed a TUBB3 mutation, causing congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3, which is an alternative diagnosis also found in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
<p>As opposed to both Briegel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] who have found an equal sex-ratio of 1:1 in MS and Strömland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] who have found a ratio of 1:3, favouring males, this study finds a sex-ratio of 4:1 favouring females. Due to the low number of patients in all of these studies no consensus regarding the true sex-ratio can be determined.</p>
<p>The causality of MS is not adequately investigated, but the present study may indicate a connection between uterine abnormalities and the cascade of secondary events in embryonic development. Two of the five patients in present study were born to mothers with uterine abnormalities (unicornuate and bicornuate uterus), which may be suspected of being a cause to the damages to the foetus due to either hemorrhage or ischemia at a critical period in the embryonic development of structures including the abducens and facial nerve. Furthermore two of five patients had an inappropriate intrauterine position which may be due to uterine abnormalities. Strömland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] found adverse pregnancy events in 16 of 25. Three of five patients in the present study had problems establishing breastfeeding in the neonatal period and had additional problems in the feeding process with swallowing and chewing. Recently, de novo mutations have been reported to cause MS indicating a genetic aetiology of MS, which further increases the possibility for a correct diagnosis of MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, studies still need to investigate the relationship between genotype, phenotype and previous reported symptomatology in order to set up guidelines for distinguishing classical MS from other syndromes included in the group of OMLH syndromes. Furthermore, studies need to investigate whether a genetic predisposition followed by a vascular cascade of secondary events and uterine abnormalities might both be crucial factors in the development of classical bilateral MS.</p>
<p>As stated by Moralez-Cháves et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] facial disability, including smiling, might be a disabling condition both functionally, psychologically and aesthetically. Children with MS are described with facial blankness and inability to express emotions and are hence described as “Children without a smile”. Functions of the facial muscles are essential for both verbal and non-verbal communication as well as social interaction. In the present study, the two patients with the highest SDQ scores on “emotional stress” and “overall stress” also had the highest NOT-S score. The high NOT-S score is an indication of a poor oral motor function, which includes facial disability. Thus, an association between poor oral motor function and high emotional and overall stress may exist. However, the two patients with high scores were also the patients with the highest age. Presumably, age also influences the impact of facial disability on the patient’s emotional and overall stress in society. Of the two patients who had smile surgery performed, patients no. 4 had high SDQ and NOT-S scores but patient no. 2 had a relatively good oral motor function with only minor facial disability (low NOT-S score) and low emotional and overall stress. This adds to the impression of an association between the facial disability and both emotional and overall stress. However, the limited sample size allows no conclusive statement on the potential association.</p>
<p>Although minor deviations were seen in relation to the dentition (agenesis and hypomineralisation) no consistent abnormality could be associated with MS, and the teeth were healthy. This is in contrast to previous reports of dental agenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the reported risk of rampant caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The NOT-S revealed an affection of the orofacial motor function in all patients. That finding is expected in a disease with facial palsy and is in accordance with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported severe mandibular retrognathism in patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; in contrast, the present study found a craniofacial and dentofacial morphology dominated by a maxillary prognathism combined with a normal mandible causing an intermaxillary discrepancy. A variance of dentoalveolar compensations or dysplastic remodelling was seen. Severe malocclusion only played a minor role.</p>
<p>This study finds macrodactyly in three of five patients, curly toes in four of five patients and a mild scoliosis in all five. These findings have not previously been associated with MS. In addition, this study has not found any MS patients with Poland anomaly, opposite to the findings of other studies.</p>

<sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>MS is an extremely rare disease with a risk of misdiagnosis due to differing diagnostic criteria. The present study proposes congenital bilateral paralysis of the abducens and facial nerves as standard diagnostic criteria for MS. In patients where these criteria are not met the diagnosis may be a Moebius-like syndrome or Oro-Mandibular-Limb hypogenesis syndrome (OMLH).</p>
<p>No definitive conclusion on causality or new symptomatology can be made due a low patient number, although some trends can be appreciated.</p>
