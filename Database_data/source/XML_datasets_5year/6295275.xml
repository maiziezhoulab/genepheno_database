<title>Purpose</title>
<p id="P1">Sixty-75% of individuals with rare and undiagnosed phenotypes remain undiagnosed after whole exome sequencing (ES). With standard ES reanalysis resolving 10–15% of the ES negatives, further approaches are necessary to maximize diagnoses in these individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="P2">In 38 ES negative patients an individualized genomic-phenotypic approach was employed utilizing: A) Phenotyping; B) Reanalyses of FASTQ files, with innovative bioinformatics; C) Targeted molecular testing; D) Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and E) Conferring of clinical diagnoses when pathognomonic clinical findings occurred.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Results</title>
<p id="P3">Certain and Highly Likely diagnoses were made in 18/38 (47%) individuals, including identifying two new developmental disorders. The majority of diagnoses (&gt;70%) were due to our bioinformatics, phenotyping and targeted testing identifying variants that were undetected or not prioritized on prior ES. WGS diagnosed 3/18 individuals, with structural variants not amenable to ES. Additionally, Tentative diagnoses were made in three (8%) and in five individuals (13%) candidate genes were identified. Overall, diagnoses/potential leads were identified in 26/38 (68%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P4">Our comprehensive approach to ES negatives maximizes the ES and clinical data for both diagnoses and candidate gene identification, without WGS in the majority. This iterative approach is cost-effective and is pertinent to the current conundrum of ES negatives.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P5">Whole exome sequencing (ES) has transformed the diagnostic approach to rare and undiagnosed Mendelian phenotypes, with diagnosis rates of 25–50%. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> However, 50–75% of individuals remain undiagnosed after ES (ES negatives). The next steps after a negative ES are currently limited. Some commercial laboratories offer one free ES reanalysis and this can provide a diagnoses in 10%–15%, with the majority (~70%) occurring due to interim new gene-disease associations. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Other studies have reported diagnosis rates of 15–36% with ES reanalyses: although the raw data are reanalyzed, the diagnoses are mostly related to resequencing singletons as trios, looking for copy number variants (CNV), literature reports, and case matching through platforms such as Matchmaker exchange. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> Resequencing is reported to result in ~15% new molecular diagnoses, due to addition of family members and new gene-disease associations. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> We reported that reanalyses of ES can improve the diagnostic yield due to phenotypic characterization, improved exome coverage, realignment and variant calling in addition to new disease gene discovery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and careful phenotyping leading to targeted molecular testing can detects variants missed by ES <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can be an option for ES negative patients, with its ability to detect variants in noncoding regions, uniform coverage and better detection of structural variants; ~15% of variants missed by ES may be detected by WGS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, WGS is not widely available clinically and is not covered by third party payers and thus ES remains the standard diagnostic approach to rare Mendelian phenotypes.</p>
<p id="P6">There are many reasons why ES may miss variants of interest. Firstly, the underlying genetic etiology may be non-Mendelian and thus not amenable to ES (e.g., complex diseases). Secondly, the underlying disorder may be Mendelian, but due to variants undetectable with ES technology (e.g., trinucleotide repeats). Finally, variants that should be tractable to ES may still not be detected or reported due to variants not being detected or not recognized as disease-causing. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> This may occur due to: 1) Analytical factors/differences (e.g. difficult regions of exome, different quality filters); <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> 2) Knowledge gaps since initial ES (e.g. evolving phenotypes, gene-disease relationships not well established); <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> 3) Interpretation/reporting differences between labs (e.g. variant not reported due to poor phenotypic fit). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup></p>
<p id="P7">The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu">https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu</ext-link>) is a nationwide NIH-funded research study that accepts patients with intractable phenotypes for further diagnostic resolution. Genomic sequencing is a major component of the UDN, since most undiagnosed and rare diseases (~85%) are believed to be genetic. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> At the Duke/Columbia clinical site of the UDN, we observed that the majority (~60%) who enter the study have a negative ES result through prior commercial or research sequencing. In comparison to previous studies, these individuals are among the most challenging, with the majority having undergone trio ES prior to the UDN and in some instances, an ES reanalyses as well. We thus devised a systematic approach to resolving these phenotypes, including reanalyses of the ES data with our innovative and agnostic approach in parallel to phenotyping and then utilizing the information from these iteratively. If the phenotype was specific enough to warrant targeted molecular tests, these were pursued and if still not resolved, WGS was utilized. Our study provides an integrated genomic-phenomic approach to resolving ES negative individuals that extends well beyond just ES reanalyses.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<p id="P8">The study was performed under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Duke University Medical Center and the NHGRI.</p>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p id="P9">Thirty-eight individuals with a pre-UDN negative ES evaluated at the Duke/Columbia UDN clinical site from September 2015-October 2017 were included. Nineteen patients (50%) were male, 29 (77%) were Caucasians, with two (5%) African-Americans, five (13%) Asians, two (5%) Others and six (16%) were Hispanic. The mean age was 7.07±5.82 years, ranging from 0–26 years. The mean age of onset of illness was 0.51±1.04 years and the mean duration of illness was 6.35±5.59 years. The organ system most often involved was the nervous system (58%) with the musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal systems being the next most frequent at 7% each (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The time to diagnosis was 5.76±5.22 months (0–23 months) in those that obtained a diagnosis (n=21), compared to 10.83±5.2 months, for declaration of no diagnosis in 12 individuals (t=2.21, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Details of prior ES</title>
<p id="P10">Pre-UDN ES had been performed in 37 individuals and a pre-UDN WGS in one. A negative ES/WGS was operationalized as an ES/WGS report that was non-diagnostic and had either: (a) no variants of interest, (b) variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in a known disease-causing gene or (c) variants in candidate genes/genes of uncertain significance not associated with human disease. These pre-UDN variants are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>.</p>
<p id="P11">Commercial ES had been performed in 22 individuals (59%), research ES in 13 (35%) and two (6%) had undergone both clinical and research ES (Individual 23 had clinical WGS). The majority were trios (33/38, 86%), two were quartets, two were duos (parent-child) and one was a singleton. The pre-UDN sequencing had occurred from 2012–2016, with the majority (36/38, 95%) occurring after 2012. One ES reanalysis prior to UDN entry had occurred in 18/38 (48%) individuals, 2.11±1.07 years (1–4 years) after the initial ES.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S9">
<title>Process for evaluation of ES negative individuals</title>
<p id="P12">We began with simultaneous ES data reanalyses and phenotyping. These data were iteratively used to derive variants of interest that could be pursued further for diagnoses. If the reanalyses found variants that were likely pathogenic, then the phenotyping was customized to capture clinical manifestations related to that particular disorder. If the phenotyping suggested specific conditions in the differential diagnosis, the ES data were reexamined for pertinent genes. Then, if no variants were detected and the clinical suspicion for a particular disorder was high, direct Sanger sequencing/deletion-duplication testing and/or biochemical testing was pursued. WGS was utilized when these procedures did not result in resolution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S10">
<title>UDN Phenotyping</title>
<p id="P13">Thirty-seven individuals underwent phenotyping (Individual 23 died after acceptance and prior to evaluation). This included customized clinical consultations, imaging, procedures and laboratory tests, during a one-week visit to the Duke campus. Clinical consultations were the most often obtained (median= 3), with radiological, laboratory tests and procedures being performed as needed (median=1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S11" sec-type="results">
<title>Review of other prior pertinent results</title>
<p id="P14">A chromosomal microarray that was at least at the level of an oligonucleotide array was available on 36/38 individuals and reviewed; no CNVs that could explain the individuals’ features were evident. Regions of homozygosity on the array, if present, were utilized to identify autosomal recessive genes of interest. Other pre-UDN laboratory test results were reviewed, but details are beyond the scope of this publication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S12">
<title>ES Reanalyses</title>
<p id="P15">FASTQ files were obtained directly, or generated with data from the pertinent laboratory in 35/38 individuals. In three individuals (24, 27 and 23) raw ES/WGS data could not be obtained. Primary alignment was performed with the DRAGEN platform. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Duplicate removal was performed using Picard tools and index realignment and variant calling conducted with GATK v3.6. Variants were annotated using Clin-Eff with Ensembl-GRCh37.73. Our bioinformatics is agnostic in its approach, utilizing the innovative tools developed by our group. The Residual Variation Intolerance Score (RVIS) assesses whether genes have accumulated common functional variation; subRVIS applies the RVIS approach to sub-regions of genes and captures regional changes due to isoform inclusion/exclusion of exons, and/or by gene domain. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> Novel genotypes were filtered into tier one and tier two variants. Tier one variants were strictly filtered for quality and control observations in public databases (ExAC, gnomAD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and EVS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>), and 13,000 internal controls. Tier one variants were further prioritized: hotzone variants (polyphen 2 score &gt; 0.95 in an intolerant gene with an RVIS or a sub-RVIS score &lt;25) were predicted damaging in an intolerant gene. We highlighted hotzone variants in known OMIM genes, or mouse essential genes. We also highlighted loss of function (LoF) variants that are in genes with known pathogenic LoF variants or reported as haploinsufficient by ClinGen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, or LoF intolerant by high pLI score and estimated conservation/constraint of a variant site with the Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP) score. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> We curated ClinVar, HGMD, and internal cases to annotate all variants previously reported pathogenic. Tier 2 variants had less strict filters for quality and control observations, but required that a variant is a known or expected pathogenic variant. This allowed pathogenic variants that might otherwise be filtered due to noise in the control data sets. <italic>De novo</italic>, newly homozygous, newly hemizygous, and compound heterozygous variants were identified. All coding and intron/exon boundary (up to 8bp) variants were also considered. An inheritance naïve filter was also applied to identify any variants which may be incompletely penetrant or mosaic in the parent. For genes known to be disease-associated, we also used the ACMG criteria for variant classification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In select cases, CNV analysis was performed with the target coverage and segmentation tools in GATK 4. These rely on normal samples sequenced on the same sequencing platform. With reanalysis these controls were not always available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S13">
<title>Whole exome sequencing</title>
<p id="P16">Two individuals (15 and 22, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) had a repeat ES since the prior trio ES had been performed in early 2012, when ES capture kits were more incomplete. These were performed at the Baylor Miraca sequencing core of the UDN, using methodology and analyses previously published <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S14">
<title>Whole genome sequencing</title>
<p id="P17">UDN WGS was performed by the HudsonAlpha UDN sequencing core on 27 individuals (26 trios, one quartet), with methodology and analyses as previously published. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> The 27 individuals included 17 whose ES reanalyses through our study was negative and Individual 23 who had a pre-UDN negative WGS, as well as nine other individuals whose WGS was done in parallel with the ES reanalyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S15" sec-type="results">
<title>Communication with laboratories regarding ES negative results</title>
<p id="P18">When new variants were detected, we corresponded with the pertinent laboratory to discuss the reasons for the variant not being detected or not prioritized previously. This information is in the relevant tables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S16">
<title>Determination of Diagnoses</title>
<p id="P19">The genomic and clinical information was combined for diagnostic interpretation by consensus. The UDN has created categories of diagnoses, recognizing that it is difficult to determine the certainty of diagnosis in rare phenotypes and that the certainty may change over time. Of the four categories of Certain, Highly Likely, Tentative and Low, we used the first three to classify the diagnoses in the ES negatives in this study. Further considerations in this rubric are the method used to achieve the diagnosis (e.g. genomic sequencing, directed testing based on phenotype or clinical grounds), the mechanistic characterization of disease pathology, the degree to which the diagnosis explains the phenotypes of the patients and consequences of the diagnoses. Whenever pertinent, variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing/MLPA/exon array, prior to communication to the individuals and their families. When bioinformatically compelling variants in novel genes were identified, these were categorized as candidate genes. If further avenues such as GeneMatcher and functional studies led to the determination that they were new disease genes, they were then classified as a diagnosis (Certain, Highly Likely or Tentative, depending on the strength of the supporting evidence).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="S17" sec-type="results">
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p id="P20">Overall, 18/38 (47%) individuals received Certain (n=12) or Highly Likely diagnoses (n=6) and three (8%) received Tentative diagnoses. Candidate genes were identified in five (13%) individuals. In total, we identified diagnoses/potential leads in 26/38 (68%) individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In the individuals with a Certain or Likely Diagnoses (excluding the two with clinical diagnoses only), eight had <italic>de novo</italic> autosomal dominant variants, six had biallelic autosomal recessive variants, one had an inherited autosomal dominant variant and one had a <italic>de novo</italic> X-linked dominant variant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>).</p>
<sec id="S18">
<title>ES Reanalyses</title>
<p id="P21">In 8/35 (23%) individuals, a Certain or Highly Likely diagnosis was made and a ninth individual received a Tentative diagnosis after ES reanalyses. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The reasons for a pre-UDN negative ES in these individuals are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>. Other variants detected in our ES reanalyses are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S2 and S3</xref>. Overall, in these nine individuals, in <italic>one</italic> instance there was an interim literature report of a new gene-disease association (<italic>EFL1</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Except for the homozygous CNV in <italic>NPHP1</italic> (Individual 3, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) which may have been easier to detect by WGS, all the variants were of the type that are tractable by ES.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S19" sec-type="methods">
<title>Integration of Phenotype with Genomic Data from ES Reanalyses</title>
<p id="P22">Genomic findings directed the phenotyping and the phenotypic information led to the examination of specific genes. For example, for Individual 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>), the <italic>EFL1</italic> gene variant was detected just as phenotyping was beginning; further evaluations resulted in finding hematological, hepatic and pancreatic abnormalities consistent with the Shwachman-Diamond (SDS)-like syndrome associated with <italic>EFL1.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> Conversely, phenotyping by the epileptologist led to a recommendation to examine the <italic>CACNA1A</italic> gene in Individual 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>) and a likely pathogenic variant was detected on manual inspection of the gene and also on reanalyses through the pipeline. There were no significant differences in whether the pre-UDN ES was clinical or research based, among the Certain and Highly Likely diagnoses (χ<sup>2</sup>=.46, p&gt;0.05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S20">
<title>Phenotype Guided Diagnoses</title>
<p id="P23">A strong clinical suspicion of specific disorders occurred in two individuals. Targeted molecular testing then led to pathogenic variants that had been missed on the pre-UDN ES, as published previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). A VUS in a known disease-causing gene in Individual 17 was reinterpreted since she and her mother (who also has this variant) have pathognomonic features of the <italic>HEPACAM</italic> related disorder on further phenotyping. A CNV was established as being diagnostic for some features in individual 18, based on an interim literature report of this CNV being associated with features that overlapped his. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> In individuals 15 and 19 clinical diagnoses were conferred according to the UDN diagnostic rubric, due to their clinical features being so exactly consistent with a specific disorder, that the lack of molecular confirmation after all testing did not take away the diagnoses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P30">A systematic approach to resolving diagnoses in ES negative individuals is a critical need, as the genomics community is increasingly utilizing ES in routine clinical practice and yet 50–75% of individuals remain without a diagnosis. We demonstrate that careful consideration of the phenotypic features, combined with innovative agnostic bioinformatics ES reanalysis, targeted molecular testing and subsequent WGS results in a significant number of the ES negatives being resolved (47%), with an additional ~20% obtaining tentative diagnoses or candidate genes. Our experience is that WGS is highly effective in detecting structural variants, making it an important adjunct approach to ES negatives. However, mining ES data to maximize its potential and utilizing phenotype directed targeted testing can detect/prioritize variants not reported (due to analytical factors, knowledge gaps and variability in laboratory reporting), so that the more expensive option of WGS may be minimized (&gt; 80% of the molecular diagnoses we made were made without WGS).</p>
<p id="P31">Prior studies on ES negatives have employed various approaches, including reanalyses of the raw ES data (sometimes with more relaxed filters), moving from singleton to trio sequencing to detect <italic>de novos</italic> and compound heterozygous variants, utilizing CNV analyses, considering the interim literature for new gene-disease associations and networking to identify additional patients; these procedures have yielded 10–36% additional diagnoses. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> Our cohort was particularly challenging, since the majority had been sequenced as trios (88%), with almost all having a negative pre-UDN CNV analyses (94%) and a substantial number (48%) entering the study with one negative ES reanalysis. Thus, many logical next steps were not avenues that we could pursue. Despite this, our systematic and comprehensive approach resulted in ~ 70% of the individuals obtaining diagnoses or potential leads that could be pursued further. Our ES reanalyses alone were highly effective in providing diagnostic resolution in approximately 25% of the ES negative individuals in this study. Only two diagnoses were facilitated by new disease gene reports in the interim literature and all diagnoses were achieved without the relatively easy step of moving from a singleton to a trio. Utilization of networking platforms such as GeneMatcher or Matchmaker Exchange <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> did facilitate candidate gene follow-up. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup></p>
<p id="P32">Our approach enabled us to identify variants that had been not been previously reported. Due to our innovative bioinformatics tools such as RVIS and our ranking of variants into tiers we were able to overcome analytical factors to select bioinformatically compelling variants. Capturing phenotypic changes allowed us to bridge knowledge gaps, resulting in identification of significant variants. Indeed analytical factors and knowledge gaps were the major reasons (70%) for a pre-UDN negative ES (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Variability in laboratory reporting resulted in non-reporting of significant variants when they did not fit the reported phenotype; this has implications for clinical practice as diagnoses can be missed and phenotypic expansion of a disorder may go unrecognized.</p>
<p id="P33">An important component of our systematic approach is to phenotype the ES negative individuals in parallel with the ES reanalyses. Phenotyping is also critical in solving ES negatives without automatically resorting to WGS. When the clinical phenotypes are specific enough to be suggestive of one or a few disorders, targeted molecular testing, such as Sanger sequencing can be effective in determining variants that can be difficult to detect on ES, and is also cost-effective <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Finally, we were able to confer clinical diagnoses in two individuals, even in the absence of molecular conformation, since unmistakable pathognomonic phenotypic features of a specific disorder were present. Such clinical diagnoses, when prudently made with irrefutable findings, provide a guide to the families and enable reasonable genetic counseling and estimates of reproductive risk, even as efforts to find a molecular basis continue.</p>
<p id="P34">The role of WGS in current diagnostics of rare and undiagnosed phenotypes is still being determined. In a cohort of individuals with intellectual disabilities and a negative ES, WGS led to diagnosis in ~40% due to detection of <italic>de novo</italic> and structural variants in the exome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>; in such earlier studies, limitations of older ES capture kits may have led to coding variants not being detected. Other publications have estimated that 15–17% of additional diagnoses variants are made on WGS, mostly due to detection of variants not amenable to ES. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> Interestingly, in our cohort, WGS led to a similar rate of Certain and Likely diagnoses (16%) in the ES negatives and all were due to structural variants that would be not be easily amenable to ES or chromosomal microarrays. We acknowledge that the majority of variants that we detected in this study would have been amenable to WGS, but several patients (n=9) who underwent WGS were ultimately resolved by our systematic approach and not by WGS. Varying reasons are operative for the negative WGS in these individuals, such as the UDN WGS laboratory not reporting variants that do not fit the describe phenotype well and not reporting variants in genes of uncertain significance. This further emphasizes the value of using different pipelines in reinterpreting raw data on ES negatives. Establishing collaborations with researchers at their institutions or outside may enable clinicians to utilize a different bioinformatics pipeline for the reanalyses of ES data.</p>
<p id="P35">Twelve individuals in our study have no diagnosis or candidate genes, despite all efforts. A few of these individuals have phenotypes wherein the etiology could be complex (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, autism and recurrent fevers) and we propose that such disorders are difficult to solve by sequencing, unless larger cohorts with similar manifestations are accumulated and studied.</p>
<p id="P36">In conclusion, a systematic and comprehensive iterative approach to ES negatives that includes ES reanalysis, careful phenotyping, targeted testing and in select cases WGS, can result in a high rate of resolution. We recommend that with the high cost, relatively low incremental yield over ES, and complexity of analyses, that WGS be utilized only after ES data have been extensively mined and combined with the phenotypic data to maximize its yield. Many aspects of our approach can be implemented in practice. Commercial laboratories could adopt an agnostic approach (which could be easily automatable) to the raw data in ES negatives, so that variants that may be otherwise be filtered out due to stringent settings or phenotypic mismatch would be detected. Clinicians can also update laboratories about interim changes or atypical aspects of the phenotypes and ask about bioinformatically compelling variants that may have been initially unreported due to phenotypic mismatch. Utilizing targeted testing such as Sanger sequencing for disorders that are high in the differential diagnosis is useful; these variants may have been missed on ES, due to various analytical factors, as illustrated by Individuals 16 and 20 in this study. Additionally, considering disorders that are not amenable to ES (e.g. epigenetic disorders) and obtaining a chromosomal microarray (if not previously done), are useful approaches to ES negatives. Finding additional cases through networking such as GeneMatcher are also feasible in clinical practice. As the genomics community faces the challenge of the ES negatives, approaches such as ours provide viable avenues to maximize their resolution.</p>
