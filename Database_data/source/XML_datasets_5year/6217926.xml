<abstract>
<p id="P1">Common genetic contributions to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reside in risk-gene variants that individually have minimal effect-sizes. Since neurodevelopment-perturbing environmental factors also underlie idiopathic-ASD, it is crucial to identify altered regulators able to orchestrate multiple ASD-risk genes during neurodevelopment. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins 1-4 (CPEB1-4) regulate translation of specific mRNAs by modulating their poly(A)-tail and participate in embryonic development and synaptic plasticity. Here we find that CPEB4 binds transcripts of most high-confidence ASD genes. Idiopathic-ASD brains show CPEB4 transcript isoform imbalance due to decreased inclusion of a neuronal-specific microexon together with a new molecular signature of global poly(A)-tail shortening that remarkably impacts high-confidence ASD-risk genes with concomitant reduction of their protein levels. Equivalent CPEB4 transcript isoform imbalance in mice mimics the mRNA-polyadenylation and protein level changes of ASD genes and induces ASD-like neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. Altogether, these data unravel CPEB4 as a novel regulator of ASD-risk genes.</p>

<body>
<p id="P2">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly heritable<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. However, despite the importance of genetic determinants in ASD causality, neurodevelopment-perturbing environmental factors also contribute<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>. A minority of ASD cases correspond to syndromic forms caused by highly penetrant single-gene mutations or chromosomal abnormalities, often characterized by additional phenotypes, such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, craniofacial dysmorphology and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. In contrast, the majority of cases correspond to idiopathic ASD for which the genetic causality resides in polygenic risk involving small effect-size variants in hundreds of genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. A major question in understanding ASD is therefore to identify whether altered regulators in the brains of idiopathic ASD individuals could orchestrate pathogenic changes in numerous ASD-risk genes during neurodevelopment.</p>
<p id="P3">Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins 1-4 (CPEB1-4) are RNA-binding proteins that repress or activate translation of mRNAs with CPE sequences in their 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) by inducing cytoplasmic-shortening or -elongation of their poly(A)-tails<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>. CPEBs were discovered as regulators of certain mRNAs in response to embryonic environmental clues, such as hormones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>; later, they were shown to be involved in learning and memory by modulating synaptic plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. As FMR1/CPEB1 double-knockout (KO) rescues the fragile X-like phenotype of FMR1-KO mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, it has been suggested that manipulating CPEB1 might have therapeutic value for this monogenic X-linked intellectual disability syndrome, in which up to 50% of cases also show autistic features. However, a role of CPEBs in the etiology of a broader range of neurodevelopmental disorders—including non-syndromic ASD—has not been studied.</p>

<title>ASD-risk gene mRNAs bear CPEs and bind CPEB4</title>
<p id="P4">To investigate the CPEB-bound brain transcriptome in a disease context, we performed CPEB1 and CPEB4 RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) with striatum (St) RNA from wild-type (WT) mice and from a Huntington’s disease (HD) mouse model in which altered CPEB1- and CPEB4-levels correlate with transcriptomic poly(A)-tail length changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a-c</xref>). Regardless of genotype, 7.9% of transcripts were bound only by CPEB4, 5.8% only by CPEB1 and 7.0% by both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1a</xref>). Enrichment of CPE sequences on the 3’UTR of RIP-detected transcripts supported specificity of this binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). When comparing CPEB-specific targets and HD-associated polyadenylation changes, we found that CPEB4-specific mRNAs were enriched within deadenylated transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Interestingly, the largest fold-change (FC) in this category corresponded to <italic>Auts2</italic>, a gene linked to ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, and several high confidence ASD genes (<italic>Dyrk1a</italic>, <italic>Cul3</italic>, and <italic>Ptchd1</italic>; categories 1-2 in SFARI database) were among the forty CPEB4-targets with most prominent poly(A)-shortening (FC ≤ –3.0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1b</xref>). The remarkable enrichment of CPEB4-specific deadenylated mRNAs for SFARI genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>), led us to hypothesize a role of CPEB4 in the expression of ASD-risk genes.</p>
<p id="P5">We then analysed the incidence of CPEB4 binders in a compiled set of ASD genetic risk candidates from the SFARI database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). CPEB4 binders were enriched in ASD-risk genes and also in a smaller curated list of ASD-only genes, which cause ASD but not intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>; a weaker enrichment was also observed for CPEB1 target mRNAs). CPEB4 binders were also overrepresented within several functional co-expression modules that represent shared pathology in the ASD brain as identified in previous microarray<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> and RNA-seq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Next, we found an increase of canonical CPEs in the 3′ UTRs of mRNAs of ASD genes in the SFARI highest confidence categories, in the 39 genes harbouring rare <italic>de novo</italic> protein disrupting mutations identified in two whole-exome sequencing studies for simplex ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> and in the equivalent 61 genes from a recent study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> (“ASD39” and “Takata 2018” lists; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) when compared with multiple control gene sets: brain-, synaptic- and neuronal-enriched transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This enrichment remains after all and brain-, neuronal- and synaptic-enriched genes were stratified with respect to the ASD genes for 5’UTR, CDS or 3’UTR length, gene size, or ratio of neuron vs. glia expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). We then confirmed that most high-confidence ASD genes corresponded to CPEB4 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that mRNAs of the majority of high-confidence ASD-risk genes contain CPEs and are bound by CPEB4.</p>

<sec id="S2">
<title>CPEB4 alteration in idiopathic ASD brains</title>
<p id="P7">To assess whether CPEBs are altered in the brains of idiopathic ASD individuals, we analysed transcript levels in RNA-seq data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> from post-mortem cortex (Cx) (43 idiopathic ASD, 63 neurotypical control). We found no changes for <italic>CPEB1</italic> and <italic>CPEB2,</italic> a slight decrease for <italic>CPEB3</italic> and a slight increase for <italic>CPEB4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). At the protein level, only CPEB4 was significantly altered in idiopathic ASD brains but, strikingly, it was decreased despite increased transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b-c</xref>). This suggests that CPEB4 is heavily post-transcriptionally regulated, fitting the autoamplification loop<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> via CPEB4 binding to its own transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1a</xref>), in line with the multiple CPE sequences in its 3’ UTR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. The decreased levels of CPEB4 in ASD occur particularly in young individuals (≤35 years-old), where protein levels were higher compared to older individuals in control (CTRL) samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">Splicing alterations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, particularly of microexons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, have been reported in ASD. We thus looked for potential splicing alterations in mRNAs of the different CPEBs in our published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> rMATS-analysis of cortical RNA-seq data. Only CPEB4 showed significant splicing alterations in ASD samples, involving different combinations of two consecutive alternatively spliced exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>): the 51-nt exon 3 and the 24-nt neuronal-specific microexon (exon 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To specifically investigate changes in the level of inclusion of these exons, we re-analyzed the RNA-seq data using vast-tools<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. This revealed significantly less inclusion of exon 4 in ASD brains (ΔPSI=-7.6, Extended data Fig. 2e) which, parallel to the decreased CPEB4 protein levels, essentially occurs in individuals under 35 years old (ΔPSI=-8.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Interestingly, this microexon encodes the 8–amino acid B region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, which adds potential motifs for posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation by AKT, S6K, PKA or PKC (NETPHOS 2.0)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, a tendency to more exon 3 inclusion was found in individuals under 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Isoform-specific exon-junction RNA-seq reads were used to estimate the relative abundance of the four possible isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of exons 3 and 4 (Full length-CPEB4, CPEB4Δ3, CPEB4Δ4 and CPEB4Δ3Δ4). This revealed a significant increase of the CPEB4Δ4 transcript in ASD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2f</xref>). RT-PCR with primers that simultaneously amplify the four isoforms confirmed the increase in Δ4 transcripts (CPEB4Δ4 and CPEB4Δ3Δ4) to the expense of Ex4+ isoforms (FL-CPEB4 and CPEB4Δ3) in young ASD individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e-f</xref>), a pattern that was further validated using conventional and digital-droplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g-h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2g-i</xref>) absolute qRT-PCR. Overall, these data demonstrate an increased Δ4/Ex4+ transcript ratio of CPEB4 in ASD, concomitantly with slightly increased total RNA and decreased total protein levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Deadenylation of ASD gene mRNAs in ASD brains</title>
<p id="P10">We then explored potential genome-wide poly(A)-tail length changes in mRNA from post-mortem prefrontal Cx tissue of young controls and idiopathic ASD cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). In ASD samples, 10.2% and 9.1% of transcripts showed poly(A)-tail lengthening and shortening, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> “Total” column and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Remarkably, transcripts deadenylated in ASD brains were significantly enriched for CPEB4 binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). Gene ontology analysis detected “oxytocin signalling pathway” –implicated in social behaviour and proposed to be therapeutically relevant to ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>– as the most significantly enriched term (among deadenyated CPEB4-binding transcripts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). Interestingly, the SFARI ASD-risk genes globally showed a deadenylation signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3d-e</xref>). Strikingly, the poly(A)-tail shortening of ASD genes was progressively exacerbated with the increased confidence in causality as defined by SFARI curated gene categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This was not a by-product of enrichment of brain, neuronal or synaptic specific transcripts, or biased 5'UTR, CDS and 3'UTR lengths, gene sizes and ratio of neuronal vs. glial expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3f-g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). As expected, CPEB4 binders were overrepresented among deadenylated SFARI cat. 1–3 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), thus suggesting a role of CPEB4 in the observed deadenylation of ASD genes.</p>
<p id="P11">We next analysed the protein levels of CPEB4-bound ASD genes in Cx tissue of young idiopathic ASD cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The four studied SFARI cat. 1-2 genes (<italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>DYRK1A</italic>, <italic>FOXP1</italic> and <italic>WAC</italic>) with significant poly(A) shortening (<italic>PTEN</italic> transcript deadenylation also validated by Hire-PAT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3h</xref>) showed significantly decreased protein levels in ASD brains despite unchanged transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). A similar pattern was observed for tested SFARI cat. 3 genes showing a trend for deadenylation (<italic>AUTS2, RBFOX1</italic> and <italic>ZBTB20</italic>). Furthermore, <italic>PCDH9</italic> an SFARI cat. 4 gene displaying one of the most prominent and significant shortenings in poly(A)-tail length, also showed decreased protein levels despite increased transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-d</xref>). Unaltered protein levels of neuronal- and glial-specific genes such as CALB1, D2R, SNAP25, TUBB3 and IBA1, whose poly(A) tails were not changed in ASD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3i</xref>), rule out an underlying non-specific decrease in protein translation in ASD. Together, these results are consistent with Δ4 CPEB4 isoforms favouring deadenylation (and concomitant decreased protein levels) of target transcripts, including CPEB4 itself, and multiple ASD-risk genes.</p>
<p id="P12">Altogether, the presented human data indicate that ASD-risk genes are enriched in CPE-containing and CPEB4-binder transcripts. Moreover, idiopathic ASD brains show (i) CPEB4 mis-splicing (exon 4 skipping) and reduced CPEB4 protein levels, (ii) a new molecular signature of mRNA deadenylation that remarkably impacts high-confidence ASD-risk genes and (iii) concomitant decreased protein levels of multiple CPEB4-target and deadenylated ASD-risk gene transcripts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>ASD-like poly(A) changes in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice</title>
<p id="P13">To determine if changes in CPEB4 splicing and/or protein levels can cause the observed changes in polyadenylation and translation of ASD-risk gene mRNAs, we used different mouse models to mimic the CPEB4 changes observed in idiopathic ASD brains. First, we used two models to emulate the decreased CPEB4 protein levels: a heterozygous CPEB4 KO<sup>GT</sup>/+ model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> showing partial reduction of CPEB4 protein with unaltered isoform ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>) and a homozygous CPEB4 KO model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> showing full suppression of CPEB4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). Both models showed similar changes in global transcript polyadenylation, but in the opposite direction to what was observed in ASD cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4c-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). CPEB4-deficient mice showed prominent and significant poly(A) lengthening in ASD-risk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4c-h</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the decreased polyadenylation of ASD-risk mRNAs in ASD brains was unlikely a consequence of their reduced CPEB4 levels—on the contrary, decreased CPEB4 by itself had the opposite effect.</p>
<p id="P14">To explore the effects of the increase in Δ4 <italic>CPEB4</italic> transcript isoforms, we generated mice with conditional neuronal-specific overexpression of <italic>CPEB4Δ4</italic> transcript (TgCPEB4Δ4 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), which did not display perinatal lethality–based on live births–and were indistinguishable from their WT and single-transgenic littermates from birth to weaning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). However, at weaning (3 weeks), up to 40% of TgCPEB4Δ4 mice begun to develop cranial dysmorphology suggestive of hydrocephalus. TgCPEB4Δ4 mice with cranial dysmorphology died prematurely, with a mortality peak at 7 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). The TgCPEB4Δ4 mice with normal cranial morphology did not present any obvious abnormality nor die prematurely, but they were significantly smaller than their control littermates starting at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). In the remaining study, analysis was restricted to TgCPEB4Δ4 mice with normal cranial morphology. Transgene expression in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice takes place in neurons of forebrain structures, such as Cx and St (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5d-e</xref>). Importantly, overexpression of CPEB4Δ4 transcript resulted in a Δ4/Ex4+ transcript ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b-c</xref>) similar to that observed in brains of idiopathic ASD individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Total CPEB4 protein levels in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice moderately increased in young adults (1.5 months), did not increase at 12 months and a tendency to decrease was observed in 2-year-old mice, despite increased transcript levels at all ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5f-g</xref>). Likewise, as in human ASD brains, the other CPEBs were essentially unaltered in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5f-g</xref>). Strikingly, global poly(A)-tail length changes in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice significantly overlapped with those observed in idiopathic ASD individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>) and replicated the predominant deadenylation of ASD-risk genes, a pattern correlated with increasing ASD-risk gene confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The latter result was robust to different stratification analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6b-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Thus, creating a CPEB4 transcript isoform imbalance in mice that mimics the increase in Δ4 isoforms observed in ASD individuals was sufficient to induce the ASD-associated poly(A) signature.</p>
<p id="P15">Similar to the observations in human ASD brains, shortened poly(A) tail-length of ASD-risk gene transcripts correlated with reduced protein levels in Cx and St of TgCPEB4Δ4 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6d</xref>). <italic>Zbtb20, Tnrc6b</italic>, Chd2, <italic>Foxp1, Wac, Auts2</italic> and <italic>Gpc6</italic> are among the deadenylated SFARI cat.1-4 genes (<italic>Auts2</italic> deadenylation also validated by Hire-PAT, Extended Data Fig. 6e) whose transcripts are bound by CPEB4, and they all showed significant decreases of their protein levels without decreased transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f-g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). It is worth noting that RBFOX1 protein–one of the few splicing factors that enable microexon processing in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> and that is known to regulate alternative splicing of <italic>CPEB4</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>– is also decreased in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>) and that <italic>Cpeb4</italic> itself shows poly(A) tail shortening in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) which may explain why protein levels do not match the increased transcript levels. Unaltered protein levels of non-deadenylated neuronal- and glial-specific genes rules out a non-specific decrease in protein translation efficiency in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">We also generated TgCPEB4Δ4 mice in a CPEB4-KO heterozygous background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). Notably, CPEB4 transcript isoform imbalance persists in TgCPEB4Δ4:CPEB4-KO<sup>GT</sup>/+ mice without increased CPEB4 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7b-c</xref>). ASD genes that were diminished in the TgCPEB4Δ4 mice showed similar decreases in protein levels in the TgCPEB4Δ4:CPEB4-KO<sup>GT</sup>/+ mice, while control neuronal and glial genes were unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7d-e</xref>). These data strongly suggest that the observed effects are due to the transcript isoform imbalance rather than to increased CPEB4 protein levels. Consistent with this, we did not observe decreased protein levels of ASD genes in CPEB4-KO<sup>GT</sup>/+ mice -which only have decreased CPEB4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7f</xref>).</p>

<title>ASD-related phenotypes of TgCPEB4Δ4 mice</title>
<p id="P17">We then tested whether TgCPEB4Δ4 mice showed potential ASD-related anatomical, electrophysiological and/or behavioural abnormalities. We observed reduced brain weight for TgCPEB4Δ4 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>) as well as for TgCPEB4Δ4:CPEB4-KO<sup>GT</sup>/+ mice, but not for CPEB4-KO<sup>GT</sup>/+ mice, with volume reductions in Cx, St and hippocampus together with lateral ventricle enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>) and a two-fold increase in caspase-3 positive cells, without decreased neuronal density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8b-c</xref>). Dendritic spine dysgenesis is frequent in ASD and mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. We found a 9.2% decrease in total spine density in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) but not in CPEB4 KO<sup>GT</sup>/+ mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Fig. 8d</xref>). Whole-cell recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in layer V pyramidal neurons of somatosensory Cx revealed no differences in the mean amplitude but a 32% reduction in the mean frequency in TgCPEB4Δ4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), resembling neurexin-dysfunction mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>. No such electrophysiological alterations were observed in CPEB4-KO<sup>GT</sup>/+ mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8e</xref>). Together with the deficit in spine density, these findings are compatible with a presynaptic shortfall in neurotransmitter release and/or a reduction in numbers of excitatory synapses.</p>
<p id="P18">We then assayed behaviour. In the open field (OF) test, TgCPEB4Δ4 mice showed stereotypical running at the cage periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>), which was not due to anxiety-related behaviour since, in the elevated plus-maze test, TgCPEB4Δ4 mice actually showed reduced levels of anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). In the ultrasonic vocalization (UsV) test, TgCPEB4Δ4 mice emitted significantly less UsVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). In the social approach (SA) test, TgCPEB4Δ4 mice did not show a preference to interact with the cage containing a mouse over the empty one, indicating a dysfunction in sociability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). TgCPEB4Δ4:CPEB4-KO<sup>GT</sup>/+ mice, but not CPEB4-KO<sup>GT</sup>/+ mice, mimicked these ASD-like behaviours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8f-h</xref>), demonstrating that they are due to the altered transcript isoform ratio and not to altered total CPEB4 protein levels. Interestingly, TgCPEB4Δ4 mice treated with doxycycline to express the transgene only during embryonic and early postnatal life (ON/OFF-TgCPEB4Δ4 mice) displayed the stereotypic running in OF and the deficit in SA, while TgCPEB4Δ4 mice treated to express the transgene only after the age of 3 weeks (OFF/ON-TgCPEB4Δ4 mice) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>), indicating that these ASD-like phenotypes in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice originate during development. Together, the stereotypic running, the UsV-communication deficit, and the diminished social interaction indicate that TgCPEB4Δ4 mice display components of autistic-like behaviour that have been seen in multiple mouse models harbouring single ASD-risk mutations.</p>
<p id="P19">Hundreds of minimally penetrant mutations are implicated in ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> of which only a fraction will coincide in a given individual. Accordingly, environment-triggered misexpression of multiple ASD-related genes may contribute<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, and CPEB4 is well positioned to act as one such neurodevelopment perturbation-driven regulator. It is conceivable that development-modifying factors that have been proposed for non-genetic ASD causality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> could modulate CPEB4 developmental functions through inducing its mis-splicing. In fact, prenatal cytomegalovirus infection–which has been related to ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>– has been shown to remodel RNA splicing and polyadenylation in a CPEB1-dependent manner and to increase CPEB4 expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>.</p>
<p id="P20">The new molecular signature of transcript-deadenylation in idiopathic ASD brains, combined with proteomics data and gene modules dysregulated in ASD brain, may unravel additional risk genes or pathophysiological pathways. Finally, preclinical studies have mainly relied on monogenic syndromic-ASD mouse models. Since CPEB4 mis-splicing orchestrates expression of a plethora of ASD-risk genes, preclinical testing in TgCPEB4Δ4 mice might be relevant for a wide range of ASDs.</p>

<p id="P23">Four male WT and R6/1 mice (HD mice) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at the age of 7-8 month-old. Total striatum (St) was quickly dissected on an ice-cold plate and cut into pieces. The pool of the four WT or R6/1 striata was washed twice with phosphate buffer solution (PBS), crosslinked with 0.5% formaldehyde in PBS for 7 min at room temperature and treated with glycine 1M for 5 min. After two washes with cold PBS, pool samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxicolate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche, 11697498001), RNAse inhibitor (Ribolock, Life Technologies, EO0381)) and centrifuged at 13000g for 10 min at 4ºC. Dynabeads protein A (Life Technologies, 10001D) were washed twice with PBS and incubated with anti-CPEB4 antibody (10 μg, Abcam, ab83009), anti-CPEB1 antibody (5 μg, Proteintech, 13274-1-AP) or rabbit IgG (5 μg, Sigma, I5006) for 2h. Next, dynabeads were washed once with PBS and twice with triethanolamine 0.2 M pH 8.2, incubated with dimethyl pimelimidate 20 mM for 30 min, treated with Tris 50mM pH 8.0 and washed twice with lysis buffer. Lysates were precleared with unconjugated dynabeads for 20 min at 4ºC in a wheel, an aliquot was stored at -80ºC (“Input”) and the rest of the extract was immunoprecipitated with the antibody-conjugated dynabeads overnight at 4ºC in a wheel.

Library preparation and amplification were performed following the distributor’s (Sigma-Aldrich) recommendations for WTA2 from purified immunoprecipitated or diluted input RNA. SYBR Green (Sigma-Aldrich, 163795-75-3) was added to the amplification reaction, which was performed in a CFX Real-time instrument (Bio-Rad) to monitor amplification yield. When the SYBR Green signal reached a plateau after 27 cycles, the reaction was stopped. Amplified cDNA was purified and quantified on a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo-Fischer). 8 µg of cDNA were subsequently fragmented by DNAseI and biotinylated by terminal transferase obtained from GeneChip Mapping 250K Nsp Assay Kit (Affymetrix, 900753). After hybridization for 16h at 45ºC, washing and staining was performed in the Affymetrix GeneAtlas Fluidics Station. The arrays were scanned in the GeneAtlas Imaging Station. All processing was performed according to manufacturer’s recommendations. CEL files were generated from DAT files using Affymetrix Command Console software.

All PCR reactions were made in three replicates and assayed in 96 well plates. The PCR reaction volume was 22 µL using the QX200™ ddPCR™ Evagreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, 1864034). Each reaction included 11 µL of ddPCR™ Evagreen Supermix, forward and reverse primers at 0.9 μM each and 4 ng of template cDNA. The PCR reaction mixture was loaded into an eightwell DG8™ Cartridge for QX200™ (Bio-Rad, 1864008) and droplets with Oil for EvaGreen (Bio-Rad, 1864005) were formed with the Bio-Rad QX200™ Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad, 1864101), following the manufacturer’s instructions. During emulsion, the QX200 droplet generator partitions the samples into 20,000 nanolitre-sized droplets. The droplets were then transferred to a 96-well plate and sealed with a Bio-Rad PX1™ PCR Plate Sealer (Bio-Rad, 1814000). Optimal ddPCR annealing temperatures for the CPEB4 isoforms assays were determined by incorporating a temperature gradient from 55.6ºC to 66.6ºC. FL-CPEB4 and CPEB4∆3 were amplified using the following cycling conditions: 95ºC for 5 min, 40x (95ºC for 30 s and an annealing–extension step at 60ºC for 1 min) and 90ºC for 5 min. CPEB4∆4 and CPEB4∆3∆4 were amplified using: 95ºC for 5 min, 40x (95ºC for 30 s + 62ºC for 1 min) and 90ºC for 5 min.

<p id="P62">For whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, slices were transferred into a recording chamber that was perfused with 33 ± 1ºC bubbled ACSF at 2–3 ml/min. Pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex were visualized by a Nikon Eclipse FN1 microscope, a 40x water immersion objective (Nikon), and a USB 2.0 monochrome camera (DMK 31BU03.H, TheImagingSource). Whole-cell recordings were performed using a double patch clamp EPC10 plus amplifier (HEKA). Under voltage-clamp conditions, the patch-pipettes for excitatory postsynaptic currents recording (EPSCs) contained (mM): 120 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 phosphocreatine disodium salt, 2 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH, osmolality 280-290 mOsmol·kg<sup>-1</sup>. Recording of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were done in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 μM) and picrotoxin (50 µM) to block sodium channels and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, respectively. Cells were held in voltage-clamp mode at a holding potential (Vhold) of -70 mV, while resistance was compensated by 70% (lag 10 μs). Recordings were discontinued if series resistances increased by &gt; 50% or exceeded 15 MΩ.</p>
<p id="P63">Currents were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 20 kHz, and acquired using PatchMaster software (HEKA). All miniature postsynaptic currents were analyzed with the program Stimfit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>. Recordings were first digitally filtered at 1 kHz. For each cell, all events were inspected to avoid false-positive events, and then an average of all events detected was made.</p>

<title>Cleaved caspase-3 quantification</title>
<p id="P64">1.5 month-old control and TgCPEB4Δ4 mice (n = 6) were analyzed. The total number of immunopositive cells with apoptotic shape was quantified in the cortex of three sections per animal using an Olympus BX41 microscope with an Olympus camera DP-70 (Olympus Denmark A/S). Means of the three sections were calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S36">
<title>Stereology</title>
<p id="P65">Sagittal sections (30 μm thick) counterstained with toluidine blue pH 4.0 (1g/l Toluidine Blue (Sigma, 198161), 0.8 M glacial acetic acid) from the volumetric analysis were used. Sections containing striatum were selected and the 10 most central sections were analyzed. One randomly selected 60 µm x 60 µm optical dissector at 60x magnification with an Olympus BX41 microscope with an Olympus camera DP-70 (Olympus Denmark A/S) was analyzed in each section. Total neuronal cell number per dissector was assessed by a researcher blind to genotype. Striatal neuronal cell density was calculated and compared for control (n = 19) and TgCPEB4Δ4 mice (n = 5).</p>

<sec id="S38">
<title>Open Field</title>
<p id="P66">Locomotor activity was measured in 5 week-old mice in clear Plexiglas® boxes measuring 27.5 cm x 27.5 cm, outfitted with photo-beam detectors for monitoring horizontal and vertical activity. Activity levels were recorded with a MED Associates’ Activity Monitor (MED Associates, St. Albans, VT) and were analyzed with the MED Associates’ Activity Monitor Data Analysis v.5.93.773 software. Mice were placed in the center of the open-field apparatus and left to move freely. Data were individually recorded for each animal during 15 min. Distance walked in the periphery (3.5 cm from the edges) and in the center of the box was measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S39">
<title>Ultrasonic Vocalization (UsV)</title>
<p id="P67">Numbers of UsVs were measured at the age of 3, 6, 9 and 12 postnatal days in mice. Dam was removed from a temperature-controlled home cage where the pups remained. Then, pups were removed individually and placed in a plate equipped to record UsV for 5 min (Avisoft Recorder). To avoid potential confounding effects due to temperature, the room was maintained at 21ºC and body temperature was measured with an axillary probe after the 5 min test. UsV was analyzed with Avisoft SASLab Pro v.5.2.09 software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S40">
<title>Social Approach</title>
<p id="P68">Social interaction was examined in 5 week-old mice. The first day (training), mice were allowed to explore an empty Plexiglas® box measuring 45 cm x 45 cm during 10 min. The next day (test), mice were placed in the same box containing two wire cages placed in opposite corners, one empty and the other with an unknown (gender paired) mouse on it. Mice were recorded during 10 min and the time expended interacting with each cage was measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S41">
<title>Elevated plus maze (EPM)</title>
<p id="P69">Anxiety-like behavior was examined in 5 week-old mice. Animals were tested in a 5 min single trial EPM in which the mouse was allowed to move freely along the apparatus under a constant intense white light. Animal movement was recorded and the total time spent standing or walking on the open and closed arms was measured. The criterion was the head, forelimbs and hindlimbs being placed on open or closed arms. Maze consists of four arms (two open without walls and two enclosed by 15 cm high walls) 26 cm long and 5 cm wide, and it is elevated 40 cm off the floor.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p id="P70">Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 21.0 (SPSS® Statistic IBM®). Data are represented as Mean ± s.e.m (Standard Error of the Mean) with 95% confidence interval. In box plots, box segments show median, 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers above and below show the locations of the minimum and maximum. Higher or lower points (outliers) are plotted individually or not plotted. The normality of the data was analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk test (n &lt; 50) or o Kolmogorov-Smirnov (n &gt; 50). Homogeneity of variance was analyzed by Levente test. For comparison of two independent groups two-tail unpaired t-Student’s test (data with normal distribution), Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (with non-normal distribution) was performed. To compare dependent measurements, we used a paired t-test (normal distribution) or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (non-normal). For multiple comparisons, data with a normal distribution were analyzed by one way-ANOVA test followed by a Tukey’s or a Games-Howell’s post-hoc test. Statistical significance of non-parametric data for multiple comparisons was determined by Kruskal-Wallis One-way ANOVA test. Enrichment tests were carried out by using one-sided Fisher's exact test. A critical value for significance of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was used throughout the study.</p>
