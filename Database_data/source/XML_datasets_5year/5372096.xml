<abstract>
<p>Connecting genome-wide association study (GWAS) to biological mechanisms underlying complex traits is a major challenge. Mastitis resistance and milk production are complex traits of economic importance in the dairy sector and are associated with intra-mammary infection (IMI). Here, we integrated IMI-relevant RNA-Seq data from Holstein cattle and sequence-based GWAS data from three dairy cattle breeds (<italic>i.e</italic>., Holstein, Nordic red cattle, and Jersey) to explore the genetic basis of mastitis resistance and milk production using post-GWAS analyses and a genomic feature linear mixed model. At 24 h post-IMI, genes responsive to IMI in the mammary gland were preferentially enriched for genetic variants associated with mastitis resistance rather than milk production. Response genes in the liver were mainly enriched for variants associated with mastitis resistance at an early time point (3 h) post-IMI, whereas responsive genes at later stages were enriched for associated variants with milk production. The up- and down-regulated genes were enriched for associated variants with mastitis resistance and milk production, respectively. The patterns were consistent across breeds, indicating that different breeds shared similarities in the genetic basis of these traits. Our approaches provide a framework for integrating multiple layers of data to understand the genetic architecture underlying complex traits.</p>

<p>A better understanding of the genetic architecture underlying complex traits and diseases would be beneficial for the genomic prediction of disease risk in personalized medicine and would support the genomic selection in livestock and plant breeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have had limited successes in illustrating the genetic architecture (<italic>e.g</italic>., the distribution of causal variants and their effects) underlying complex traits and diseases, even with large sample sizes (n &gt; 100,000), due to a huge number of loci with small effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Extending GWAS results to biological and genetic mechanistic hypotheses of variation in complex traits and diseases has been a major challenge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. To overcome this challenge, one approach could be to assess the collective evidence of the association of a phenotype with all genomic variants in a group of genes defined by prior biological knowledge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, as causal variants have been proposed to preferentially cluster in genes interconnected in biological processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Over the last decade, transcriptomic studies have been commonly conducted on small-scale experimental populations to identify genes involved in biological processes underlying complex traits and diseases. Genomic variants affect complex phenotypes often through modulating gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, therefore integrating genomic variants and gene expression data could contribute to a better understanding of the genetic architecture underlying the trait variation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Compared to most existing pathway annotation databases (<italic>e.g</italic>., Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), these transcriptomic studies could provide more reliable gene clusters that are functionally related to traits of interest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. This information is of particular interest in livestock and plant genomics due to the lack of genome annotation. Moreover, patterns of gene expression have been suggested to be more consistent across breeds and populations compared to genome-wide significant loci of GWAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>
<p>Mastitis is most often caused by invading pathogens and frequently occurs in all lactating mammals and is a significant health problem in both human and veterinary medicine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Gram-negative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) is one of the most common mastitis-causing pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In the dairy industry, mastitis is one of the costliest diseases owing to its consequences of reduced milk production and quality and the need for the treatment and replacement of animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In addition, mastitis is unfavourably genetically correlated with milk production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Due to its heavy toll on the health and productivity of animals, many transcriptome profiling studies have been conducted <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> during intra-mammary infection (IMI) to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to pathogen invasion. These studies have revealed that many genes with significantly affected expression levels are involved in both inflammatory responses and overall metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, few studies have investigated whether the genomic variants associated with mastitis resistance and milk production are enriched in these active transcriptome regions during IMI. As both mastitis resistance and milk production are typical complex traits controlled by a minimum of 400–4000 effective loci in cattle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, the genetic architecture underlying them is currently poorly elucidated. We hypothesized that integrating sequence-based GWAS results with IMI-relevant transcriptome data from different tissues could contribute to a deeper insight into the genetic architecture underlying these economically important traits.</p>
<p>In the present study, mastitis resistance and three milk production traits (milk, fat, and protein yields) of Nordic Holstein (HOL), Nordic red cattle (RDC) and Jersey (JER) were analysed for their associations with imputed sequence-level genotype variants. The genotype data consisted of approximately 13–15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 10,597 animals. The RNA-Seq data were generated from IMI experiments of nine HOL animals involving two tissues (liver and mammary gland) and two pathogenic factors (<italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> endotoxin (LPS)). We assumed that the gene expression patterns induced by IMI were similar across breeds. The major objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the distributions of association signals of mastitis resistance and milk production traits in gene regions responsive to IMI, (2) to gain novel immuno-biological insights into the genetic basis of mastitis resistance and milk production, and (3) to provide a general framework for extending GWAS results to biological mechanistic hypotheses of variation in complex traits and diseases by integrative analysis with biological information from small-scale independent experimental populations.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Single-marker GWAS based on imputed sequence markers</title>
<p>A single-marker GWAS using imputed sequence markers (~13–15 M SNPs) was conducted for mastitis resistance, milk, fat, and protein yields in HOL, RDC, and JER separately. The –log<sub>10</sub><italic>P</italic>-values of the tested SNPs from GWAS analyses for the four traits in the three breeds are shown as Manhattan plots (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1–12</xref>). The genomic inflation statistics (lambda) of all the GWAS analyses ranged from 1.04 to 1.23, indicating that the residual population-stratification effects were very small and that the GWAS test statistics were not inflated. Detailed information of the top genome-wide significant SNP on each chromosome is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> for each trait in the three breeds.</p>
<p>The SNPs with the largest effect on fat and milk yields in the three breeds were in very close proximity to the well-known fat/milk-associated <italic>DGAT1</italic> gene on chromosome 14 and explained 18.3% and 13.9% (HOL), 6.3% and 7.2% (RDC), and 3.1% and 2.8% (JER) of the genomic variance of fat and milk yields, respectively. By contrast, no large-effect SNPs were observed for mastitis resistance or protein yield in any of the three breeds. Notably, the top SNPs on the significantly associated chromosomes jointly explained 9.7%, 17.4%, 22.3%, and 23.9% of the variance for mastitis resistance and protein, fat, and milk yields, respectively, in HOL; 6.8%, 8.4%, 12.6%, and 13.82% in RDC; and 0%, 0%, 3.1%, and 3.9% in JER. Hence, although the GWAS results demonstrated the importance of a small number of loci with moderate to large effects, they collectively explained only a small fraction of the total genomic variance. Loci with small effects remained undetectable by GWAS due to limited sample size (especially in JER) and very stringent genome-wide significance thresholds.</p>

<p>The complete datasets with statistical results for each of the 24,616 bovine genes at different time points (<italic>i.e</italic>., 3, 6, 9, 12, and 48 h) post-IMI with LPS compared with a time point before IMI (<italic>i.e</italic>., −22 h) in the liver are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.

The genomic features (<italic>i.e</italic>., the sets of response genes) were constructed using six FDR cut-offs (<italic>i.e</italic>., 0.05, 0.01, 1e-3, 1e-6, 1e-8, and 1e-10) in each experimental comparison. Ultimately, a total of 48 genomic features containing 11,446 unique genes were included for the following post-GWAS analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> shows that the expression levels of many more genes in the liver were affected at 6–12 h compared with 3 (early) and 48 h (late) post-IMI with LPS, and more genes responded in the liver than in the mammary gland at 24 h post-IMI with <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>

<title>Post-GWAS enrichment analyses and biological interpretation</title>
<p>To investigate the distributions of association signals for mastitis resistance and milk production traits in gene regions responsive to IMI, a post-GWAS analysis of the 48 genomic features identified from RNA-Seq was applied to each trait in each of the three breeds separately. The average number of SNPs mapped in each genomic feature was 443,359 (ranging from 1,668 to 1,755,179). The –log<sub>10</sub><italic>P</italic>-values of the genomic features from the post-GWAS analysis in HOL and RDC are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A,B</xref>, respectively, demonstrating that association signals for both mastitis resistance and milk production were significantly enriched (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in a subset of genes responsive to IMI, and the averaged Pearson correlation of –log<sub>10</sub><italic>P</italic>-values between HOL and RDC was 0.67 across the four traits with high significance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C–F</xref>). A similar pattern was also observed between HOL and JER (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref>). These findings indicated that certain similarities of the genetic basis underlying mastitis resistance and milk production are shared among breeds. The detailed statistical results for all the post-GWAS analyses in HOL, RDC and JER are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S3</xref>, respectively.</p>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Tissue differences in the enrichment of association signals for mastitis resistance and milk production</title>
<p>The liver data from six HOL animals at 24 h post-IMI with <italic>E. coli</italic> compared with a time point before IMI (<italic>i.e</italic>., −144 h) and the mammary gland data from the same animals at 24 h post-IMI compared with the control were analysed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">C</xref> show that in the mammary gland, more association signals of mastitis resistance were enriched in response gene regions compared with those of milk production traits (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in both HOL and RDC, indicating that IMI mainly influenced the immune response in the mammary gland. A similar pattern was also observed in JER (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S14</xref>). In the liver, more association signals of milk production traits tended to be enriched in response gene regions compared with those of mastitis resistance, particularly in RDC (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B,D</xref>), suggesting that IMI affected the overall metabolism in the liver.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Dynamic impact of the hepatic transcriptome during IMI with LPS</title>
<p>At a very early time point (3 h) post-IMI with LPS, response genes in the liver were mainly enriched for association signals in mastitis resistance rather than in milk production, whereas at 9 h post-IMI, the response genes were enriched for association signals in both mastitis resistance and milk production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), except for JER milk production traits that were less associated with the response genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S15</xref>). Notably, the response genes at 48 h post-IMI were more associated with protein yield compared with other traits in the three breeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S15</xref>). These observations provided genomic evidence that genes associated with mastitis resistance were activated initially in the liver and then genes associated with milk production traits was affected.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Differences in up- and down-regulated genes in the enrichment of association signals</title>
<p>To explore the distributions of association signals in up- and down-regulated gene regions, we further divided each of the 48 genomic features into four subsets of up- or down-regulated genomic features based on four log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) values (<italic>i.e</italic>., <italic>&gt;</italic>2, &gt;1, &lt;−1, &lt;−2). The detailed statistical information of the post-GWAS analysis for these genomic features in the three breeds is also summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S3–5</xref>. At 48 h post-IMI with LPS, there were no genes with an FDR &lt; 1e-8 and log2 (fold-change) &lt; −1 in the liver. The average number of markers mapped in the up-regulated features was 121,027 (ranging from 1,587 to 741,975), whereas the average number of markers mapped in the down-regulated features was 161,798 (ranging from 85 to 1,103,205). More association signals of mastitis resistance were enriched in the highly up-regulated features (log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) &gt; 2) compared with those of milk production with high significance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), whereas more association signals of milk production were enriched in the highly down-regulated genes (log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) &lt; −2) compared with those of mastitis resistance with high significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The patterns were consistent across the three breeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S16</xref>), except for JER down-regulated genes that were less associated with milk production compared with mastitis resistance (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S16</xref>). These patterns were also observed for up- (down-) regulated genomic features with log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) &gt; 1 (&lt;−1) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S16–17</xref>). These observations provided genomic evidence that genes associated with mastitis resistance were activated by IMI but at the same time genes associated with the overall metabolism were inhibited.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Explanation of genomic variance and biological interpretation for the top genomic feature in each trait</title>
<p>The genomic feature with the smallest <italic>P</italic>-value from the post-GWAS analysis in HOL was identified as the top feature for each trait. A genomic feature linear mixed model (GFLM) was applied to estimate the explained genomic variance by each of the top features (details in the Methods section).</p>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Mastitis resistance</title>
<p>The top genomic feature (FDR &lt; 1e-6, log2(fold-change) &gt; 1) was identified in the liver at 6 h post-IMI with LPS, containing 1790 up-regulated genes with approximately 1% of SNPs over the whole genome. This feature explained 7.53%, 10.89%, and 18.88% of the genomic variance (<italic>H </italic><sup>2</sup>) for mastitis resistance in HOL, RDC, and JER, respectively, approximately 5% of the variance for three milk production traits in HOL and RDC, but less than 1% of the variance for milk production traits in JER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). A functional enrichment analysis of this feature demonstrated that these up-regulated genes were mainly engaged (FDR &lt; 0.05) in RNA processing, the regulation of gene expression, the regulation of apoptotic processes, the inflammatory response, and metabolism processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The detailed information of the top three enriched (FDR &lt; 0.05) GO terms relevant to the immune response is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Milk and fat yield</title>
<p>Milk and fat yield shared the same top genomic feature (FDR &lt; 0.01, log2(fold-change) &lt; −1), which was identified in the liver at 12 h post-IMI with <italic>E. coli</italic>, containing 654 down-regulated genes with approximately 0.5% of SNPs over the whole genome. This feature explained 13.34% (17.79%), 14.95% (19.32%), and 8.79% (9.49%) of the genomic variance for milk (fat) yield in HOL, RDC, and JER, respectively, and approximately 6% of the variance for protein yield and less than 0.01% of the variance for mastitis resistance in the three breeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). A functional enrichment analysis of this feature revealed that these down-regulated genes participated in multiple biological functions, including cell cycle regulation, hepatobiliary system development, lipid metabolic processes and long-chain fatty acid metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). The details of the enriched GO terms relevant to metabolic processes are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Protein yield</title>
<p>The top genomic feature for protein yield (FDR &lt; 1e-3, log2(fold-change) &gt; 2) was identified in the liver at 48 h post-IMI with LPS, containing 48 highly up-regulated genes with less than 0.01% of SNPs over the whole genome. This feature explained 2.67%, 3.31%, and 5.33% of the genomic variance for protein yield in HOL, RDC and JER, respectively, 1.09%, 1.89%, and 1.34% of the variance for mastitis resistance, respectively, but less than 1% of the variance for milk and fat yield in the three breeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). A functional enrichment analysis of this feature revealed that these up-regulated genes were involved (FDR &lt; 0.05) in multiple biological processes that were mainly relevant to inflammatory and defence responses and the regulation of protein metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). The details of the top three enriched GO terms relevant to metabolic processes and the top three enriched GO terms for immune response are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5">Table 5</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to integrate sequence-based GWAS and IMI-relevant transcriptome data to exploit the genetic basis underpinning mastitis resistance and milk production in dairy cattle. We provide genomic evidence that genes in the mammary gland responding to IMI were more associated with mastitis resistance than milk production. Moreover, responsive genes in the liver played roles not only in the regulation of the immune response but also in the dysregulation of overall metabolism, providing novel immuno-biological insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the unfavourable correlation between mastitis and milk production. The patterns were consistent across breeds, revealing that different breeds could share similarities in genetic architecture underlying mastitis resistance and milk production. This finding is in line with previous observations that the innate immune response to IMI remains highly conserved among breeds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Our findings here might indicate that it is possible to improve multi-breed genomic predictions by borrowing information across breeds, which is currently a major ongoing challenge in the animal breeding area<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. However, in several analyses, slightly different results for Jersey compared to Nordic Red and Holstein were observed. These differences are probably due to the breed differences in segregating QTLs, minor allele frequencies, and SNP effects. In addition, the smaller sample size for Jersey animals may also have resulted in lower power to detect the associated SNPs compared to Nordic red and Holstein cattle.</p>
<p>The global gene expression alterations in the mammary gland and liver during IMI with <italic>E. coli</italic> and LPS as determined by microarray analyses have been previously reported using the same samples as those in the current study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Compared to microarray technology, RNA-Seq has several advantages, including a greater dynamic range, higher reproducibility, less bias, and a lower frequency of false-positive signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. A previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> re-analysed the microarray dataset of Jiang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> using a dynamic impact approach (DIA) and found that at 3 h post-IMI with LPS, all pathways activated in the liver were primarily related to the innate immune system, with this activation persisting for up to 12 h. The authors found that between 6 and 12 h post-IMI, pathways related to metabolism were strongly inhibited, whereas the transcriptional response subsided at 48 h post-IMI. This result is in agreement with our current findings. Together, these findings from both transcriptome functional annotation and genome association analyses confirm that soon after IMI, the liver initially increases its immune response (<italic>e.g</italic>., increased production of acute phase proteins) and then decreases its overall metabolism, particularly of lipids and cholesterol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. There is clear evidence to indicate that the immune response in the liver is highly integrated with metabolic regulation and that the biological dysfunction of either could severely impact the other<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, as the liver is a crucial organ for host immune responses and metabolism, including lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and cholesterol metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p>
<p>Single-marker GWAS has limitations for deciphering the genetic and biological mechanisms underlying complex traits, therefore many studies using different strategies have been conducted to investigate the distributions of causal genomic variants contributing to complex phenotypes along the genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p>
<p>Secondary analyses of GWAS results (<italic>i.e</italic>., post-GWAS) based on prior biological knowledge have been suggested as a computationally simple way to extract additional information from genome-wide marker data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. This approach has the potential to identify joint effects of multiple markers with independent subtle effects in a genomic feature that may be missed when estimated individually. Furthermore, statistical analysis incorporating external biological information can provide novel insights into the mechanisms causing phenotype variation, helping to open the “black box” of the genetic architecture underlying complex traits. A host of methods for this type of post-GWAS analysis have been developed to date<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. A commonly used approach is count-based; that is, to compare the proportion of associations over a certain pre-defined significance threshold in the genomic feature to the proportion of such associations in the remaining genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. One major limitation of this type approach is the dichotomization of associations into significant and non-significant groups based on a pre-specified significance cut-off, which ignores information about the strength of association<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Our post-GWAS approach assessed the enrichment of association signals in a genomic feature by comparing the sum of squared single marker test statistics (<italic>i.e</italic>., <italic>t</italic><sup>2</sup>) within the region to an empirically derived distribution under a competitive null hypothesis. This approach is more likely to match the genetic architecture underlying complex phenotypes, whereby genetic variation is governed by many loci with small effects. Our previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> using simulations have shown that the performance of this procedure is better or similar to other approaches (<italic>e.g</italic>., count or score-based) in most scenarios, and the number of false positives could be effectively controlled when the following criteria are met: 1) the average number of markers in each gene is approximately the same among the genomic features, and 2) the average linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers in different genes is approximately the same<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.</p>
<p>Our current GFLM approach could be an alternative way to examine the collective contribution of markers in a genomic feature to the phenotypic variation. It is based on partitioning genomic variance into two components: markers within and outside a genomic feature. We previously applied this approach to partition the genomic variance in health and milk production traits based on pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. This approach is similar to those proposed by other investigators, who used multiple variance components based on markers belonging to different chromosomes or sequence ontologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Here, we examined genomic markers in response gene regions detected from IMI-transcriptomic studies, which were more likely to be associated with mastitis and milk production. Moreover, our GFLM approach builds on a solid statistical modelling framework that is commonly applied to predict genetic values in animals and plants in genomic selection programmes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Compared to the standard genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model, whereby the genetic marker relationships are weighted equally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, our GFLM approach could improve the ability to predict genomic values for complex traits through differential weighting of the individual genetic marker relationships based on the estimated genomic parameters, provided that causal genomic variants are enriched in the genomic feature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. The GFLM approach is more likely to match the genetic architecture of complex traits compared to GBLUP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Additionally, the multiple-trait GFLM can be used to further disentangle the negative genetic correlation between mastitis and milk production in future studies.</p>
<p>In principle, many genomic features can be constructed using prior information from different sources, such as single genes, haplotypes, chromosomes, sequence ontologies, biological pathways, and experimental studies. The gain in knowledge generated by their use relies heavily on the quality of the genomic feature classification strategies on which the marker sets are based. As trait-associated genomic markers are not uniformly, or necessarily physically, clustered in the genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, dissecting genomic variance using adjacent genomic regions is not an ideal way to detect the joint effect of many loci with small effects and does not facilitate the interpretation of biological mechanisms underlying the trait. Biological interpretation may be better served by the use of biological pathways as genomic features; however, the quantity and quality of genes that are functionally annotated in current pathway databases are limited<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, particularly for livestock and plant genomes. Here, we used information from our transcriptomic studies of a small-scale experimental population to define genomic features, providing novel insights into the genetic and biological basis of mastitis and milk production traits. Our approaches can be easily extended to use diverse types of biological knowledge obtained from costly high-throughput technologies (<italic>e.g</italic>., RNA-Seq, methylation-Seq, and ChIP-Seq) in small-scale samples to assist in the understanding of the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex traits at the population level. However, because gene expression patterns are highly time- and tissue-dependent, some trait-associated genes might not show differential expression in some tissues at a certain time. Therefore, incorporating more biological information (<italic>e.g</italic>., protein and metabolite levels) related to the studied complex traits could be important for understanding the flow of biological information underpinning complex traits, which will help us identify the appropriate genomic features that are highly enriched for causal variants. Our current genomic feature modelling approaches provide a general framework to investigate and integrate multiple layers of omics data from high-throughput technologies or existing pathway annotation databases, potentially leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological basis underlying complex traits and diseases.</p>

<title>Animal biopsy samples for IMI experiments</title>
<p>All experimental procedures involving animals were approved by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate and complied with Danish Ministry of Justice laws concerning animal experimentation and care of experimental animals. The animal experiments were conducted in strict accordance with regulations and guidelines established by these committees. An inspection was carried out by members of these committees during the animal infection experiments.</p>
<p>In total, three and six healthy Holstein animals at the early stage of their first lactation were used in the following two IMI experiments, respectively. For the first IMI experiment, the udder health of the three Holstein cows was evaluated based on bacteriological examinations and somatic cell count (SCC) before LPS treatment. All cows were free of mastitis-causing pathogens and had SCCs &lt; 138,000 cells/ml in all the quarters. At the start of the trial, the right front quarter of all the cows was inoculated with 200 μg of <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS (0111:B4) (Sigma-Aldrich, Brøndby, Denmark) dissolved in 10 ml of a 0.9% NaCl solution, whereas the left front quarter received 10 ml of the 0.9% NaCl solution as a control. The following clinical findings verified the induction of mastitis by LPS, such as fever and high SCCs in the milk of the infected quarters. Liver biopsies were collected at −22, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 48 h relative to LPS treatment in all the studied cows. The detailed information of the liver biopsy samples from the three Holstein cows post-IMI with LPS has been previously described by Jiang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
<p>For the second IMI experiment, prior to the <italic>E. coli</italic> treatment, all six Holstein animals were evaluated and had normal body temperature and white blood cell count, a negative glutaraldehyde test, and low Californian Mastitis Test (CMT; (Kruuse, Marslev, DK)) scores ranging from 1 to 5. They were found to be free from mastitis-causing pathogens and had SCCs in milk &lt;27,000 cells/ml in all the quarters. One of the front quarters from each of the six animals was infused with 10 ml of a 0.9% NaCl solution containing ~20–40 CFU of live <italic>E. coli</italic>, whereas another quarter serving as a control received 10 ml of the 0.9% NaCl solution.

<p>RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from liver samples collected at −22, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 48 h post-IMI with LPS (each condition with three biological replicates), liver tissue samples from −144, 12, and 24 h post-IMI with <italic>E. coli</italic> (each condition with six biological replicates), and mammary gland tissues collected from udder quarters at 24 h post-IMI with and without <italic>E. coli</italic> infection (each condition with six biological replicates).

<p>The approaches applied for RNA-Seq bioinformatics analyses have been previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Briefly, the indices of the bovine reference genome (UMD3.1) were first built using the Build-Index function implemented in the Rsubread package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. The sequence reads of each sample were then mapped to the bovine reference genome assembly with an efficient mapping program using the seed-and-vote algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> implemented in the Rsubread package in R/Bioconductor. The number of reads mapped to 24,616 Ensemble genes was counted using the function Feature-Counts in this package. The averaged uniquely mapping rate across all samples was 87.11%. The analysis of differential gene expression was conducted using edgeR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. The weighted trimmed means of M-values were used to normalize the count data. As the count data follow non-normal distributions and commonly exhibit a quadratic mean-variance relationship, a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) was used. To ensure stable inference, an empirical Bayes approach was applied to shrink gene-wise dispersions towards a common dispersion for all tested genes. The GLM allow adjustment for relevant factors in the experimental design, and the differential expression of each gene was determined based on a likelihood ratio test. Time (<italic>i.e</italic>., different time-points post-IMI) was considered as the only effect for the liver samples, whereas infection status (<italic>i.e</italic>., Infected and Control) was included in the model for the mammary gland samples.

<title>Single-marker GWAS based on imputed sequence markers</title>
<p>The definitions of milk production traits (milk, protein, and fat yields) and mastitis resistance were standardized among the Nordic countries. The phenotypes used for the single-marker association analysis were de-regressed proofs (<italic>i.e</italic>., de-regressed breeding values) of 5,056 HOL, 4,310 RDC, and 1,231 JER cattle from routine genetic evaluation by Nordic Cattle Genetic Evaluation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nordicebv.info/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.nordicebv.info/</ext-link>). The average reliabilities of the de-regressed proofs for milk, fat, and protein yields and mastitis resistance were 0.95, 0.95, 0.95, and 0.85, respectively, in HOL; 0.95, 0.95, 0.95, and 0.83, respectively, in RDC; and 0.92, 0.92, 0.92, and 0.76, respectively, in JER. The details of the imputation from 50 K and High-Density (HD, 700 K) genotypes of these cattle to whole-genome sequence data have been described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Briefly, a multi-breed reference of 3,383 individuals (1,222 HOL, 1,326 RDC, and 835 JER) with HD genotypes was used to impute individuals with 50 K genotypes to the HD level. Individuals with the imputed HD genotypes were then imputed to the whole-sequence level using a multi-breed reference of 1,222 individuals from <italic>run4</italic> of the 1,000 Bull Genome project (288 HOL, 56 RDC, 61 JER and 743 individuals from different breeds)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref> and private sequence data from Aarhus University (23 HOL, 30 RDC and 27 JER)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. IMPUTE2 v2.3.1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref> was applied to impute 50 K to the HD level, and Minimac2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> was used to impute HD to the whole-sequence level.

<p>Considering the genes detected in RNA-Seq as genomic features, a post-GWAS analysis was performed based on the GWAS results, where test statistics were obtained for the association of each individual SNP.

The approach applied to test the association between a phenotype and a genomic feature has been described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Briefly, the observed test statistic (<italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>t</italic><sup>2</sup>) was first ranked based on the chromosome position of the markers, and a test statistic was then randomly chosen from this vector. All test statistics were moved to the new positions, with the remaining markers maintaining the original order, whereby the chosen statistic became the first. This uncoupled any associations between markers and genomic features while maintaining the correlation structure among the test statistics. Afterward, a new summary statistic of a genomic feature was calculated based on the original position of the feature. The permutation was repeated 1,000 times for each studied genomic feature, and an empirical <italic>P</italic>-value was then calculated based on one-tailed tests of the proportion of randomly sampled summary statistics larger than that observed. Here, we used response genes detected in RNA-Seq to define genomic features. Genes were thus used as the sampling units in the permutation procedure.
