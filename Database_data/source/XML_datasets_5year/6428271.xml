<p>Blocking cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) at the time of immunisation enhances vaccine induced T cell responses and improves control of tumour cell growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the effect of an IL-10 blockade on the biological function of macrophages has not been explored. In the current paper, a macrophage precursor cell line, U937 cells, was selected to investigate the differential expression of proteins and relevant cell signalling pathway changes, when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of antibodies to IL-10 or IL-10 receptor. We used a quantitative proteomic strategy to investigate variations in protein profiles of U937 cells following the treatments with LPS, LPS plus human anti-IL10 antibody and anti-IL10R antibody in 24hrs, respectively. The LPS treatment significantly activated actin-related cell matrix formation and immune response pathways. The addition of anti-IL10 and anti-IL10R antibody further promoted the immune response and potentially effect macrophage survival through PI3K/AKT signalling; however, the latter appeared to also upregulated oncogene XRCC5 and Cajal body associated processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer therapeutic vaccines are gradually becoming a cancer treatment modality, especially when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref002">2</xref>]. Therapeutic vaccine induced T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, are able to destroy tumour cells without damaging nearby normal cells or tissues and cause less side effects compared with conventional surgery, chemo-or radiotherapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref004">4</xref>]. Ideally, a therapeutic vaccine should elicit sufficient numbers of effector T cells, that can migrate to the tumour site, overcome the tumour suppressive microenvironment and kill the tumour cells. Tremendous efforts have been made to increase the efficacy of a therapeutic vaccine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a cytokine with various biological functions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref007">7</xref>] and is produced by many different myeloid and lymphoid cells. The primary function of IL-10 is to limit the amplitude of the immune response to avoid excessive immune activation to both self and foreign antigens that may result in autoimmune pathology or increased disease severity. IL-10 mediates its biological effects mainly through interaction with the IL-10 receptor on the membrane of professional antigen presenting cells and naïve and effector T cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>We previously showed that temporal locking of IL-10 signalling at the time of immunisation drastically increases vaccine induced cytotoxic T cell responses compared with the same vaccine without IL-10 signalling blockade, and reduced tumour growth in an animal tumour model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref009">9</xref>]. HPV16 E7 long peptide-based vaccine with incomplete Freud adjuvants has been shown to be effective against the pre- cancerous condition, CIN3 in a clinical trial[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref010">10</xref>]. In an animal model blocking IL-10 at the time of E7 long peptide/MPLA immunisation prevents HPV16 E6/7 transformed TC-1 tumour growth[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref011">11</xref>]. This latter immunisation strategy was more efficacious in preventing tumour growth than immunisation without the IL-10 signalling blockade[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref012">12</xref>]. The underlying mechanism may include enhanced stimulation of dendritic cells by Toll Like Receptor (TLR) ligands, such as CpG orLPS, when IL-10 signalling is blocked. Generally, IL-10 signalling blockade is achieved through administration of anti-IL-10 or anti-IL-10 receptor mono-clonal antibodies. Therefore, only those cells with an IL-10 receptor on their membrane will be affected when IL-10 signalling is blocked.</p>
<p>Macrophage are innate immune cells which respond instantly to infection through TLRs. Tumour associated macrophages play both tumour promoting and anti-tumour roles depending on the tumour microenvironment. IL-10 can mediate an anti-inflammatory response in macrophages by metabolic reprogramming[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref013">13</xref>]. It has also been found that macrophage-derived IL-10 contributes to the control of the LPS response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref014">14</xref>]. It is therefore of importance to investigate if and how the biological activities of macrophage are affected when stimulated by a TLR ligand simultaneously with an IL-10 signalling blockade.</p>
<p>U937 is a pro-monocytic, human myeloid leukaemia cell line and was isolated from the histiocytic lymphoma of a 37 year old male[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref015">15</xref>]. This cell line exhibits many characteristics of monocytes and has been widely used in the investigation of the mechanisms involved in monocyte-endothelium attachment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref016">16</xref>]. They have also been used as the experimental model to elucidate mechanisms of monocyte and macrophage differentiation, and investigations into the tumorous nature of the cell line[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Our previous studies have shown that the use of antibodies to IL-10 and IL-10R downregulated the expression of IL-10 in several cell lines including U937[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref019">19</xref>]. Here we report the molecular response at the protein level in the human monocytic (ML) cell line U937 stimulated with LPS when IL-10 signalling is blocked by anti-IL-10 or anti-IL-10R antibodies. The iTRAQ-labelling quantitative proteomic technique was used to compare for variation in protein abundance due to different treatments. The gene ontology enrichment and protein-protein interactions related to significantly regulated proteins were analysed. In addition, the modulation of biological signalling pathways was elucidated based on protein quantity.</p>

<title>Cell lysis and iTRAQ labelling of peptides</title>
<p>Unstimulated U937 cells were used as reference and cultured overnight. U937 cells were either stimulated with 4×10<sup>−3</sup> μM of LPS overnight (positive control) or treated with LPS plus 10 μg/mL concentration of anti-IL-10 or anti-IL-10R antibodies, respectively. After the treatment, cell pellets were washed with 1 mL of cold PBS and counted, then 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were lysed with 300 μl of lysis buffer (8M urea, 0.8M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 8.0) supplemented with 10 μl of protease inhibitor cocktail (80-6501-23, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) to prevent protein degradation. The samples were then sonicated for 30 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 12,000× g at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatants were collected, and protein concentration in the cell lysates was measured using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit on a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Then, 500 μg of proteins were reduced with 5 μl of 100 mM DTT for 1 h at 37°C, and subsequently alkylated with 20 μl of 100 mM IAA for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in the dark, followed by the incubation with the addition of 20 μL of 100 mM DTT at RT for 45 min. The urea concentration was reduced to below 2M by diluting the reaction mixture with MilliQ water, then the proteins digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 1:50 enzyme‐to‐substrate ratio. After 4 h of digestion at 37°C, samples were diluted 1:4 with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and another aliquot of the same amount of trypsin was added to the samples and further incubated at room temperature overnight (~16 h).</p>
<p>The digested samples were then acidified with 10% FA to pH&lt;3. Tryptic peptides were desalted on Sep-Pak C18 columns (Waters, Milford, MA) and dried using Speed-Vac concentrator (Thermo Fischer, Massachussets, USA). Peptides (100 μg) from three samples were dissolved in 30 μL of 0.5 M triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 solution, and mixed with 1 units of iTRAQ reagent that was dissolved freshly in 70 μL of ethanol. Channel 114 was used for labelling the reference (unstimulated), 115 for labelling LPS stimulated cells, 116 and 117 for labelling LPS plus anti-IL-10 or anti-IL-10 receptor antibodies, respectively. After 1 h incubation at RT, 300 μL of water was added and incubated for 30 min at RT to stop the reaction. Peptides labelled by different iTRAQ reagents were then mixed and concentrated to ~200 μL, and were desalted on C18 SPE columns, dried and stored at -20 <sup>o</sup>C. Biological triplicates were prepared using the same protocol.</p>

<title>NanoLC tandem TripleTof MS/MS analyses</title>
<p>The iTRAQ labelled peptides were resuspended in 25 μL 0.1% FA in MilliQ water and analysed by LC-MS/MS on a Shimadzu Prominance Nano HPLC (Kyoto, Japan) coupled to a Triple Tof 5600 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Concord, Canada) with a nano electrospray ion source, following a similar protocol reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref020">20</xref>]. Briefly, ten microliters of each replicate were injected onto a trap column, followed by fractionation on a 150mm x 75μm 300SBC18, 3.5um nano HPLC column (Agilent Technologies, Australia). Linear gradients of 1–60% solvent B over 60 min at 300 nL/min flow rate, followed by a steeper gradient from 60% to 80% solvent B in 5 min were used for peptide elution. Solvent B was held at 80% for 5 min for washing the column and returned to 1% solvent B for equilibration prior to next sample injection. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% formic acid (aq) and solvent B contained 90/10 acetonitrile/ 0.1% formic acid (aq). The ionspray voltage was set to 2400V, declustering potential (DP) 100V, curtain gas flow 25, nebuliser gas 1 (GS1) 12 and interface heater at 150 <sup>o</sup>C. The mass spectrometer acquired 500ms full scan TOF-MS data followed by 20 by 50 ms full scan product ion data in an IDA mode. Full scan TOFMS data was acquired over the mass range 350–1800 and for product ion ms/ms 100–1800 with a charge state of +2 to +5. The data was acquired and processed using Analyst TF 1.5.1 software (AB SCIEX, Concord, Canada). Biological triplicates were analysed in parallel.</p>

<title>Protein identification and quantification</title>
<p>The LC-MS/MS data were imported to the PEAKS studio (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada, version 7.0) with the assistance of MS Data Converter (Beta 1.3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sciex.com/software-downloads-x2110">http://sciex.com/software-downloads-x2110</ext-link>). The database of human proteome used for the analysis in this study was downloaded from Uniprot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640">http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640</ext-link>) containing 70,613 entries. <italic>De novo</italic> sequencing of peptides, database search and characterising specific PTMs were used to analyse the raw data; false discovery rate (FDR) was set to ≤ 1%, and [-10*log(p)] was calculated accordingly where p is the probability that an observed match is a random event. The PEAKS used the following parameters: (i) precursor ion mass tolerance, 0.1 Da; (ii) fragment ion mass tolerance, 0.1 Da (the error tolerance); (iii) tryptic enzyme specificity with two missed cleavages allowed; (iv) monoisotopic precursor mass and fragment ion mass; (v) a fixed modification of cysteine carbamidomethylation; and (vi) variable modifications including iTRAQ (for cell protein quantitation only), lysine acetylation, deamidation on asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine and conversion of glutamic acid and glutamine to pyroglutamate.</p>
<p>For iTRAQ quantification, peptides with confidence ≥ 99% were used in ProteinPilot 5.0 software (AB SCIEX, Concord, Canada). The mass error tolerance was set to 0.1 Da, and the peptide score threshold (-10lgP) was set to that corresponding to 1% FDR. The results of differentially expressed proteins were validated sequentially by the following criteria, the proteins must contain at least one unique high confident peptide, the proteins have a P values &lt; 0.05 and FDR ≤ 1%, and the fold change of proteins ≥ 1.5. To be less restrictive in the identification of proteins with altered relative abundance in treated cells with respect to the control (unstimulated) group, a protein was included in the analysis when it was confidently identified in at least two biological replicates.</p>

<p>The significantly up- or down- regulated proteins were subjected to gene ontology and pathway analysis using the online tool ToppFunc[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref021">21</xref>], respectively. ToppFunc adopts a hypergeometric model to evaluate the annotation frequency of an input gene list with respect to the one that randomly occurs. Chromosome cytoband-based enrichment analysis was used to identify the genomic regions, where the input genes were significantly enriched using all the genes in these regions as background. Similar procedures were adopted to elucidate enriched gene ontology terms and pathways. In these enrichment analyses, all human genes in ToppFunc were used as background to calculate statistical significance. In addition, the Benjamini–Hochberg method implemented in ToppFunc was used to further exclude false negative results.

The down-regulated proteins had lower <italic>P</italic>-values for these mutually regulated GOs. The viral process, unfolded protein binding, glycolytic, glucose and carbohydrate metabolic process were significantly suppressed, as they appeared to be more enriched in down-regulated proteins; while RNA metabolism, protein folding, cellular component movement, gene expression, MHC class I protein binding and platelet degranulation seemed more stimulated in U937 cells due to LPS treatment.

There was a cluster of ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL4, 5, 6, 14, 23 and 28 etc.) interacting with each other, and they interplay with other nodes mainly via EIF4A1, NME2, NCL and SLC25A5. The proteins with most interactions were mainly located in the central cluster of network, including heat shock proteins (HSP 10, 27, 60, 70 and 90), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, valosin containing protein, protein disulphide isomerase family A, enolase 1, ATP synthase, thioredoxin, malate dehydrogenase 2, transketolase, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, aldolase A and peroxiredoxin 6, many of them are enzymes.</p>
<p>The GO enrichment of upregulated proteins was further investigated in terms of biological processes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213813.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). There are 38 genes actively involved in negatively regulating megakaryocyte differentiation (GO:0045653, corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 5.85E-33). We found 19 and 18 genes with differential expressions that play roles in the regulation of immune system development (GO:0002520, corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 4.61E-11) and regulation of immune system process (GO:0002682, corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 5.17E-7), respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s008">S4 Table</xref></bold>).

<p>The integrative pathway analysis revealed that the RhoGDI, EIF2, death receptor and 14-3-3 signalling pathways were significantly modulated. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213813.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold> shows that the downregulation of Rho family proteins leads to the inhibition of Rho-GDP interaction, which consequently suppresses downstream regulators, including CDC42, ROCK and RAC, as well as the interactions among DGKZ, PIP5K, RhoGDI, RAC and GDP. Eventually, the polymerisation of actin in cytoplasm is inhibited due to the downregulation of ARP2/3. However, as the contents of cofilin, ERM and F-actin are elevated, the stabilisation and linkage of action and cytoskeletal reorganisation are therefore activated. Within the nucleus, the inhibition of CBP/P300 is suggested. Other three pathways are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s009">S1 File</xref></bold>. On EIF2 signalling pathway, many elongation factors are activated, thus the translation is enhanced. Because of the elevated level of 14-3-3 protein, ERK1/2, p90RSK and GSK3 are activated on the 14-3-3 mediated pathway, which causes the upregulation of TAU; in the nucleus, BAX and ELK1 are activated. In terms of death receptor signalling, CASP3, 6, 9 and 7 were inhibited yet the DNA repair was enhanced, leading to the suppression of cell apoptosis. Cell shrinkage is activated due to the upregulation of actin.</p>

The enriched GO terms of significant up-regulated proteins (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s002">S2C Fig</xref></bold>) show that there were more immune response related biological processes present (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s008">S4 Table</xref></bold>) compared to LPS treatment, including innate immune response in mucosa (corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 3.16E-10), mucosal immune response (corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 4.40E-9), organ or tissue specific immune response (corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 6.21E-9), innate immune response (corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 1.61E-5), humoral immune response (corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 2.23E-5), immune response (corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 2.18E-3) and defence response (corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 3.42E-3), which potentially resulted from the elevation of HSPs. Furthermore, three biological processes in response to bacteria were significantly detected, including antibacterial humoral response, defence response to Gram-positive bacterium and defence response to bacterium (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s008">S4 Table</xref></bold>), which were not present with LPS only treatment. There were two more HSP related processes that emerge with the anti-IL10 antibody treatment, i.e., chaperone-mediated protein transport involved in chaperone-mediated autophagy and autophagy translocation complex disassembly. More RNA relevant processes, such as regulation of mRNA stability, RNA replication, viral RNA genome replication and regulation of RNA stability, became significant. Negatively regulations of tumour necrosis factor superfamily member 11 production and supermolecular fibre organisation seems to be additionally activated by anti-IL10 antibody (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s008">S4 Table</xref></bold>). There were many metabolic processes that became less significant, such as NADH, NAD, ATP, NADP and a few pyridine and purine relevant processes. In addition, five actin-involved processes reduced their significance, including organisations of filament and cytoskeleton, filament-based process, rod assembly and filament capping.</p>
<p>It appears that the anti-IL10 antibody significantly modulated the death receptor signalling (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213813.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>) compared to LPS only treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s009">S1 File</xref></bold>). This was mainly caused by the differential expression levels of ARHGDIB (Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2), which showed downregulation in LPS only treatment, but upregulation with the presence of anti-IL10 antibody. As a result, apoptosis process was more activated with the addition of anti-IL10 antibody. The 14-3-3 signalling pathway was modulated in a comparable manner to LPS only treatment, which thus activated BAK and ELK1 within the nucleus (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s009">S1 File</xref></bold>); 14-3-3 protein content was more elevated, and the higher abundance of PLC activated DAG. These two factors also contributed to the modulation of protein kinase A signalling (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s009">S1 File</xref></bold>), where PKAr and PKAc were activated, thus cytoskeletal regulation was suppressed, yet histone H1 and H3B were upregulated in nucleus.</p>

<title>Anti-IL-10R antibody modulated PI3K/AKT signalling to potentially effect cell survival</title>
<p>There were 43 proteins quantified as significantly down-regulated, while only two GO terms were found be enriched with anti-IL-10R antibody, i.e., extracellular vesicular exosome and RNA binding, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s003">S3A Fig</xref></bold> This was remarkably different from those of LPS plus anti-IL10 antibody or LPS only treatments, respectively. Proteins involved in MHC class I protein binding process were enriched, in comparison to anti-IL10 antibody. The interactions of significantly regulated proteins were displayed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s003">S3B Fig</xref></bold> and the network information was kept in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s007">S3 Table</xref></bold>. The number of nodes (76) and edges (390) were much less than those of U937 cells treated with LPS plus anti-IL10 antibody or LPS only, yet still representing intensive interactive network. The group of ribosomal proteins became less clustered due to less members identified, so were the central nodes that had less interactions identified. The HSPs, including HSP27, 70 and 90, were largely connected nodes though less than anti-IL10 antibody treatment. The nucleophosmin (<italic>NPM1</italic>), guanine nucleotide binding protein (<italic>GNB2L1</italic>) and cyclophilin A (<italic>PPIA</italic>) were newly identified as major nodes in this network, while VCP and MIF were missing in comparison with anti-IL10 treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s003">S3B Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>LPS stimulated U937 cells treated with anti-IL10 or anti-IL10R antibody showed similar amounts of enriched biological processes, which were remarkably less than those of LPS only treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref></bold>). There were several Cajal body relevant biological processes enriched uniquely due to proteins significantly upregulated with anti-IL10R antibody treatment compared to LPS plus anti-IL10 antibody or LPS only treatment, with positive regulation of protein (corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 3.42E-4) and telomerase RNA localization to Cajal body (corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 3.42E-4) being the most representative processes. In addition, protein localisations to nucleoplasm and nuclear body, protein refolding and formation of translation preinitiation complex processes were more representative in U937 cells treated with anti-IL10R than anti-IL10 antibody. The pathway analysis shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213813.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold> suggests the PI3K/AKT signalling was significantly modulated, where AKT was activated by the upregulation of HSP90. None of other upstream regulator of AKT was largely influenced by the treatment. The downstream factors including MCL1, eNOS and 27KIP1 were accordingly enhanced, which in turn activated macrophage survival, production of NO and cell cycle progression (function in conjunction with 14-3-3), respectively. Other regulators, such as GSK3, FKHR, BAD, c-Raf and JIP1 etc., were suppressed. Consequently, the energy storage was activated because of GYS activation and the contribution of CCND1 to cell cycle progression; cell survival was suggestive with the upregulations of both BCL-2 and BCL-XL.</p>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that blocking IL-10 signalling with an anti-IL10R antibody at the time of immunisation enhances vaccine-induced T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref004">4</xref>]. We also demonstrated that LPS treated human PBMCs secreted more IL-12 in the presence of anti-IL-10 antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref019">19</xref>]. To further confirm that immune response would be enhanced by the application of anti-IL10R or anti-IL10 antibody, IL-6 or IL-12p40 were measured 24hrs post the treatments of U937 or mouse PBMCs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). The ELISA results clearly showed that IL-12p40 of PBMCs were significantly elevated by the addition of anti-IL10R or anti-IL10 antibody (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s004">S4A Fig</xref></bold>), respectively; the enhanced level of IL-6 due to anti-IL10R was dose-dependent (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s004">S4B Fig</xref></bold>). Significant more IL-12p40 was secreted by U937 cells treated by LPS plus 10μg anti-IL10R antibody (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s004">S4C Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The iTRAQ labelling in conjunction of LC-MS/MS found that poly(rC) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) was significantly up-regulated with LPS treatment (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s006">S2 Table</xref></bold>). PCBP1 stimulates integral RNA entry segment (IRES)-mediated translation initiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, where it functions as an RNA chaperone to open the RNA in the recruitment of ribosome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref024">24</xref>]. It has been found that PCBP1 is induced under cell stress conditions via the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref025">25</xref>], which has a positive correlation with the expression of HSP27 through the oxidative stress response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref026">26</xref>]. The significantly upregulation of HSP27 detected aligned well with this pathway. Besides, other two HSP family members, including HSP70 and 90, were elevated compared to untreated cells. HSP70 plays role in the control of cell proliferation and cellular aging[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref027">27</xref>], while HSP90 contributes to not only processing and transporting secreted proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref028">28</xref>], but also endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref029">29</xref>] and relates to the folding of Toll-like receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref030">30</xref>]. Thus, the elevated level of HSP90 aligned with the activation of Toll-like receptor due to LPS treatment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>There were several microfilament relevant proteins showing significant upregulation, such as tubulins and actinin, as well as additional proteins with the function of promoting the formation of filament, including myotrophin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref032">32</xref>], capping protein (muscle Z-line, alpha 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref033">33</xref>] and adenylate cyclase-associated protein 1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref034">34</xref>], which suggests that the dynamics of filament was remarkably altered; this can also be predicted from the RhoGDI pathway modulation shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213813.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>. The interactions between herpesvirus and the actin cytoskeleton of the host cell and actin-regulating Rho GTPase play important roles in virus entry and replication[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref035">35</xref>], thus modulation of RhoGDI signalling may contribute to the interplay between LPS and the cell matrix. Besides HSP90 (with ATPase activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref036">36</xref>]) and ATP synthase, ATP related proteins showed up-regulation, for example, proteasome 26S subunit acts a regulator in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref037">37</xref>]; valosin containing protein is involved in the formation of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum, which generates vesicle bubbles with the assistance of ATP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref038">38</xref>]; and chaperonin containing TCP1 guides protein folding post ATP hydrolysis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref039">39</xref>]. Together this suggest that the energy consumption within the cells increased as more depletion of ATP occurred due to the LPS treatment, which is also supported by the enriched glycolysis and other energy production KEGG pathways (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213813.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Glutathione transferase Omega 1 (GSTO1) were significantly upregulated in three treatments (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s006">S2 Table</xref></bold>). It has recently reported that GSTO1 plays a critical role in the pro-inflammatory response of macrophages to LPS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref041">41</xref>]; in addition, the genetic knockout of <italic>GSTO1</italic> in a mouse model remarkably reduced the pro-inflammatory response in three inflammatory disease models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref042">42</xref>]. Our study strongly suggests that gene expression of <italic>GSTO1</italic> might also positively correlate with pro-inflammation in U937 cells stimulated by LPS, and the use of anti-IL-10 and anti-IL-10R antibodies were not able to influence this correlation.</p>
<p>The upregulation of Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (ARHGDIB), known to play crucial role in the regulation of the GDP/GTP exchange reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref043">43</xref>], was observed in U937 cells in the presence of anti-IL-10 or anti-IL-10R antibody (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s006">S2 Table</xref></bold>). ARHGDIB was found to show significant overexpression in COS-7 cells with the infection of enteropathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref044">44</xref>]. It has been reported that elevated ARHGDIB was able to attenuate HIV-1 infection via negatively regulating the replication of HIV-1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref045">45</xref>]. Its upregulation was also identified in the response of the mouse nervous system to alpha herpesvirus infection at the latency and reactivation stages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref047">47</xref>], while its downregulation appears to be associated with herpesvirus entry and replication[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref048">48</xref>]. A recent report indicated that ARHGDIB produced by apoptotic T-cells can inhibit the growth of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and enhance the apoptosis of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected human macrophages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref049">49</xref>]. The addition of recombinant ARHGDIB to monocyte-derived macrophages resulted in the reduction of IL-10 secreted into the supernatant[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref049">49</xref>]. Our study suggested that additional anti-IL-10 or anti-IL-10R antibody further activated the pathway to produce more ARHGDIB in response to LPS stimulation.</p>
<p>Significant elevated level of 14-3-3 protein was only detected in the cells treated with additional anti-IL-10 antibody (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s009">S1 File</xref></bold>), which contributed to the presence of YWHAE and YWHAB on the PPI (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213813.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>), suggesting tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase signalling was potentially activated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref050">50</xref>]. 14-3-3 protein was found to negatively affect parainfluenza virus particle formation through interacting with PIV5M protein to reduce the budding of virus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref051">51</xref>]. Also, it has been found that 14-3-3 protein is able to regulate the host inflammatory response to viral and bacterial infections through interaction with Toll-like receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref054">54</xref>]. Thus, the addition of anti-IL-10 antibody could induce U937 cells to generate more immune response towards LPS stimulation via expressing higher concentration of 14-3-3 proteins.</p>
<p>PI3K/AKT pathway has been found to signal with multiple receptors, such as insulin receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref055">55</xref>], pathogen recognition receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref056">56</xref>] and cytokine receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref057">57</xref>], thus it regulates macrophage responses by modulating the activation phenotype[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref059">59</xref>]. Previous studies also pointed out that this pathway plays critical roles in macrophage biology and inflammatory disease regulation, via the regulations of inflammatory cytokines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref059">59</xref>], miRNAs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref060">60</xref>], together with molecular functions including phagocytosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref061">61</xref>], autophagy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref062">62</xref>], and cell metabolism[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref063">63</xref>]. In this study, significant activation of this pathway was identified with the treatment of anti-IL-10 or anti-IL-10R antibody led by the upregulation of AKT, compared to LPS treatment only (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213813.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213813.s009">S1 File</xref></bold>). Consequently, macrophage survival might be increased to eliminate pathogens through phagocytosis. Meanwhile, the polarisation of M1 and M2 might also be activated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref065">65</xref>].</p>
<p>The upregulations of histone cluster 1 and 2 were identified with significance in the treatment with anti-IL-10 or anti-IL-10R antibody. This protein family is one of the core components of the nucleosome and has important function in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref066">66</xref>]. Thus, its upregulation suggests increased activity of the nucleosome, which is in accordance with the higher abundance of elongation factors detected by LC-MS/MS; as a response, there was elevated level of TRIM28 expressed in cells that functions as transcription suppressor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref067">67</xref>].</p>
<p>XRCC5 was significantly upregulated only in the presence of anti-IL-10R antibody and downregulated remarkably in LPS only treatment. XRCC5 is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase mapped to chromosome 2q35 and has been suggested as a potential chronic obstructive pulmonary disease susceptibility gene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref068">68</xref>]. Other studies reported that XRCC5 promoted colon cancer growth through modulation of COX-2 signalling[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref069">69</xref>]; potentially associated with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref070">70</xref>]; and related to hyper proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, genomic instability, and tumorigenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref071">71</xref>]. Furthermore, Cajal body relevant processes were enriched in U937 cells treated with LPS plus anti-IL-10R antibody. It has been reported that Cajal body formation was induced <italic>in vitro</italic> by the overexpression of telomerase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref072">72</xref>] and a few Cajal body-localised small nucleolar RNP components showed significantly higher levels in cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref073">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0213813.ref074">74</xref>], indicating Cajal body might relate to cancer progression. These studies suggest that the upregulation of XRCC5 and Cajal body related proteins observed in this study, caused by the addition of anti-IL-10R antibody, might lead to oncogenic phenotypes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary we demonstrated that U937 cells (a macrophage precursor cell) when stimulated with TLR ligand 4, LPS, in the presence of anti-IL-10 or anti-IL-10 receptor antibodies, activated more immune-related signalling pathways than without IL-10 signalling blockade. This outcome may not only lead to higher vaccine induced immune responses but may also change the function of tumour infiltrating macrophages within the tumour microenvironment, contributing to better tumour growth control. Both antibodies enhanced macrophage survival via PI3K/AKT signalling. However, the application of anti-IL-10R antibody requires further study, as its usage might activate oncogene <italic>XRCC5</italic>. Ongoing studies that analyse the function of tumour residential macrophage is warranted when immunisation and temporal IL-10 signalling blockade is used to treat cancer patients.</p>
