<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">NEAT1 is a highly and ubiquitously expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which serves as an important regulator of cellular stress response. However, the physiological role of NEAT1 in the central nervous system (CNS) is still poorly understood. In the current study, we addressed this by characterising the CNS function of the Neat1 knockout mouse model (<italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice), using a combination of behavioural phenotyping, electrophysiology and expression analysis. RNAscope® in situ hybridisation revealed that in wild-type mice, Neat1 is expressed across the CNS regions, with high expression in glial cells and low expression in neurons. Loss of Neat1 in mice results in an inadequate reaction to physiological stress manifested as hyperlocomotion and panic escape response. In addition, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice display deficits in social interaction and rhythmic patterns of activity but retain normal motor function and memory. <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice do not present with neuronal loss, overt neuroinflammation or gross synaptic dysfunction in the brain. However, cultured <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons are characterised by hyperexcitability and dysregulated calcium homoeostasis, and stress-induced neuronal activity is also augmented in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice in vivo. Gene expression analysis showed that Neat1 may act as a weak positive regulator of multiple genes in the brain. Furthermore, loss of Neat1 affects alternative splicing of genes important for the CNS function and implicated in neurological diseases. Overall, our data suggest that Neat1 is involved in stress signalling in the brain and fine-tunes the CNS functions to enable adaptive behaviour in response to physiological stress.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an arbitrary group comprising non-protein coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. The majority of lncRNAs display tissue-specific, cell-specific, and context-specific expression, and only few of them are ubiquitous and highly expressed. The prominent member of the latter group is Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1 (NEAT1), a nuclear-retained lncRNA with important roles in cellular (patho)physiology and one of the most intensely studied lncRNAs. NEAT1 contributes to various cellular processes, from regulation of transcription and chromatin active state to miRNA biogenesis (reviewed in the ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>). <italic>NEAT1</italic> locus produces two transcripts, NEAT1_1 and NEAT1_2. The longer NEAT1 isoform, NEAT1_2, is essential for the assembly of nuclear bodies termed paraspeckles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, whereas NEAT1_1, albeit also a paraspeckle component, is dispensable for their formation and likely plays various paraspeckle-independent roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. <italic>NEAT1</italic> expression is elevated in stressed cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, such as those subjected to hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, heat shock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, mitochondrial stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or proteasome inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. NEAT1 transcripts have been shown to regulate epigenetic marks on histones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Changes in NEAT1 levels is a recurrent theme in neoplasias, and the gene is a hotspot for mutations in several types of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">According to the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) database, <italic>NEAT1</italic> is expressed ubiquitously in the human body, including in the CNS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Despite <italic>NEAT1</italic> expression in the CNS is lower than other organs and tissues, NEAT1 transcripts are induced under specific conditions, e.g., by augmented neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, pointing to important regulatory roles of this lncRNA in the brain. Because levels of NEAT1_2 in the intact brain are almost negligible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, NEAT1_1 can be considered as the main functional NEAT1 transcript in the CNS tissue under basal conditions. NEAT1 is able to modulate neuronal excitability, where its acute downregulation renders neurons more excitable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Altered <italic>NEAT1</italic> expression has been reported in all major neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), epilepsy, traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia (reviewed in the ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). However, mechanisms of NEAT1 transcripts involvement in the neurological conditions are still poorly understood, primarily because our knowledge of their function(s) is the CNS is still scarce. We still lack a clear picture of what and how NEAT1 contributes to neuronal function, especially at the organismal level.</p>
<p id="Par4"><italic>Neat1</italic> knockout mouse strain was generated in 2011 through disruption of the <italic>Neat1</italic> promoter sequences common for both Neat1 isoforms, and these mice appeared to be viable and superficially normal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, subsequent more detailed studies revealed hormone dysfunction and decreased fertility of <italic>Neat1</italic> knockout females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, confirming an important role for Neat1 transcripts in specific physiological processes. <italic>Neat1</italic> knockout mice do not present with an overt neurological phenotype, however, neuronal deficits in these mice may only manifest under certain conditions such as the physiological stress experienced during pregnancy.</p>
<p id="Par5">In the current study, we interrogated Neat1 function in the mammalian CNS using this mouse line. We show that loss of Neat1 perturbs normal behavioural responses of mice specifically under conditions of stress. This phenotype is not due to neuronal loss, neuroinflammation or gross changes in synaptic functions but rather can be attributed to altered neuronal excitability and changes in the alternative splicing of genes important for the CNS function. Our data suggest that Neat1 fine-tunes the CNS function under stressful conditions at the organismal level, which is consistent with the current view of NEAT1 as stress-responsive transcripts at the cellular level.</p>

<title>Mouse colonies and genotyping</title>
<p id="Par6">Generation of the <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mouse strain has been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The strain was maintained on the C57Bl/6J genetic background by backcrossing with wild-type mice from Charles River, UK. Primers used for mouse genotyping by PCR were 5′-CTAGTGGTGGGGAGGCAGT-3′ and 5′-AGCAGGGATAGCCTGGTCTT-3′. Homozygous (<italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and wild-type (<italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>) mice were obtained by intercrossing heterozygous (<italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>) mice. Experimental animals were housed individually, at 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, with food and water supplied ad libitum. Before behavioural testing, the animals were placed in the testing room in their home cages for 1 h for habituation. All work on animals was carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986).</p>

<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Behavioural testing</title>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Locomotor activity</title>
<p id="Par7">Spontaneous locomotor activity was assessed in the home-like cage (HC) equipped with infra-red beams to monitor horizontal movements over a period of 36 h, under the 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Number of beam breaks was recorded at 15-min intervals. The same level of illumination (as in the room used for normal housing (15–20 lux) was maintained during the day phase of the test. Locomotor activity under bright light conditions (600 lux) was recorded for 1 h using Ugo Basile 47420 multiple activity cage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">
<title>Elevated plus maze test</title>
<p id="Par8">The test was performed on a standard plus-shaped apparatus under bright light (400 lux). Each mouse was placed in the central square of the maze facing one of the open arms and was allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. Video recordings were analysed to determine the duration and frequency of entries into open and closed arms, number of head dips and stretch-attend postures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec7">
<title>Y-maze test</title>
<p id="Par9">Working memory was assessed using a Y-maze apparatus with arms measuring 40 × 6 × 20 cm (L × W × H). The test was conducted under dim light conditions (15–20 lux). Forced alternations were assessed in the two-trial test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Briefly, mice were initially allowed to explore two arms of maze for 5 min with the third arm blocked. After a 30 min inter-trial interval, the second trial was conducted, where mice were allowed to explore all three arms for 5 min. An arm entry was recorded when more than half of the mouse body crossed the border between two arms. Number of entries and time spent in each arm were registered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec8">
<title>Resident-intruder test</title>
<p id="Par10">To assess aggression and social interaction, the standard protocol of resident-intruder test was used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Animals were maintained without bedding changed for 1 week before the task. The cage top was removed and the male intruder was placed in the cage for 5 min. Older and heavier C57Bl/6J males were used as intruders (single time for each animal). The number of attacks and total time spent in a physical interaction were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec9">
<title>Social odour test</title>
<p id="Par11">Social odours were collected from a home cage where five C57Bl/6 adult male mice had been housed for 6 days without bedding change. The bottom of the cage was wiped with a cotton swab in a zig-zag pattern to collect social odour. Mice were left to habituate in a new cage in the presence of an unused cotton swab for 30 min prior to test. Subsequently, mice were exposed to a new cotton swab without odour, followed by a cotton swab with a social odour. The amount of time spent sniffing each swab over a period of 2 min was recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec10">
<title>Restraint stress</title>
<p id="Par12">To induce <italic>cFos</italic> expression, mice were exposed to a 60 min restraint stress. Animals were closed into custom-made cylindrical polycarbonate tubes with ventilation holes measuring 12.7 cm long and 3.8 cm in diameter, which allowed to significantly restrict their movements. Control animals were left undisturbed in their home cages in the same procedure room. After the restraint, mice were returned to their home cages for 60 min. Control and experimental mice were euthanised immediately after, and brain tissue was fixed for analysis as described below.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="Sec11">
<title>RNA isolation and gene expression analysis in mouse tissue</title>
<p id="Par13">Whole cortices were carefully dissected from freshly removed brains on ice and thoroughly homogenised to ensure equal representation of cells from different cortex regions in the experimental samples. Total RNA was extracted using PureLink total RNA extraction kit (Life Technologies) and possible DNA contamination was removed using RNase free DNase kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed on 500 ng of total RNA using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) and random hexamer primers (Promega). Quantitative real-time PCR was run in triplicate on an StepOne™ real-time PCR instrument and data were analyzed using StepOne™ Software v2.0 (all Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Gapdh was used for normalisation. Primer seqeunces were as follows: Neat1 total 5′-TGGAGATTGAAGGCGCAAGT3′ and 5′-ACCACAGAAGAGGAAGCACG-3′; Neat1_2 5′-AACTACCAGCAATTCCGCCA-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCGCCAGGTTTACAGT-3′; Malat1 5′-GAGCTCGCCAGGTTTACAGT-3′ and 5′-AACTACCAGCAATTCCGCCA-3′; Gapdh 5′-AAGAGGGATGCTGCCCTTAC-3′ and 5′-TACGGCCAAATCCGTTCACA-3′; Gabrr2 5′-ACATCCAAGCCAAGCCATTTG-3′ and 5′-CATGGTGAAGTCGTGGTCCT-3′; Gabra1 5′-TATGGACAGCCCTCCCAAGA-3′ and 5′-TACACGCTCTCCCAAACCTG-3′; Gabra2 5′-ACAGATTCAAAGCCACTGGAGG-3′ and 5′-TCTTCTTGTTGCCAAAGCTG-3′; Rfk 5′-GGCCACATTGAGAATTTCCCC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGTGAGCATTGGATGGA-3′.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing and analysis</title>
<p id="Par14">Total RNA was prepared as described above and its quality examined using Agilent 4200 TapeStation. RNA sequencing was performed at the School of Biosciences Genomics Research Hub. Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq stranded total kit (Illumina). For the main experiment (in 2-month old mice), paired-end sequencing was carried out on Illumina NextSeq500 (read length: 75 bp; coverage ~50 million reads/sample). For the additional experiment (low-coverage, in 1-month-old mice) single-end sequencing was performed instead (read length: 75 bp; coverage ~25 million reads/sample). Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38) using STAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) values were obtained using DESeq2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Sequencing reads were viewed in the IGV browser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Ensembl IDs for genes identified by DESeq2 were mapped to known genes and tested for GO term enrichment using DAVID 6.8 online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>). Differential splicing events were identified using the Leafcutter pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. GO term and pathway enrichment analysis of differentially spliced genes was performed using the Enrichr online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/">https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="Par15">SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to homogenised samples, followed by denaturation at 100 °C for 5 min. After SDS-PAGE using Mini-Protean® precast gels (Bio-Rad), proteins were transferred to PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) by semi-dry blotting. Membranes were blocked in 4% milk in TBST, incubated in primary antibody at 4 °C overnight and in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) for 1.5 h at RT. For detection, WesternBright Sirius kit (Advansta) and Bio-Rad ChemiDoc™ Gel Imaging System were used. Equal loading was confirmed by re-probing membranes with an antibody against beta-actin. Protein levels were quantified using the band analysis tool of Image J software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>RNA in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry in mouse tissue</title>
<p id="Par16">Whole mouse brains and spinal cord sections were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and embedded in paraffin wax. Eight µm thick sections were mounted on poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine coated slides (ThermoScientific). For RNAscope® ISH analysis, Neat1_1 (440351), with the target region 1416–2381 in mouse Neat1, and Neat1_2 (538761), with the target region 7378–8453, probes (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) were used according to manufacturer’s instructions. For Nissl staining, sections were incubated in 0.5% Cresyl Violet Acetate solution (C5042, Sigma) and differentiated in acidified ethanol. Immunohistochemistry with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a substrate was performed as described earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Images were taken using Leica DMRB microscope or Olympus BX40 slide scanner (×20 magnification). The images of sagittal sections for the same brain regions (1000 ± 200 µm from the midline) for all animals were obtained. Quantification of neuron numbers was performed using the 3D Object Counter plugin of ImageJ using an equally sized region of interest (ROI) for the cortex zone incorporating all cortex layers.</p>

<title>Analysis of NEAT1_2 induction in stressed human ES cell derived neurons</title>
<p id="Par18">Motor neuron enriched cultures were obtained by chemically induced differentiation of H9 human embryonic stem (hES) cells, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Briefly, hES cells were maintained in mTESR-Plus media (Stemcell Technologies) on plates coated with Matrigel® (Corning). Cultures were tested for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlertTM Mycoplasma Detection Kit, Lonza, cat # LT07-218 and determined to be negative. Confluent cultures were subjected to neuronal patterning in advanced DMEM/F12 (ADF) medium supplemented with SB431542 (10 µM, Abcam) from day 1; and purmorphamine (1 µM, Cayman Chemicals) and retinoic acid (0.1 µM, Sigma) from day 4. On day 16, neural progenitors were dissociated using Accutase® and plated onto Matrigel® coated dishes and cultured in ADF with GlutaMAX, penicillin-streptomycin, B27 (12587-010), N2 (all Life Technologies) and BDNF (Miltenyi, 10 ng/ml). On day 23, neurons were re-plated using Accutase® on coverslips at desired density and maintained in 50/50 mixture of ADF/Neurobasal A with the above supplements until Day 36. Neurons were treated with 0.5 mM or 0.05 mM NaAsO2 (Sigma), or 10 µM MG132 (Sigma). Recovery took place in fresh culturing medium. NEAT1_2 induction was analysed by RNA-FISH using a commercial probe (Stellaris®, Biosearch Technologies, human NEAT1 middle segment, SMF-2037-1) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Neurite network was visualised using anti-neurofilament H immunostaining (rabbit polyclonal antibody, N4142, Sigma) as described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Nuclei were visualised with DAPI (Sigma). Fluorescent images were taken using BX57 fluorescent microscope equipped with ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera (Hamamatsu) and cellSens Dimension software (Olympus). RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis were performed as described above for mouse tissue, using the following human-specific primers: NEAT1 total: 5′- CTCACAGGCAGGGGAAATGT-3′ and 5′-AACACCCACACCCCAAACAA-3′; NEAT1_2: 5′-TGTGTGTGTAAAAGAGAGAAGTTGTGG-3′ and 5′- AGAGGCTCAGAGAGGACTGTAACCT -3′; GAPDH: 5’-TCGCCAGCCGAGCCA-3’ and 5′-GAGTTAAAAGCAGCCCTGGTG -3′.</p>

Equal or nearly equal numbers of males and females were used to generate experimental cohorts. All animals were labelled with ear tags and experimenters who conducted tests and analysed results were blinded to their group allocation. To minimise the between-tests interference, evaluation of anxiety-like behaviour was performed first followed by activity and memory tests. Assessment of social behaviour was conducted at the end of the test battery as the most stressful paradigm. The Y-maze test was conducted in a procedure room different from that where locomotor activity had been tested to exclude interaction with surrounding cues. The resting time between tests was at least 7 days and the order of tests was the same for all mice.</p>

<title>Predominantly non-neuronal expression of Neat1 in the murine CNS</title>
<p id="Par24">Neat1 levels in the murine organs and tissues, as studied by RNA in situ hybridisation, vary significantly, with high levels in the digestive tract, medium—in lung and kidney, and low—in skeletal muscle and brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, the distribution of Neat1 within anatomical structures in the brain and its relative expression in different cell types in the CNS are still largely unknown. To address this, we used RNAscope® ISH with 5′ end specific Neat1 probe in the sagittal brain sections as well as in the spinal cord of adult (2-month old) wild-type (<italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>) mice. As a negative control, we included brain sections from <italic>Neat1</italic> knockout (<italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) mice. This analysis revealed the expression of Neat1 throughout the brain and spinal cord (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Region-wise, the highest Neat1 level was detected in <italic>corpus callosum</italic>, <italic>fornix</italic> and <italic>glia limitans</italic>, which are the brain structures mainly composed of glial cells. In neuron-dense areas, such as hippocampus and granule cell layer of the cerebellum, Neat1 was much less abundant and present in a dotted pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, insets—<italic>hip</italic> and <italic>cer</italic>, respectively). In contrast, in many non-neuronal cells, the entire nucleus was darkly stained, as was especially obvious in the <italic>corpus callosum</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, inset—<italic>cc</italic>). Neat1 ISH also resulted in the staining of the cytoplasmic perinuclear region in a population of cells expressing highest Neat1 levels, which was attributed to a staining artefact (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, <italic>cc</italic>—arrowheads). In <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, only traces of Neat1 were detected in all anatomical brain regions except the cerebellum, where Neat1 signal was readily detectable in the granule cell layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). Similar to the brain, Neat1 signal was evenly distributed throughout the spinal cord of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). To identify types of cells expressing Neat1, we used counterstaining of brain and spinal cord sections with Cresyl Violet (Nissl stain) after the RNAscope® ISH. Neat1 signal was observed in virtually all cell nuclei, with weak signal (few dots per cell) in cells with lightly stained nuclei, which were identified as neuronal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>), and strong signal in smaller nuclei often adjacent to neurons and corresponding to satellite cells—usually astrocytes and oligodendrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>, arrowheads and inset). Of note, we were unable to achieve the typical Nissl staining pattern (i.e., staining of both nuclei and cytoplasm of neurons) after RNAscope® ISH, which could be due to the ISH processing protocol.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Neat1 is expressed in all cell types in the murine CNS.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Neat1 is expressed at high levels in non-neuronal cells and low levels in neurons in the murine brain.

<title>Neat1 knockout mice demonstrate abnormal behavioural response to stress</title>
<p id="Par26">Consistent with the original study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice showed no obvious deficits in general health, physical characteristics, or basic sensorimotor functions compared to their wild-type (<italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>) littermates, except for reduced body weight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). However, we noticed that, despite normal behaviour while being observed in the cage without intervention, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice exhibited a panic-like escape response and hyperlocomotion (excessive running and jumping) upon contact with an experimenter, e.g., handling or cage changes (Supplementary Video S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>). This phenotype gradually developed after weaning, and was apparent in 2-month-old animals. We generated experimental groups of littermate <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 9 and 11, respectively), that included both male and female mice, for behavioural analysis.

<p id="Par27">During the period spanning from the age of 3–7 months, the above experimental cohorts were assessed using a panel of behavioural tests. First, we attempted to examine motor function in these cohorts using rotarod, however it was not possible due to multiple escape attempts of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice after placing them on the apparatus. To assess the anxiety levels, we carried out the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice presented with decreased anxiety-like behaviour in this test, as evidenced by a significantly higher number of entries to and increased time spent in open arms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>). However, an increase in the above readouts could be also interpreted as a behavioural phenotype of impulsivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and/or high escape motivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Consistent with the latter interpretation, the number of head dips from the open arm towards the floor was significantly increased, whilst the number of stretch-attend postures, when the rodent remains motionless with its body stretched forward, was decreased for <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d, e</xref>). This is indicative of escape attempts and inadequate risk assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. There was no difference in the overall locomotor activity between the genotypes measured as the total number of arm entries (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>), suggesting normal motor function in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p id="Par28">To analyse the locomotor activity of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice under conditions of normal housing, we recorded their ambulatory activity for 24 h in the home cage (HC) test. <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice were overall hypoactive, with significantly reduced total activity during the test, as compared to <italic>Neat</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g, h</xref>). Decreased locomotor activity in the absence of motor impairment could be interpreted as depression-like behaviour. Surprisingly, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice displayed dramatically reduced activity, as compared to <italic>Neat</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice, in the first 2 h of the test, i.e., when the animals encountered novel conditions, suggestive of increased anxiety. We were initially puzzled by the discrepancies between locomotor activity and anxiety levels in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice recorded in HC and EPM tests. However, there is one important difference between the two tests which is the brightness of light. HC test is conducted at 30–40 lux (during the day phase), which is comparable to the light intensity under normal housing conditions. In contrast, EPM test is carried out under the bright light conditions (~400 lux). Thus in the EPM test, the mice were subjected to strong aversive stimulation—a combination of novelty and bright light, which could be the reason for abnormal behaviour of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. To test this directly, we measured locomotor activity under bright light conditions (600 lux) for 1 h in the activity cage apparatus. <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice were indeed hyperactive under these conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2i</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of strong stress, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice demonstrate decreased or similar (after habituation to novelty) level of locomotor activity to that of <italic>Neat</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice. However, a strong stressful stimulus, such as bright light, is sufficient to induce hyperactivity, impulsive reactions and possibly increased anxiety in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. Therefore, strong aversive stimulation converts the behaviour of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice from hypoactive to hyperactive. To rule out possible memory deficits which could affect EPM test performance, we examined working memory using Y-maze forced alternation task. This test did not reveal any differences between the genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2j</xref> and data not shown).</p>
<p id="Par29">To assess social behaviour of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, we used Resident-Intruder test. In this test, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice demonstrated normal level of territorial defence behaviour, including moderately aggressive acts, such as lateral threats, chase and clinch attacks. In contrast, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice showed nearly complete absence of aggression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2k</xref>). In addition, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice had decreased physical interactions with the intruder (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2l</xref>). Altered social behaviour was further confirmed in the Social Odour test, where <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice showed less interest in a social odour as compared to <italic>Neat</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2m</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par30">We next asked whether the phenotype in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice would change during aging. Two key tests, EPM and HC, were performed in a group of 18-month-old mice (novel cohorts of animals not subjected to behavioural testing before). In the EPM test, aged <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice showed behavioural patterns similar to the young animals, in that they also displayed preference for open arms and had increased number of head dips (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2a–d</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice were also hyperactive in this test, as indicated by increased total number of entries (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2e</xref>). In the HC test, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice demonstrated reduced activity in the first 4 h (statistical significance reached for the first hour), however their total activity was similar to that of <italic>Neat</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2f, g</xref>). We also noticed an abnormal pattern of rhythmic fluctuations of activity in old <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice in this test: peaks of activity for <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice were often in the reverse phase to those of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> animals (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2f</xref>). Young <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice also demonstrated smoothened rhythmic activity pattern after habituation (from 8 h onward), lacking bursts of activity alternating with quiet periods typical for <italic>Neat</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par31">To summarise, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice display a distinct behavioural phenotype manifested in stress-induced hyperlocomotion, decreased anxiety, disinhibition, altered daily rhythms of activity and impaired sociability, without concomitant working memory or motor deficits, and this phenotype is largely preserved during aging.</p>

<p id="Par35">We speculated that abnormal behavioural responses of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice may be determined by intrinsic changes in neurons, e.g., their altered excitability. It has been shown previously that human iPSC-derived neurons become hyperexcitable after acute downregulation of NEAT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We prepared and analysed primary cultures of the hippocampal neurons from newborn <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. Morphological analysis of neurons transiently transfected to express GFP did not reveal significant differences in the neurite outgrowth and branching between the genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). To assess excitability properties of these neurons, including transmembrane currents and the ability to generate induced action potentials (iAPs), we employed patch-clamp whole-cell electrophysiology. In current-clamp studies, 50% of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons demonstrated spontaneous action potentials, whereas in the <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> group, only 36% neurons were spontaneously active (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).

<p id="Par36">To understand the basis of the enhanced excitability of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons, transmembrane voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> currents were measured using voltage-clamp mode. <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons had increased densities for both inward and outward transmembrane currents with significant difference from <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> neurons for Na<sup>+</sup> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) but not for K<sup>+</sup> voltage-gated currents (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4a, b</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>).

<p id="Par37">To explore how the changes in excitability of the <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons correspond to the regulation of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) homoeostasis, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments using ratiometric Fura-2 AM dye to examine the changes of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced by KCl.

<title>NEAT1_2 induction in neurons is a late event during stress</title>
<p id="Par40">The mouse strain used in this study lacks the expression of both Neat1 isoforms, the constitutively expressed Neat1_1 and the inducible Neat1_2. So far, only one type of stress, pharmacologically-induced seizures, is known to induce de novo Neat1_2 synthesis in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. However, whereas Neat1_1 upregulation was an early event in the above study (1 h post-stress), Neat1_2 induction/expression was delayed, and its peak occurred 8 h post-stress, with its levels still high 24 h post-stress. We asked whether the behaviour phenotype of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice and the phenotypes detected in cultured neurons derived from these mice may be attributed to the loss of Neat1_2 induction. Firstly, we performed RNAScope® ISH on the brain of wild-type mice after restraint stress (60 min stress/60 min recovery), using a Neat1_2 specific ISH probe, but did not detect any Neat1_2 signal (data not shown). Since we were unable to induce Neat1_2 expression in wild-type mouse primary neurons with any known stressors, we used a recently established stress paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> in human embryonic stem (ES) cell derived neuronal cultures. Day 36 neurons were subjected to an acute oxidative stress using NaAsO2 (sodium arsenite) for 1 h and left to recover for 1–48 h, or were subjected to 10-fold lower NaAsO2 concentration for 24 h, and NEAT1_2 expression was examined by RNA-FISH. Human ES cell derived neurons did not have detectable NEAT1_2 expression under basal conditions, immediately after stress and early during recovery (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). NEAT1_2 signal started to appear after 6 h of recovery, with a peak at 24 h of recovery, and was still detectable after 48 h of recovery (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). NEAT1_2 induction was also confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Prolonged treatment with low NaAsO2 concentration was not as efficient in NEAT1_2 induction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Another stressor known to robustly trigger NEAT1_2 expression in stable cell lines, a proteasome inhibitor MG132<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, also induced NEAT1_2 expression, albeit to a lesser extent than NaAsO2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Stress-induced NEAT1_2 induction in neurons is a late event during stress.</title><p><bold>a</bold> De novo synthesis of NEAT1_2 in human ES cell derived neurons occurs late during the recovery from oxidative stress.

Total RNA (RIN 8.7–9.2) from the whole cortices of 2-month-old animals (four per genotype) was used. Prior to sequencing, Neat1 levels in these samples were measured by qRT-PCR. In the original study, total Neat1 (Neat1_1 + Neat1_2) levels in mouse embryonic fibroblasts were found to be decreased to 6.0 ± 0.5%, whereas Neat1_2 was undetectable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Overwhelmingly more genes from this list were found to be downregulated (260: 89.3%) than upregulated (29: 10.7%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d, e</xref>), indicating that Neat1 positively regulates gene expression of a large subset of genes.

<p id="Par48">RNA-Seq datasets for <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Neat1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice were further used to analyse possible changes in the alternative splicing in the brain of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. For that, a recently developed pipeline, LeafCutter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, was utilised. Altogether, 14 differentially spliced genes were identified in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice using a &lt;20% FDR threshold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a, b</xref> and Supplementary Table S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">5</xref>). All these genes are highly expressed in the brain and two of them—almost exclusively in the brain (<italic>Myt1l, Rgs7</italic>). Most of these genes are also important for the CNS function, including those with roles in neuron proliferation, differentiation, cell–cell interaction, intraneuronal transport, synaptogenesis, primary axonogenesis, and axon guidance (<italic>Dlg1, Myt1l, Ptprs, Dctn2, Rgs7</italic>). Further, some genes are genetically linked to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (<italic>Dlg1, Myt1l</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, autism spectrum disorder (<italic>Myt1l</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and panic disorder (<italic>Rgs7</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par49">For the enrichment/pathway analysis we used a <italic>p</italic>-value cut-off of &lt;0.05 which was met by 671 genes (Supplementary Table S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">5</xref>). The use of a relaxed cut-off (<italic>p</italic>-value instead of padj) in this case was possible because only truly positives are expected to cluster in functional categories whereas false positives should be functionally unrelated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Analysis of GO Biological process enriched terms using Enrichr revealed that a significant number of differentially spliced genes were involved in axonogenesis, protein localisation to synapse and dendritic morphogenesis, including genes critical for neuronal homoeostasis and implicated in neurological diseases, e.g., <italic>Shank1, Bdnf, Map2, Dlg4, Nrxn1, Nrxn2</italic> and <italic>Ncam1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par51">LncRNAs play an important role in fine-tuning the functions specific for different cell types, and their activity might be especially important in the adult nervous system. Indeed, lncRNAs have been reported to regulate critical processes in the developing and adult brain, including cell differentiation, neurite elaboration and synaptogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. NEAT1 is an abundant lncRNA known to be expressed in the mammalian CNS however its role in the CNS under basal conditions and under conditions of physiological stress remained largely unknown.</p>
<p id="Par52">In the current study we performed a detailed behavioural characterisation of a mouse line with residual Neat1 expression, which revealed a distinct phenotype whose core feature is the exaggerated response to physiological stress. Under stressful conditions, these mice adopt an active coping strategy (“fight-or-flight” response), instead of passive coping strategy or freezing typical for wild-type mice. In addition, <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice were found to have deficiencies in social interaction—encounter with unfamiliar animal or its odour, i.e., acute social stress. Furthermore, these mice also present with abnormal rhythmic fluctuations of daily activity, which is in line with the recently reported role for Neat1 in the control of circadian genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Behavioural features detected in these mice, i.e., hyperactivity, reckless behaviours, disinhibition, impulsivity, are commonly found in psychiatric disorders, including dementia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Consistently, altered NEAT1 expression is a common theme in multiple neurological conditions including dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>, Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, Huntington’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>, schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>, and epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Therefore, abnormal NEAT1 expression and/or regulation might underlie at least some of the symptoms and phenotypes in common neurological diseases.</p>
<p id="Par53">We cannot completely exclude possible influence of decreased Neat1 expression in other organs and tissues, e.g., thyroid and gonads, on the behaviour phenotype observed in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. However, we believe that this phenotype is of primarily neurological origin for three main reasons: i) good general health of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, even during aging; ii) absence of differences between males and females in test performance suggestive of low/absent hormonal dependence; iii) high specificity of stimulation that triggers abnormal behaviour.</p>
<p id="Par54">Our study also reports detailed analysis of Neat1 expression and distribution in the mammalian CNS regions using in situ hybridisation. We found that in the murine CNS (adult brain and spinal cord), Neat1 is expressed in multiple cell types with higher levels in glial cells. An earlier transcriptomic analysis of purified cell types also reported higher Neat1 levels in glial cells—astrocytes and microglial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. In another study, Neat1 was also reported to be highly expressed in oligodendrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. It should be noted that although chromogenic detection-based RNAscope® ISH does not allow co-localisation analysis, it is an extremely sensitive method permitting detection of individual clusters of molecules (e.g. individual Neat1 dots in neurons) in histological samples. The latter was not possible using fluorescent Neat1 ISH due to high level of tissue autofluorescence (unpublished observations).</p>
<p id="Par55">The longer isoform of Neat1, Neat1_2, is the main structural component of paraspeckles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, Neat1_2 expression is restricted to certain organs/tissues, such as the gut, and was not detected in the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Using RNA-Seq, we also show that Neat1_2 expression is barely detectable in the brain under basal conditions. However, a previous study demonstrated accumulation of Neat1_2 in the murine hippocampus after seizures with a peak at the 8 h time-point and still detectable after 24 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, suggesting that the isoform switch can take place in neurons under certain (stressful) conditions. Our data from human cultured neurons also indicated that Neat1_2 expression is a late event during stress/recovery from stress. This result is consistent with the in vivo data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> and indicates that neurons, which do not express NEAT1_2 under basal conditions, require some time to initiate its expression (as compared to cells already expressing this isoform, e.g., stable cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>). However, in all our behaviour paradigms, the testing schedule had a very short timeline and was therefore unlikely to be affected by the lack of acute Neat1_2 synthesis in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. Thus we believe that the behavioural phenotype of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice can be ascribed, with confidence, to the changes caused by the loss of the expression of the constitutive neuronal Neat1 isoform, Neat1_1.</p>
<p id="Par56">Although NEAT1 has been heavily implicated in the function of the immune system and in inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, we show that its loss in mice does not result in a neuroinflammatory phenotype. This result is consistent with the role for NEAT1 as a stress-responsive transcript which would mediate/facilitate a response to an external trigger (pathogen) but likely does not have housekeeping immune functions.</p>
<p id="Par57">It has long been known that deficits in the inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission lead to behavioural changes in mice characterised by hyperactivity, panic attacks, impulsivity and generalisation of fear. Therefore, it was possible that the hyperactive phenotype detected in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice is caused by attenuated GABA system function. However, in RNA-Seq analysis, we found that only one member of GABA type A receptor complex <italic>Gabrr2</italic> is downregulated and another one, <italic>Gabrd</italic>, is differently spliced in the cortex of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis also did not reveal any detectable changes in the populations of GABAergic neurons throughout the brain of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. While it cannot be excluded that subtle changes in the GABAergic neurotransmission are still present in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, we concluded that it is not the main driver of the observed behaviour changes. Another possibility was that neurons derived from <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice are intrinsically hyperexcitable, which was indeed the case and in line with previous data obtained in human neurons with acutely downregulated NEAT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Augmented neuronal activity upon depletion of NEAT1 was previously determined indirectly, using calcium measurements. In our study, we used the gold standard method for this type of studies—whole-cell patch clamp recording in cultured neurons—which allowed to unambiguously establish the enhanced activity of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons. Comparison of the electric properties showed that increased excitability of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons was likely due to the upregulated voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> influx, which determines the kinetics of the action potential and frequency of firing. Two-fold enlargement of voltage range availability for Na<sup>+</sup> current in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons presumably allows greater number of these neurons to generate spontaneous and induced action potentials, whereas a trend for enhanced K<sup>+</sup> conductance <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons could be crucial for faster repolarisation and therefore shortening of the absolute refractory period. Finally, we were able to demonstrate the relevant consequence of enhanced neuronal excitability—increased stress-induced cFos expression—in live mice. Our in vivo cFos data are consistent with a recent finding that Neat1 inhibits the expression of <italic>cFos</italic> in cultured neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Notably, basal cFos expression was not changed in the brain of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice in our RNA-Seq analysis, therefore cFos regulation by Neat1 mainly occurs upon stimulation, at least in vivo.</p>
<p id="Par58">In an attempt to delineate molecular (gene expression) changes which underlie the hyperexcitability phenotype in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons, we analysed differential gene expression and changes in the alternative splicing in the cortex of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. DEG analysis revealed only a small number of significantly changed genes, and prominent changes were found in the expression of genes located in the vicinity of <italic>Neat1</italic> such as <italic>Frmnd8</italic>, <italic>Cd6</italic> and <italic>Malat1</italic>, similar to a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. This result is in agreement with the emerging role for lncRNAs as important regulators of gene expression in <italic>cis</italic>. Indeed, a large proportion of lncRNAs with a known function are now classed as <italic>cis</italic>-acting lncRNAs, including NEAT1 and MALAT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Importantly, the distances covered by such RNAs can vary significantly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, consistent with the fact that some genes affected by Neat1 loss of expression, albeit on the same chromosome as <italic>Neat1</italic> locus, are not located in the vicinity of the locus. We cannot completely exclude the possibility that the targeting strategy used to disrupt the <italic>Neat1</italic> locus in this mouse model affected the genomic environment, however the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory function of Neat1 probably still plays a significant role in the regulation of DEGs identified in our analysis. Unexpectedly, we found that the majority of DEGs (~90%) in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice were downregulated, and this finding was further reproduced in an independent mouse cohort. Both NEAT1 and MALAT1 have been reported to be localised to numerous genomic sites and bind active genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Thus Neat1 likely contributes to positive regulation of gene expression, explaining why its loss results in attenuated transcription of multiple targets. It is conceivable that moderate Malat1 downregulation found in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice synergises with Neat1 loss to mediate this phenotype. In future studies, it will be important to characterise possible neurological changes in Malat1 knockout mice at the behavioural and molecular levels.</p>
<p id="Par59">Alternative splicing occurs at high frequency in the CNS and is crucial for normal functioning of the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Indeed, global changes in alternative splicing pattern have been identified in the brain of patients with psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. In our RNA-Seq dataset, we also detected a number of genes differentially spliced in the cortex of <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. Functionally, these genes can be subdivided into groups related to <italic>synaptic functions, mRNA processing</italic> and <italic>cancer</italic>. Even though we did not detect major synaptic abnormalities in <italic>Neat1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, it is plausible that these alternative splicing changes translate into functional changes in the synapse and contribute to the observed behavioural phenotype. It is important to note that, although alternative splicing changes at the level of individual genes were subtle in these mice, small changes in multiple genes belonging to the same pathways likely resulted in a measurable phenotype. The role of lncRNAs in neural plasticity is emerging, the latter being crucial for stress-coping mechanisms and behavioural adaptation. For example, in response to repeated social defeat stress, hundreds of lncRNAs change their expression in the prefrontal cortex in mice, and these lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of synaptic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. NEAT1 interacts with multiple RNA-binding proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup> many of which are autoregulated, including via alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. Therefore, Neat1 loss can also lead to dysregulation of large RNA-binding protein networks. Finally, the pathophysiological connection between Neat1 isoform expression and tumorigenesis is well-established, and our data suggest that at least some of the cancer-related network changes caused by altered Neat1 expression may be attributed to abnormal alternative splicing regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Further studies are needed to determine whether the effects of Neat1 loss on gene expression and alternative splicing are specific for the CNS tissue.</p>
<p id="Par60">Unlike CNS-specific lncRNAs, Neat1 is expressed in a variety of tissues. Presumably, such lncRNAs play a universal regulatory role, while the specificity arises from the repertoire of cell type-depended targets and environmental cues. It can be concluded that although Neat1 is not essential for basic brain functions, its availability becomes important in the presence of biologically significant stress stimuli. Overall, Neat1 plays a fine-tuning regulatory role in the nervous system and participates in the processes responsible for environmentally appropriate behaviour.</p>
