<title>Objective</title>
<p>While abnormalities in myelin in tuberous sclerosis complex (<styled-content style="fixed-case">TSC</styled-content>) have been known for some time, recent imaging‐based data suggest myelin abnormalities may be independent of the pathognomonic cortical lesions (“tubers”). Multiple mouse models of <styled-content style="fixed-case">TSC</styled-content> exhibit myelination deficits, though the cell types responsible and the mechanisms underlying the myelin abnormalities remain unclear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="acn3254-sec-0002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>To determine the role of alterations in <styled-content style="fixed-case">mTOR</styled-content> signaling in myelination, we generated a conditional knockout (<styled-content style="fixed-case">CKO</styled-content>) mouse model using Cre‐recombinase and the <italic>Olig2</italic> promoter to inactivate the <italic>Tsc2</italic> gene in oligodendrocyte precursor cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="acn3254-sec-0003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Characterization of myelin and myelin constituent proteins demonstrated a marked hypomyelination phenotype. Diffusion‐based magnetic resonance imaging studies were likewise consistent with hypomyelination. Hypomyelination was due in part to decreased myelinated axon density and myelin thickness as well as decreased oligodendrocyte numbers. Coincident with hypomyelination, an extensive gliosis was seen in both the cortex and white matter tracks, suggesting alterations in cell fate due to changes in <styled-content style="fixed-case">mTOR</styled-content> activity in oligodendrocyte precursors. Despite a high‐frequency appendicular tremor and altered gait in <styled-content style="fixed-case">CKO</styled-content> mice, no significant changes in activity, vocalizations, or anxiety‐like phenotypes were seen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="acn3254-sec-0004">
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>Our findings support a known role of <styled-content style="fixed-case">mTOR</styled-content> signaling in regulation of myelination and demonstrate that increased <styled-content style="fixed-case">mTORC</styled-content>1 activity early in development within oligodendrocytes results in hypomyelination and not hypermyelination. Our data further support a dissociation between decreased Akt activity and increased <styled-content style="fixed-case">mTORC</styled-content>1 activity toward hypomyelination. Thus, therapies promoting activation of Akt‐dependent pathways while reducing <styled-content style="fixed-case">mTORC</styled-content>1 activity may prove beneficial in treatment of human disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Investigation of neurodevelopmental diseases, such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), has traditionally focused on neuronal abnormalities in the neocortex. TSC is a multisystem neurodevelopmental disorder with prominent neurological manifestations including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and epilepsy. Recent technological advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain have revealed widespread white matter changes in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders including TSC. White matter and glial abnormalities are well characterized adjacent to the cortical tubers in TSC, but only recently with increased use of more advanced techniques for imaging myelin has an appreciation come about for abnormalities in nontuber white matter, subcortical white matter, and commissural white matter tracts.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0002">2</xref> Fractional anisotropy (FA), a MRI measure which reflects the directional organization of the brain and is influenced by the extent and orientation of white matter tracts,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0003">3</xref> is decreased in patients with TSC and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as compared to controls or TSC patients without ASD.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0004">4</xref> Similar alterations in FA have been seen prospectively in patients with cryptogenic autism.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0005">5</xref> These data implicate myelin abnormalities in autism and support such abnormalities as contributing to the severity of the TSC clinical manifestations. Recent clinical studies show improvement in the integrity of white matter in TSC patients following treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus, suggesting that myelin abnormalities are reversible in human neurologic diseases and that myelin may serve as a much needed biomarker for therapies.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0008">8</xref>
</p>
<p>Loss of either <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> can cause TSC.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0009">9</xref> The complex of hamartin/tuberin, the protein products of <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic>, respectively, function within the PI3K signaling pathway as inhibitors of mTORC1 and activators of mTORC2, thus perturbation of the hamartin/tuberin complex results in increased mTORC1 and decreased mTORC2 signaling. The role of PI3K signaling in myelination has been studied extensively with several mouse models showing that decreased activity of the PI3K pathway and AKT kinase in oligodendrocytes leads to hypomyelination<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0011">11</xref> and increased Akt activity in oligodendrocytes results in hypermyelination.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0013">13</xref> More recently, Lebrun‐Julien et al. reported the surprising finding of hypomyelination in the context of increased mTORC1 activity following targeted deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> from oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0014">14</xref>
</p>
<p>While abnormal brain imaging findings from TSC patients support the link between clinical disease and myelin abnormalities, it is unknown if cortical myelin abnormalities are due to (1) abnormal signaling from neurons with failure to stimulate proper myelination, (2) cell autonomous oligodendrocyte dysfunction, or (3) some the combination of the two. Previous studies with neuronal‐specific conditional knockout (CKO) animal models of TSC have demonstrated noncell autonomous abnormalities in myelin.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0015">15</xref>
<italic>Tsc1</italic> CKO animals generated in our laboratory also demonstrated myelin abnormalities with altered mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling. However, we targeted dorsal neural progenitor cells using Emx1‐Cre transgene that is expressed in excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and a subset of oligodendrocytes.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0017">17</xref>
</p>
<p>To address cell autonomous contributions of <italic>Tsc2</italic>/tuberin and mTOR signaling in cortical oligodendrocytes, we conditionally targeted <italic>Tsc2</italic> in oligodendrocytes using <italic>Olig2</italic> transgenic mice. We report a marked hypomyelination phenotype following loss of <italic>Tsc2</italic> from oligodendrocytes and reduction of oligodendrocytes numbers in the cortex and corpus callosum (CC). Our findings support that cell autonomous dysregulation of mTOR signaling in cortical oligodendrocytes contributes to human disease pathology in TSC and expands the repertoire of cells types involved in TSC disease pathogenesis.</p>

<italic>Tsc2</italic> CKO mice</title>
<p>The <italic>Tsc2</italic> gene was conditionally targeted in oligodendrocytes utilizing the <italic>Olig2</italic> promoter (Jackson Laboratory #011103, Sacramento, California, USA). <italic>Olig2</italic>‐Cre animals were crossed to a <italic>Tsc2</italic> floxed knockin line we created.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0018">18</xref> Littermate Olig2<italic>‐Cre</italic>‐negative Flox/Wt and Flox/Wt Olig2<italic>‐Cre</italic>‐positive mice were used as controls.

Genotyping was performed using PCR as described previously.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0019">19</xref>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Brain tissues were extracted and dissected from Tsc2‐Olig2 CKO and littermate controls as described previously.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0021">21</xref> Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused with ice‐cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and then cryoprotected for 48 h in 30% sucrose prior to sectioning. For immunofluorescence, tissue sections allowed to warm to room temperature, washed in Tris buffered saline (TBS), and blocked with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) with 0.1% Triton‐X100 in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. Antigen retrieval was used for APC with heating a 1:10 dilution of TBS in a microwave 3× for 40 sec, permeabilization with 10% Triton‐X100 in TBS, then blocking with superblock (10% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10% NGS, 0.03% NaN3 in TBS).<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0022">22</xref> Sections were probed with primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4°C followed by species appropriate secondary antibodies (anti‐mouse, anti‐rabbit, or anti‐rat Alexa 488 and 555 fluorochromes, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Photomicrographs were obtained using a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) or an AMG Evos epifluorescence microscope (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Image analysis was performed with Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA, USA) and Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). Experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility. Primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 1:1000, phospho‐S6 (Ser240‐244), myelin‐associated glycoprotein (MAG) 1:100 (all Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), Olig2 1:500 (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), myelin basic protein (MBP) 1:200 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and APC 1:100 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA).</p>

<p>Slides were warmed to room temperature and washed with PBS followed by 70% EthOH. Slides were incubated in filtered 0.4% Sudan black in 70% EthOH for 30 min, washed in 70% EthOH and then with water. Photomicrographs were obtained using a Zeiss bright field microscope.</p>

<title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title>
<p>Following anesthesia with ketamine/xylazine, mice underwent intracardiac perfusion with 2% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde/1 mmol/L Gd‐DTPA in PBS followed by postfixing for 1 week at 4°C. 3D MRI was performed on a 15.2T 11‐cm horizontal bore Bruker Biospec scanner (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA) with field of view = 19.2 × 14.4 × 10.8 mm<sup>3</sup> and matrix size = 128 ×96 × 72 for a nominal isotropic resolution of 150 × 150 × 150 <italic>μ</italic>m<sup>3</sup>. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired using a 3D diffusion weighted fast spin‐echo sequence with TR/TE/ESP = 200/19.0/7.1 msec and ETL = 4. Diffusion weighting was achieved with <italic>δ</italic>/Δ = 5/12 msec, <italic>b</italic>‐value = 3000 sec/mm<sup>2</sup>, 30 directions, and two signal averages with gradient polarity reversal for a total scan time of ~12 h. Multiexponential T<sub>2</sub> (MET<sub>2</sub>) data were acquired using a 3D multiple spin‐echo sequence with TR/TE/NE/BW/NEX = 520 msec/5.8 msec/18/38.5 kHz/6 and a total scan time of ~6 h.</p>
<p>For DTI analysis, diffusion tensors were estimated voxel‐wise using a linear least‐squares approach. From the tensors, DTI indices FA, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, and RD, respectively) were calculated on a voxel‐wise basis. For MET<sub>2</sub> analysis, data were fit by non‐negative least squares (NNLS)<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0023">23</xref> to the sum of signals from 100 logarithmically spaced <italic>T</italic>

<sub>2</sub> spectra were regularized using a minimum curvature constraint with a conservative regularization held constant across all voxels. Myelin water fraction (MWF) was defined as the percentage of signal with <italic>T</italic>
<sub>2</sub> &lt; 17 msec over total signal.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0027">27</xref> For quantitation, the average of regions of interest (ROIs) from the splenium, mid, and genu of the CC for each animal were averaged to generate a single data point per animal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="acn3254-sec-0011">
<title>Transmission electron microscopy</title>
<p>Specimens were processed for TEM per standard protocol and imaged in the Vanderbilt Cell Imaging Shared Resource‐Research Electron Microscopy facility (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA). Briefly, following anesthesia with ketamine/xylazine, mice underwent intracardiac perfusion as above for MRI and stored at 4°C. The samples were washed in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer then incubated for 1 h in 1% osmium tetraoxide at room temperature, washed with 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer, and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series followed by propylene oxide. Samples were infiltrated with graded concentrations of Epon 812 resin and propylene oxide, exchanged into pure epoxy resin, and polymerized at 60°C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (70–80 nm) were then cut from the block and collected on 300‐mesh copper grids. The copper grids were postsection stained at room temperature with 2% uranyl acetate (aqueous) and then with lead citrate. Samples were subsequently imaged on the Philips/FEI Tecnai T12 electron microscope (Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) at various magnifications.</p>

<title>Determination of axon density and calculation of <italic>G</italic> ratios</title>
<p>Number of myelinated and nonmyelinated axons per 15,000× field were determined and axon density calculated. <italic>G</italic> ratio, the ratio of axon diameter to the myelinated axon diameter were calculated via determination of the average axon and average myelinated axon diameter. <italic>G</italic> ratios were then plotted on the ordinate with axon diameter on the abscissa. A minimum of 50 axons per animal with an <italic>n</italic> &gt; 3 animals were used for generation of the <italic>G</italic>‐ratio plot.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Control and CKO animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and tissues were extracted on ice, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until use. Cortical lysates included the CC. Lysate preparation, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE), and western blotting were performed as described previously.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0019">19</xref> Primary antibodies included pS6 (Ser235/236), pS6 (Ser240/244), S6, pAkt (Ser473), pAkt (Thr308), Akt, pNDRG1‐Thr346, NDRG1, MAG, GFAP, 2′,3′‐cyclic nucleotide 3′‐phosphodiesterase (CNPase), and actin (Cell Signaling, 1:1000 dilution). Additional antibodies were MBP 1:1000 (rat, Abcam), PGP9.5 1:2000 (Serotec, Kidlington, UK), and actin 1:2000 (mouse, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).</p>

<title>Primary astrocyte cultures</title>
<p>Primary mixed glial cultures were prepared from P0 to P2 mouse brains with modification of published protocols.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0028">28</xref> Following euthanasia, brains were placed in ice‐cold minimum essential media (MEM) and cortex isolated from ventral structures and meninges.

Oligodendrocyte precursors were isolated by shaking overnight at 220 rpm to make both enriched oligodendrocyte and astrocyte cultures. Following shaking, oligodendrocyte precursors were plated into PLL‐coated six‐ or 24‐well plates in OL media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with BSA, progesterone, putrescine, sodium selinite, 3,3′,5‐triiodo‐<sc>l</sc>‐thyronine, insulin, glutamine, holo‐transferrin, B27, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) and subsequently harvested at DIV 9. Astrocytes remaining in the T25 flask were harvested, washed with PBS, and dissociated with 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Dissociated cells were plated into PLL‐coated six‐ or 24‐well culture dishes until day of harvest.</p>

<p>MRI‐based studies have demonstrated changes in diffusion‐weighted parameters such as FA in patients with TSC as well as in patients with autism, suggesting that myelin abnormalities may contribute to disease morbidity. To determine if similar myelin abnormalities exist following loss of <italic>Tsc2</italic> in oligodendrocytes, we imaged P60 <italic>Olig2‐Tsc2</italic> CKO and littermate control mouse brains ex vivo with a 15.2T MRI scanner. FA was significantly reduced in the CC in the <italic>Olig2‐Tsc2</italic> CKO brains compared to littermate controls, suggesting decreased directional organization of white matter tracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="acn3254-fig-0002">2</xref>). As both RD (perpendicular to the axon) and AD (following the direction of the axon) contribute to FA (cartoon inset, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="acn3254-fig-0002">2</xref>), analysis of directionality demonstrated that the reduction in FA in the CC was predominantly due to increased RD but not AD (data not shown, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0436), supporting that FA reduction is more likely due to a myelin abnormality than an axonal pathology.

<p>Electron microscopy was used to evaluate whether the observed hypomyelination and MRI changes were due to decreased total axonal myelin or alterations in myelin thickness. The overall density of myelinated axons was significantly decreased in the CC of the <italic>Olig2‐Tsc2</italic> CKO mice at P60 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="acn3254-fig-0003">3</xref>), with an associated decrease in the overall myelin fraction. <italic>G</italic> ratios (ratio of axon diameter to myelinated axon diameter) were calculated in the CC and were increased in the <italic>Olig2‐Tsc2</italic> CKO mice compared to littermate controls, consistent with decreased myelin thickness. Binning of the axons by diameter demonstrates that the increased <italic>G</italic> ratio is significant in axons less than 1 <italic>μ</italic>mol/L in diameter. These data suggest a reduced ability to myelinate axons in the CKO animals, with a bias toward myelination of larger diameter axons. The PI3K signaling pathway is involved in oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation, thus we sought to determine if changes in proliferation or differentiation could be a contributing mechanism to the observed hypomyelination. We identified cortical oligodendrocytes and myelin using immunostaining for the oligodendrocyte marker, Olig2, and MBP. There was a marked overall reduction in MBP expression seen diffusely throughout the cortex as well as the CC in P17 <italic>Olig2‐Tsc2</italic> CKO brains and ~50% reduction in Olig2+ cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="acn3254-fig-0004">4</xref>). A similar reduction in Olig2+ cell number was seen at 5 days of age (data not shown, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0048, <italic>n</italic> = 5–7). The number of MBP/Olig2 double‐labeled mature cortical oligodendrocytes was also significantly decreased. To determine the density of mature oligodendrocytes in white matter tracts, APC+ oligodendrocytes were counted in the CC. Consistent with that seen in the cortex, a 50% reduction in APC+ oligodendrocytes was seen in the CC. These data suggest that both decreased oligodendrocyte number and impaired maturation of oligodendrocytes may be contributing to the decrease in myelination.</p>

<p>Reduced oligodendrocyte numbers could be due to changes in proliferation or differentiation. Data from spinal cord injury models demonstrate a link between mTOR activity and cell fate, with activation of PI3K signaling stimulating differentiation of preoligodendrocytes to astrocytes.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0032">32</xref> As cortical tubers in TSC patients have prominent astrocyte pathology, we hypothesized that the decrease in oligodendrocyte number results from altered differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors into astrocytes rather than mature oligodendrocytes. Increased expression of the astrocyte marker GFAP was seen diffusely in white matter tracts and cortex in P17 <italic>Olig2‐Tsc2</italic> CKO (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="acn3254-fig-0005">5</xref>) animals and persisted throughout adulthood. We questioned whether this astrogliosis was a nonspecific response to altered structure or whether it was secondary to cellular fate change. To address this hypothesis, primary astrocyte cultures were generated from P0 to P2 mouse pups and evaluated with immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. In culture, astrocytes from CKO mouse brains were larger with a more diffuse shape as compared to a stellate shape of the controls. This was also reflected with both a slight but significant increase in spherical cell size as measured with a Cellometer during plating (control 14.55 ± 0.29 <italic>μ</italic>m, CKO 16.218 ± 0.30 <italic>μ</italic>m, <italic>n</italic> = 7–13 independent cultures, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0019 by two‐tailed <italic>t</italic>‐test) as well as an 80% increase protein yield (control 6.56 ± 0.61 <italic>μ</italic>g/<italic>μ</italic>L, CKO 11.92 ± 0.84 <italic>μ</italic>g/<italic>μ</italic>L, <italic>n</italic> = 7–18 independent cultures, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 by two‐tailed <italic>t</italic>‐test). Protein analysis demonstrated that the cortical astrocytes were targeted with a near complete ablation of tuberin as well as expected increase in S6 phosphorylation and reduction in Akt phosphorylation, consistent with deletion of <italic>Tsc2</italic> and subsequent mTORC1 activation and suppression of mTORC2 signaling.</p>

<p>We sought to determine the contribution of increased mTORC1 activity to <italic>Olig2‐Tsc2</italic> CKO hypomyelination through inhibition with rapamycin. Two treatment paradigms were used: an early treatment paradigm with 0.1 mg/kg rapamycin initiated prior to the maximal rate of myelination, P3 to P17<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0033">33</xref>; and a late paradigm with treatment started after myelination is nearly complete, with 0.6 mg/kg rapamycin daily from P30 to P60. At P17, following the early treatment paradigm, despite the expected reduction in S6 phosphorylation, cortical hypomyelination was not rescued (Table <xref ref-type="table-wrap" rid="acn3254-tbl-0001">1</xref>). Consistent with published reports following mTORC1 inhibition, overall expression of myelin proteins decreased in rapamycin‐treated controls. Olig2+ cell expression in the cortex was not changed with rapamycin treatment (data not shown), suggesting the possibility that the timing of treatment was too late to correct the reduction in cell number. In contrast to the early treatment paradigm, the late treatment paradigm did significantly increase MAG expression, but did not rescue the reductions in MBP or CNPase. The increased expression of GFAP persisted after rapamycin treatment, suggesting insensitivity of the gliosis to mTORC1 inhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="acn3254-fig-0006">6</xref>).</p>

<p>As the late rapamycin treatment paradigm led to slight improvement in myelin quantity as well as an improvement in the tremor seen in <italic>Olig2‐Tsc2</italic> CKO mice (data not show), we questioned whether myelin abnormalities may contribute to behavior abnormalities and whether they may be ameliorated with rapamycin treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="acn3254-fig-0007">7</xref>).

Furthermore, while rapamycin treatment did qualitatively reduce the tremor, it did not alter mean fall latency in either group or normalize gait abnormalities (Fig. S2). As human myelination abnormalities have been associated with ASD,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0005">5</xref> we expanded our studies to address autism relevant behaviors.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Myelin abnormalities have recently been reported in a wide array of neurodevelopmental disorders including TSC, Angelman's syndrome, and autism in part to advances in MRI techniques.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0036">36</xref> Consistent with these clinical findings, animal studies in TSC have demonstrated myelin abnormalities which though have been largely attributed to the neuronal abnormalities. We have demonstrated a marked hypomyelination phenotype following loss of <italic>Tsc2</italic> from oligodendrocytes and demonstrated MRI findings which recapitulate that seen in humans with TSC.</p>
<p>An extensive literature exists to support a role for PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in myelination, and in the context of this literature, our findings and those of Lebrun‐Julien et al.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0014">14</xref> are unexpected. A variety of mouse models have shown a positive correlation between Akt/mTORC1 activity and the degree of myelination. Whether from loss of upstream signaling through deletion of IGF1 or direct deletion of Akt isoforms, myelin quantity is decreased.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0038">38</xref> The effect of rapamycin on mutant and normal tissue along with more recent data with oligodendrocyte‐specific deletion of mTOR and Raptor, supports that mTOR activity downstream of Akt is important in the myelination process.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0040">40</xref> Conversely, hyperactivation of Akt signaling through deletion of PTEN or insertion of a constitutively active Akt results in a diffuse hypermyelination phenotype<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0042">42</xref> which is sensitive to rapamycin. In contrast to these studies, despite increased mTORC1 activity, the brains of <italic>Olig2‐Tsc2</italic> CKO mice are markedly hypomyelinated. The observed tremor phenotype is similar to that of other models of hypomyelination including the Cnp1 CKO mouse.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0030">30</xref> The decreased number of cortical and callosal oligodendrocytes suggests that altered proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursors contributes to the hypomyelination. The demonstration that both the <italic>G</italic> ratios of myelinated CKO axons were increased and that the proportion of Olig2+/MBP+ oligodendrocytes was reduced supports that oligodendrocyte maturation may also be impaired. The apparent increase in axon diameter in addition to decreased myelin thickness may be due in part to a bias toward myelination of larger axons versus a direct targeting of cortical excitatory neurons (Fig. S4).</p>
<p>Increased mTORC1 activity can lead to reductions in mTORC2 activity likely through a feedback loop involving IRS‐1. The decrease in NDRG1 phosphorylation in our model supports that mTORC2 signaling is decreased. We have hypothesized that decreased mTORC2 activity may contribute to myelination abnormalities based on our previous work with the <italic>Emx1‐Rictor</italic> CKO.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0019">19</xref> Preliminary studies in our <italic>Olig2‐Rictor</italic> CKO mouse (unpublished observation) and two recent reports from the Macklin and Wood labs with oligodendrocyte specific ablation of mTOR, Rictor and Raptor, provide additional support for a role for mTORC2 signaling in myelination.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0040">40</xref> While reduced mTORC2 activity is likely contributing to the hypomyelination in our model, the degree of hypomyelination seen is more dramatic than that seen with the <italic>Rictor</italic> CKO models, suggesting that this is not the key mechanism for the hypomyelination. Similarly, feedback inhibition of Akt activity is likely contributing to the hypomyelination through decreased phosphorylation of downstream effectors. One likely candidate is GSK3, which when inhibited by phosphorylation by Akt is associated with oligodedrogenesis.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0043">43</xref> Additional studies in primary cultures of oligodendrocytes will be required to fully delineate the specific signaling changes in oligodendrocyte precursors.</p>
<p>The extensive cortical and callosal gliosis is of interest as cortical tubers in TSC contain a mix of neuronal and glial components.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0020">20</xref> While the gliosis on our model may be a nonspecific response to hypomyelination, our data demonstrate that astrocytes are targeted. Data from a spinal cord injury models have demonstrated that increased BMP signaling through mTOR can change the fate of oligodendrocyte precursors from oligodendrocytes to an astrocytic lineage.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0044">44</xref> This, combined with the demonstration in culture that astrocytes are targeted in our mouse model in concert with a reduction in cortical oligodendrocytes, suggests the possibility of a fate change. While direct targeting of astrocytes by the <italic>Olig2‐Cre</italic> driver may serve as a potential confounder, the stark contrast between our <italic>Olig2‐Tsc2</italic> model versus the <italic>Olig2‐PTEN</italic> model of Harrington,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0029">29</xref> which at P20 demonstrates normal to increased expression of myelin proteins as well as gliosis (Fig. S5), supports a cell autonomous role for oligodendrocyte dysfunction in the hypomyelination. Additionally, the similarity of our results to Lebrun‐Julien et al.,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0014">14</xref> who used the Cre‐CNP driver to study the spinal cord, also supports a cell autonomous mechanism for hypomyelination. Additional fate mapping studies and generation of primary oligodendrocytes cultures will be of benefit in elucidating mechanisms for the oligodendrocyte reduction.</p>
<p>Given the known association of mTORC1 activity in myelin production, the lack of a rescue with the early rapamycin treatment paradigm is not surprising, especially when the detrimental effect of rapamycin on control pups is seen. The lack of efficacy and the reduction of Olig2+ cells seen as early as P5 suggests that loss of oligodendrocyte precursors may occur at an earlier time in development. While these data differ from the data of Way et al.,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0033">33</xref> it is likely that the degree of mTORC1 activity in neurons, while likely normalized by rapamycin in the Way et al. model, is expected to be suppressed by rapamycin in the Olig2 model. The improvements in expression of myelin proteins in the late rapamycin paradigm supports a continued process by which altered mTORC1, and likely mTORC2, activity inhibit proper myelination. The persistence of increased S6 phosphorylation after rapamycin may suggest that the inhibition of mTORC1 activity was incomplete, though given the decreased numbers of oligodendrocyte precursors seen prior to P17 and that rapamycin can decrease expression of myelin proteins, a complete rescue may not be possible as a deficiency of functional oligodendrocytes is likely.</p>
<p>The lack of a dramatic behavioral phenotype other than the gait abnormality and tremor is surprising given the degree of myelin impairment. The animals had no clear phenotype on rotarod testing and only a subtle, though rapamycin‐sensitive alterations in activity with elevated zero maze testing with no clear anxiety phenotype. The lack of a rotarod phenotype is even more surprising in the context of the gait abnormality and that Olig2 may additionally target a subset of spinal cord motor neurons. Using both an Ai14‐RFP reporter mouse line and analysis of spinal cord extracts, we do see targeting of spinal cord motor neurons and reductions in expression of spinal cord myelin proteins, respectively (Fig. S6), similar to that demonstrated by Lebrun‐Julien et al.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0014">14</xref> Likewise, there were no changes in the overall number of ultrasonic vocalizations with the exception of male pups only at P6/7. The behavior findings may be complicated by the fact that the animals used for the behavior studies were not fully back‐crossed (generation 4–5) which likely contributed to variability in activity and vocalizations. More studies in fully back‐crossed (generation 10+) animals are required to better determine if indeed autism‐relevant behaviors exist in this model.</p>
<p>These findings demonstrate that cell autonomous loss of <italic>Tsc2</italic> in oligodendrocytes leads to abnormal myelination and supports that abnormal myelination in TSC is likely due to both intrinsic abnormalities in oligodendrocytes as well as altered communication between neurons and oligodendrocytes.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="acn3254-bib-0015">15</xref> In addition, we utilized both standard (DTI) and novel (myelin water imaging) MRI techniques which may serve as important biomarkers in monitoring disease progression or response of myelin to therapeutic interventions. Characterization of the developmental changes attributed to oligodendrocytes and myelination is important for a better understanding of TSC as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders, including cryptogenic autism, for which myelination abnormalities may contribute to disease pathology. Importantly, given that myelination is largely a postnatal process, a window may exist for potential therapeutic interventions, thus further identification of relevant targets is of key importance. Future studies with this model focused on ASD‐relevant behaviors will need be conducted to better determine the applicability of this model as a tool to study pharmacologic interventions directed both at rescue of myelination and improvement in neuropsychologic sequela of autism.</p>
