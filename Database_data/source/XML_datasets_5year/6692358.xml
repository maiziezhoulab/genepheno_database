<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Schizophrenia (SZ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with complex genetic etiology. To date, 145 genetic loci have been associated through genome wide association studies (GWAS) with adult onset schizophrenia (AOS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The microRNA-137 (miR-137) gene (<italic>MIR137HG</italic>) is a top association in these studies with four regional SNPs (rs1625579, rs1198588, rs2660304, rs1702294) reaching genome wide significance. The morphological and functional complexity in the brain depends on a highly coordinated gene expression program that includes small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRs) which are critical for neurodevelopment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. MicroRNAs predominantly function to down-regulate the expression of target genes by binding to mRNA and either targeting transcripts for degradation or preventing translation. Convergent evidence from genetic, phenotypic, and functional studies support the association of miR-137 with SZ, with miR-137 gain-of-function implicated in risk. Notably, there is a significant overlap between miR-137 target genes and genes associated with SZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. <italic>MIR137HG</italic> risk genotypes are associated with phenotypic variability in AOS, such as age of onset, neuroanatomical structure, and function and negative symptoms of cognitive subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Aberrant neurodevelopment in-utero is thought to contribute to SZ, long before the onset of clinical symptoms. This is congruent with miR-137’s association to risk and biological role in neurogenesis and early neural development, with expression of miR-137 being tightly balanced during these critical windows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. miR-137 acts as a gene network hub during synaptic development, functioning upstream in many critical neurodevelopmental pathways that are independently associated with SZ such as Nrg/ErbB, PI3K-Akt-mTOR, and MAPK/ERK signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Additionally, miR-137 regulates adult neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and glutamatergic signaling, all processes thought to contribute to the pathobiology of SZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Despite these numerous associations, specific molecular mechanisms underlying miR-137’s genetic association to SZ are unclear.</p>
<p id="Par3">A single miRNA can regulate expression of thousands of target genes, and indeed miR-137 has over 1,300 predicted targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, even subtle changes in miRNA expression and function may have far reaching consequences. miR-137 is processed canonically through several stages and expression of miRs is largely dependent on processing efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Initially the primary miR (pri-miR) is transcribed and capped and tailed. The pre-miR sequence forms a stem-loop which is cleaved by the microprocessor comprised of DROSHA and its cofactor DGCR8. The pre-miR transcript is then exported out of the nucleus and cleaved a second time to become the final mature miR-137 strand. Determining how common genetic variants affect transcription and processing of miR-137 is a critical step in understanding molecular mechanisms contributing to the etiology of SZ. One variant found within <italic>MIR137HG</italic> which is proposed to alter miR-137 function, is a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) element located within the pri-miR-137 transcript six bases upstream of the pre-miR-137 sequence. The VNTR is a repetitive sequence of 15 bases with high GC content. Three repeats is the shortest known length and the common allele. <italic>In</italic>-<italic>vitro</italic> studies show that mature miR-137 expression is affected by the length of the VNTR where greater lengths are associated with lower expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Variations in VNTR length have also been shown to affect Stroop test performance in healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. To date, the relationship between VNTR length and transcript variation of pri-miR-137 has not been examined.</p>
<p id="Par4">The present study investigates whether the <italic>MIR137HG</italic> VNTR is associated with pri-miR-137 transcriptional variation during human brain development and contributes to the risk architecture of SZ through case-control haplotype analysis. The main objectives were (i) to characterize the transcription of MIR137HG at both early and late developmental time points through cloning and sequencing of human brain RNA, (ii) to evaluate VNTR length associations within transcript sequences, and (iii) to conduct haplotype analyses to evaluate whether the VNTR contributes to haplotype association with diagnosis. Our clinical cohort consisted of 307 healthy controls, 602 AOS patients, and an additional 89 childhood onset schizophrenia (COS) patients. COS is a rare form of SZ defined by the onset of psychotic symptoms before the age of 13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Previous work has determined COS to be a more genetically severe form of SZ, associated with a higher rate of copy number variants in genes associated with pathways of neuronal development and regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Evaluating genetic associations in multiple populations including COS is important for understanding the pathobiology of AOS and etiological differences between AOS and COS phenotypes. We predicted that GWAS SNP associations with AOS may also contribute to risk for COS, and therefore replicated SNP analysis in our COS cohort. Using a combination of molecular and bioinformatic approaches to evaluate <italic>MIR137HG</italic> transcription, we describe haplotype associations with SZ diagnosis, novel splice variants associated with VNTR length, and present new regulatory mechanisms for miR-137 which may have contributed to the evolution of increased human cognitive abilities as well as risk for complex neurodevelopmental disease.</p>

<title>Transcript characterization</title>
<p id="Par5">Transcription of pri-miR-137 was characterized using custom PCR primers in cDNA generated from pooled samples of human fetal and adult total brain RNA. Gel electrophoresis of PCR products exhibited a consistent multiple banding pattern for all reactions containing exon 3 (exon 1-5, exon 2-5, exon 3-5) with smaller product bands observed in addition to bands of expected size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). For these reactions, amplicon base sizes ranged from approximately 350 bases less than to expected sizes (E1-5:2034, E2-5:1797, E3-5:1694). Single bands were seen for exon 4-5 and exon 5-5 amplifications (base size: E4-5:1307, E5-5:838). The observed multiple banding pattern indicates alternative splicing of pri-miR-137 transcripts within exon 3. When comparing the same primer reactions (and equal concentrations of cDNA) between fetal and adult tissues, we noted that PCR bands of expected size were brighter relative to shorter bands within the adult brain, whereas all bands exhibited apparent equal luminosity within the fetal brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). This qualitative observation indicates potential differential transcript expression in adult vs. fetal brain.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Pri-miR-137 PCR Exhibits Multiple Banding Pattern. (<bold>a</bold>) PCR results are shown for pri-miR-137 custom primer pairs in adult and fetal total brain cDNA. Exon primer pairs are labeled along the top of each gel lane (i.e. E1-5 is primer pair exon 1 to exon 5). Ladders and corresponding base sizes are shown on either side. Results for both adult and fetal total brain tissues depict correct product lengths for all primer pairs (E1-5:2034, E2-5:1797, E3-5:1694, E4-5:1307, E5-5:838). A consistent multiple banding patterns can be seen for all reactions containing exon 3, indicating alternative splicing within exon 3. (<bold>b</bold>) A magnified view of PCR results for primer pair E3-5 demonstrates potential differential transcript expression between time points with brighter bands of expected size relative to shorter bands in the adult tissue and equal brightness between band sizes in the fetal tissue.

<p id="Par6">Next, cloning and sequencing of the PCR primer products allowed us to quantify and analyze relative proportions of pri-miR-137 transcript isoforms in the fetal and adult brain. Fifty-six total cDNA clones and corresponding full-length transcripts were sequenced from fetal brain and 78 total cDNA clones were sequenced from adult brain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). Two novel 5′ splice donor sites within pri-miR-137 exon 3 were identified, termed the primary (SS′) and secondary (SS″) splice sites based on frequency. The SS′ was found in 91% (30/33) of fetal spliced transcripts and 95% (n = 18/19) of adult spliced transcripts; the remainder of spliced transcripts were spliced at SS″. The remainder of cloned transcripts were confirmed as canonical pri-miR-137. Therefore, novel spliced transcripts accounted for 70% of the total in fetal brain and only 26% in adult brain. The location of both splice sites is within the pre-miR-137 sequence, upstream of the mature miR-137 sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Both splice sites precede splice site consensus sequence GT nucleotides, consistent with alternative splicing as opposed to microRNA processing. Importantly, the resulting spliced transcripts exclude the mature miR-137 sequence and are thus termed ‘deleted-miR-137’ (del-miR-137). Processing efficiency and expression of miR-137 would be decreased through expression of del-miR-137 transcripts. This alternative splicing pathway for del-miR-137 reveals a previously unknown mechanism for the potential down-regulation of mature miR-137. Del-miR-137 sequence data was deposited to GenBank and assigned the following accession numbers: MK631885, MK631886 and MK631887.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Cloning and Sequencing Transcript Data.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Variant</th><th colspan="2">Adult Brain</th><th colspan="2">Fetal Brain</th><th rowspan="2">FET p</th></tr><tr><th>(n = 73)</th><th>Freq.(%)</th><th>(n = 47)</th><th>Freq.(%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SS’</td><td>18</td><td>24.7</td><td>30</td><td>63.8</td><td rowspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>SS”</td><td>1</td><td>1.4</td><td>3</td><td>6.4</td></tr><tr><td>Total SS</td><td>19</td><td>26.0</td><td>33</td><td>70.2</td><td>2.15e-06</td></tr><tr><td>VNTR Length</td><td>(n = 73)</td><td></td><td>(n = 56)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>66</td><td>90.4</td><td>30</td><td>53.6</td><td rowspan="6"></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>1.4</td><td>20</td><td>35.7</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td><td>2</td><td>3.6</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td><td>2</td><td>3.6</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>6.8</td><td>2</td><td>3.6</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1.4</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>Total &gt;3</td><td>7</td><td>9.6</td><td>26</td><td>46.4</td><td>5.91e-06</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>SS’ - primary splice site, SS” - secondary splice site.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Novel Splicing of Pri-miR-137.

<title>Statistical transcript analyses</title>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>VNTR length frequency between age groups</title>
<p id="Par7">The VNTR allele frequency between fetal and adult groups was significantly different with a higher proportion of transcripts containing minor (&gt;3R) VNTR lengths in the fetal group (FET p = 5.919e-06) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). Differences in length of the VNTR between groups may reflect random population sampling differences between age groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">
<title>Frequency of spliced transcripts between age groups</title>
<p id="Par8">Next, the frequency of spliced transcripts was evaluated. All transcripts that spanned the splice sites (fetal 47/56, adult 73/78) were included in the frequency analysis. The proportion of spliced transcripts was significantly higher (FET p = 2.145e-06) in the fetal brain group(70%) compared to the adult group(26%) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). We propose that this finding is in part due to the VNTR length association with splicing frequency (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>) in addition to developmental regulation, as discussed subsequently.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>VNTR Length vs. Del-miR-137 Transcript Frequency. (<bold>a</bold>) Frequency of spliced del-miR-137 transcripts are depicted for fetal, adult, and combined allele length groups. There is a significant positive association between VNTR length and del-miR-137 frequency in all three (Adult, Fetal, Combined) groups (Adult: Fishers p = 3.09e-5, Fetal: Fishers p = 0.03, Combined: Fishers p = 7.10e-9). This correlation supports a role for VNTR length in alternative pri-miR-137 splicing, and ultimately regulation of miR-137 expression. Interestingly, there is also a significant difference in del-miR-137 frequency of the 3R transcripts between developmental groups with a higher frequency of 3R transcripts spliced in the fetal group (3R Fishers p = 6.8e-4). This indicates a potential epigenetic component underlying alternative splicing and that it is neurodevelopmentally regulated. (<bold>b</bold>) The frequency of del-miR-137 transcripts was significantly higher in the Fetal group (Fishers p = 2.15e-06) compared to the Adult group. We suspect that this reflects both an epigenetic developmental difference as well as differences in VNTR lengths between groups.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e700" xlink:href="41598_2019_48141_Fig3_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>

<sec id="Sec7">
<title>VNTR length correlation with del-miR-137 splicing</title>
<p id="Par9">Direct sequencing of cloned transcripts from fetal and adult total brain cDNA allowed us to evaluate VNTR length proportions between developmental groups and VNTR length associations with alternative splicing within and at an individual transcript level. All transcripts spanning both the VNTR and the splice sites were included in analyses of VNTR length versus alternative splicing (adult n = 73, fetal n = 47, combined n = 120). Importantly, we found significant positive associations between VNTR length and proportions of spliced transcripts, in both the adult and fetal brain. When transcripts were grouped by VNTR allele (3R, &gt;3R), for both age categories as well as combined total transcripts, a significantly higher proportion of transcripts containing VNTR lengths &gt;3R were also del-miR-137 transcripts (FET p = 0.029 fetal, p = 3.093e-05 adult, p = 7.098e-09 combined) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). These results demonstrate novel correlations between VNTR length and alternative splicing of the pri-miR-137.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec8">
<title>Splicing frequency comparisons between 3R groups across age</title>
<p id="Par10">All transcripts containing the VNTR were included in VNTR allele frequency analyses. While it is notable that the VNTR allele frequency between fetal and adult groups was significantly different, between group analysis confirmed that the major VNTR allele (3R) in the fetal brain was associated with higher levels of del-miR-137 transcripts compared to the 3R in the adult group (FET p = 6.790e-04; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). This finding reflects possible developmental differences in epigenetic regulation of the region, independent of VNTR length, since VNTR genotype is consistent between groups. This observation is consistent with the previous finding of significantly higher del-miR-137 transcripts in fetal brain compared to adult (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). All findings remain significant after controlling for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.</p>
<p id="Par11">Taken together, these results implicate VNTR length in conjunction with developmentally regulated epigenetic factors as part of a novel miR-137 regulatory mechanism mediated through pri-miR-137 alternative splicing.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec9">
<title>CpG island prediction</title>
<p id="Par12">The VNTR sequence has high GC content and in order to evaluate contributions of VNTR length to regional GC content we analyzed putative CpG islands (CGIs) using EMBOSS. Results show two putative CGIs within the <italic>MIR137HG</italic> genome region one smaller 247 base CGI spanning HG19 chr1:98456956 – 98457203 and a larger 647 base CGI spanning HG19 chr1:98457215 – 98457862 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). These regions overlap a large portion of pri-miR-137 exon 3, including the VNTR, pre- and mature miR-137 sequences and span into intron 3. Because the VNTR is within the CGI, increased VNTR lengths increase length of the CGI. These results indicate that the VNTR may impart regulatory effects on pri-miR-137 splicing through altered regional GC content.</p>

<sec id="Sec10">
<title>Competitive endogenous RNA <italic>in silico</italic> analyses</title>
<p id="Par13">The del-miR-137 transcript constitutes a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that may have independent regulatory function. LncRNAs can regulate miRNA target gene networks through a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. CeRNAs function by containing microRNA response elements (MREs) that competitively bind and sequester miRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To assess potential ceRNA functionality of the del-miR-137 transcripts, we first evaluated predicted MREs within the del-miR-137 sequence and generated a list of associated miRs using miRDB.org<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We found predicted MREs for 56 miRs (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Next, we evaluated potential target genes regulated by the top scoring miRs with target scores &gt;60 (n = 31). A list of 1,591 previously validated target genes was generated from the predicted binding microRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

<title>Analysis of GWAS SNPs in childhood onset schizophrenia</title>
<p id="Par14">We found no significant association between SNPs rs1625579 (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 2.259, df = 2, p = 0.294), rs2660304 (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1.195, p = 0.580) and COS diagnosis. SNP rs1198588 genotype was significantly associated with COS diagnosis (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 6.171, p = 0.048). The COS group had a higher frequency of minor (A/A) genotypes compared to controls (OR = 3.23, 95% CI 1.15–8.96).

<title>Case-control variant genotyping</title>
<p id="Par15">The VNTR was genotyped in all patients and controls to evaluate association with diagnosis. VNTR lengths ranged from 3 to 14 repeats (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). Previous findings as well as our current findings for VNTR length frequencies, particularly for longer repeats, vary between studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We found through extensive troubleshooting that extended VNTR lengths (&gt;9) require a high GC content PCR system in order to consistently amplify. We suspect that disparate allele frequencies between studies are due to different amplification protocols. Results of the VNTR case-control analysis failed to reach significance (p = 0.06), however the direction of effect indicates that the 3 repeat allele is found more frequently in patients (OR: 1.22), and we predict a significant effect may be seen with a larger sample size. Additionally, analysis of VNTR length alone is confounded by haplotype background, and potential additional risk variants within the region, we therefore next included the VNTR within a haplotype analysis.</p>

<title>Haplotype analyses</title>
<p id="Par16">To fully assess the VNTR contribution to risk while controlling for genetic background in the region, haplotype analyses were performed using SNP and VNTR genotyping data. This analysis also allowed us to evaluate risk for more rare haplotypes. Results are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>. The common haplotype (TT3T) frequency for each group is: 54.7% in controls, 57.3% in the combined patient sample, 57.5% in AOS and 56.5% in COS patients. The global haplotype analysis was significant for all diagnosis groups (Combined global simulated p = 4.9e-03, AOS global simulated p = 3.3e-03, COS global simulated p = 2.6e-03) indicating overall association of the haplotype block with SZ. Tables and plots of haplotype risk scores for each diagnostic group are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>. Haplotype risk scores indicate a significant protective effect for the (TT &gt; 3T) group in the combined (p = 0.014) and AOS (p = 0.020) groups. In the COS group, the directionality of the protective effect of the (TT &gt; 3T) was consistent but failed to reach significance (p = 0.098) likely due to the smaller sample size and lack of power in this group. Furthermore, significant haplotype associations to risk were also seen for three rare haplotypes. The combined and AOS groups showed significant association to the rare AT3G (Combined p = 0.009; AOS p = 0.007) and TG3T (Combined p = 0.006; AOS p = 0.001) haplotypes. The COS groups also had a significant score for the rare haplotype (AT3T p = 1.0e-5). Together, these results confirm overall association within the <italic>MIR137HG</italic> region to SZ and suggest combinatorial effects of the VNTR and the GWAS SNPs leading to both protective and rare high risk haplotype associations in patients with AOS and COS.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Global simulated p-value, haplotype frequencies, haplotype scores and simulated p-values are shown for Combined (<bold>a</bold>), AOS (<bold>b</bold>) and COS (<bold>c</bold>) Diagnoses.

The pattern of risk scores shows a potential protective effect for the TT &gt; 3T haplotype, and a potential risk associations with the AT3G and TG3T haplotypes for the combined (<bold>a</bold>) and AOS (<bold>b</bold>) groups. The AT3T haplotype had a significant risk score in the COS group (<bold>c</bold>) indicating a potential contribution to more severe phenotypes.

<p id="Par17">Results of the individual haplotype analysis allowed us to assess magnitude and direction of effect for significant haplotypes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>). We used the protective haplotype (TT &gt; 3T) as the reference to evaluate risk effects for the major haplotype. Results are consistent with the global haplotype score results. For the combined diagnosis group, individual haplotype analysis found significant effects for the common haplotype TT3T(OR: 1.32, p = 0.035), as well as for the rare haplotype AT3G(OR: 10.49, p = 0.022), and the rare haplotype group(OR: 2.36, p = 0.024). When the minimum frequency is lowered to 0.8% to allow for evaluation of the TG3T haplotype, complete separation is seen in the model with the TG3T haplotype only seen in cases and not in controls, and the rare haplotype group is no longer significant (p = 0.507). This complete separation confirms the global haplotype result that the TG3T haplotype is a rare high risk haplotype and indicates that the TG3T haplotype is driving the risk association with the rare haplotype group. An increased sample size is further needed to better assess the TG3T haplotype within the individual GLM model. Similar results were found for the AOS diagnosis group with significant risk associations for haplotypes TT3T(OR: 1.34, p = 0.034), AT3G(OR: 11.81, p = 0.016), and the rare haplotype group(OR: 2.22, p = 0.013). With the minimum haplotype frequency lowered to 0.9%, again we see complete separation with the TG3T haplotype being only found in patients, and the rare haplotype group becoming non-significant (p = 0.219). The risk association of the common TT3T haplotype relative to the TT &gt; 3T haplotype implicates the major VNTR 3R allele as a driver of risk for the TT3T haplotype. Genotyping allowed us to conduct LD analysis of the VNTR and GWAS SNPs within our control cohort. Results indicate low linkage between the VNTR and GWAS SNPs (VNTR LD versus: rs1198588 D′ = 0.03, r = 0.02; rs2660304 D′ = 0.04, r = 0.03; rs1625579 D′ = 0.02, r = 0.01) suggesting that VNTR instability is not haplotype dependent, and that GWAS SNPs would not be tagging the VNTR. This is consistent with previous VNTR LD findings and supports a role for other regional risk variants.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Individual Haplotype GLM Results.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Haplotype*</th><th colspan="4">Combined Diagnosis vs. Controls</th><th colspan="3">AOS Diagnosis vs. Controls</th><th colspan="3">COS Diagnosis vs. Controls</th></tr><tr><th>Freq. controls (n = 307)</th><th>Freq. patients (n = 691)</th><th>P</th><th>OR (CI)</th><th>Freq.

<p id="Par18">It is apparent from our data that the VNTR is not the only risk variant within the region as evidenced by low LD with the GWAS SNPs, the lack of risk association with the AG3G haplotype and high risk associations found with the rare AT3G and TG3T haplotypes. The high risk of these rare haplotypes suggest that recombination of the rs2660304 SNP region may also be contributing to risk. In order to evaluate how recombination alone may contribute to risk independent of the VNTR, we conducted global and individual haplotype analyses utilizing only SNP genotypes, excluding the VNTR variant. Results of these analyses confirm that recombination of the rs2660304 SNP alone is a driver of risk (Global haplotype scores: Combined: TGT p = 2.8e-3, ATG p = 1.9e-3; AOS: TGT p = 1.2e-3, ATG p = 9.9e-3. Individual GLM: Combined TGT OR: 12.24 p = 0.015, ATG OR: 12.22 p = 0.015; AOS TGT OR: 14.40 p = 9.0e-3, ATG OR: 13.27 p = 0.012). These results suggest that recombination of the rs2660304 region contributes to risk independently of VNTR genotype, through a presently unknown mechanism.</p>
<p id="Par19">A different pattern of association was found for COS diagnosis. The rare haplotype AT3T was significant (haplo.glm OR: 10.28, p = 8.0e-4), and no association was found with the common TT3T haplotype. This result is consistent with our previous data demonstrating a genotype association with the minor rs1198588 genotype (A/A) and COS diagnosis. These results may be spurious due to sample differences or they may represent an etiological difference between COS and AOS. Further functional studies will be needed to confirm risk association.</p>
<p id="Par20">As seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>, confidence intervals for rare haplotype associations are large due to low haplotype frequencies, larger sample sizes will be needed to determine more accurate effect sizes and replicability of the association findings. Overall, these results demonstrate a complex pattern of risk architecture for the <italic>MIR137HG</italic> region with shorter VNTR lengths and recombination of the rs2660304 region both independently contributing to risk for SZ diagnosis.</p>

<title>Human specific VNTR expansion</title>
<p id="Par21">Previous research demonstrates a significant correlation between VNTR genotype and cognitive phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that expansion of the VNTR is evolutionarily advantageous for cognition, due to its potential negative regulation of miR-137. To evaluate the VNTR in the context of mammalian evolution we used Ensembl Comparative Genomics to evaluate conservation. Sequence alignment shows that the VNTR length of 2 repeats and the surrounding region is highly conserved throughout the primate lineage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). However, the expansion of the VNTR to 3 repeats is human lineage specific. This result suggests that VNTR expansion may have contributed to increased human cognitive abilities and may contribute to risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as well as SZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Comparative Genomic Conservation of the VNTR.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par22">Through this work, we report novel miR-137 regulatory mechanisms and further characterize SZ risk architecture of the <italic>MIR137HG</italic> genome region. Transcript characterization at early and late developmental stages (fetal vs. adult) revealed a novel pri-miR-137 transcript isoform, del-miR-137. Expression of this lncRNA would down-regulate mature miR-137 expression through alternative 5′ splicing within the pri-miR-137 sequence. Importantly, we found a significant positive association with del-miR-137 transcripts and VNTR length. Increased VNTR lengths were observed more frequently within del-miR-137 transcripts. Analysis of regional GC content demonstrates that the VNTR contributes to length of an overlapping CpG island, which may underlie VNTR associations with alternative splicing. We describe common <italic>MIR137HG</italic> haplotype associations with SZ which are driven by VNTR length, in addition to more rare high risk haplotypes. These associations reveal multiple epistatic risk variants and overall complex risk architecture for the region, that may underlie the common GWAS associations to SZ.</p>
<p id="Par23">Our present findings are consistent with previous GWAS findings where the common variants are the risk variants. Haplotype analyses revealed risk association with the common TT3T haplotype to increased risk. Critically, our findings demonstrate that the VNTR is a driver of risk only on the background of the common haplotype, as the TT &gt; 3T haplotype imparts a protective effect. In conjunction with our finding that increased VNTR lengths are associated with del-miR-137 splice variants, we predict that the VNTR may mediate risk through altered GC content with the potential to affect DNA binding proteins such as methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (meCP2). MeCP2 has been shown to up-regulate alternative splicing and down-regulate miRNA processing and in this context may contribute to the protective effect of longer VNTR lengths. Functional studies to test this hypothesis are currently underway.</p>
<p id="Par24">Additionally, we describe a putative novel ceRNA function for the del-miR-137 transcript which may alter axon guidance and other neurodevelopmental pathways and provide additional protective effects for alternatively spliced transcripts independent of reduced miR-137 expression. In general our results suggest that shorter VNTR lengths may contribute to risk for observed miR-137 over-expression in SZ patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and longer VNTR lengths may impart a protective effect through decreased miR-137 expression. Interestingly, rare high risk haplotypes with recombination of the rs2660304 region were identified. Specific underlying risk mechanisms are unknown, however we predict that cis-acting repressive elements for both the major (TTT) and minor (AGG) haplotypes would be disrupted by recombination. This would result in increased miR-137 expression for the recombined (TGT and ATG) haplotypes, which would contribute to gain-of-function risk for SZ. Replication of our findings in a larger population cohort and further functional analyses is needed to validate these high risk associations and elucidate risk mechanisms.</p>
<p id="Par25">The human lineage specific expansion of the VNTR supports a potential role for this variant in the evolution of increased cognitive abilities in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Longer VNTR repeats would result in a competitive cognitive advantage associated with suppression of miR-137 expression. This is supported by GWAS associations with intelligence and cognitive performance within the <italic>MIR137HG</italic> locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Additionally, VNTR length may contribute to risk for other neurodevelopmental disorders. While SZ and ASD share a subset of phenotypes and risk variants, there are several known pathological variants and pathways in which the direction of risk for SZ is the opposite of risk direction for ASD, also known as the diametric hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The <italic>MIR137HG</italic> locus follows this diametric pattern of association. Findings from GWAS have identified minor allele SNPs within the <italic>MIR137HG</italic> locus to be associated with ASD, which is the opposite finding for GWAS SZ SNPs which are all major alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Conditional knockout of miR-137 in mice lead to social deficits and unusual repetitive behavior, phenotypes that are associated with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Individuals with microdeletion of <italic>MIR137HG</italic> had a syndrome presenting with intellectual disability, ASD, and obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. We predict that longer VNTR lengths may confer risk for ASD as miR-137 loss-of-function results in ASD like phenotypes. These findings support an evolutionary role for VNTR expansion in the development of the human brain.</p>

<title>Genotyping</title>
<p id="Par35">Three GWAS significant SNPs (rs1625579, rs1198588, rs2660304) were genotyped for all individuals. All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls (rs1625579: <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.275, p = 0.600; rs1198588: <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.039, p = 0.844; rs2660304: <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.275, p = 0.600). Genotyping was performed in duplicate for each sample using TaqMan Genotyping Assays and qPCR on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System. Samples were excluded if genotype calls were undetermined or if discrepant calls were made between duplicates after two rounds of genotyping. Multiple testing correction was not performed as we considered this a replicative analysis of previous associations in SZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>; p-values of &lt;0.05 were considered as statistically significant.</p>
<p id="Par36">An optimized PCR protocol for the VNTR was used to genotype all individuals with custom VNTR primers (Forward: 5′ GCTCAGCGAGCAGCAAGAGT; Reverse: 5′ GTCACCGAAGAGAGTCAGAGGACC) using the GC-RICH PCR System mfr. Roche. PCR products were run on a 3% agarose gel to resolve the 15 bp repeat size differences. After a sufficient number of samples were run, a band size ladder was generated with VNTR lengths ranging from 3–12 repeats. Ladder results were confirmed through DNA Fragment analysis (GENEWIZ) with a fluorescent FAM labeled primer (FAM labeled: 5′ TCACCGAAGAGAGTCAGAGGACC). Manual calls were 100% consistent with fragment analysis results. This ladder was used for comparison to genotype remaining individuals manually. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the VNTR and GWAS SNPs was calculated in the control cohort using the R package ‘genetics’ LD function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec26">
<title>Haplotype analyses methods</title>
<p id="Par37">Haplotype analysis was conducted using R haplo.score and haplo.glm functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Input data included unphased genotypes for all GWAS SNPs (rs1625579, rs1198588, rs2660304) and the VNTR for each individual. Global score tests of association use an additive GLM to regress diagnosis on haplotype pairs for an individual. Correction for multiple testing was performed by applying the simulate = TRUE parameter in haplo.score which provides simulated <italic>p</italic> values for each haplotype. Haplotypes were excluded with frequencies &lt;0.8% for the combined diagnosis group, and &lt;1% for AOS and COS groups. The magnitude and direction of individual haplotype effects is determined using a Wald type test relative to a common reference haplotype. Initially, rare haplotypes (&lt;0.8%) were grouped and included in the model. As complete separation was seen for the TG3T haplotype, minimum haplotype frequency was raised to 0.9% to include the TG3T haplotype with in the rare group and better fit the model. In order to evaluate effects the common haplotype, the second most frequent haplotype was used as the reference. An additional haplotype analysis was conducted using only GWAS SNPs to evaluate VNTR independent associations.</p>

<title>VNTR conservation</title>
<p id="Par38">Ensembl (release 95) Comparative Genomics was used to evaluate the conservation of the VNTR in the 75 eutherian mammals alignment set. The evaluated sequence included GRCh38.p12 Chromosome 1: 98,046,166-98,046,254.</p>

<sec id="Sec28">
<title>ceRNA pathway</title>
<p id="Par39">The miRDB.org website was used to generate a list of predicted miRs that bind to the del-miR-137 transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The miRDB tool uses a custom target prediction algorithm, MirTarget v4.0, which combines CLIP binding data and miRNA overexpression data to predict microRNA binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. The algorithm assigns target prediction scores between 50–100. Per miRDB recommendations, only miRNAs with a target score &gt;60 were used for further analysis. This list of miRNAs was then input into the miRSystem to determine potential target genes and conduct pathway ranking analysis for target gene pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. MiRSystem utilizes 7 algorithms predicting miRNA targets and two experimentally validated databases of miRNA target genes. Pathway analysis results are based solely on experimentally validated miR/target gene pairs.</p>
