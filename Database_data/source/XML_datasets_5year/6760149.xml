<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are serious mental illnesses that affect more than 2% of adults. While large-scale genetics studies have identified genomic regions associated with disease risk, less is known about the molecular mechanisms by which risk alleles with small effects lead to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In order to fill this gap between genetics and disease phenotype, we have undertaken a multi-cohort genomics study of postmortem brains from controls, individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Here we present a public resource of functional genomic data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; Brodmann areas 9 and 46) of 986 individuals from 4 separate brain banks, including 353 diagnosed with schizophrenia and 120 with bipolar disorder. The genomic data include RNA-seq and SNP genotypes on 980 individuals, and ATAC-seq on 269 individuals, of which 264 are a subset of individuals with RNA-seq. We have performed extensive preprocessing and quality control on these data so that the research community can take advantage of this public resource available on the Synapse platform at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://CommonMind.org">http://CommonMind.org</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Background &amp; Summary</title>
<p id="Par4">Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are serious mental illnesses (SMI) that affect more than 2% of adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. There has been much recent progress in understanding the genetic basis for schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Yet understanding the molecular mechanisms linking risk loci to disease phenotypes, and characterizing disease pathways remains an open challenge. Here we have compiled a large-scale functional genomics resource in order to understand the interplay between genetic regulation, gene expression, chromatin accessibility and disease in the human brain. We have generated RNA-seq (n = 991) and ATAC-seq (n = 269) profiles from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specimens and SNP genotypes (n = 1076) from 4 separate brain banks. The genotype data includes 98 samples without RNA- or ATAC-seq data released with the anticipation of including functional data for these in a future release.</p>
<p id="Par5">By providing an extensive public resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://CommonMind.org">http://CommonMind.org</ext-link>) of processed and quality controlled data, we aim to empower other researchers to apply novel methods and perform integrative analyses. Moreover, we provide raw and aligned data to enable custom reprocessing.</p>

<title>Multi-cohort data collection</title>
<p id="Par6">This data release of the CommonMind Consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> is composed of 4 separate brain banks (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Assembling individuals from multiple sites enables larger sample size; enables cross-site replication of findings; and reduces the effect of variables in sample collection, specimen preservation and generation of molecular data in any single site.

<title>RNA-seq quality control</title>
<p id="Par65">All RNA-seq samples were integrated into a single analysis across the 4 brain banks in order to perform a joint quality control. Retained samples had acceptable values for RIN (mean 7.6, sd ±0.9), intergenic rate (mean 5.7%, sd ±1.9%), total read pairs (mean 4.6e + 7, sd ±1.1e + 7), intronic rate (mean 36.7%, sd ±11.2%), mapped read pairs (mean 4.42e + 7, sd ±9.8e + 6) and ribosomal RNA rate (mean 0.03%, sd ±0.01%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Joint principal components analysis (PCA) of genes on autosomes identified outliers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). As expected, PCA identified two distinct clusters separated along PC2 that correspond to technical differences in the RNA library preparation. Among other technical differences, samples from HBCC underwent a negative-strand library preparation, while the library preparation of samples from the remaining brain banks was not stranded. Joint downstream analysis must therefore include an RNA library preparation indicator variable as a covariate in order to account for this technical source of variation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>RNA-seq quality control metrics stratified by disease status.

<title>ATAC-seq quality control</title>
<p id="Par67">Confirmation of the identity of samples and estimation of their contamination was performed by VerifyBamID (v1.1.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> based on the comparison of allele heterogeneity.</p>
<p id="Par68">To evaluate the overall quality of samples, the peaks of open chromatin regions (OCRs) were called using MACS (v1.4.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. For the purpose of quality control analysis, the consensus peakset was created from the individual peaks that were subsequently merged across all samples, retaining only peaks found in at least 2 samples. Subsequently, we counted how many reads for each sample overlapped each consensus peak using featureCounts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> in the Rsubread package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Finally, we counted fragments defined from paired-end reads that overlapped with the final consensus set of peaks.</p>
<p id="Par69">The sex of the samples was assessed using three metrics: (1) the heterozygosity rate of chromosome X genotype calls outside the pseudoautosomal regions. For this, we discarded variants with MAF &lt; 5%. In male samples, a high heterozygosity rate can indicate sample contamination, sex mismatch, or chromosomal abnormalities like Klinefelter’s syndrome. (2) The read counts of OCRs adjacent to FIRRE and XIST, which are only, or predominantly, accessible in females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. (3) Read counts in OCRs on chromosome Y outside the pseudoautosomal region.</p>
<p id="Par70">On average, we obtained 28.8 million uniquely mapped reads per sample after removing duplicate reads (mean 42%, sd ±9.5%) and those aligned to the mitochondrial genome (mean 8.9%, sd ±2.2%). Analyses included autosomes and sex chromosomes unless stated otherwise. The comparison of fractions of fragment in peaks (FRiP) was used to mark the replicates of lower quality for nine individuals that have more than one sample present in the dataset. Since we requested only one sample per individual, those nine replicates with lower FRiP were excluded. Using the sex check pipeline, two individuals were found to be genetically females though initially reported as males in the sample description (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). However, further inspection revealed that they were diagnosed with Klinefelter’s syndrome that biases this observation. No other sex abnormalities or mismatches were observed. For nine individuals, VerifyBamID detected an improper matching between ATAC-seq and Illumina genotyping (see below). Therefore, these samples were excluded together with additional nineteen samples that were identified as possibly contaminated, leaving a final total of 269 samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). Using this dataset, we generated a set of 272,424 peaks accounting for 4.96% of the genome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Finally, we quantified read counts of all the individual non-merged samples within these peaks and used these counts for MDS clustering (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Sex check of ATAC-seq samples.

<title>Variant concordance analysis across assays</title>
<p id="Par72">Integrated quality control across assays by evaluating concordance of genetic variants between SNP genotyping, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. A simple approach would be to directly call genetic variants from RNA-seq and ATAC-seq and compare across assays. Since variant calling from functional genomics assays is technically challenging and has a high error rate, we used a statistical method to compare a BAM file from RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to the SNP genotyping data and evaluate the read support for each sample using only autosomes. BAM files using reads aligned to GRCh38 were compared to genotype data originally processed on GRCh37, but subsequently lifted overt to GRCh38. VerifyBamID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> was used to match RNA-seq data to SNP genotyping. Using the flags --best--ignoreRG--verbose, we identified each RNA-seq sample’s best genotyping match, and removed potentially contaminated samples, as judged by the chipmix and freemix estimates. If a BAM file matched to the expected individual in the SNP genotype data, the sample was accepted if its chipmix and freemix parameters were both below 0.2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>). Higher values for chipmix and freemix can indicate contamination, so samples exceeding this cutoff were excluded. Alternatively, If a BAM file did <italic>not</italic> match to the expected individual in the SNP genotype data, the sample was excluded except in 4 cases were the sample could be rescued by re-labeling it to the proper individual. Bcftools gtcheck was used to compare all whole genome sequencing and genotyping data. These data were subsetted to include only dbSNP non-AT/GC SNPs with MAF &gt;0.25.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Assessing sample concordance using genetic variants.

<title>Use case 1: Differential expression analysis</title>
<p id="Par75">Dysregulation of gene expression is of primary interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of schizophrenia biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This CommonMind Consortium resource has RNA-seq data from postmortem brains from 351 schizophrenia cases and 500 controls. Researchers can perform differential expression analysis to identify genes whose expression differs significantly between cases and controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. The 4 cohorts can be used to evaluate how well signals from one cohort replicate in an independent cohort. A meta-analysis can be performed by analyzing each cohort separately combining the results of the statistical test, or a mega-analysis can be performed by combining all cohorts into a single analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec43">
<title>Use case 2: Differential chromatin accessibility</title>
<p id="Par76">The role of epigenetic variation and in particular the variation in chromatin accessibility between schizophrenia cases and controls is of particular interest for its role in mediating downstream gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This resource includes ATAC-seq data from 126 schizophrenia cases and 127 controls. Researchers can perform statistical analysis of differential chromatin accessibility between cases and controls. These results can then be compared to the differential analysis of gene expression to examine the shared and unique components of these assays. Moreover, the chromatin accessibility data can be directly integrated with gene expression data where both assays were performed on the same samples.</p>

<sec id="Sec44">
<title>Use case 3: eQTL/caQTL analysis</title>
<p id="Par77">Variants associated with schizophrenia are thought to mediate disease risk by regulating chromatin accessibility and then gene expression. By integrating genome-wide SNP genotyping data with RNA-seq from 981 individuals, researchers can identify eQTL’s. By integrating SNP genotyping data with ATAC-seq data, researchers can identify chromatin accessibility QTL’s (caQTL’s). These eQTL/caQTL results can then be integrated with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of schizophrenia or other neuropsychiatric diseases to identify genes, or ATAC-seq peaks than mediate disease risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="Sec45">
<title>Use case 4: Coordinated regulation of epigenetics and gene expression</title>
<p id="Par78">Integrated analysis of caQTLs, eQTLs, and GWAS summary statistics can trace the impact of risk variants from their downstream effect on a specific open chromatin region to the effect on gene expression and finally to disease risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. This integrated framework can be used to understand epigenetic regulation of gene expression and further prioritize disease genes.</p>
