<abstract>
<p>Inducing somatic cells into neural stem cells (iNSCs) in specific ways provides a new cell therapy in a variety of neurological diseases. In the past, iNSCs were generated by transcription factors which increased the risk of mutagenesis, tumor formations, and immune reactions by viral transduction vectors. Therefore, in this study, different small molecules were used to induce mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into iNSCs in different reprogramming stages, which showed high reprogramming efficiency without altering the genome. We demonstrated that the small molecules staged-induction neural stem cells (SMSINS) have the characteristics of neural stem cells (NSCs) in morphology, gene expression, self-renewal and differentiation potential. Furthermore, valproic acid (VPA), one of small molecules, was showed to enhance neural induction with highest efficiency compared with six other small molecules, which were also investigated in the present study. Moreover, our results suggested that activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling enhanced the induction efficiency and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, our findings indicated that using this induction program allowed us to obtain safe and efficient iNSCs which were free of genetic manipulation. The VPA-mediated mTOR signaling pathway may enhance reprogramming efficiency and neuronal differentiation. So we suggested that this program could be a new method of obtaining iNSCs for the treatment of neurological diseases by cell replacement therapy in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular replacement holds potential opportunities to treat diseases which result from loss of specific cells like NSCs in neurodegenerative diseases such as ischemic stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Hedlund and Perlmann, 2009</xref>). NSCs could be generated from induced differentiation of iPSCs or ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Takahashi et al. (2007)</xref> illustrated that iPSCs could be directly generated from mouse or human fibroblasts by the additional supplements of defined transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>). However, iPSCs need to be differentiated into specific-lineage cell types for cell therapeutic purpose with long induction period and low induction efficiency. Moreover, iPSCs may cause teratomas, a major safety hurdle in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Fong et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, somatic cells could be directly reprogrammed into lineage-restricted stem cells such as NSCs, which enhances differentiation efficiency and lowers the risk of teratoma formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Ring et al., 2012</xref>). Compared with iPSCs, iNSCs not only maintain its proliferative potential, but also differentiate more easily into three neuronal lineages, namely neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Thus, iNSCs are more suitable than iPSCs in clinical applications for the treatments of neurological diseases.</p>
<p>Recently, some researchers found fibroblasts could be reprogrammed into NSCs using transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Ring et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Thier et al., 2012</xref>). However, they were limited to clinical applications because of the risk of viral transduction vectors and the transgene integration. To find a way without the insertion of any gene, several studies have focused on small molecules to regulate signaling pathways and improve reprogramming efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). VPA, as one small molecule, shows a direct inhibition of HDACs inhibitors activity and causes hyperacetylation of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Phiel et al., 2001</xref>). In the CNS, VPA promoted the neurogenesis of embryonic rat cortical cells to striatal primordial stem cells, and increased neuronal differentiation of NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Laeng et al., 2004</xref>). Studies have shown that VPA not only can improve reprogramming efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Mirakhori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Han et al., 2016</xref>), but also induce neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal NSCs and inhibit astrocytes and oligodendrocytes differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, VPA exposure also activated mTOR signaling which is a key regulator to proliferation in NSCs or NPCs and essential for terminal differentiation of NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Hsieh et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the preparation phase, we found that the reprogramming efficiency and neuronal differentiation exhibited significant differences with or without VPA. We hypothesized that exposure to VPA could enhance induced efficiency and neuronal differentiation through activating mTOR signaling. Then we discussed the effect of specific mTOR signaling activators or inhibitors on reprogramming efficiency to find a new pathway in the induction program.</p>

<title>Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts Preparation and Mouse Neural Stem Cells</title>
<p>Isolation of MEFs was from E13.5 mouse embryos (C57BL/6, stain) as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). To remove neural tissues and derive pure fibroblasts, the head, limb, tail, and internal organs were removed from the E13.5 mouse embryos. Then the body tissues were slices into small pieces, trypsinized, and culture in MEFs medium [DMEM (Gibco) supplement with 10% FBS (Gibco) 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco)] at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. In this study, we used MEFs with the third passage for avoiding cellular senescence. After separating the bodies of embryos from the heads, the cerebral cortexes were separated from heads with stereomicroscope, then cut up and were digested with 0.05% trypsin to obtain single cells of NSCs that cultured in NSCs medium [DMEM/F12 (Gibco) containing with 1 × N2 supplement (Gibco), 1 × B27 supplement (Gibco), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco), 20 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech), and 20 ng/ml bFGF (Peprotech)].</p>

<sec id="S2.SS3">
<title>Stage-Induction of SMSINS Cells</title>
<p>Generally, MEFs were treated with LDN193189 (selleck S2618, 0.25 μM), SB431542 (selleck S1067, 1 μM) on day 1 and day 2. CHIR99021 (selleck S2924, 3 μM), DAPT (selleck S2215, 5 μM), and VPA (sigma P4543, 0.5 mM) were used on day 3 and day 4. CHIR99021 (selleck S2924,3 μM), DAPT (selleck S2215, 5 μM) were used on day 5 and day 6. Shh (Peprotech 315225, 100 ng/ml) and Purmorphamine (selleck S3042, 1 μM) were used to improved neural differentiation on day 7 and day 8. Then, all small molecules were withdrawn on the last 2 days. After 10 days, SMSINS cells were plate into coated poly-<sc>D</sc>-lysine (10 μg/ml)/laminin (5 μg/ml) (sigma) (PDL/L) for proliferation or next test. However, for neurosphere culture, SMSINS cells were trypsinized to single cells and seeded into uncoated 24 well-plates in NSC medium. The half of medium was switched every 2 days.</p>
<p>To mediate mTOR signaling, we repeated the program except that Rapamycin (sigma V900930, 2 μM) was added on day 3 and day 4 and MHY1485 (selleck S7811, 1 μM) replaced VPA.</p>

<title>Differentiation of SMSINS Cells <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>Cells were seeded at 5000 onto PDL/L 24 well-plates in special medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). For spontaneous differentiation, cells were changed to NSCs medium without containing bFGF and EGF, named N2-B27 medium, for 2 or 3 weeks. For neuron differentiation, cells were cultured in Neural basal medium [50% Neurobasal Plus Medium (Gibco) and 50% DMEM/F12 containing with 1 × N2 supplement, 1 × B27 supplement, 2 mM L-Glutamine] supplement with 10 ng/ml BDNF (Peprotech) and 200 μM ascorbic acid (Sigma) for at least 2 weeks. As for mature neuron differentiation, the medium was switched neuron medium containing NSCs medium supplement with 100 ng/ml Shh and 1 uM retinoic acid (sigma) for 4 days, then replaced with the Neural basal medium supplement with 10 ng/ml BDNF, 10 ng/ml GDNF (Peprotech), 2 μM cAMP (sigma), and 200 μM ascorbic acid for 4 weeks. To differentiate into astrocytes, the special astrocyte medium used was a mixture of NSC medium and 20 ng/ml CNTF (Peprotech) for 4 days. Then all growth factors were withdrawn and replaced with 10 ng/ml BDNF, 10 ng/ml GDNF, and 200 μM ascorbic acid for the next 14 days. For oligodendrocytes differentiation, SMSINS were cultured in NSCs medium supplement with 10 ng/ml NT-3 (Peprotech) and 20 ng/ml PDGF (Peprotech) for 6 days, then N2-B27 medium containing with 10 ng/ml NT-3, 20 ng/ml PDGF, and 200 μM ascorbic acid for 8 days. For further differentiation of the SMSINS cells into mature oligodendrocytes, 10 ng/ml BDNF and 10 ng/ml GDNF were added to N2-B27 medium containing 200 μM ascorbic acid for at least 2 weeks.</p>
<p>To differentiate into neuronal subtypes, dopaminergic neuron, cells were cultured into NSCs medium supplement with 100 ng/ml FGF8 (Peprotech) and 200 ng/ml Shh for 4 days. Then the medium was switched the Neural basal medium containing with 10 ng/ml BDNF, 10 ng/ml GDNF, and 200 μM ascorbic acid for 14 days. For cholinergic neuron differentiation, the same conditions as dopaminergic neuron were used, except that in the latter case 1 μM retinoic acid and 100 ng/ml Shh were added to NSC medium for the first 4 days instead of FGF8 and 200 ng/ml Shh. GABAergic neuron medium was approximately identical to dopaminergic neuron, but FGF8 was replaced by 10 μM VPA for the first 4 days.</p>

<title>SMSINS Cells Can Be Obtained From MEFs by a Staged-Induction Program of Small Molecules</title>
<p>To investigate whether small molecules can replace transcription factors to chemically reprogram MEFs into NSCs, we searched the literature broadly to identify potential candidate molecules based on two major selection criteria; (1) that they inhibit fibroblasts signaling pathways, (2) that they activate neural signaling pathways. According to criteria, we found a cocktail of seven small molecules (LDN193189, SB431542, CHIR99021, VPA, DAPT, Shh, and Purmorphamine) capable of directly reprogramming MEFs into NSCs. For initial examination, we performed seven small molecules together to MEFs cultures, but massive cell death was observed after drug treatment. To reduce cell death, we applied different small molecules at different time points to reprogram cells. SB431542 is an inhibitor of TGF-β receptors, and has been reported that it could enhance reprogramming in the MET transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Ichida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Li et al., 2010</xref>). LDN193189 is an inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors and helpful to enhance neural induction. For more reprogramming efficiency, it was often combined with SB431542 to facilitate neural transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Mirakhori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Park et al., 2017</xref>). CHIR99021, an inhibitor of GSK3β, was commonly used in reprogramming studies due to its high reprogramming efficiency in combination with other small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). DAPT is a γ-secretase inhibitor that interferes with Notch activity and promotes neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Borghese et al., 2010</xref>). As mentioned, VPA enhance reprogramming efficiency and neuronal differentiation from NSCs. Both Shh and Purmorphamine are agonists for the Shh signaling pathway to complete the reprogramming MEFs into NSC-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Moon et al., 2011</xref>). This staged-induction program was illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p>

<p>Mouse embryonic fibroblasts in our cultures were immunostained for fibroblast markers Col1a1 with no NSCs markers like Nestin and Sox2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). It was reported that neural precursors could be isolated from juvenile and adult rodent skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Toma et al., 2001</xref>). To eliminate the possibility of neural precursors from mouse skin, MEFs were negative to Sox2 and Nestin before being used for induction. Using seven small molecules for staged-induction, MEFs in induction medium started to aggregate on day 2, then gradually developed several colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). MEFs expressed the fibroblast markers Collagen IV without NSCs markers Nestin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). SMSINS cells attaching on PDL/L was detected with typical NSCs markers Nestin and Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In order to compare the characteristics, native NSC cells were isolated from embryonic mouse brain. To further detect the expression of Nestin and Sox2, we showed the analysis of FACS results for SMSINS cells and NSCs, demonstrating that Nestin-positive cells of NSCs were slightly higher than SMSINS, but Sox2-positive cells were slightly lower than SMSINS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>SMSINS Cells Performs the Characteristics of NSCs</title>
<p>We dissociated SMSINS cells into single cells, and then cultured them on PDL/L plate in NSC medium, which was recorded as passage one. SMSINS cells were able to expand six passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thereafter, SMSINS cells continued amplification and detected Nestin expression at the sixth and ninth passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B,C</xref>). To further detect morphological characteristics of SMSINS cells, cell colonies were dissociated into single cells. We seeded them on uncoated plates, and single cells grew neural spheres like a typical morphology of native NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, we fixed these spheres and immunostained with Nestin to confirm them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>SMSINS Have a Potential of Multi-Potent Differentiation Into Neural Cell Lineages</title>
<p>One of the most prominent parts of our research is identifying the SMSINS cells capacity to differentiate into neural cell lineages and neuronal subtypes <italic>in vitro</italic>. First, SMSINS cells could spontaneously differentiate into neurons (Tuj1-positive cells, 32 ± 2%), astrocytes (GFAP-positive cells, 55 ± 3%) and oligodendrocytes (Olig2-positive cells, 38 ± 6%) by treatment with NSC medium without EGF and bFGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,C</xref>). For guided differentiation into three neural lineages, SMSINS cells were cultured in the respective specific medium. As for neuron differentiation, 58 ± 9% of cells was Tuj1-positive neurons according to the neuronal protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B,D</xref>). Moreover, our study proved that SMSINS cells were able to express a mature neuronal marker NeuN cultured with mature neuron medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>). Astrocytes were differentiated from SMSINS cells and 61 ± 14% of cells expressed GFAP-positive in specific differentiation morphology. In characteristic protocol, an average 53 ± 6% of cells were Olig2-positive oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B,D</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression of Endogenous Relative Transcription Factors and Epigenetic Analyses During Reprogramming Process</title>
<p>To investigate gene profile changes during reprogramming process, we analyzed the expression of several typical NSCs markers such as Nestin, Sox2, and Sox1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). After small-molecule induction, we found a gradual increase in the NSC-related gene. Furthermore, we detected the expression of iPSCs-related gene Oct4 to understand whether there was a pluripotent stem cell intermediate during small-molecules treatment. The level of Oct4 at each stage was never higher than NSCs group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). In a conclusion, these results suggest that our staged-induction program could activate NSC-related transcription factors.</p>

<p>To ensure the epigenetic analyses during reprogramming process, we performed immunofluorescence staining to examine changes in the expression of several related proteins. First, we found that epigenetic expression of Nestin level was activated at day 4 and substantially increased at day 10, which suggested a dynamic reprogramming process into the NSCs state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B,C</xref>). To ensure that SMSINS cells were directly reprogrammed from MEFs instead of re-differentiation from intermediate pluripotent cells, we found that the iPSCs marker Oct4 had not been detected during the whole reprogramming process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>).</p>

<title>VPA Shows Highest Efficiency in Cellular Reprogramming and Neuronal Differentiation</title>
<p>To ascertain the precise effect of each molecule in reprogramming and optimize the staged-induction program, we withdrew one small molecule from our induction protocol. When we compared Nestin expression of drug-withdrawing groups by immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR analysis, we found that each group exhibited reduction of Nestin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A–J</xref>). Notably, we found that both protein expression and gene level showed a significant reduction in reprogramming efficiency due to the removal of either VPA or DAPT. The reduction was even more significant with removal of VPA. Removing LDN193189 also has a significant effect in efficiency reprogramming. Interestingly, removing CHIR99021, SB431542, or Purmo + Shh slightly reduced the level of Nestin expression in qRT-PCR analysis and immunofluorescence staining assays. In order to ascertain that VPA further affected neural spontaneous differentiation, especially into neuron, we compared neuronal marker Tuj1 expression of VPA-withdrawing groups and SMSINS. Our data showed that Tuj1 expression was significantly reduced due to removal of VPA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<title>The Facilitative Effect of Neuronal Differentiation by VPA May Be Mediated by mTOR Signaling</title>
<p>To detect the mechanism underlying the role of VPA in the induced stage, we evaluated the effect of mTOR inhibition rapamycin and activator MHY1485 on the induced NSCs. First, we formed four groups: SMSINS, -VPA, SMSINS + rapamycin, and -VPA + MHY1485. Then we observed the expression of mTOR of each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Secondly, we examined the effects of mTOR signaling on the induction program from the aspects of reprogramming efficiency, neuronal differentiation and proliferative potential according to the characteristics of NSC. As mentioned earlier, removal of VPA caused a significant decrease in the reprogramming efficiency. Similarly, when mTOR-specific inhibitor was added to the induction protocol, the Nestin expression was significantly reduced. Interestingly, replacing VPA with MHY1485 partially increased induction efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7B,C</xref>). For detecting the differentiation effect of mTOR signaling, we caused the induced NSCs of each group to spontaneously differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). We found that SMSINS cells could differentiate into neural cell lineages, but the differentiation ability of the -VPA group and the SMSINS + rapamycin group is attenuated. However, although the induction protocol was removed from VPA, supplementation with MHY1485 to activate mTOR signaling also showed neuronal phenotype.</p>

<p>To further confirm the proliferative potential in the different groups, we found that there was no significant difference in cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, regardless of whether or not MHY1485 was added, removing VPA could slightly reduce self-renewal. Furthermore, inhibition of mTOR signaling did not result in a significant decrease in proliferative capacity. This result indicated that the mTOR signaling was independent of proliferation ability, and that the effect of VPA on proliferation was through other pathways.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Reprogramming somatic cells into iNSCs with the capabilities of self-renew and differentiation has great value as cell transplantation therapies in many neural diseases. Our study demonstrated that fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into NSCs by seven small molecules without involving any genetic materials. Furthermore, SMSINS cells could be passaged and differentiated into three neural lineages.</p>
<p>Noticeably, we reviewed previous researches and selected seven small molecules. Then, we found that adding seven small molecules together would cause cell death, which was considered to be due to the possibility of simultaneous inhibition of some signaling pathways or excessive DMSO intake. To overcome this problem, we reviewed related researches and concluded that MET should be promoted in the early induction stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). TGF-β signaling plays an important role on modulation of EMT, a process by which an epithelial cell becomes a mesenchymal cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Grunert et al., 2003</xref>), in normal human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Valcourt et al., 2005</xref>). The generation of iNSCs from MEFs requires an increase in the MET process, through inhibition of TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Valcourt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The combination of the TGF-β inhibitor SB431542 and LDN193189 enhances the reprogramming efficiency of MET transition. Therefore, we selected the combination of the TGF-β inhibitor SB431542 and LDN193189 on early stage to enhance the reprogramming efficiency of MET transition. Then, we used CHIR99021, DAPT, and VPA to improve reprogramming efficiency, and observed that level of NSCs marker Nestin expression increased significantly. Purmorphamine/Shh promoted neural differentiation. In general, our data showed that the level of NSCs marker Nestin expression gradually enhanced during the induction period. We calculated the number of Nestin-positive cells in the passage 6 and passage 9 that was gradual decrease, which was considered the continued differentiation at each passage.</p>
<p>To further identify the effect of each small molecule in reprogramming by withdrawing individual molecules, we ultimately found that VPA played the most significant role in the induction protocol, followed by DAPT, LDN193189, Purmo + Shh, CHIR99021 and SB431542. VPA, a HDACs inhibitor, was widely used in reprogramming studies to eliminate the original epigenetic memory of cells. It could play important role in upregulation of ESC-specific genes and downregulation of MEFs-specific genes and improve reprogramming efficiency by more than 100-fold in iPSCs induction process, using Yamanaka factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Huangfu et al., 2008</xref>). Our study also suggested that VPA was a key step in the induction stage. Furthermore, VPA has been shown to enhance the reprogramming efficiency of iPSC from somatic cells through the directly activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to Oct4 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Teng et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, VPA activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to ameliorate pathology of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in mouse and induce neuronal differentiation of NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Gurpur et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). To test whether VPA enhanced neural induction efficiency through mTOR signaling, NSCs phenotype, neuronal differentiation and self-renewal were examined using an induction protocol supplemented with mTOR-specific inhibition or activator. Our study showed that inhibiting mTOR signaling pathways without removing VPA supplement significantly decreased the induction of NSCs and neuronal differentiation. Although other studies focused on other reprogramming-related pathways of VPA such as inhibiting HDACs or activating canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Ciani and Salinas, 2005</xref>), our study proved the importance of mTOR signaling for reprogramming efficiency and neuronal differentiation. However, the use of mTOR-specific activators instead of VPA did not fully compensate for the lack of induction efficiency. We considered that the MHY1485 was added on day 3–4, the same point time as the VPA treatment to make the experimental condition and results more comparable. The short duration of MHY1485 exposure might explain why it was not able to significantly change mTOR expression to activate the iNSCs. Moreover, VPA possibly effects the induction phase through pathways other than the activation of mTOR signaling. Overall our results suggest that mTOR signaling plays an important role in the inducing program and merits further study. Several reports showed that the mTOR pathway was a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Endo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kaeberlein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). However, our results demonstrated that the mTOR signaling had no significant effect on cell proliferation in three replicate experiments. In stem cells, mTOR finely regulated the balance between self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the role of active mTOR signaling during induction is more likely to induce NSCs and neuronal differentiation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we illustrated that a small molecule stage-induction program could obtain iNSCs with the characteristics of self-renewal and neuronal differentiation. The advantage of this program was that it not only reduces the number of cell death, but also enhances efficiency without going through the pluripotent stage. Furthermore, VPA significantly improved reprogramming efficiency and neuronal differentiation. Our results suggest that VPA may stimulate mTOR signaling as conceptually illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, an aspect which we will investigate in future studies.</p>
