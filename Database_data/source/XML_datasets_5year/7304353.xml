<abstract>
<p>Exome sequencing (ES) has become an important tool in pediatric genomic medicine, improving identification of disease-associated variation due to assay breadth. Depth is also afforded by ES, enabling detection of lower-frequency mosaic variation compared to Sanger sequencing in the studied tissue, thus enhancing diagnostic yield. Within a pediatric tertiary-care hospital, we report two years of clinical ES data from probands evaluated for genetic disease to assess diagnostic yield, characteristics of causal variants, and prevalence of mosaicism among disease-causing variants. Exome-derived, phenotype-driven variant data from 357 probands was analyzed concurrent with parental ES data, when available. Blood was the source of nucleic acid. Sequence read alignments were manually reviewed for all assessed variants. Sanger sequencing was used for suspected de novo or mosaic variation. Clinical provider notes were reviewed to determine concordance between laboratory-reported data and the ordering provider's interpretation of variant-associated disease causality. Laboratory-derived diagnostic yield and provider-substantiated diagnoses had 91.4% concordance. The cohort returned 117 provider-substantiated diagnoses among 115 probands for a diagnostic yield of 32.2%. De novo variants represented 64.9% of disease-associated variation within trio analyses. Among the 115 probands, five harbored disease-associated somatic mosaic variation. Two additional probands were observed to inherit a disease-associated variant from an unaffected mosaic parent. Among inheritance patterns, de novo variation was the most frequent disease etiology. Somatic mosaicism is increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to genetic disease, particularly with increased sequence depth attainable from ES. This report highlights the potential and importance of detecting mosaicism in ES.</p>

<body><sec id="s1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of the exome has demonstrated significant diagnostic and clinical utility in patients with suspected genetic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC25">Lee et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC14">Farwell et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC33">Meng et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC10">Clark et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC16">Hu et al. 2018</xref>). Molecular diagnostic rates from clinical testing by hospital and reference laboratories performing exome sequencing (ES) range from 24% to 58%, likely influenced by laboratory-specific methodologies and by the characteristics of the patient population being evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC10">Clark et al. 2018</xref>). Given the utility of ES, it has been proposed that the assay should be considered as a first-tier molecular test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC49">Stark et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC16">Hu et al. 2018</xref>). An additional advantage to this type of testing is the ability to reevaluate existing sequence data as advances in bioinformatic processing and variant detection occur over time. Furthermore, this approach allows for a consideration of the evolution of patient phenotype, in addition to the inclusion of updated/emerging data for disease–gene associations, thus further enhancing diagnostic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC13">Ewans et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC36">Nambot et al. 2018</xref>).</p><p>The increased utilization of MPS, including ES, has expanded our understanding of the contribution of somatic mosaicism in genetic disorders by enhancing our ability to identify disease-associated variants at low variant allele frequency/fraction (VAF). Genetic variation acquired during embryogenesis and resulting in the establishment of two or more genetically distinct cell populations represents postzygotic mosaicism. Disease-causing variants can be confined to the germline (gonadal mosaicism), resulting in disease when passed on to subsequent offspring. Alternatively, a genetic variant can occur in the soma of a developing embryo (somatic mosaicism), with variable levels of the variant throughout the body dependent on cell lineage. In addition, a mosaic variant affecting both the soma and germline is referred to as gonosomal mosaicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC5">Biesecker and Spinner 2018</xref>). The phenotypic spectrum of postzygotic somatic mosaicism can vary and is dependent upon timing of the manifestation of the variant during development, along with the proportion of cells harboring the variant and distribution across tissue types. Pathogenic variants at very low VAF in affected tissue can be sufficient to cause disease. For example, in diseases such as Sturge–Weber or vascular anomalies with overgrowth (e.g., Proteus syndrome or <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-related overgrowth spectrum [PROS]), the VAF of pathogenic variants in affected tissue has been reported as low as 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC27">Lindhurst et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC46">Shirley et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC17">Hucthagowder et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>Among unselected clinical exome cohort studies of pediatric, and combined pediatric and adult populations, disease-associated mosaic variants were noted at a frequency of ∼1%–1.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC53">Yang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC40">Retterer et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC9">Cao et al. 2019</xref>). The frequency of mosaicism increases when examining for specific phenotypes. For example, in epilepsy-related neurodevelopmental disorders, 3% of the pathogenic variants identified by either an MPS epilepsy panel or ES were mosaic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC50">Stosser et al. 2018</xref>). In certain disorders (e.g., McCune–Albright and PROS), mosaic variants are the primary mechanism of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC2">Aldred and Trembath 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC19">Keppler-Noreuil et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC17">Hucthagowder et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>We evaluated two years of clinical ES data from our laboratory within a pediatric tertiary care center to determine the characteristics of disease-associated variants within our cohort, as well as to compare the diagnostic yield reported by the laboratory versus the ordering clinical provider's interpretation of laboratory reported variant causality. We sought to evaluate the concordance of the molecular ES diagnostic rate generated by the laboratory with clinical provider-confirmed diagnoses recorded in the electronic medical record (EMR) to test if the laboratory workflow, including selection of genes relevant to the proband phenotype and subsequent variant assessment, resulted in meaningful results being reported back to the ordering provider. We further summarized the characteristics of these provider-confirmed causal variants and evaluated the contribution of mosaic variants to genetic disease within the context of these diagnoses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient Cohort</title><p>In a consecutive 24-month period, proband (<italic>n</italic> = 357) and parental (when available, <italic>n</italic> = 601) peripheral blood samples were submitted for ES to The Steve and Cindy Rasmussen Institute for Genomic Medicine at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio.

In addition, causal variants in two probands were found in a mosaic state in two unaffected parents (0.3% of available parental samples). All mosaic variants were verified by Sanger sequencing analysis as evidenced by disparate peak height in the electropherogram (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molecularcasestudies.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/mcs.a005231/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 2</ext-link>). In total, mosaic etiology in a proband, or that originating in a parent with transmission to a proband, was associated with seven out of 117 (6.0%) provider-substantiated genetic diagnoses. These mosaic variants were recurrently associated with several types of disorders, predominately involving neurodevelopmental features, including early infantile epileptic encephalopathies, intellectual disability syndromes, Coffin–Siris syndrome, and megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCS005231MILTB3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We evaluated the concordance of the molecular ES diagnostic rate generated by the clinical laboratory with ordering clinical provider-substantiated diagnoses. Our results demonstrate the robust clinical utility of ES, with 91.4% of the laboratory findings reported as likely causal for the proband phenotype resulting in a clinically confirmed diagnosis by the ordering provider. This concordance may increase over time, as four laboratory-reported diagnostic cases were still under consideration in the patient differential. The high concordance rate may be attributable to the detailed clinical feature information form submitted by an experienced clinical geneticist or genetic counselor at the time of ES ordering, additional curation of the medical record as performed by the variant analysis team or laboratory genetic counselor to enable a phenotype-informed variant analysis approach, and the multidisciplinary expertise achieved by group evaluation of annotated, filtered variants in a case conference setting. Within our primarily pediatric population, we obtained a 32.2% diagnostic yield, with 64.9% of causal variants identified by trio analysis confirmed as de novo. These numbers are in line with previously reported exome and genome sequencing diagnostic yields (average = 31%) and de novo rates (average = 44%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC10">Clark et al. 2018</xref>). In comparison to other large clinical exome sequencing cohorts, our study found a similar rate of cases submitted for trio analysis. In addition, the distribution of AD, AR, and XL inheritance patterns of causal variants were also comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC53">Yang et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC54">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC25">Lee et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC14">Farwell et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC40">Retterer et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>Of the 115 diagnostic cases, we confirmed mosaicism of a disease-associated variant in five probands and two parental samples. The contribution of parental mosaicism may be higher, given that trio analyses were available for 74.8% of our cases. The frequency of mosaicism in our cohort is higher than what has previously been reported in unselected clinical exome sequencing cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC53">Yang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC40">Retterer et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC9">Cao et al. 2019</xref>). Several differences between our study and previous reports may contribute to this difference, including sequencing in a hospital-based laboratory representing a pediatric patient population referred by clinical geneticists within a single institution, stringent quality control metrics for sequencing data (including both assay and variant quality measures), diagnostic yield based on EMR clinical substantiation versus solely a laboratory-defined molecular diagnostic yield, and manual evaluation of all assessed variants with specific review of aligned reads and variant characteristics in proband and parental samples.</p><p>Our positive mosaic findings contributed to several types of disorders associated with neurodevelopmental features including Coffin–Siris syndrome (<italic>n</italic> = 2), early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (<italic>n</italic> = 2), intellectual disability syndromes (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and the brain overgrowth syndrome MPPH (<italic>n</italic> = 1). The presence of mosaicism in these patients is consistent with the reported association of mosaic variants within these types of disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC24">Krupp et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC26">Lim et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC29">Madsen et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC50">Stosser et al. 2018</xref>). The enrichment of our pediatric ES population for various neurodevelopmental features, such as developmental delays, cognitive impairment, and autistic behavior, also may have contributed to the high prevalence of mosaicism seen within this cohort.</p><p>Identifying that a disease-causing variant is mosaic can have several implications when counseling families. Although the presence of mosaicism is generally unable to predict disease severity, as often only a single tissue type is available for study, it can be informative in providing a clinical explanation for a proband with a mild presentation. In this cohort, detection of mosaicism provided a mechanism to explain a mildly affected male diagnosed with the X-linked disorder, early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 2, primarily seen in females (Case 2). Identifying mosaicism in proband or parental samples is of particular importance to inform recurrence risk in future pregnancies. Evaluating parental samples for the presence of mosaicism can also be beneficial for providing an explanation for why a parent positive for pathogenic variant may be mildly symptomatic or unaffected, as evidenced in this series by the unaffected mother with an <italic>IQSEC2</italic> mosaic variant, which was hemizygous in the affected proband, as well as his affected brother (Case 4, previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC4">Barrie et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p>Mosaic variants can be challenging to detect clinically because of several factors, and consensus guidelines addressing how to detect, assess, and report mosaicism are not currently available. These variants can occur at very low frequencies and thus may be below the threshold of detection if coverage or read depth is insufficient at the affected residue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC1">Acuna-Hidalgo et al. (2015)</xref> modeled that the probability of detecting mosaicism at 100× coverage is &gt;90% for variants occurring at 10% VAF or higher. However, the ability to detect these variants decreases considerably with decreasing read depth. The higher sequence depth in coding regions typically achieved by exome sequencing thus offers an advantage for detecting mosaicism compared to genome sequencing, because of cost-related limitations to genome sequencing read depth. Despite sufficient coverage across a given region, if the variant is present in a limited number of reads, it may be below the sensitivity of the variant caller software. In our cohort, one of the mosaic variants in a parental sample (Case 6), the <italic>ARID2</italic> variant at 4% VAF, was not detected by the variant caller and came to attention during manual review of reportable variants within aligned sequencing reads. This highlights the utility in manual review of variant calls within the aligned reads to evaluate variant authenticity.</p><p>Alternatively, identifying an authentic mosaic variant can also present a challenge. With MPS, false-positive variants may occur by several means. These include biologic contamination during sample acquisition, nucleic acid extraction, or library preparation, low-level admixture during sequencing, or as a result of sample carryover from prior sequencing runs, as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or sequencing artifacts (incorporation errors and library chimeras). Additionally, index hopping can result in false positive calls at very low-level as single-indexed reads can incur misassignment of indices within multiplexed libraries, a phenomenon known to be enhanced on patterned flow cells in short-read sequencing chemistries. The confounding variable of index hopping in the setting of trio analyses can be decreased by the use of dual indexing of libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC11">Costello et al. 2018</xref>). To increase confidence in calling mosaicism and rare, low-frequency variants, the addition of dual-indexed libraries containing unique identifiers known as molecular barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC21">Kinde et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC45">Schmitt et al. 2012</xref>) allows discrimination of improperly indexed libraries and random errors. In this study, all de novo and mosaic variants called with single-indexed libraries were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Evidence of the low-level variant allele could be visualized for all mosaic variants by review of peak heights in the electropherogram. A priori knowledge of suspected mosaicism facilitated review of Sanger sequencing data and enabled scrutiny of allelic peak heights, including the variant allele relative to background. Thus, data points from two orthogonal methodologies (MPS and Sanger) were considered prior to report out of a mosaic call. The variant with a VAF of 4% in a maternal sample (Case 6) was visualized by Sanger sequencing, despite being below the threshold typically appreciable by this method (∼10%–20%), because of the nature of the variant (2-nt deletion), as well as prior observation of the heterozygous variant in the proband. However, if the VAF is too low to be appreciable by Sanger, high-depth amplicon sequencing or other quantitative approaches including digital droplet PCR could be used. The testing of alternative tissue sources can also be considered to aid in confirming suspected mosaicism in patients, although multiple tissue sources may be required, and may be impractical or impossible to obtain. Authentic mosaic variants with high VAFs can also be challenging to detect, as they may be mistaken for heterozygous calls that deviate from the expected 50% VAF because of technical variation and platform bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC1">Acuna-Hidalgo et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>Outside of technical limitations of the assay, mosaic variants can go undetected when the variant is confined to specific tissue types. In these cases, sequencing of the affected tissues is required for detection. Confinement of mosaicism in a parent to predominately or exclusively germline cells would also go undetected by clinical ES trio analysis and typically only comes to light in instances of multiple affected children from an otherwise unaffected parent.</p><p>In conclusion, our study highlights two years of an ongoing ES assay within a pediatric tertiary care institution and emphasizes the utility of clinical-provider engagement in ES test ordering and phenotypic curation, as demonstrated by the strong concordance of laboratory-reported and ordering provider-substantiated diagnostic yield. Additionally, we demonstrate that mosaicism is an important contributor to disease-causing variation identified by ES within the pediatric population. Given that our diagnostic yield of mosaic variants exceeds those reported by other ES studies, vigilant manual review of variant calls by a highly skilled variant analysis team and clinical laboratory directors may be a key differentiator in detecting somatic mosaic events. This must occur in concert with adequate read depth and breadth of the assay, appropriate bioinformatic processing parameters, and in consideration of the proband's clinical characteristics to attribute causality. As we begin to appreciate the expanding role of mosaicism in genetic disease, further research on the types of disorders with mosaicism, clinical implications, and optimal laboratory practices for identifying and reporting mosaicism are needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Sequencing, Bioinformatics, and Quality Control</title><p>Proband and parental peripheral blood samples were submitted for ES to The Steve and Cindy Rasmussen Institute for Genomic Medicine at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. Prior to ES studies, microarray analysis was previously performed on the submitted proband, unless deemed to not be clinically indicated by the ordering provider (5% of the cohort). Genomic DNA was extracted using the Puregene DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer protocol (QIAGEN) or EZ1 DNA isolation kit (QIAGEN), with two separate DNA extractions performed per each submitted proband and parental sample to facilitate identity and provenance analyses. Genotyping of 30 autosomal loci representing single-nucleotide variants with high population minor allele frequency was performed in the parental and proband samples using a custom Agena MassArray panel (Agena). Subsequently, a comparison of the Agena-derived genotype data was performed relative to aligned sequencing read data derived by MPS to further ensure sample provenance throughout the extraction, library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis stages, as well as to verify familial relationships.</p><p>Libraries were subject to target capture using SureSelect Human All Exon V6 (Agilent) followed by paired-end 101- or 151-bp sequencing to 137× mean depth on a HiSeq 2500 or HiSeq 4000 (Illumina), with 96.5% of targeted bases at 20× or greater (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molecularcasestudies.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/mcs.a005231/-/DC1">Supplemental Table 2</ext-link>). Sequencing data were demultiplexed and analyzed by GenomeNext (Columbus, OH) v1.1, which performs alignment to the reference sequence (GRCh37/hg19 Feb 2009), deduplication, and single sample variant calling with GATK Unified Genotyper 1.6–13 via the Churchill secondary analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC18">Kelly et al. 2015</xref>). Mitogen (Sunquest) was used for annotation and tertiary analysis filtering informed by clinician-provided phenotypes, which were converted into HPO terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC22">Kohler et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p>As standard of practice in our exome workflow, aligned sequencing reads in the BAM file were reviewed at all assessed variants using the Integrative Genomics Viewer v2.3-2.4.4 (Broad) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC43">Robinson et al. 2011</xref>). This allowed for a review of variant authenticity and encompassed an examination of read counts and strandedness, location of the variant within the read, VAF, homology, read quality, and mapping. Manual review of read-aligned proband data was performed relative to review of identity-confirmed parental sequence to allow for side-by-side comparison, with IGV alignment preferences set to allow for display of coverage allele-fraction threshold at 2% and retention of soft-clipped reads. Genomic regions with known homology as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC30">Mandelker et al. (2016)</xref> have been incorporated into ES analysis through BED file track definitions to visually flag the level of homology of the local region in IGV. Parentage was confirmed in our data set for all de novo calls, with familial relationships established by genotyping per our standard workflow. Hemizygous variants were X-linked variants identified in &gt;95% of reads in male patients. Homozygous calls applied to autosomal variants in &gt;95% of reads. Variants deviating to the extreme of VAF &lt;20 or &gt;80 were considered suspicious for mosaicism, and subsequently underwent orthogonal testing by Sanger sequencing.</p><p>Sanger sequencing was performed on proband and available parental samples for all de novo variants and suspected mosaic variants identified as likely causal for the proband phenotype. Analysis by Sanger was used to distinguish from MPS or PCR artifact, and verify reduction in allelic ratio as visualized by disparate peak heights for mosaicism. For Sanger sequencing, PCR amplification of the region of interest was followed by purification using the QIAquick purification kit (QIAGEN). Forward and reverse sequencing reactions were performed with the Big Dye v3.1 terminator mix (ThermoFisher). Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 3130 or 3730 instrument (ThermoFisher). Mosaic variants were confirmed by observation of a nonreference allele with a disparate peak height during Sanger analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Variant Interpretation</title><p>Custom scripting allowed for enrichment of variant attribute data including disease association and phenotype overlap. For each proband, the annotated filtered variant list was evaluated at a case conference attended by laboratory directors, genetic counselors, variant scientists, residents, fellows, and geneticists, including the ordering provider, when available. Variants that met group consensus were assessed according to ACMG/AMP recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS005231MILC41">Richards et al. 2015</xref>). Following assessment, variants are reported as either likely causal for proband phenotype or as findings of undetermined clinical relevance to the proband phenotype based upon strength of phenotype overlap with the associated disease at the discretion of the ABMGG board-certified signing director. Laboratory diagnostic yield was defined as the number of cases with a variant or variants reported as likely causal for the proband phenotype. Concordance between the laboratory and the ordering provider as to reported variant-associated disease causality was examined via clinical documentation in the EMR. Variants were considered clinically confirmed as causal if the ordering provider attributed some or all features in the proband to the variant(s).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</title><sec id="s5a" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Deposition and Access</title><p>The mosaic variants were submitted to ClinVar (<uri xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/</uri>) under accession numbers SCV001161761.1, SCV001161762.1, SCV001161763.1, SCV000864353.2, SCV001161764.1, SCV001161765.1, and SCV001161766.1.
