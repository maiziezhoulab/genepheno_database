<abstract>
<p>Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy 21, is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and is associated with a greatly increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The Ts65Dn mouse model of DS exhibits several key features of the disease including developmental delay and AD-like cognitive impairment. Accumulating evidence suggests that impairments in early brain development caused by trisomy 21 contribute significantly to memory deficits in adult life in DS. Prenatal genetic testing to diagnose DS <italic>in utero</italic>, provides the novel opportunity to initiate early pharmacological treatment to target this critical period of brain development. Here, we report that prenatal to early postnatal treatment with a ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) small-molecule peptide mimetic, Peptide 021 (P021), rescued developmental delay in pups and AD-like hippocampus-dependent memory impairments in adult life in Ts65Dn mice. Furthermore, this treatment prevented pre-synaptic protein deficit, decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3β) activity, and increased levels of synaptic plasticity markers including brain derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF) and phosphorylated CREB, both in young (3-week-old) and adult (~ 7-month-old) Ts65Dn mice. These findings provide novel evidence that providing neurotrophic support during early brain development can prevent developmental delay and AD-like memory impairments in a DS mouse model.</p>

<body>
<p>Down syndrome (DS), caused by triplication of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21, trisomy 21), is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and is associated with a greatly increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. By the age 40, almost all DS individuals develop the histopathological characteristics of AD including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and ~70% of individuals with DS develop dementia by age 60<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Currently, there are ~250,000–400,000 individuals with DS in the United States and approximately five million worldwide, and as yet, there is no effective pharmacological treatment that can either rescue the neurodevelopmental and intellectual deficits or reduce the risk of AD in adult life in DS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p>
<p>During the last few decades, several mouse models of DS with segmental trisomy for orthologues of Hsa21 genes have been developed to facilitate our understanding of the link between enhanced gene dosage and DS phenotype such as developmental delay and altered synaptic plasticity and cognition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The Ts65Dn mouse, the most widely used mouse model of DS, is trisomic for the distal portion of mouse chromosome 16 (MMU16) which contains more than 140 genes orthologous to those on Hsa21<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In the newborn period, Ts65Dn mice mimic the human condition presenting developmental delay in motor and sensory milestones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Like human DS individuals, these mice demonstrate impaired ontogenic neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, possibly a major factor responsible for aberrant brain development and cognitive dysfunction. The adult Ts65Dn mice show deficient adult hippocampal neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, suppressed synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and impairment in spatial and declarative memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p>
<p>Most of the pharmacological approaches used in DS mouse models and human DS patients to ameliorate cognitive and other neurological deficits have targeted the adult or adolescent life stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Prenatal genetic testing, including amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling (CVS) to diagnose DS in early <italic>in utero</italic> period, provides the novel opportunity to initiate pharmacological treatment which can positively affect early brain development and significantly improve the postnatal cognitive outcome in DS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. During the past few years, a growing number of studies have explored the exciting possibility of using pharmacological approaches to ameliorate neurodevelopmental deficits in DS mouse models during the critical time window of brain development, and shown significant improvement in learning and memory in adult life (for review, refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>).</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to note that even though studies carried out in adult DS mice have shown that it is possible to improve hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, the duration of this beneficial effect in most cases remains controversial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. After the critical window of brain development including neurogenesis and synaptogenesis which takes place during prenatal and early postnatal period, the brain can undergo limited plastic changes, and the late therapies are unlikely to exert profound and long lasting effects in DS brains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Thus, early therapies could hold the key to rescue Alzheimer’s like cognitive impairment in DS individuals.</p>
<p>During early brain development, neurotrophic factors provide the appropriate brain milieu necessary for all aspects of neural development, including neuronal proliferation, differentiation, growth, and migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. The trisomy 21 in DS, which leads to overexpression of nearly 300 genes, may alter the trophic support provided by neurotrophic factors during early brain development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. For instance, increased amyloid β precursor protein (APP) gene dosage has been linked to failed nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling and cholinergic neurodegeneration in Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Similarly, increased superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene dosage is known to cause increased oxidative stress in DS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>; increased oxidative stress has previously been shown to block ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) activity in neurons, which is essential for neuronal survival and maintenance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. The expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays essential role in neurodevelopment, has been shown to be decreased in the hippocampus of postnatal day 15 (PND15) Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. An inverse correlation between dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) overexpression because of trisomy 21 and reduced BDNF expression has been suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Counteracting the trisomy 21 induced alteration in neurotrophic support which is essential for early brain development is a novel therapeutic modality for DS. Adjusting the brain milieu by modulating neurotrophic support at the critical period of fetal brain development may ameliorate neurodevelopmental abnormalities and cognitive impairment associated with DS.</p>
<p>Neurotrophic factors, by virtue of their neurogenic and neurotrophic activities, have potential for treatment of cognitive impairment in DS and AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. However, the therapeutic usage of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and CNTF is hindered by limited blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, poor plasma stability and unfavorable pharmacokinetics, and systemic adverse effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. Neurotrophic factor small-molecule mimetics, which can exert the therapeutic beneficial effects of neurotrophic factors on neurogenesis, neuronal and synaptic plasticity, and cognition, and have favorable pharmacokinetics and BBB permeability without unwanted systemic effects, offer a promising strategy to overcome the limitations associated with therapeutic usage of whole-molecule recombinant neurotrophic factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>.</p>
<p>Previously, by employing neutralizing antibodies and epitope mapping, our laboratory devised a CNTF small-molecule peptide mimetic, Peptide 021 (P021; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) which was found to ameliorate learning and memory deficits in animal models of aging and AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. The compound P021 exerts a neurogenic and neurotrophic effect by inhibiting leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling pathway and enhancing brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression by increasing its transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>. P021 was shown to ameliorate AD pathology via reduction in glycogen synthase kinase -3 beta (GSK3β) activity in a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD mouse)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. P021 is a small water-soluble compound that is BBB-permeable and has suitable pharmacokinetics for oral administration without any adverse effects observed with native CNTF or BDNF molecule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we treated Ts65Dn mice from embryonic day 8 (E8) to weaning/postnatal day 21 (PND21) with the compound P021 (200 nmoles/g diet administered to mothers/dams). We report that treating the Ts65Dn mice with a neurotrophic factor small-molecule peptide mimetic during prenatal and early postnatal period can ameliorate the developmental delay in early postnatal period and AD-like learning and memory impairments in adult life.</p>

<title>Study outline</title>
<p>We treated 2–3-month-old pregnant Ts65Dn (Dn) and wild-type (WT) mothers from day 8 (E8) of pregnancy till the weaning of the pups on PND21 with compound P021 (P) in the feed, or as control with vehicle (V) feed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The offsprings also had access to the P021 or vehicle diet as per mother’s group till PND21. The offsprings from Ts65Dn mothers were genotyped to identify Ts65Dn and WT pups. There were 6 study groups as follows: WT offsprings of WT mothers on vehicle diet (WT-V-WT), WT offsprings of WT mothers on P021 diet (WT-P-WT), WT offsprings of Ts65Dn mothers on vehicle diet (Dn-V-WT), WT offsprings of Ts65Dn mothers on P021 diet (Dn-P-WT), Ts65Dn offsprings of Ts65Dn mothers on vehicle diet (Dn-V-Dn), and Ts65Dn offsprings of Ts65Dn mothers on P021 diet (Dn-P-Dn). In the first phase of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), the newborn pups were evaluated for neurobehavioral development starting on PND1 and carried out until PND21 (or until the appearance of developmental milestone/reflex). After completion of behavioral testing, the 3-week-old mice were sacrificed and brain tissue was collected. The neurobehavioral development component of the study was performed on WT-V-WT (n = 11), WT-P-WT (n = 10), Dn-V-WT (n = 10), Dn-P-WT (n = 9), Dn-V-Dn (n = 11), and Dn-P-Dn (n = 12) mice. In the second phase of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), after prenatal to early postnatal treatment, the offsprings were allowed to grow till 5 months of age, and then general behavioral evaluation and cognitive testing were performed. After weaning, the offsprings received regular mouse chow. After completion of behavioral testing, ~7-month-old animals were sacrificed and brain tissue was collected for biochemical analyses. This longitudinal component of the study was carried out on WT-V-WT (n = 10), WT-P-WT (n = 12), Dn-V-WT (n = 12), Dn-P-WT (n = 11), Dn-V-Dn (n = 13), and Dn-P-Dn (n = 12) mice. Data was pooled together for male and female mice as no statistically significant gender differences were noted in separate analysis.

<title>Design and synthesis of P021</title>
<p>The peptidergic compound P021 (Ac-DGGL<sup>A</sup>G-NH<sub>2</sub>; molecular weight: 578.3) corresponds to a biologically active region of human CNTF molecule (amino acid residues 148–151) to which adamantylated glycine was added to make it more stable and lipophilic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>. The peptide was synthesized and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to &gt;96% purity, as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>.

<title>Stability in plasma and gastric and intestinal juices, blood-brain barrier permeability, and placental/lactational accessibility of P021</title>
<p>The studies regarding the plasma stability and stability in gastric and intestinal juices of P021 were done at EVER NeuroPharma GmbH, Unterach, Austria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. Briefly, the compound P021 was found stable both in artificial gastric juice (&gt;90%) and in artificial intestinal juice (&gt;95%) as analyzed up to 30 min and 2 hours, respectively. P021 was found to be BBB-permeable based on studies in adult C57Bl/6 mice carried out through a commercial service (APREDICA, Watertown, MA, USA) and described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. In a previous study, we found that P021 acted via dose-dependent competitive inhibition of LIF activity towards LIF/CNTF receptor at as low as 0.1 nM (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 at 10 nM P021) concentration as measured by phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) at Tyr705<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. Also, previously we showed that oral administration of P021 in the diet decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3 at pTyr705 in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice and the age-matched wild type controls after 6 months of treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. These data provided further evidence that the compound P021 is BBB permeable and is orally bioavailable. In the present study, we found that prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 also resulted in a significant reduction in phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 in the hippocampus of 3-week-old WT and Ts65Dn mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). These data suggest that P021 was delivered across placental barrier during pregnancy and via breast milk during lactation, and then via BBB to reach significant concentrations in off springs’ brains to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation. It is also worth mentioning that young mice may have consumed some P021 diet directly as young mice start consuming solid food by ~PND16.</p>

<title>Genotyping of animals</title>
<p>The Ts65Dn mice and their diploid littermates (2N) were genotyped using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>. The tail or toe clippings were obtained from 10-day-old mouse pups and were stored at −20 °C till further processing. The genomic DNA was extracted from clippings using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit per manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The RT-qPCR was done using Brilliant SYBR Green Master Mix (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in a Stratagene Mc3000p PCR detection system under the following conditions: 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing 55 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The fold change in APP gene (3 copies in Ts65Dn mice) was evaluated. The apolipoprotein b (apob) gene (2 copies in Ts65Dn mice) was used as internal control. The primer sequences were the following: forward 5′-TGCTGAAGATGTGGGTTCGA-3′ and reverse 5′-GACAATCACGGTTGCTATGACAA-3′ for APP; forward 5′-CACGTGGGCTCCAGCATT-3′ and reverse 5′-TCACCAGTCATTTCTGCCTTTG-3′ for apob.

<p>Evaluation of neurobehavioral development in rodents represents an essential study paradigm to model neurodevelopmental disorders such as Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) which are characterized by mental retardation and delays in growth and development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">80</xref>. In rodents like mice and rats, the early postnatal period is associated with a burst of brain growth, synaptogenesis, myelination, and development of motor and sensory modalities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>. Therefore, examination of neurobehavioral development in rodents allows to trace the nervous system ontogeny via evaluation of neurological reflexes, developmental milestones, and early motor behavior including muscle power and coordination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, evaluation of neurobehavioral development was performed following the procedure described previously by others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">81</xref>, and further validated by us ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">80</xref>. Examination was started on PND1 and was carried out until PND21 (or until the appearance of developmental milestone/neurological reflex) daily between 12:00–15:00 hours in a set up made specifically for the purpose in the Behavior Lab of the Department of Neurochemistry at NYSIBR. The following neurological reflexes and developmental milestones were examined by the same evaluators blinded to both the genotype and the treatment group.</p>

<title>Surface righting</title>
<p>The mouse pup was put on its back with the experimenter’s fingers holding the head and the hind body. The time taken in seconds to turn over with all four paws placed on the surface of the table after release was measured. Surface righting was evaluated daily until the pup could right itself in &lt;5 s for two consecutive days. The data for the day of first appearance of surface righting were analyzed. The surface righting reflex measures labyrinthine and body righting mechanisms, and motor strength and coordination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="4">
<title>Negative geotaxis</title>
<p>The mouse pup was placed head down on a square of screen inclined at an angle of 45°. The time taken by the pup to turn around 180° to the head up position was evaluated. The test was halted if the pup did not turn around within 30 s. If the mouse pup lost grip and slipped, it was again placed at the start point once. The negative geotaxis test was repeated daily until the mouse pup could perform appropriately in less than 30 s for two consecutive days. The data for the first day of appearance of negative geotaxis were analyzed. Like surface righting, the negative geotaxis reflex also measures labyrinthine and body righting mechanisms, and motor strength and coordination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>.</p>

<sec disp-level="4">
<title>Cliff aversion</title>
<p>The mouse pup was placed on cliff edge (eppendorf box) with the snout and fore limbs over the edge, and the time taken (in seconds) to turn and move away was recorded. The test was repeated every day until the mouse pup could perform appropriately in less than 30 s for two consecutive days. The first day of appearance of cliff aversion data were analyzed. The cliff aversion test measures labyrinthine function, motor strength and coordination, and feel sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>.</p>

<title>Rooting reflex</title>
<p>A cotton swab was rubbed from front to back along the side of the head and snout, and the head turning response towards this tactile stimulus was observed. The rooting reflex was evaluated daily till the pup responded correctly for 2 consecutive days. Rooting is a measure of tactile sensory reflex and motor coordination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>.</p>

<title>Forelimb grasp</title>
<p>The mouse pup was held with its forepaws grasping a string fixed from one end to the other end of the cage nearly 12 cm above the bedding. The pup was released, and the time the pup spent holding onto the string with forepaws was recorded. The test was considered positive when the pup held onto the string for &gt;2 s. It was repeated daily until performed correctly for 2 consecutive days. Forelimb grasp testing provides a measure of motor strength<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>.</p>

<sec disp-level="4">
<title>Air righting</title>
<p>The mouse pup was held upside for few seconds approximately 12 cm above the soft bedding of a cage and was then released. The test was marked positive on the day when the pup landed with all its fore and hind paws placed on the surface of the bedding. It was repeated every day until positive for 2 consecutive days. Similar to surface righting, air righting measures labyrinthine and body righting mechanisms, and motor coordination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>.</p>

<title>Ear twitch reflex</title>
<p>The pulled-out end of a cotton swab was applied against the ear tip, and the presence or absence of flattening of the ear against the side of the head was observed.

<title>Auditory startle</title>
<p>To evaluate auditory startle, the experimenter clapped within 10 cm of the mouse pup, and the first day of the startle response was recorded.

<title>Elevated plus maze</title>
<p>Elevated plus maze testing was used to evaluate the anxiety-like behavior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82">82</xref> in adult mice. The maze comprised of four arms (30 × 5 cm) connected by a common 5 × 5 cm center area. There were two opposite facing open arms (OA), and two facing closed arms (CA) which were enclosed by 20 cm-high walls. The entire plus-maze was elevated on a wooden pedestal to a height of 82 cm above the floor level in a room separated from the experimenter. Ambient luminosity was kept at 60 lux to control the anxiogenic feature of light for mice. Each mouse was placed onto the central area facing an open arm and allowed to explore the maze for a single 8 min session. After each session, any feces were removed from the maze, and the floor of the maze was wiped with 70% alcohol to remove any urine or scent cues. The number of entries into OA and CA, and the amount of time spent in OA and CA were recorded by a video tracking system (ANY-Maze software, version 4.5, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA). As OA are more anxiogenic for rodents than CA, the percentage of time spent in OA [OA/(OA + CA) × 100] was calculated to evaluate anxiety-like behavior of mice.</p>

<title>Open field</title>
<p>We evaluated the exploratory activity in adult mice by allowing them to freely explore the open field arena in a single 15-min-session. The testing apparatus was a classic open field i.e., a PVC square arena with dimensions of 50 × 50 cm and 40 cm high walls, as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>. The open field was placed in a room separated from the experimenter, and was surmounted by a video camera connected to a computer tracking mice. Ambient luminosity in the open field was maintained at 60 lux that is believed to be non-anxiogenic for rodents. Data were recorded using a video tracking system (ANY-Maze software, version 4.5, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA). The parameters analyzed included ambulatory distance and time during the single 15-min-session.</p>

<title>One-trial object recognition/discrimination task</title>
<p>We evaluated the long-term memory performance of the adult mice in a one-trial object recognition/discrimination task in an open field arena. The test is based on the innate tendency of rodents to differentially explore novel objects over familiar ones, as described before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83">83</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">84</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">85</xref>. The task protocol consisted of three different phases: a habituation phase (four sessions of 10 min each on four consecutive days), a sample phase (fifth day), and a test phase (sixth day). During the first four days, the study mice were individually subjected each day to a habituation session of 10 min during which they were introduced in the empty open field arena to familiarize them with the arena. On the fifth day, each mouse was first subjected to the sample phase where two identical cylindrical plastic objects were placed in a symmetric position from the center of the arena, and the mouse was allowed to freely explore the objects for 10 min. The exploration of the objects was defined as any investigative behavior such as head orientation or sniffing, or contact that occurred with an object in a distance &lt;2 cm. On the sixth day (retention period, 24 h), each mouse was introduced into the arena to do the test phase. During the test phase, the mouse was exposed to two objects for another 10 min: a familiar object (previously presented during the sample phase; a cylindrical plastic object) and a new object (a triangular plastic object), placed at the same location as that of the other object during the sample phase. The data was collected using a video tracking system (ANY-Maze software, version 4.5, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA). Object discrimination (measure of novelty preference) was evaluated by applying the following index to the test phase data:</p>

<title>Spatial reference memory task in the Morris water maze</title>
<p>Spatial reference learning and memory were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) task adapted from that originally described by Morris and collaborators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86">86</xref>, and validated in AD mice by us previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87">87</xref>. Mice were trained for 4 trials (90 s each) per day and for a total of 4 consecutive days in a circular water tank (diameter, 180 cm) filled with water (at room temperature, 21 + 2°C) rendered opaque with small amount of non-toxic white paint. Four positions around the edge of the tank were designated for alternative start positions for successive trials. The tank was surrounded by extra-maze cues in the visual discrimination range detectable by mice. During the training trials, a circular platform (diameter, 14 cm) was submerged 1 cm below water surface in the target quadrant (TQ). If a mouse was unable to locate the platform within 90 s of a training trial, it was gently guided to it. At the end of each trial, the mouse was left on the platform for 20 s, then dried, and returned to its home cage until the next trial. With 4 trials/day for 4 consecutive days, each mouse performed a total of 16 training trials. Probe trial for memory was given 24 h after the last day of training. For the probe trial, the circular tank was divided into 4 imaginary quadrants (TQ; AR, adjacent right; AL, adjacent left; OQ, opposite quadrant). During the probe trial, mice were allowed to swim in the pool without escape platform for 60 s. The latency to reach the platform during training trials and the time spent in the 4 quadrants during probe trial was recorded using an automated video tracking system with SMART (Panlab, San Diego Instruments) v 2.0.14 software.</p>

<title>Prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 rescues delay in neurobehavioral development in Ts65Dn pups</title>
<p>Developmental delay is nearly universal in DS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b89">89</xref>, and is also documented in Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. We assessed the effect of prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 on neurobehavioral development in Ts65Dn mice from PND1-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, we found a significant group effect in body weight analysis [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>; two-way ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub>(5,560)</sub> = 3.62, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0031] and a significant time effect [<italic>F</italic><sub>(6,560)</sub> = 152.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001], however group × time interaction was not significant [<italic>F</italic><sub>(30,560)</sub> = 0.36, <italic>p</italic> = 0.995]. On PND21, the body weight of vehicle-treated Ts65Dn mice was significantly lower than vehicle-treated WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>; WT-V-WT vs. Dn-V-Dn, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This agrees with previous studies which demonstrated lower body weight in Ts65Dn pups as compared to WT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b90">90</xref>. At early stages of development, P021 treatment induced weight gain in Ts65Dn mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>; PND3 and PND6, Dn-V-Dn vs. Dn-P-Dn, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). During the early developmental stages, mouse pups received P021 exclusively from mother’s milk, whereas at later stages pups also received P021 through directly consuming the chow. The weight gain during early developmental stages raises the possibility that P021 can be enriched in mother’s milk and/or exerts its maximal effect through breast feeding.</p>
<p>The Ts65Dn mice exhibited a delay in the achievement of certain developmental milestones. The differences were statistically significant for surface righting, negative geotaxis, cliff aversion, forelimb grasp, air righting, and ear twitch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>; WT-V-WT vs. Dn-V-Dn; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 for surface righting and ear twitch, and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for negative geotaxis, cliff aversion, forelimb grasp, and air righting).

<p>BDNF is an important biological marker of synaptic plasticity.

Previously, we showed that P021 exerts its beneficial effects on cognition via increasing BDNF expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. Here, we found a significantly reduced expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of 3-week-old Ts65Dn mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,e</xref>; Dn-V-WT vs. Dn-V-Dn, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

As BDNF acts through TrkB receptor, we evaluated the expression levels of TrkB in the hippocampus. We did not find a significant difference in TrkB expression between 3-week-old WT and Ts65Dn mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,f</xref>; WT-V-WT vs. Dn-V-Dn, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; Dn-V-WT vs. Dn-V-Dn, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), and P021 treatment did not affect TrkB expression in Ts65Dn mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,f</xref>; Dn-V-Dn vs. Dn-P-Dn, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).

<p>Previously, we showed that P021 reduces AD pathology via increased BDNF expression-mediated reduction in GSK3β activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. GSK3β is one of the downstream effectors of BDNF/TrkB/PI3-kinase/AKT signal transduction pathway and can be inhibited by AKT-mediated phosphorylation on Ser9 (pGSK3β)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b105">105</xref>. APP-dependent alteration of GSK3β activity was shown to impair neurogenesis in Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b106">106</xref>. Drugs that increase GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9, such as lithium and fluoxetine, have been shown to improve neurogenesis and cognition in Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b106">106</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b107">107</xref>.

<p>Protein kinase A (PKA) is a major CREB kinase which activates it by phosphorylation at Ser133<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b112">112</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b113">113</xref>. The holoenzyme of PKA is made up of a regulatory subunit dimer, and each regulatory subunit (R) is bound to a catalytic subunit (C). Under low levels of cAMP, the holoenzyme remains intact and is catalytically inactive. When the intracellular concentration of cAMP increases, cAMP binds to the two binding sites on each regulatory subunit, which results in the release of the catalytic subunits. Free catalytic subunits catalyze the phosphorylation of substrate proteins including CREB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b114">114</xref>. As we found a significantly reduced phosphorylation of CREB in 3-week-old Ts65Dn mice, we further quantified the PKA catalytic subunit α (PKAcα) levels in these mice.

<title>Prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 ameliorates long-term memory deficit in adult life in Ts65Dn mice</title>
<p>We evaluated long-term declarative memory using one-trial object recognition/discrimination task, with a retention period of 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The medial temporal lobe structures including the hippocampus and perirhinal, entorhinal, parahippocampal cortices govern the appropriate encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of information related to discrete events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b115">115</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b116">116</xref>. This process ultimately leads to recognition memory, which consists of two components: (1) familiarity, a global awareness of the features of a stimulus, and (2) recollection, knowledge of the stimulus in the context of other information, such as what, where, or under which context the stimulus was encountered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b115">115</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b116">116</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b117">117</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b118">118</xref>. The episodic or recollection component of the recognition memory is thus dependent on the integrated conceptualization of “what”, “where”, and “which” parameters of a situation. In the one-trial object recognition/discrimination task for long-term memory, animals explore two different objects which they have to identify as either novel or familiar based on the memory of an earlier experience with one of the two objects which they were exposed to in the same open-field arena<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>. The animals are expected to explore the familiar object for a shorter time than the novel object because the representation of the former is still available in memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>.</p>
<p>Impairment in visual object long-term memory in DS individuals is well documented (for review, ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b119">119</xref>). Long-term memory deficit using novel object recognition task has also been demonstrated in Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. We thus assessed the effect of prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 on object recognition long-term memory in adult (5-7-month-old) Ts65Dn mice. All groups of mice, on average, spent equal time exploring the objects during the sample phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>; ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> = 0.7567). Test phase was performed 24 h after the sample acquisition phase, and showed a severe impairment in vehicle-treated Ts65Dn mice. Indeed, the discrimination index for the Dn-V-Dn group was 25.7 ± 3.5% compared to 56.8 ± 2.3% of the WT-V-WT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).

These data indicated a severe deficit of long-term memory in Ts65Dn mice. Prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 significantly improved the performance of Ts65Dn mice.

Nonetheless, the Dn-P-Dn group was still significantly impaired compared to WT-V-WT and Dn-V-WT control groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Thus, the rescue of long-term memory with prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 was only partial.

In the present study, P021 administered orally at nanomolar level during embryonic and early postnatal period reached significant amounts in offsprings’ brains to exert beneficial effect on neurobehavioral development and cognition, probably via increased BDNF and pCREB expression, reduction in GSK3β activity, and by rescue of the synaptic deficit. Unlike recombinant CNTF, which has been shown to cause anorexia, skeletal muscle loss, hyperalgesia, severe cramps, and muscle pain in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>, in the present study, we did not find any alterations in body weight and general physical state in P021-treated mice.</p>
<p>In the newborn period, DS infants exhibit delay in achievement of developmental motor and sensory milestones, as well as in olfactory, auditory, and visual sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b94">94</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b138">138</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b139">139</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b140">140</xref>. Our data are congruent with previous studies that have demonstrated delay in the acquisition of developmental milestones during the early postnatal period in Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b141">141</xref>. Like DS infants, the Ts65Dn mice ultimately achieve developmental milestones but with significant delay as compared to their WT littermates. The progression of infant motor and sensory development has previously been linked to cognition and motor skills in adulthood in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b142">142</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b143">143</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b144">144</xref>. A recent study reported a relationship between early motor skills and executive function in DS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b145">145</xref>. Similarly, in Ts65Dn mice, a positive correlation was recently reported between acquisition of developmental milestones during early postnatal period and cognitive performance in adult life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b141">141</xref>. The present study showed that prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 rescues the delay in some of the motor and sensory developmental milestones. These data suggest that providing neurotrophic support during fetal and early postnatal period can compensate for the developmental delay in Ts65Dn mice, and may result in improved cognitive performance in adult life. It was not possible for us to do a correlation analysis between acquisition of developmental milestones during the first 3 weeks of life and cognitive performance at adult stage as the data were collected from two separate batches of mice. Nonetheless, based on recent literature on Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b141">141</xref>, we speculate that at least one of the contributory factor in improved learning and memory performance in adult life in P021 treated Ts65Dn mice might be the amelioration of developmental delay during early postnatal period.</p>
<p>By the age 40, almost all DS individuals develop AD histopathological hallmarks, and by age 60, ~70% develop AD-like cognitive dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The DS individuals show deficits in spatial and hippocampus-dependent learning paradigms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b146">146</xref>. The Ts65Dn mice exhibit similar behavioral deficits in spatial and hippocampus dependent learning paradigms such as the Morris water maze and novel object recognition/discrimination tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In the spatial reference memory task, the hippocampus is crucial for processing information on relationships among distal environmental cues into a spatial map, and is also essential for memory storage, consolidation, and restitution of the spatial information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86">86</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b120">120</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b121">121</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b122">122</xref>. We found that in adult Ts65Dn mice, the learning and memory performance was severely impaired compared to WT controls. These data show that Ts65Dn mice were not able to encode, store, and/or recognize spatial representation of the environment and co-ordinates of the submerged platform. Prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 ameliorated these deficits. We found that P021 treatment during early stages of brain development improved not only the spatial learning but also the spatial memory as the performance of P021-treated Ts65Dn mice was comparable to that of WT controls in probe trial. These results suggest that the P021 treatment enhanced memory consolidation mechanisms in Ts65Dn mice.</p>
<p>Impairment of hippocampus-dependent long-term memory, a major hallmark of AD, is also found in DS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b147">147</xref>. We employed one-trial object recognition/discrimination task to assess hippocampus-dependent long-term declarative memory. Impairment in this task is well documented in Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The present study showed profound impairment of long-term memory in Ts65Dn mice. The Ts65Dn mice showed a lack of preference for the novel object most probably because of the failure of the encoding, storage, and retrieval of the memory related to familiar object representation. Prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 significantly ameliorated this long-term memory impairment in Ts65Dn mice.</p>
<p>Synaptic plasticity, the property of synapses to undergo long-term changes in synaptic strength, is thought to be the cellular substrate of learning and memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b148">148</xref>. It has been suggested that AD-like cognitive deficits in Ts65Dn mice are strongly associated with failure of hippocampal LTP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, aberrant expression of synaptic proteins in the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b149">149</xref>, and structural alterations in dendritic spines in the hippocampus and the cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b150">150</xref>. The developing DS brain also exhibits markedly aberrant synaptogenesis and dendritic hypotrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b93">93</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b151">151</xref>. In the present study, we found a significant deficit in the expression of the pre-synaptic protein, synaptophysin, in the hippocampus of both young and old Ts65Dn mice. Prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 rescued this deficit not only in young mice but also in adult mice. These data provide strong evidence that early neurotrophic treatment can exert long-lasting effect on pre-synaptic loss in Ts65Dn mice. As pre-synaptic vesicle proteins like synaptophysin are known to play an essential role in synaptic plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b152">152</xref>, the increase in synaptophysin expression in P021-treated Ts65Dn mice might have contributed to their better cognitive performance.</p>
<p>BDNF is one of the most potent modulators of synaptic plasticity, and plays a crucial role in both the early and late phases of LTP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b99">99</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b100">100</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b101">101</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b102">102</xref>. It is also essential for hippocampal neurogenesis, and for the survival and integration of new-born neurons into the hippocampal circuitry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b103">103</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b104">104</xref>. Reduced expression of BDNF has been reported in the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b153">153</xref> and the cerebral cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b154">154</xref> of DS fetuses. Young Ts65Dn mice also have reduced BDNF levels in the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Similarly, adult Ts65Dn mice were shown to have reduced BDNF expression in the frontal cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b155">155</xref>. In the present study, we found reduced BDNF expression and mRNA levels in the brains of both young and adult Ts65Dn mice. This deficit was ameliorated by prenatal to early postnatal P021 treatment. Previously, we showed that P021 exerts its neurogenic and neurotrophic effects in rodent model of AD by increasing BDNF transcription and its expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. The results of the present study further strengthen this hypothesis. As compared to the previous studies in AD models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>, in the present study, P021 was only administered during the early developmental stages in Ts65Dn mice. Remarkably, this treatment not only increased BDNF transcription and its expression in young mice but the effect persisted until adulthood. This data also support the recently proposed hypothesis that treatment during early brain development can have long-lasting effects in DS mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p>
<p>The transcription of BDNF gene is regulated by CREB phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b156">156</xref>. The phosphorylation of CREB is known to play a critical role in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b108">108</xref>. Furthermore, it triggers the transcription of c-fos and zif268 which both contribute to memory consolidation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b157">157</xref>. We observed significantly less pCREB and PKAcα (major CREB kinase catalytic subunit) expression in both young and adult Ts65Dn mice. This deficit was rescued by prenatal to early postnatal P021 treatment, hinting to another pathway by which this treatment might have ameliorated learning and memory deficits in Ts65Dn mice.</p>
<p>Another possible mechanism by which P021 could have exerted its beneficial effects in Ts65Dn mice is reduction in GSK3β activity. Previously, APP-dependent alteration of GSK3β activity was demonstrated to cause impairment in neurogenesis in Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b106">106</xref>; and GSK3β inhibitors improved neurogenesis and memory in Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b106">106</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b107">107</xref>. P021 was previously documented to be a GSK3β inhibitor via BDNF/TrkB/PI3-kinase/AKT pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. In the present study, we also found that prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 significantly reduced GSK3β activity by increasing its inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser9, both in young and adult Ts65Dn mice. This reduction in GSK3β activity may have contributed significantly to the beneficial effect of P021 on developmental delay in new-born period and AD-like memory deficit in adult life in Ts65Dn mice.</p>
<p>Elevated spontaneous locomotor activity has been documented both in young and old Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b127">127</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b128">128</xref>. Also in DS individuals, hyperkinetic and hyperactivity disorders are common<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b158">158</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b159">159</xref>. Aberrant motor behavior and disinhibition are also reported in AD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b160">160</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b161">161</xref>. We found enhanced spontaneous locomotor activity in adult Ts65Dn mice which was significantly ameliorated by prenatal to early postnatal P021 treatment. These data suggest that early treatment can not only rescue cognitive impairment but also benefit other behavioral disturbances in a DS mouse model.</p>
<p>In summary, we found that prenatal to early postnatal treatment with a neurotrophic factor small-molecule peptide mimetic in Ts65Dn mice rescues developmental delay and AD-like learning and memory impairment, probably via increased BDNF and pCREB expression, reduced GSK3β activity, and amelioration of pre-synaptic protein deficit. The present study further corroborates the recent hypothesis that trisomy 21-linked brain abnormalities can be prevented with embryonic and neonatal treatment. Furthermore, we show a novel therapeutic modality, i.e., neurotrophic factor small-molecule mimetic with potent neurogenic and neurotrophic effects, that can robustly prevent the AD-like cognitive impairment in a DS mouse model without exerting any significant adverse effect.</p>

<title>Structure of compound P021, study design and groups, and placental/lactational and BBB permeability of P021.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structure of CNTF derived P021 (Ac-DGGL<sup>A</sup>G-NH<sub>2</sub>; molecular weight, 578.3). (<bold>b</bold>) Design of the neurobehavioral development component of the study. The effect of prenatal to early postnatal treatment on the appearance of developmental milestones/early neurological reflexes was evaluated from PND1 to PND21. (<bold>c</bold>) Design of the longitudinal component of the study. The effect of prenatal to early postnatal treatment on cognition and general behavior in adult mice was evaluated. (<bold>d</bold>) Summary of the study groups. There were 6 study groups as follows: WT offsprings of WT mothers on vehicle diet (WT-V-WT), WT offsprings of WT mothers on P021 diet (WT-P-WT), WT offsprings of Ts65Dn mothers on vehicle diet (Dn-V-WT), WT offsprings of Ts65Dn mothers on P021 diet (Dn-P-WT), Ts65Dn offsprings of Ts65Dn mothers on vehicle diet (Dn-V-Dn), and Ts65Dn offsprings of Ts65Dn mothers on P021 diet (Dn-P-Dn). (<bold>e</bold>,<bold>f</bold>) Based on previous studies on the mechanism of action of compound P021<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>, the delivery of P021 to the target organ, i.e. offspring’s brain via placental barrier and during lactation, and across BBB, was determined by evaluating the phosphorylation level of STAT3 at Tyr705 in the hippocampus of 3-week-old WT and Ts65Dn mice. P021 treatment significantly reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 in the hippocampal tissue of both WT and Ts65Dn mice. This confirmed that significant amount of P021 reached the offsprings’ brains to exert its proposed effect i.e. inhibition of LIF activity as measured by pSTAT3, Tyr705. Quantification of the Western blots is shown as mean ± S.E.M. from WT-V-WT (n = 7), WT-P-WT (n = 6), Dn-V-WT (n = 7), Dn-P-WT (n = 7), Dn-V-Dn (n = 7), and Dn-P-Dn (n = 7) mice. *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001.

<title>Prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 prevents delay in neurobehavioral development in Ts65Dn pups.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Body weight analysis of young mice from PND3-21. The Ts65Dn mice weighed less than WT mice on PND21. At early developmental stages (PND3 and PND6), P021 treatment induced significant weight gain in Ts65Dn mice, and brought it to WT level. (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>c</bold>) Neurobehavioral development evaluation of young mice from PND1-21. Ts65Dn mice exhibited significant delay in the development of surface righting, negative geotaxis, cliff aversion, forelimb grasp, air righting, and ear twitch. Prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 significantly prevented the delay in the appearance of surface righting, cliff aversion, and ear twitch. There was also a trend towards rescue of delay in the development of negative geotaxis. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M. and are based on WT-V-WT (n = 11), WT-P-WT (n = 10), Dn-V-WT (n = 10), Dn-P-WT (n = 9), Dn-V-Dn (n = 11), and Dn-P-Dn (n = 12) mice. *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <italic>a, p</italic> = 0.09; <italic>b, p</italic> = 0.073; <italic>c, p</italic> = 0.072.

<title>Prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 ameliorates impairment in long-term recognition memory in adult Ts65Dn mice.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) The experimental design of one-trial object recognition/discrimination task for long-term memory. (<bold>b</bold>) Time spent exploring the objects during the sample phase of the object recognition/discrimination task. There was no difference among experimental groups. (<bold>c</bold>) In the test phase, the vehicle-treated Ts65Dn mice (Dn-V-Dn) exhibited a significantly impaired novelty preference (discrimination index, 24.7%) as compared to vehicle-treated WT mice (WT-V-WT, discrimination index, 56.8% and Dn-V-WT, discrimination index, 60%), suggesting a short-term memory deficit in these mice. The prenatal to early postnatal treatment with P021 ameliorated this deficit significantly; however, these mice (Dn-P-Dn, discrimination index, 38.8%) still did not reach the WT level of novelty preference. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M. and are based on WT-V-WT (n = 10), WT-P-WT (n = 12), Dn-V-WT (n = 12), Dn-P-WT (n = 11), Dn-V-Dn (n = 13), and Dn-P-Dn (n = 12) mice. *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001.
