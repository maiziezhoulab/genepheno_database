<abstract>
<p id="P1">Copy number variations have been frequently associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome is one of the most common genomic rearrangements in males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and is characterized by autism, intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, anxiety, epilepsy, recurrent respiratory tract infections, and early death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The broad range of deficits caused by methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) overexpression poses a daunting challenge to traditional biochemical pathway-based therapeutic approaches. Accordingly, we sought strategies that directly target MeCP2 and are amenable to translation into clinical therapy. The first question, however, was whether the neurological dysfunction is reversible after symptoms set in. Reversal of phenotypes in adult symptomatic mice has been demonstrated in some models of monogenic loss-of-function neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, including loss of MeCP2 in Rett syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, indicating that, at least in some cases, the neuroanatomy may remain sufficiently intact so that correction of the molecular dysfunction underlying these disorders can restore healthy physiology. Given the absence of neurodegeneration in <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome, we hypothesized that restoration of normal MeCP2 levels in <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication adult mice would rescue their phenotype. Therefore, we first generated and characterized a conditional <italic>Mecp2</italic>-overexpressing mouse model and showed that correction of MeCP2 levels largely reversed the behavioral, molecular, and electrophysiological deficits. Next, we sought a translational strategy to reduce MeCP2 and turned to antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). ASOs are small modified nucleic acids that can selectively hybridize with mRNA transcribed from a target gene and silence it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and have been successfully used to correct deficits in different mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We found that ASO treatment induced a broad phenotypic rescue in adult symptomatic transgenic <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication mice (<italic>MECP2</italic>-TG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and corrected <italic>MECP2</italic> levels in lymphoblastoid cells from <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication patients in a dose-dependent manner.</p>

<p id="P2">To determine whether <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome is reversible, we generated a conditional <italic>MECP2</italic> overexpression mouse model that carries two functional alleles with species-matched endogenous control elements: a human wild type (WT) <italic>MECP2</italic> allele and a conditional mouse <italic>Mecp2</italic> allele (<italic>Mecp2<sup>lox</sup></italic>) that can be deleted using tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Our breeding strategy resulted in FVB/N × C57Bl/6 F1 hybrid mice belonging to the following three genotypes: Flox, Flox;TG, and Flox;TG;Cre. The <italic>loxP</italic> sequences did not alter MeCP2 expression or phenotype as Flox and Flox;TG mice were indistinguishable from WT and TG mice, respectively, in both molecular and behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">2</xref>). To ascertain the efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination, we injected Flox;TG;Cre mice intraperitoneally with either tamoxifen (TMX) or vehicle over the course of four weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and euthanized four cohorts of mice at different time points after initiation of treatment. MeCP2 protein levels were significantly downregulated at 2.5 weeks, and the levels of MeCP2 remained low thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Moreover, RT-qPCR showed that Cre-mediated recombination efficiently downregulated mRNA levels of both alternatively-spliced isoforms (<italic>Mecp2-e1</italic> and <italic>Mecp2-e2</italic>) of the floxed mouse <italic>Mecp2</italic>, but not the human transgenic <italic>MECP2</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Finally, we confirmed the normalization of MeCP2 levels by immunofluorescence staining of hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P3">Next, we injected a new cohort of 8- to 9-week-old mice with TMX or vehicle for behavioral characterization. Flox;TG;Cre mice injected with TMX (Flox;TG;Cre-TMX) were indistinguishable from Flox control mice in the different assays, showing a resolution of the phenotypes that resemble <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome, such as hypoactivity, anxiety-like behavior, motor abnormalities, and social behavior deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a–f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">Changes in MeCP2 abundance affect the mRNA levels of thousands of genes in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that normalizing MeCP2 levels would also normalize gene expression patterns. First, we analyzed the expression of selected MeCP2-sensitive genes in the hypothalamus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> by RT-qPCR, in adult mice. The mRNA levels of these genes in the Flox;TG;Cre-TMX group were indistinguishable from the Flox control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a,b</xref>). We then performed whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to evaluate expression patterns in the hippocampus. The analysis showed that the mRNA expression profile of the Flox;TG;Cre-TMX group clustered together with the Flox control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Reducing MeCP2 to normal levels in symptomatic mice thus appears to rescue the behavioral phenotype by reversing pathogenic molecular changes in the brain.</p>
<p id="P5">MeCP2 levels also influence synaptic plasticity, as indicated by abnormalities in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in MeCP2 null<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">We, therefore, assessed LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapses of the CA1 area in the hippocampus, and found no difference in input/output relationship (I/O) or paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) between the groups, indicating that MeCP2 overexpression does not affect basal synaptic transmission or short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4a–d</xref>). However, normalization of MeCP2 levels in Flox;TG;Cre-TMX mice, completely rescued the abnormal, enhanced LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). Defects in long-term hippocampal synaptic plasticity induced by MeCP2 overexpression are thus reversible in adult mice.</p>
<p id="P7">To determine whether we could normalize MeCP2 levels using a strategy that is more readily translatable into a medical therapy, we took advantage of our <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG mice harboring one copy of human <italic>MECP2</italic> (in addition to the endogenous mouse gene) to screen for a treatment using human-specific ASOs. We tested ASOs designed to bind multiple regions of the human <italic>MECP2</italic> pre-mRNA so as to reduce the levels of both alternatively-spliced <italic>MECP2</italic> isoforms, <italic>MECP2</italic>-e1 and <italic>MECP2</italic>-e2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). After screening <italic>MECP2</italic>-ASOs for their ability to reduce <italic>MECP2</italic> levels in cultured human cells, and for toxicity in WT mice (data not shown), we screened five selected <italic>MECP2</italic>-ASOs by injecting them stereotaxically in the brain of <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>), and used the most effective one, ASO-5, for further studies.</p>
<p id="P8">To determine the duration of treatment efficacy, we gradually infused ASO into the brains of 7–8-week old mice using micro-osmotic pumps designed to deliver the molecule at a constant rate over a four-week period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). At the end of treatment, immunofluorescence staining showed that the ASO was widely distributed throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) and that it effectively knocked-down MeCP2 close to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). We next analyzed MeCP2 expression in the cortex at different time points after initiation of treatment by western blot (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). MeCP2 was significantly downregulated four weeks after the initiation of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>), and remained so for an additional four weeks after stopping the infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). We further confirmed the specificity of the ASO for human <italic>MECP2</italic> by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We then treated a new cohort of animals for behavioral characterization. At 6–7 weeks after the initiation of the treatment, rescue was evident only in the rotarod test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>), but by 10–11 weeks, the hypoactivity, anxiety-like behavior and social behavior of <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG mice were also reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g, h, j</xref>). Ten weeks after treatment cessation, when MeCP2 levels had increased to pre-treatment levels, the symptoms reappeared (data not shown). To gain insight into the basis of the delayed behavioral rescue, we performed RNA-seq analysis in the hippocampus at two different time points after treatment initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We found that four weeks after initiation of treatment, there was a trend towards normalization of the expression of some mRNAs, but the TG-ASO group did not cluster together with the WT group. By eight weeks, however, the TG-ASO group clustered together with the WT group, suggesting that reversal of pathogenic molecular changes in the brain as a consequence of MeCP2 normalization correlates strongly with resolution of the behavioral phenotype. To test for possible off-target effects, we compared expression profiles at both time points to detect genes whose expression was significantly affected by the ASO treatment (TG vs TG-ASO), but was not different between WT and TG mice. We found only 10 overlapping genes that meet this criterion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), suggesting minimal off-targets.</p>
<p id="P10">Seizures occur in <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome mice as they age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, so we tested the ability of ASO treatment to reverse abnormal electrographic discharges in 25–35-week old <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG1 mice (pure FVB/N background). Vehicle-treated <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG1 mice manifested electrographic seizure spikes in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>), and strong electrographic seizure events were typically accompanied by behavioral seizures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). ASO treatment abolished these abnormal EEG discharges and eliminated behavioral seizures and electrographic seizure spikes in this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Lastly, we determined that <italic>MECP2</italic>-ASO treatment corrected <italic>MECP2</italic> mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner in lymphoblastoid cells from <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). The amount of ASO can thus be titrated and optimized so as to target only some <italic>MECP2</italic> RNA and allow translation of physiological levels of the protein.</p>
<p id="P12">As the main “reader” of methylated cytosines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, MeCP2 plays a fundamental role in epigenetics, controlling chromatin states and the expression of thousands of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Accordingly, MeCP2 expression must be maintained within a fairly narrow range to assure proper gene expression and neuronal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Here we demonstrated that restoration of MeCP2 to its normal level can largely reverse the phenotype of adult symptomatic <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication mice.</p>
<p id="P13">It is worth noting that reversal of <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication-like features was evident 6–7 weeks after genetic rescue but took 10–11 weeks after initiation of ASO treatment. This four-week difference is probably due to the more gradual reduction in MeCP2 levels brought about by ASO treatment. The RNA-seq results in the ASO experiment correlated nicely with the resolution of the disease phenotype: abnormal gene expression was still prominent at four weeks after the initiation of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>), whereas robust correction of gene expression eight weeks after treatment initiation (and four weeks after MeCP2 levels normalized, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>)) was accompanied by full behavioral rescue. In mice, therefore, MeCP2 levels must be normal for one month before there is resolution of the duplication phenotypes.</p>
<p id="P14">The finding that ASO treatment rescues the <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication-like phenotypes to a similar extent of the genetic rescue provides a proof-of-concept about the value of this approach. To move this closer to translation, further studies will have to test different ASO dosages and establish the safety margin of MeCP2 levels, using a mouse model that exclusively expresses two human <italic>MECP2</italic> alleles. Additionally, we will screen thousands of <italic>MECP2</italic>-ASOs for off-target effects.</p>
<p id="P15">Overall, our results show that delivering ASOs to the CNS is a promising therapeutic approach for treating <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome, and has potential for other disorders caused by duplication of genetic material by targeting genes in the respective critical regions, such as peripheral myelin protein 22 (<italic>PMP22</italic>) in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, retinoic acid induced receptor 1 (<italic>RAI1</italic>) in Potocki-Lupski syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (<italic>DYRK1A</italic>) in Down syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Antisense oligonucleotide synthesis</title>
<p id="P16">Isis Pharmaceuticals synthesized all ASOs as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. All ASOs consist of 20 chemically modified nucleotides (MOE gapmer). The central gap of 10 deoxynucleotides is flanked on its 5’ and 3’ sides by five 2’ -<italic>O</italic>- (2-methoxyethyl) (MOE) modified nucleotides. The backbone modifications from 5’ to 3’ are: 1-PS, 4-PO, 10-PS, 2-PO, and 2-PS. PS modifications were replaced with PO in the MOE wings to reduce the overall PS content of the ASO, since a fully modified PS ASO is not necessary for robust CNS activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

<title>Mice</title>
<p id="P17">The first MeCP2-overexpressing mice were <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG mice on a FVB/N pure background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. These mice show normal locomotion in the open field and an increase in vertical activity, which was interpreted as less anxiety, but there was no difference in anxiety-like behavior in the light-dark test. Mice on a pure FVB/N background, however, develop premature retinal degeneration, which can confound the interpretation of some behavioral tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. To overcome issues related to a pure inbred strain, our laboratory characterized F1 hybrid <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG mice (FVB/N × C57Bl/6 or FVB/N × 129S6/SvEv) and showed that these mice display several phenotypes as early as the age of 7 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, including increased anxiety and a trend towards hypoactivity. Therefore, for both the genetic rescue and the ASO treatment experiments, we decided to continue using F1 hybrid <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG mice.</p>
<p id="P18">For experiments related to the validation of the Flox;TG mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">2</xref>) we generated F1 hybrid animals by mating male <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG1 mice on a pure FVB/N background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> to female mice heterozygous for the <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>lox</sup> allele (Flox) (B6;129S4-<italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1Jae</sup></italic>/Mmucd obtained from MMRRC, and backcrossed to C57Bl/6J for more than 10 generations; see also scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 1a</xref>). For experiments related to conditional rescue of <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) we first mated Flox C57Bl/6 females with C57Bl/6 Cre-ER males (B6.Cg-Tg(UBC-cre/ERT2)1Ejb/J obtained from Jackson Laboratories). The F1 Flox;Cre females were then mated to FVB/N <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG1 males to generate the F1 hybrid, triple transgenic Flox;TG;Cre male mice and their control littermates (Flox and Flox;TG) (see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). For studies related to <italic>MECP2</italic>-ASOs, we generated F1 hybrid animals by mating FVB/N <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG1 females to wild-type 129S6/SvEv male mice (Taconic Farms). For the EEG experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>) we used <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG1 males on a pure FVB/N background.</p>
<p id="P19">We routinely use mouse littermates as controls for our experiments. Throughout the experiments, mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled, AAALAS-certified Level 3 facility on a 12 hr light-dark cycle. Food and water were given <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

<title>Gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR</title>
<p id="P21">The subset of mice for RTqPCR was selected randomly, using Excel software to generate a table of random numbers. No significant differences on behavioral measurements were found between the selected mice and the rest (per genotype group). Total RNA from mouse brain tissue was extracted using miRNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and 1 µg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA by Quantitect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). For human lymphoblasts 2µg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA. RT-qPCR was performed in a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using PerfeCTa SYBR Green Fast Mix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Sense and antisense primers were selected to be located on different exons, and the RNA was treated with DNase, to avoid false-positive results caused by DNA contamination. The specificity of the amplification products was verified by melting curve analysis.

General locomotor activity was automatically analyzed using AccuScan Fusion software (Omnitech, Columbus, OH, USA) by counting the number of times mice break the laser beams (activity counts). In addition, rearing activity, time spent in the center of the arena, entries to the center and distance traveled were analyzed. In this study we found that <italic>MECP2</italic>-TG mice are hypoactive in the open field test.

<title>RNA-seq</title>
<p id="P29">Mice were euthanized under anesthesia and the hippocampi were quickly dissected over ice. Total RNA of 30 hippocampal samples (three biological replicates of each genotype from three experiments) was extracted using miRNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated RNA was eluted in RNase-free water and submitted to the Genomic and RNA Profiling Core at Baylor College of Medicine. Sample quality checks using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 were conducted. Then Illumina TruSeq RNA library preparation protocol was used as follows: A double-stranded DNA library was created using 250 ng of total RNA (measured by picogreen), preparing the fragments for hybridization onto a flow-cell. First, cDNA was created using the fragmented 3’ poly(A) selected portion of total RNA and random primers. During second strand synthesis, dTTP is replaced with dUTP which quenches the second strand during amplification, thereby achieving strand specificity. Libraries were created from the cDNA by first blunt ending the fragments, attaching an adenosine to the 3’ end and finally ligating unique adapters to the ends. The ligated products were then amplified using 15 cycles of PCR. The resulting libraries were quantitated using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer and fragment size assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer. A qPCR quantitation was performed on the libraries to determine the concentration of adapter ligated fragments using Applied Biosystems ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System and a KAPA Library Quant Kit. Using the concentration from the ViiA7 qPCR machine, 21pM of library was loaded onto a flowcell and amplified by bridge amplification using the Illumina cBot machine. A paired-end 100 cycle run was used to sequence the flow-cell on a HiSeq Sequencing System.</p>

<title>RNA-Seq Data Pre-processing and Analysis</title>
<p id="P30">For each sample, about 10 million of 100 bp pair-end reads were generated. Raw reads were first groomed by removing adapters from both the 3’- and 5’-ends before mapping to reference genome. Then, trimmed reads were aligned to the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome (UCSC <italic>mm10</italic>; the gene model for the mapping was obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html">http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html</ext-link>) using TopHat v2.0.9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> with default parameters (<italic>-r 200 –p 5</italic>). The mappability for all 30 samples was above 85%. To prepare the aligned sequence reads into expression level for differential gene analysis, we employed the free Python program HTSeq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The <italic>htseq-count</italic> function of HTSeq allowed us to accumulate the number of aligned reads that fall under the exons of the gene (union of all the exons of the gene). These read counts are analogous to the expression level of the gene. Using the obtained read counts, differential gene analyses were carried out using the DESeq package and <italic>glm.nb</italic> function in the R environment. DESeq includes functions for us to normalize the read counts of multiple samples across multiple genotypes by the use of the negative binomial distribution and a shrinkage estimator for the distribution’s variance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. <italic>glm.nb</italic> allows us to fit a negative binomial regression model to test the gene changes between genotypes. Specifically, for data from the ASO experiment, each gene was tested to check if its expression levels in WT and TG-ASO mice differed from that in TG mice. Similarly, for data from the genetic rescue experiment, expression levels in Flox and Flox;TG;Cre-TMX were tested for differences from the expression in Flox;TG;Cre-vehicle and Flox;TG. The statistical significance of the observed changes was reported by the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the p-value adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. A gene was considered significantly different between genotypes if it fell under a FDR of 10% and changed in a coherent direction.</p>

<title>Sample Clustering</title>
<p id="P31">To assess the similarity of expression patterns between samples of different genotypes, we carried out unbiased clustering: expressions of the identified significantly changed genes were clustered by sample based on Euclidean distance on average linkage and by genes based on Euclidean distance on complete linkage. Heatmaps were then used to plot the clustered gene expressions for visual inspection. The plotted expressions (z-scores) for each gene were the expressions normalized at the gene level to have an average of zero and a standard deviation of one.</p>

Electrophysiology was performed in an interface chamber (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA, USA). Oxygenated ACSF (95%/5% O<sub>2</sub> /CO<sub>2</sub>, 31°C) was perfused into the recording chamber at the rate of 1.5 mL/min. Electrophysiological traces were digitized and stored using a Digidata 1320A and Clampex software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). Field EPSPs (fEPSPs) were recorded in the stratum radiatum with an ACSF-filled glass recording electrode (1–3 MΩ). The relationship between fiber volley amplitude and fEPSP slope over various stimulus intensities was used to assess baseline synaptic transmission. All subsequent experimental stimuli were set to an intensity that evoked a 30%–40% of the maximal fEPSP slope. Slices that did not exhibit stable fEPSP slopes during the first 20 min of recording were excluded from the analysis. Paired-pulse facilitation was measured at varying interstimulus intervals (20, 50, 100, 200, and 300 ms). LTP was induced by 2 trains of high-frequency stimulation (HFS, 100 Hz for 1 s) with 20 s intertrain interval. Synaptic efficacy was monitored for 20 min prior to and 70 min following LTP induction by recording fEPSPs every 20 s (3 traces were averaged over succeeding 1 min intervals).
