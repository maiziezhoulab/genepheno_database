<abstract>
<p>Monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor (MLIF), a heat-stable pentapeptide, has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in ischemic brain injury. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective action of MLIF against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced injury in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. MTT assay was used to assess cell viability, and flow cytometry assay and Hoechst staining were used to evaluate apoptosis. LDH assay was used to exam necrosis. The release of inflammatory cytokines was detected by ELISA. Levels of the apoptosis associated proteins were measured by western blot analysis. To identify the protein target of MLIF, pull-down assay and mass spectrometry were performed. We observed that MLIF enhanced cell survival and inhibited apoptosis and necrosis by inhibiting p-JNK, p53, c-caspase9 and c-caspase3 expression. In the microglia, OGD-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines was markedly reduced in the presence of MLIF. Furthermore, we found that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) is a downstream target of MLIF. Knockdown eEF1A2 using short interfering RNA (siRNA) almost completely abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of MLIF in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to OGD, with an associated decrease in cell survival and an increase in expression of p-JNK and p53. These results indicate that MLIF ameliorates OGD-induced SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma injury by inhibiting the p-JNK/p53 apoptotic signaling pathway via eEF1A2. Our findings suggest that eEF1A2 may be a new therapeutic target for ischemic brain injury.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stroke is the second leading cause of death, and the number of new stroke cases continues to rise along with an ageing population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref001">1</xref>]. Ischemic stroke, which accounts for 80% of all strokes, is a devastating disorder with a complex pathophysiology involving inflammation, apoptosis, excitotoxicity, and oxidative and nitrosative stress to brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref002">2</xref>]. The main drug treatment for ischemic stroke is tissue plasminogen activator, which has a very limited time window of therapeutic efficacy. Consequently, there is an urgent clinical need for effective anti-ischemic cerebroprotective drugs.</p>
<p>Monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor (MLIF,Met-Gln-Cys-Asn-Ser), is a heat-stable anti-inflammatory oligopeptide derived from <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> axenic cultures. MLIF has been shown to have numerous biological effects. It is involved in the inflammatory response and in the repair process, it regulates the expression of immunomodulatory genes, and it plays a role in cell proliferation, extracellular matrix production and degradation, vasculogenesis, axon guidance and cellular movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref004">4</xref>]. We previously found that MLIF attenuates the inflammatory response and oxidative damage in focal ischemia and protects cerebrovascular endothelial cells following hypoxic injury by inhibiting the expression of adhesion molecules and by targeting the eEF1A1/eNOS pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref005">5</xref>]. Yao and colleagues also reported that MLIF is neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A), a member of the G protein family, transfers aminoacylated-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) to the A site of the ribosome during the elongation cycle in protein biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref007">7</xref>]. Recently, studies have shown that in addition to the role in protein translation, the two sister genes, eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, exhibit some non-canonical functions. eEF1A1 has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref008">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref011">11</xref>], but eEF1A2 has not. eEF1A2, unlike eEF1A1 which is widely expressed, is mainly expressed in the brain, heart and skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref013">13</xref>]. eEF1A1 is gradually replaced by eEF1A2 after birth in the developing brain, and as a result eEF1A2 is the main form in the mature brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref014">14</xref>]. An increasing number of studies have shown that eEF1A2, in addition to its anti-apoptotic properties in many cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref015">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref017">17</xref>], has an important role in nervous system diseases. Deletion of the eEF1A2 gene results in a neurodegenerative phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref018">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>MLIF appears to provide neurovascular protection in brain ischemia by modulating the expression of inflammatory adhesion molecules and by regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide levels via the eEF1A1/eNOS pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref005">5</xref>]. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective actions of MLIF in ischemic brain injury remain unclear.</p>
<p>In the present study, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of ischemia using primary neurons and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to study the neuroprotective effects of MLIF. To evaluate the cytoprotective actions of MLIF, cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, molecular targets of MLIF were identified using pull-down assay and mass spectrometry in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, we used RNAi to clarify the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of MLIF against OGD-induced SH-SY5Y cells injury.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Reagents</title>
<p>MLIF and biotinylated MLIF were synthesized by the Chinese Peptide Company (Hangzhou, China), with purity above 98%. MLIF was dissolved in PBS (pH7.4) to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml and stored at â80Â°C. Rabbit monoclonal antibody specific for eEF1A2 was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA), p-JNK, caspase3, caspase9, ERK, p-ERK, p38, p-p38 and p53 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Secondary antibody was purchased from Kangchen (Shanghai, China), and anti-rabbit phycoerythrin antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). 2-(4-Amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride (DAPI) and Hoechst 33258 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co (St. Louis, MO, USA), while 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). All reagents in this study were of analytical grade.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and mouse microglial BV-2 cells were purchased from the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 1ÃPenicillin-Streptomycin (100U/ml or 100mg/ml) (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air at 37Â°C. Cells in the log growth phase were used for the various experiments. Rat primary cortical neurons were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref023">23</xref>]. Primary neurons were cultured in Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2% B27 (Life Technologies) and 0.5 mM L-glutamine, and 1ÃPenicillin-Streptomycin. Cells were plated at 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in polyethyleneimine-coated 96-well plates.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion procedure</title>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> ischemic injury was induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref024">24</xref>]. Cells were cultured until 80% confluent and incubated with glucose-free DMEM in a modular hypoxia incubation chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA, USA) with 95% N<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref025">25</xref>]. The chamber was kept in an incubator for 6 hours at 37Â°C to produce OGD. OGD/R is composed of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation period. Cells were kept in the glucose-free DMEM for 4 hours in the hypoxia incubation chamber at 37Â°C. OGD was terminated by adding glucose to a final concentration of 4.5mg/ml followed by incubation in a normoxic incubator for 12 hours (reoxygenation). Control cultures were maintained in an incubator under atmospheric oxygen levels and normal humidity (normoxia, control). A stock solution of MLIF was diluted with cell culture medium just prior to the experiments and added to the cells 2 h before OGD and at the reoxygenation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>MTT assay</title>
<p>Cells were seeded at 5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml and subjected to OGD as described above. After OGD, MTT (20 Î¼L, 5 mg/ml) was added to the cells and incubated at 37Â°C for 4 h. A 150 Î¼L aliquot of dimethyl sulfoxide was added and incubated for 10 min to dissolve the dark blue crystals. The absorbance was subsequently measured at 490 nm on a microplate reader (Multiskan MK3, Thermo Scientific, USA). The control group without OGD treatment was taken as 100% cell survival and all other groups were normalized to this value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Cells were seeded at 1.5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml, and OGD was performed. The number of apoptotic cells was assessed using an annexin V-FITC/PI assay according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Alexa Fluor<sup>Â®</sup> 488 annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with Alexa<sup>Â®</sup> Fluor 488 annexin V and PI for Flow Cytometry, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, following OGD injury, the cells were trypsinized without EDTA, harvested, and washed in cold PBS twice. Cells were then treated with annexin V/PI solution in 1 Ã annexin-binding buffer, and thereafter analyzed using a BD FACS Caliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Three separate experiments were performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay and Enzyme-linked Immunoassay</title>
<p>Cell death was evaluated using the Lactate Dehydragenase (LDH) Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). SH-SY5Y cells were grown in 96-well plates. After OGD treatment for 6h, the level of LDH in the cell culture supernatant was measured according to the manufacturerâs instruction.</p>
<p>ELISA was used to assess the effects of MLIF on TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² levels in OGD-induced BV-2 cells. Cells were plated onto 12-well plate. Supernatants were harvested to measure IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± using ELISA kits according to the manufacturerâs instruction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Pull-down assay</title>
<p>Cells were cultured until 80% confluent and then used for the pull-down assay. The cells were lysed with M-PER Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail in an ice-bath. The protein supernatant was incubated with biotinylated MLIF (40 Î¼L, 5 mg/ml, bio-MLIF) or control solution and incubated for 6â7 h at 4Â°C. Subsequently, 40 Î¼L of streptavidin-agarose bead suspension (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added and stirred gently at 4Â°C for 4â6 h. The sample was then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 12, 000 rpm for 2 min to obtain a pellet (S1), the supernatant was repeated the binding assay for two times to obtain sample2 (S2) and sample3 (S3). After three washes with cold PBS, 1Ã SDS sample buffer was added to the pellet and boiled. The control groups were respectively showed as C1, C2, and C3. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Proteins were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Voyager DESTR mass spectrometer, Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) after in-gel digestion, and protein identification was performed using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref027">27</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MLIF, an anti-inflammatory oligopeptide produced by <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. MLIF downregulates iNOS gene expression, increases levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-Î² after spinal cord injury, and inhibits the locomotion of human macrophages and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref036">36</xref>]. In our previous study, we found that MLIF alleviates damage to cerebrovascular endothelial cells induced by hypoxia by inhibiting the expression of adhesion molecules and by targeting the eEF1A1/eNOS pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref005">5</xref>]. Furthermore, MLIF treatment significantly alleviated neurological deficits and enhanced functional recovery in rats with ischemic or traumatic injury to the spinal cord. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of MLIF remained unclear.</p>
<p>Nervous system diseases vary in clinical phenotype, and the underlying pathogenetic processes are complex. Neuroprotection often involves cellular defense mechanisms that protect neurons from apoptosis or degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref037">37</xref>]. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases including three members: JNK, p38 and ERK, which become phosphorylated and activated in response to external stimulation and regulate cell differentiation, cell survival and apoptosis in neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref038">38</xref>]. In the present study, we found that MLIF protects human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells from OGD-induced apoptosis and necrosis through inhibiting caspase-dependent apoptotic protein p-JNK/p53. We subsequently set about to identify MLIF target proteins with a pull-down assay and mass spectrum analysis. Interestingly, we found the target protein was eEF1A2, the main isoform of eEF1A expressed in the mature brain. The importance of eEF1A2 in mediating the effects of MLIF was confirmed by knockdown in SH-SY5Y cells.</p>
<p>There are reports showing that eEF1A2 is involved in Akt-dependent cell migration and actin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref039">39</xref>], apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref041">41</xref>], and phosphatidylinositol signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref042">42</xref>]. eEF1A2 is thought to play a critical role in cell transformation as well. Furthermore, accumulating data show that eEF1A2 has a significant association with nervous system diseases. Deletion of eEF1A2 in mice gives rise to a neurodegenerative phenotype, and the animals die of muscle wasting and neurodegeneration 4 weeks after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref018">18</xref>]. In addition, eEF1A2 mutation in patients is associated with neurological symptoms and the following clinical features: severe intellectual disability, facial deformity, psychomotor developmental delay, autism and epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Our present findings suggest that eEF1A2 may be a potential new therapeutic target for nervous system diseases. The neuroprotective mechanisms of MLIF targeting eEF1A2 may partial through inhibiting apoptosis. Inactivation of eEF1A proteins leads to immunodeficiency, neural and muscular defects, and enhanced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref045">45</xref>]. eEF1A2 has a strong connection with apoptosis. Indeed, we observed that the neuroprotective effect of MLIF was mediated by eEF1A2, and was associated with a reduction in apoptosis and reduced expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins p-JNK and p53.</p>
<p>Previous investigations have reported that MAPK pathway is involved in the biological actions of MLIF[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref046">46</xref>]. As a group of MAPK families, JNK pathway plays an important role in apoptosis by destabilize p53 and promote ubiquitin-mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref047">47</xref>]. In this work, we found MLIF significantly decreased the expression of p-JNK, and activated caspase-3. MLIF protects OGD-induced SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma injury may through eEF1A2/JNK/P53 pathway. The inhibition of neuronal apoptosis is a key feature of many neuroprotective mechanisms. The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), a group of stress kinases activated by cellular stress, have a critical role in apoptosis and play a key role in the nervous system, not only in regulating neuronal death, but also in brain morphogenesis and axodendritic architectonics during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref049">49</xref>]. Moreover, under phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or UV irradiation stress, polysome-associated JNK phosphorylates eEF1A2, thereby increasing levels of polysomal eEF1A2, which in turn induces JNK dissociation in puromycin-treated mammalian cells. Indeed, eEF1A2 and JNK are heavily implicated in cell proliferation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref050">50</xref>]. p53, a tumor suppressor, plays a critical role in ischemic injury. When upregulated, p53 induces apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref052">52</xref>]. It is reported that JNK is a regulator of the translation and stability of the p53 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0149965.ref053">53</xref>]. Inhibition of eEF1A2 upregulates the levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins p-JNK and p53 in neurons, suggesting that the eEF1A2/JNK/p53 pathway plays a critical role in the neuroprotective action of MLIF. Consequently, eEF1A2 may be a promising new therapeutic target for ischemic brain injury</p>
