<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p id="P3">Heterozygous coding mutations in <italic>TRIO</italic> are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy, and impair TRIO’s biochemical activities. To model mutant alleles, we ablated one or both <italic>Trio</italic> alleles from excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of mice. <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency increases anxiety and impairs social preference and motor coordination. <italic>Trio</italic> loss reduces forebrain size and dendritic arborization but increases dendritic spine densities. Cortical synapses in <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficient mice are small, exhibit pre– and postsynaptic deficits, and cannot undergo long–term potentiation. Similar phenotypes are observed in <italic>Trio</italic> knockout mice. Overall, <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency causes severe disease–relevant deficits in behavior and neuronal structure and function. Interestingly, phosphodiesterase 4A5 (PDE4A5) levels are reduced and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is increased when <italic>TRIO</italic> levels are reduced. Elevation of PDE4A5 and drug–based attenuation of PKA signaling rescue <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency–related dendritic spine defects, suggesting an avenue for therapeutic intervention for <italic>TRIO</italic>–related neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P6">Mutations and rare variants in the coding region of <italic>TRIO</italic> are enriched in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, and epilepsy (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Katrancha et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sadybekov et al., 2017</xref>). Analysis of genetic variation in humans indicates that <italic>TRIO</italic> is highly intolerant to mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Genovese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Katrancha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Samocha et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that mutations in <italic>TRIO</italic> confer risk for disease. <italic>TRIO</italic>, also known as triple functional domain protein, interfaces with cell surface receptors and small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) to regulate neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Awasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bateman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bellanger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">van Haren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Iyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Newsome et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Shivalkar and Giniger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Steven et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>TRIO</italic>9S and <italic>TRIO</italic>9L, the major isoforms expressed in the mammalian cortex, contain multiple catalytic and accessory domains, including two distinct guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bellanger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Blangy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Debant et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Katrancha et al., 2017</xref>). Many diseaseassociated <italic>de novo</italic> mutations and rare variants impair <italic>TRIO</italic> GEF1 domain function but do not interfere with wild–type <italic>TRIO</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Katrancha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sadybekov et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that <italic>TRIO</italic> haploinsufficiency causes disease.</p>
<p id="P7">To study <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency in excitatory neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, we crossed mice bearing a conditional “floxed” <italic>Trio</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zong et al., 2015</xref>) with <italic>NEX(Neurod6)–Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>) to generate heterozygous <italic>NEX–Cre, Trio</italic><sup><italic>+/flox</italic></sup>
<italic>(NEX–Trio+/−)</italic> and homozygous <italic>NEX</italic>–Cre, <italic>Trio</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> (<italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/−) mice. As modeled by disruption of one <italic>Trio</italic> allele, <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency causes behavioral deficits, including increased anxiety, impaired social preference, and impaired motor coordination. Similar and often more severe phenotypes are observed in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice. In a gene dosage–dependent manner, <italic>Trio</italic> loss reduces forebrain size and dendritic arborization but increases dendritic spine densities in the motor cortex. Cortical synapses in <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficient and knockout mice are also smaller than wild–type, exhibit preand postsynaptic deficits, and do not undergo long–term potentiation. Interestingly, phosphodiesterase 4A5 (PDE4A5) levels are reduced and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is increased when <italic>TRIO</italic> levels are reduced or eliminated. Elevation of PDE4A5 and drug–based attenuation of PKA signaling rescue <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency–related dendritic spine defects. Overall, <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency, as observed in patients with NDDs, causes brain– and disease–relevant behavioral, anatomical, functional, and molecular deficits; some of these defects can be rescued by drug–based modulation, suggesting an avenue for therapeutic intervention for <italic>TRIO</italic>–related NDDs</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title><italic>TRIO</italic> Levels Are Reduced in the Cortex and Hippocampus of <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− Mice</title>
<p id="P8"><italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice were generated by crossing mice bearing a conditional <italic>Trio</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zong et al., 2015</xref>), in which exons 22–25 are flanked by LoxP sites, with <italic>NEX(Neurod6)</italic>–Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>). Cre–mediated recombination of <italic>Trio</italic> creates a premature stop codon at the start of the <italic>TRIO</italic> GEF1 domain, modeling the protein–truncating R1276X and F1538Intron mutants in schizophrenia and I1329Frameshift mutant in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Genovese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Katrancha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike whole–brain <italic>Trio</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">O’Brien et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Peng et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice survived into adulthood. At postnatal day 42 (P42), <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice had reduced <italic>TRIO</italic> levels in the cortex (46% and 85%, respectively) and hippocampus (51% and 74%, respectively) relative to wild–type (WT) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A–1D</xref>). As <italic>NEX–Cre</italic> is only expressed in excitatory neurons, the remaining <italic>TRIO</italic> likely reflects residual expression in interneurons or glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>TRIO</italic> levels were unaffected in the cerebellum, where <italic>NEX–Cre</italic> is not expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A–1D</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title><italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− Mice Have Smaller Brains Than WT Mice</title>
<p id="P9">Knockout of both <italic>Trio</italic> alleles in most cortical and hippocampal neurons with <italic>EMX1–Cre</italic> resulted in reduced body weight at P17 and reduced brain size at both P17 and P60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zong et al., 2015</xref>). We found that sex–matched WT, <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/−, and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice had similar body weights at P42 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A and S1C</xref>). Both the total brain weight and the combined weight of the cortex and hippocampus were reduced in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice by 4%–7% and 23%–29%, respectively, relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E–1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B, and S1D</xref>). The total brain weight and the combined weight of the cortex and hippocampus were also reduced at P21, suggesting a gross anatomical deficit, even during development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1F and S1G</xref>). Body weight at P21 was only reduced in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title><italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− Mice Display Increased Anxiety–like Behavior and Impaired Social Preference</title>
<p id="P10">Mutations in <italic>TRIO</italic> are observed in NDD patients with wide–ranging behavioral deficits. As anxiety and depression are often comorbid with NDDs, we assessed anxiety–like behavior using the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus (E+) maze and behavioral despair using the forced swim test (FST). <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice showed increased anxiety–like behavior in the OFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>) and E+ maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E and 2F</xref>) relative to WT littermates. <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice had variable behavioral phenotypes that were sexually dimorphic: only females spent more time in the center of the OFT, and only males showed reduced open arm time in the E+ maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C, 2D, 2G, and 2H</xref>). In the OFT, locomotor activity was decreased in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2A–S2C</xref>), although <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice showed slight hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2D–S2F</xref>). Behavioral despair was not observed in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− or <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice in the FST (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2G and S2H</xref>). Overall, anxiety–like behavior was increased in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice with no change in behavioral despair, although variable phenotypes were observed in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice.</p>
<p id="P11">As social dysfunction is associated with autism, schizophrenia, and other NDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Blatt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tarbox et al., 2013</xref>), we tested how reduced <italic>TRIO</italic> levels impact social preference. WT mice interacted more with an unfamiliar “stranger” mouse relative to an inanimate object, exhibiting social preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A–3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3E</xref>). In contrast, <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice showed no preference for the stranger mouse relative to the object and reduced social preference relative to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A–3E</xref>), spending equivalent total visit time with the stranger mouse and object (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3A–S3E</xref>). These findings reveal that reducing or eliminating <italic>TRIO</italic> function in excitatory forebrain neurons impairs social function.</p>
<p id="P12">We also assessed disease–specific behaviors. Individuals with schizophrenia show deficits in sensorimotor gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Parwani et al., 2000</xref>), so we tested prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (PPI). <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice displayed normal PPI with 30 ms or 100 ms interstimulus intervals (ISIs) for all pre–pulse intensities (6, 12, and 16 dB; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4A–S4D</xref>), except male <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice, which exhibited decreased PPI in the most challenging condition (6 dB prepulse intensity with 30 ms ISI). Individuals with autism display repetitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Angoa–Pérez et al., 2013</xref>), so we assessed nestlet shredding. Male <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice exhibited increased nestlet shredding; this effect was driven by a subset of mice, suggesting incomplete penetrance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4E–S4G</xref>). Finally, in a test for recognition memory, <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice exhibited normal discrimination between novel and familiar objects and performed similarly to sex–matched WT littermates during object familiarization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5A–S5E</xref>), despite completing the task faster on one or both days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5F and S5G</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that partial and/or full loss of <italic>Trio</italic> expression does not affect novel object recognition but impacts sensorimotor gating and repetitive behaviors in some male mice.</p>
<p id="P13">In summary, <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice showed complex behavioral phenotypes that varied in both quality and severity of deficit. Of particular interest, <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency resulted in significant impairments in both social function and anxiety, consistent with the prevalence of these symptoms in NDD patients.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title><italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− Mice Display Gene Dosage–Dependent Deficits in Motor Coordination</title>
<p id="P14">Motor abnormalities are early symptoms of autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Blatt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Walker et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice showed a shorter latency to fall off an accelerating rotarod than WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F and 3I</xref>). <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice showed no deficit in motor learning, learning at a rate similar to WT littermates (40 s per trial; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3G and 3H</xref>). In contrast, <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (14–18 s per trial) showed an impairment in motor learning rate compared to WT littermates (32 or 33 s per trial; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3J and 3K</xref>). No confounding difference in muscle strength was observed using the Kondziela inverted screen test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3F and S3G</xref>). In summary, both <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice have deficits in motor coordination, and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice have additional deficits in motor learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title><italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− Mice Have Decreased Dendritic Arborization, Increased Dendritic Spine Density, and Smaller Synapses in Motor Cortex</title>
<p id="P15">As <italic>NEX</italic>–Cre–mediated recombination is absent in the striatum and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>), we assessed whether the motor deficits are associated with anatomical and functional changes in the motor cortex. We measured dendritic arborization in layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5 PNs) in motor cortex (regions M1 and M2) of <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/−, <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/−, and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A, 4E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A</xref>). Sholl analysis revealed decreased dendritic arbor complexity in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B and 4F</xref>), due to reduced branch point numbers and total dendrite length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C, 4D, 4G, and 4H</xref>). This phenotype was more pronounced in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice, indicating a gene dosage dependence.</p>
<p id="P16">We then assessed dendritic spine density in the motor cortex and hippocampus using the Thy1–GFP–M mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Feng et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice showed increased dendritic spine density on basal dendrites of L5 PNs in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A–5D</xref>), and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice showed increased dendritic spine density on apical and basal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6D and S6E</xref>). No difference in spine density was observed in hippocampal CA1 neurons of <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6B and S6C</xref>). Given the increased dendritic spine density in the motor cortex, we examined synaptic ultrastructure using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Synapse density was significantly or suggestively increased in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5F and 5G</xref>). Dendritic spine area, presynaptic density (PSD) length, and presynaptic bouton area were all decreased in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5H–5M</xref>). In summary, <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency and knockout decreased dendritic arbor length, increased dendritic spine density, and decreased synapse size in the motor cortex.</p>

<title>Presynaptic Release Probability, Postsynaptic Currents, andLong–Term Potentiation Are Impaired in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− Mice</title>
<p id="P17">L5 PNs in motor cortex exhibit task–related firing and plastic changes when mice run on an accelerating rotarod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Costa et al., 2004</xref>). To measure synaptic transmission, we recorded evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in motor cortex L5 PNs. The NMDA receptor (NMDAR)/AMPA receptor (AMPAR)mediated eEPSC ratio was increased in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>), due to decreased AMPAR–eEPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S7A and S7B</xref>), consistent with decreased PSD length and spine area. In contrast, the NMDAR/AMPAR eEPSC ratio was decreased in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>), with both NMDAR– and AMPAR–eEPSC amplitudes decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S7A and S7B</xref>), a more severe phenotype.</p>
<p id="P18">Consistent with the observed eEPSC changes, the amplitudes of AMPAR–mEPSCs were significantly decreased in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C and 6E</xref>). There was a trend toward reduced amplitude of NMDAR–mEPSCs in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice (p = 0.0517) and a significant reduction in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C and 6E</xref>). The frequencies of AMPAR– and NMDAR–mEPSCs were also decreased in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6D and 6E</xref>). <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice showed an altered mEPSC decay time for NMDARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6F and 6G</xref>). To assess presynaptic function, we measured paired–pulse ratio (PPR) in L5 PNs in motor cortex at five interstimulus intervals (35, 60, 100, 200, and 300 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6H and 6I</xref>). Increased PPR was observed in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>), suggesting a deficit in presynaptic release probability, which likely contributes to the decreased mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">Pre– and postsynaptic functions were also measured in the hippocampus. In <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice, the NMDAR/AMPAR eEPSC ratio trended toward an increase due to decreased AMPAR–eEPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6F–S6I</xref>). In <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice, the NMDAR/AMPAR eEPSC ratio was not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6F–S6I</xref>). Increased hippocampal PPR at a 75–ms interstimulus interval was only observed in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6J and S6K</xref>), suggesting that hippocampal neurons had lower sensitivity to <italic>Trio</italic> disruption relative to cortical neurons.</p>
<p id="P20">Finally, to assess synaptic plasticity in the motor cortex, we analyzed long–term potentiation (LTP), via theta burst stimulation (TBS), in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice, which showed a lack of induction and maintenance of TBS–LTP relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J</xref>).

<title>PDE4A5 Levels Are Reduced in a <italic>Trio</italic> Gene Dosage–Dependent Manner, and Restoration of PDE4A5 Rescues <italic>Trio</italic>–Related Increases in Dendritic Spine Density</title>
<p id="P21">We used mass–spectrometry–based proteomic and phosphor–proteomic analyses of the motor cortex to identify proteins whose levels or function were altered in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice. Of the 8,379 proteins quantified, 193 and 101 were significantly up– or downregulated, respectively, with <italic>Trio</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7C</xref>). Proteome profiling confirmed <italic>TRIO</italic> depletion in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7D</xref>), along with decreases in other NDD–associated proteins: phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4D, clathrin heavy chain (CHC), PDE4A, and P21 or RAC1 activated kinase 4 (PAK4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7E</xref>). Quantitative immunoblotting corroborated these findings in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice as follows: 11% PDE4D, 8% CHC, 28% PDE4A, and 25% PAK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7B and 7C</xref>). Of interest, PDE4A isoform 5 (PDE4A5) was reduced in a <italic>Trio</italic> dosage–dependent manner, exhibiting 21% and 44% reductions in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>/ mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7D and 7E</xref>). As PDE4A5 is an attenuator of PKA signaling, we queried the phosphoproteomic data for enrichment or depletion of known kinase–substrate pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>). Nine pairs were significantly increased in either the <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− or <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− samples, with PKA and its substrates most significantly changed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>). PKA substrate phosphopeptide levels were consistently increased with relatively little change in protein levels, and activity–inducing phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of PKA (phosphorylation site T198) was increased in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). Overall, <italic>Trio</italic> loss downregulates PDE4A5 protein levels, increases PKA signaling, and increases phosphorylation of PKA substrates in the motor cortex.</p>
<p id="P22">To assess the contribution of PDE4A5 to <italic>Trio</italic>–related phenotypes, we modeled <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency in cultured cortical neurons. First, we verified that Cre expression yielded significant <italic>TRIO</italic> loss in <italic>Trio</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S7G and S7H</xref>). Then, we transfected <italic>Trio</italic><sup>+/flox</sup> neurons with GFP–P2A–Cre to inactivate one <italic>Trio</italic> allele (Cre<italic>–Trio</italic>+/−) and compared this to GFP–transfected <italic>Trio</italic><sup>+/flox</sup> neurons (WT). Cre<italic>–Trio</italic>+/− neurons showed increased spine density and decreased branch tip number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7G, 7H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7I</xref>), mimicking the phenotypes observed in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mouse brain (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). PDE4A5 overexpression rescued the increased spine density in Cre<italic>–Trio</italic>+/− neurons, restoring them to WT levels, but did not impact WT spine density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7G and 7H</xref>). PDE4A5 overexpression did not rescue branching deficits in Cre<italic>–Trio</italic>+/− neurons, indicating that other mechanisms support dendrite branches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7I</xref>). As PDE4A5 levels are reduced and PKA signaling is elevated in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7E and 7F</xref>), we treated Cre<italic>–Trio</italic>+/− neurons with Rp–cAMPS, a competitive PKA antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Taylor et al., 1999</xref>). Rp–cAMPS treatment rescued the increased dendritic spine density in <italic>Cre–Trio</italic>+/− neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7G and 7H</xref>). These findings suggest that drug–based modulation of the <italic>TRIO</italic>/PDE4A5–PKA pathway may be a promising treatment for NDDs.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P23">NDDs are associated with de novo mutations and rare variants in <italic>TRIO</italic>’s coding region, many of which impair <italic>TRIO</italic> GEF1 domain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Katrancha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sadybekov et al., 2017</xref>). These disorders are also associated with impaired structure and function of excitatory forebrain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Glantz and Lewis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hutsler and Zhang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Konopaske et al., 2014</xref>). As only one allele is typically damaged in these patients, we hypothesized that the disease–associated mutations result in haploinsufficiency of <italic>TRIO</italic>, impairing the function of excitatory forebrain neurons. We discovered that <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice have smaller brains and exhibit profound deficits in dendrite and synapse structure and function; synaptic transmission and plasticity; and motor, social, and anxiety–like behaviors, all hallmarks of NDDs. Similar and often more severe phenotypes are observed in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice. Overall, this study reveals that <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency, as observed in patients with NDDs, causes disease–relevant deficits, suggesting that upregulating <italic>TRIO</italic> function may be a promising treatment for NDDs.</p>

<p id="P24">Motor abnormalities are among the earliest symptoms in autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Blatt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Walker et al., 1994</xref>). Our data suggest that <italic>TRIO</italic> plays a role in motor function, as reduced <italic>Trio</italic> dosage causes motor coordination deficits. Furthermore, we observed altered dendritic spine density, dendritic arborization, and forebrain size in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice. These phenotypes are consistent with the observations of increased cortical dendritic spine density in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hutsler and Zhang, 2010</xref>) and in primary neuronal culture following overexpression of the intellectual disability–associated <italic>TRIO</italic> D1368V mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sadybekov et al., 2017</xref>), decreased dendritic arborization in various NDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kulkarni and Firestein, 2012</xref>), and decreased cortical thickness in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">van Erp et al., 2018</xref>).

<title><italic>TRIO</italic> Promotes PDE4A5–PKA Signaling to Regulate Dendritic Spine Density</title>
<p id="P25">Our study links <italic>TRIO</italic> to PDE4A and downstream PKA–cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling in a NDD–relevant pathway. We provide evidence of a functional interaction between <italic>TRIO</italic> and PDE4A5 and their joint impact on dendritic spine density. Our data are supported by previous evidence that both <italic>TRIO</italic> and PDE4A bind DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1), which is believed to anchor these proteins within the dendritic spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Murdoch et al., 2007</xref>).

<title><italic>Trio</italic> Loss Impairs Both Pre–and Postsynaptic Functionin Mammals</title>
<p id="P26">Previous reports suggest that <italic>Trio</italic> knockdown or reduced <italic>TRIO</italic> function impairs AMPAR function in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Herring and Nicoll, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sadybekov et al., 2017</xref>). We further show that <italic>Trio</italic> disruption impairs AMPAR function in both the motor cortex and hippocampus, even if only one allele is damaged, as in patients with NDDs. We also reveal that reduced <italic>TRIO</italic> function disrupts normal presynaptic release and bouton area in mammals, possibly restricting glutamate availability in the motor cortex. Similarly, <italic>Trio</italic> mutant Drosophila exhibit impaired axonal formation and pathfinding as well as decreased boutons per area at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Awasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Ball et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bateman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hakeda–Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Miller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Newsome et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pawson et al., 2008</xref>).

Our observation that LTP is impaired with reduced <italic>TRIO</italic> function suggests that defects in plasticity likely contribute to the observed motor coordination and learning deficits. Overall, our data suggest that <italic>TRIO</italic> plays important roles in both synaptic transmission and plasticity. Furthermore, the observed increase in dendritic spine density, decrease in PSD length, decrease in mEPSC frequency, and impairment in LTP together suggest that there are more immature dendritic spines in the cortex, an anatomical hallmark of many NDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Martínez–Cerdeño, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P28"><italic>TRIO</italic> has emerged as a risk gene for many NDDs with mutations likely causing genetic insufficiency. A critical need exists to determine <italic>TRIO</italic>’s role in NDD pathology, so we performed a systematic investigation of the impact of <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency on the vertebrate central nervous system. Our data demonstrate that <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficiency is sufficient to impair normal neuron structure and connectivity as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity. We propose that disruptive or hypomorphic <italic>TRIO</italic> alleles reduce PDE4A5 levels, increase PKA signaling, and contribute to NDDs through similar impairments in structure and function in affected individuals.</p>

<p id="P37"><italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/−, <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/−, and WT mice at P42 were deeply anesthetized by pentobarbital sodium injection (Nembutal Sodium Solution) and transcardially perfused/cleared with PBS for 2 minutes. The following Golgi staining protocol was performed using the FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit (FD NeuroTechnologies, Inc) and adapted from their manual. The brain was quickly and carefully removed, rinsed in PBS, and immersed in Golgi impregnation solution. The brain was moved into new Golgi impregnation solution after 12–24 hours and allowed to sit for 2 weeks in the dark at room temperature. The brain was then transferred to Solution C for 24 hours, before being transferred to a new aliquot of Solution C for an additional 48 hours. Brains were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound (Tissue–Tek, 4583) inside a cryomold (10 mm × 10 mm × 5 mm, Tissue–Tek, 4565) and snap frozen in a dry ice and 100% ethanol bath. Sagittal sections were cut at 150 μm on a cryostat (Cryostat 2800 Frigocut–E, Reichert–Jung) set at 22°C and placed into room temperature PBS. The PBS was removed and replaced with Solution C before mounting. Sections were mounted onto gelatin–coated coverslips and allowed to dry for 48 hours at room temperature in the dark. Staining was performed in a series of Coplin staining jars: two 4–minute rinses in double distilled water, one 10–minute rinse in Solutions D/E, two 4–minute rinses in double distilled water, one 4–minute rinse in 50% ethanol, one 4–minute rinse in 70% ethanol, two 4–minute rinses in 100% ethanol, and two 4–minute rinses in xylenes. Slides were coverslipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific, SP15–100) and allowed to dry overnight. Dendrite reconstructions were performed using the Neurolucida software (MicroBrightField) at 100x magnification using a light microscope outfitted with a Z drive. Layer 5 pyramidal neurons were identified based upon the neuron’s location relative to other cells within the cortex, the presence of a pyramidal cell body, and the presence of a strong apical arbor that extended to the surface. Motor cortex (M1 and M2) was identified by comparing to “The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Paxinos and Franklin, 2012</xref>). Sholl analysis, total dendrite length, and branch point number were analyzed using the NeuroExplorer software (<italic>NEX</italic> Technologies).

Brains were postfixed at 4°C overnight and rinsed in PBS; 40 mm coronal slices were acquired on a Vibratome Series 1000 Sectioning System (Lancer). Slices containing the hippocampus were immediately mounted onto slides, while slices containing the motor cortex were stained with 4’,6–diamidino–2–phenylindole (DAPI) to identify the basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in motor cortex. Specifically, slices were incubated in 1:10,000 DAPI solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 62248) in 3% BSA in PBS by gently shaking for 10 minutes at room temperature and then washed 3 times with PBS. Slices were mounted onto Colorfrost Plus microscope slides (Thermo Scientific Shandon, 9991013), allowed to dry for 30 minutes, and coated with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, P36970) and a microscope cover glass (Fisherbrand, 12–545–F).

Images were taken on a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope at 12,000x magnification. Synapse density, PSD length, spine head area, and presynaptic bouton area were quantified using ImageJ software. The analyses were performed within a 994 ± 4 mm<sup>2</sup> area of layer 5 motor cortex (M1) using eighteen 55.2 ± 0.2 mm<sup>2</sup> fields of view per mouse. Synapses were identified by: (1) a plasma membrane surrounding and between pre– and postsynaptic compartments, (2) a PSD in the postsynaptic compartment, and (3) vesicles in the presynaptic compartment. Synapse density was the total number of spines divided by the field of view area. PSD length was the cross–sectional length of the PSD within identified synapses. Spine head and presynaptic bouton areas were measured by tracing the plasma membrane of spines and boutons in identified synapses; the tracings included the entire spine or bouton down to the narrowest part of the spine or axon neck.</p>

Coronal slices including the area of hippocampus and M1 cortex were cut at 350 mm in ice–cold sucrose–ACSF on a vibratome (Leica), then recovered in a humidified, oxygenated environment at 33.5C for at least 30 minutes. Slices were perfused during recording at 1 ml/min with ACSF (in mM): 3 KCl, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>•7H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 dextrose, 118 NaCl, 0.4 ascorbic acid, 4 Na–lactic acid, 2 Na–pyruvic acid saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>–5% O<sub>2</sub> at 290–320 mOsmol/L, pH 7.4. 10 mM bicuculline methiodide (BMI) was included in the ACSF. CA1 and M1 pyramidal neurons were identified using DIC and infrared optics with a water–immersion objective (NIR Apo 40x; BX51, Nikon) at room temperature (RT), and whole–cell recordings were obtained with an Axopatch 700B patch–clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices) using recording electrodes pulled from 1.5 mm glass capillaries on a Flaming–Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments) filled with (in mM): 137 cesium gluconate, 10 NaCl, 0.2 EGTA, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>–phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 5 QX–314 chloride adjusted to 300 mOsmol/L pH 7.4. Under these conditions, the recording electrodes had a resistance of 3–6 MΩ. Recorded signals were low pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz with a Digidata 1440 digitizer (Molecular Devices). Cells were excluded if series resistance deviated &gt; 20% or exceeded 20 MU. Data were collected in pClamp 10.3 and analyzed with Clampfit 10.3.</p>
<p id="P41">Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked with 0.05 Hz stimulation by a tungsten bipolar stimulating electrode placed 100 mm away from the recording electrode using stimulus intensities that yielded 50%–60% of the maximal response. AMPAR-eEPSC amplitudes were measured at the peak of the EPSC recorded at 70 mV holding potential. NMDAR–eEPSC amplitudes were recorded from the same neurons at +40 mV 40 ms after the stimulus artifact when AMPAR–eEPSCs have decayed. Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were recorded in whole–cell patch mode. AMPAR–mEPSCs were recorded at 70 mV and NMDAR–mEPSCs were recorded at +40 mV with tetrodotoxin and BMI in the external solution. Amplitude, frequency, and decay time of miniature events were detected using Mini–Analysis software (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA) and inspected visually to exclude overlapping events and events on a noisy baseline. In the paired–pulse ratio (PPR) experiments, the paired–pulse stimulation (interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 35, 60, 75, 100, 200 or 300 ms) was delivered via a bipolar tungsten stimulating electrode placed in CA3 Schaffer collateral axons in the hippocampus or in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex. The second EPSC (EPSC2), which was evoked by the second of the paired–pulse stimulations, was divided by EPSC1 to obtain a PPR. PPR was assessed at five ISIs (35, 60, 100, 200, and 300 ms) in M1 neurons and at 75ms ISI in hippocampal neurons. Long–term potentiation (LTP) of evoked EPSCs (recorded at 70 mV) was induced by thetaburst stimulation (TBS, five trains of four pulses at 100 Hz in 200 ms intervals, repeated four times with an interval of 10 s) in the presence of 10 03BCM BMI.</p>

<title>Proteomics and phosphoproteomics sample preparation</title>
<p id="P42">Mice at P42 were deeply anesthetized. The motor cortex was removed with the assistance of a mouse Brain Matrix and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Dissected mouse cortex slices were transferred to Covaris tissueTUBE TT1 (Part No. 520001, Plug Part No. 520006), kept on dry ice, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately prior to cryopulverization using a Covaris CP02 cryoPREP Automated Dry Pulverizer (Part No. 500001). The resulting powdered samples were transferred into 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and kept at 80C until lysis. The cryopulverized samples were lysed in 300 μl lysis buffer (8M urea, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM TRIS, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors) on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4°C at 10,000 rpm. Protein concentrations of supernatants were determined by BCA (Thermo). Cleared tissue lysates were reduced with 10 mM TCEP and cysteine alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Samples were diluted to 4 M urea with 200 mM Tris pH 8.0 and digested with LysC (1:50 enzyme:substrate ratio) for 90 minutes at 37°C. Samples were diluted to less than 2 M urea with 200 mM Tris pH 8.0 before adding trypsin (Promega) at the same ratio for overnight digestion at 37°C. Formic acid (FA) was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the samples desalted using 100 mg, 1 cc Sep–Pak (Waters). A 400 mg aliquot of each sample digest was frozen and dried by vacuum centrifugation, then stored at 80°C until tandem mass tag (TMT10, Thermo lot # SE240163, TMT11 channel, Thermo lot # RK245431) peptide labeling according to manufacturer instructions.</p>

The 110 minute method, 84 minute effective gradient, of solvent A (3% ACN, 0.1% FA) to solvent B (90% ACN, 0.1% FA) started at 2% B and went from 2% to 6% B over one minute; from 6% to 30% B over 84 minutes; from 30% to 60% B over 9 minutes; from 60% to 90% B over 1 minute, holding for five minutes, ramping down to 50% B over one minute and holding for 10 minutes. The flow rate was 200 nl/min for the first 100 minutes and 500 nl/min the last ten minutes. The Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer performed data–dependent acquisition in positive ion mode. MS1 spectra scanned a range of 300–1800 m/z at a resolution of 70,000, with a maximum injection time (max IT) of 5 ms for a 3e6 AGC target.

The test session involved four consecutive blocks of test trials, separated by 15 s, with continuous background noise (65 dB). In each block, eight trial types were used: “pulse–alone” trials (baseline startle) involved a 40 ms, 120 dB startle burst; the six independent “prepulse” trials involved a 20 ms prepulse (6, 12, or 16 dB above background) that occurred 30 or 100 ms prior to the 120 dB startle burst; and “no stimulus” trials involved only the background noise to assess spontaneous movement. Blocks 1 and 4 involved six consecutive pulse–alone trials. Blocks 2 and 3 involved six pulse–alone trials, five no stimulus trials, and five of each type of prepulse trial in a pseudo–random order. Overall, ninety–four test trials were performed in a twenty–eight–minute session. Trials with noisy baselines or excessive spontaneous movement prior to the pulse were excluded. Analyses were performed with the SR Lab Startle Response System software (San Diego Instruments) with a 10 ms baseline using an analysis window of 500 ms to 550 ms. All sound levels were measured on the “A” scale in dB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Geyer and Dulawa, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Nestlet shredding</title>
<p id="P55">The nestlet shredding test is a test for stereotyped or repetitive behaviors, often seen in autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Angoa–Pérez et al., 2013</xref>). This behavioral task was performed in a quiet, moderately lit (100 lux) room separate from housing. Mice were habituated to the testing room for 1 hour prior to experimentation. A standard polycarbonate mouse cage (30 3 19 3 13 cm) was filled with unscented bedding material to a depth of 0.5 cm, the surface was leveled, and a fitted filter–top cover was placed on top. Cotton fiber nestlets (5 cm × 5 cm, 5 mm thick, 2–2.5 g each) were weighed on an analytical balance before being placed on top of the bedding. The test mouse was placed into the test cage and left undisturbed for 30 minutes. The remaining intact nestlet was removed and allowed to dry overnight before being weighed again. The percentage of nestlet shredded was calculated.</p>

<title>Social preference test</title>
<p id="P56">The social preference test assays sociability by quantifying preference for a “stranger” mouse relative to an inanimate object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Rapanelli et al., 2017</xref>). This behavioral task was performed in a quiet, moderately lit (100 lux) room separate from housing. Mice were habituated to the testing room for 1 hour prior to experimentation. During the habituation phase, mice were placed in a 50 cm × 50 cm plexiglass box with two wire–mesh pencil holders (open side facing downward) for 10 minutes. Then, the mouse was briefly removed while an inanimate object (Duplo blocks of a similar size and color to a mouse) and a male conspecific “stranger” mouse were placed underneath separate wire–mesh pencil holders. The test mouse was then returned to the open field for 10 minutes, tracked using the AnyMaze software (Stoelting Co.), and scored for entries into and time within a social target zone and an equivalent nonsocial target zone. The target zones were defined by an annulus around the wire enclosure.</p>

<title>Open field test</title>
<p id="P57">The open field test assays both general locomotor activity and anxiety–like behavior in rodents. This behavioral task was performed in a quiet, moderately lit (100 lux) room separate from housing. Mice were habituated to the testing room for 1 hour prior to experimentation. Individual mice were placed in a large, clear plexiglass box and monitored using the Fusion software connected to a light beam array (Omnitech Electronics, Open Field Test, Version 4.5) for 60 minutes. The following measurements were analyzed based upon beam breaks: total distance traveled, ambulatory time (successive beam breaks), and vertical activity time (z axis beam breaks).</p>

<sec id="S42">
<title>Elevated plus maze</title>
<p id="P58">The elevated plus maze assays anxiety–like behavior in rodents. This behavioral task was performed in a quiet, dimly lit (20–30 lux) room separate from housing. The apparatus is raised 36.5 cm above the ground with a 5 cm square center platform and four 30 cm × 5 cm arms; two of the arms are enclosed by 16 cm high walls (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL). Mice were habituated to the testing room for 1 hour prior to experimentation. Mice were tested in 3 trials that were 5 minutes long with at least 10 minutes to rest between trials. Mice were placed directly on the center platform, tracked using the AnyMaze software (Stoelting Co.), and scored for time spent in the open arms.</p>

<sec id="S43">
<title>Forced swim test</title>
<p id="P59">The forced swim test assays behavioral despair in rodents. Mice were habituated to a quiet, moderately lit (100 lux) room separate from housing for 30 minutes prior to experimentation. Mice were then placed in a clear glass cylinder (14 cm in diameter) filled to a depth of 15 cm with water at 25°C and videotaped for 6 minutes. Mobility time was scored during the last 4 minutes of the trial by a blinded experimenter. Mobility was defined as the presence of active or escape directed movement. The total mobility time was subtracted from the total test time (240 s) to determine immobility time.</p>

<title>Accelerating rotarod</title>
<p id="P60">The rotarod is used to assess motor coordination and motor learning in rodents. Mice were habituated to a quiet, moderately lit (100 lux) room separate from housing for 30 minutes prior to experimentation. A five–lane rotarod treadmill (Med Associates ENV–577M, 8.75” rod circumference) was used for accelerating analyses. Mice were acclimated to the rotating rod at 4 RPM for 10 s before beginning the test. Then, the rod accelerated from 4 to 40 RPM over the course of 5 minutes (1.2 RPM/10 s) before leveling off at 40 RPM for 2.5 minutes. The maximum trial duration was 7.5 minutes, requiring the mice to travel 1,837.5 inches. Five trials were performed per mouse with a rest time of at least 10 minutes between trials. The latency to fall was recorded per trial.</p>

<title>Kondziela inverted screen test</title>
<p id="P61">The inverted screen test assays muscular strength in rodents. This behavioral task was adapted from methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Deacon, 2013</xref>). Briefly, mice were habituated to a quiet, moderately lit (100 lux) room separate from housing for 30 minutes prior to experimentation. The apparatus was a 40 cm square of wire–mesh with 12 mm squares of 1 mm diameter wire; it was surrounded by a square wooden frame (3.5 cm thick). During the training session on day 1, mice were placed in the center of the wire–mesh screen and rotated to an inverted position over 2 s. The screen was placed over a clear open box with the mice 45 cm above a padded surface. Mice were habituated to hanging on the screen until a cumulative hang time of 2 minutes was reached; mice were excluded if they were unable to meet this requirement. During the test session on day 2, mice were placed on the screen as before and given 3 trials to reach a maximum hang time of 8 minutes with 10–minute rest periods between trials. Mice reaching the 8–minute mark were deemed “successful,” and mice failing to reach the mark were “unsuccessful.”</p>

<title>QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</title>
<p id="P62">Statistical analyses were performed using either GraphPad Prism 7 or R software. For all assays, <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice were analyzed independently. Specific details of ‘n’ and statistical tests are included in the figure legends. Significance was defined by a p value less than 0.05. All pooled data are represented as mean ± SEM.</p>
<p id="P63">For tests with two independent variables, a two–way ANOVA was performed prior to direct comparisons with a Bonferroni multiple comparisons post hoc test in Prism. To assay motor learning in the accelerating rotarod task, linear models were created in Prism, and post hoc comparisons were performed on the slopes and elevations/intercepts of the linear models. To assess PPR, a one phase decay global fit analysis was performed with post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparisons. For analyses including more than three independent variables (e.g., genotype, gender, and target zone for the social preference test), a linear regression model (lm function) was created in R. All meaningful interactions were tested, and significant interactions were included in the final model. Post hoc comparisons were performed with a Bonferroni multiple comparisons test in R (pairwise.t.test function with p.adj = “bonf”). Tests involving success rates (proportions) were analyzed using the N–1 Chi–Square test (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://measuringu.com/ab-cal/">https://measuringu.com/ab–cal/</ext-link>). Tests involving only one independent variable (genotype) for the comparison of two groups were analyzed using the unpaired Student’s t test. For the proteomics immunoblot follow–up, a ratio paired t test was performed to compare the littermate pairs. The analysis of dendritic spine density was performed using a linear regression model in R (modeling density as a function of the mouse number, neuron number, and genotype) to control for similarities between spine densities acquired from the same neuron or mouse; this was similar for the electron microscopy–based measurements.</p>
<p id="P64">For proteomic analyses, the normalized and imputed dataset was subjected to a moderated F–test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Smyth, 2004</xref>), followed by Benjamini–Hochberg Procedure correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. We drew an arbitrary cutoff at adjusted p value &lt; 0.05 to identify proteins that significantly differed in at least one group. To consistently analyze <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice independently, unpaired t tests identified differences between groups. The heatmap shows the log<sub>2</sub> fold change compared to the common reference and was clustered using one minus Pearson correlation metric (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/</ext-link>). For phosphoproteomic analyses, kinase–substrate pairs enriched in the dataset were identified using the Phoxtrack tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>). Phoxtrack scores for kinase–substrate sets were reported and plotted if the p value for their enrichment in either the <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− groups was less than 0.05. To visualize how phosphorylation site occupancy changed compared to protein levels, we plotted the mean log<sub>2</sub> fold change of the protein level and the phosphosite level for each pair using data from the proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis.</p>

<p id="P81">(A) (Middle) In the social preference task, a test mouse (brown) is placed in an open field with a male stranger mouse (gray) and an object (Duplo blocks, similar color and size as the stranger mouse). (Left) Test mice that display social preference spend more time with the stranger mouse relative to the object. (Right) Test mice that display no preference spend equal time with the stranger mouse and object. Target zones are designated by the gray dotted circles.</p>
<p id="P82">(B and C) <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− (B) and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− (C) mice did not show preference for the stranger mouse (Str.) relative to the object (Obj.), whereas WT mice displayed normal social preference. A linear regression with post hoc Bonf MC test identified differences (n = 10–18 littermate pairs).</p>
<p id="P83">(D and E) The difference in occupancy time between the social and nonsocial zones showed that <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− (D) and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− (E) mice had reduced preference for the social zone compared to sex–matched WT littermates. RM two–way ANOVA with post hoc Bonf MC test identified differences (n = 10–18 littermate pairs).</p>
<p id="P84">(F and I) <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− (F) and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− (I) mice of both sexes had a shorter latency to fall off of the accelerating rotarod than WT littermates. RM two–way ANOVA with post hoc Bonf MC test identified differences (n = 11–14 littermate pairs).</p>
<p id="P85">(G and H) Male (G) and female (H) <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice had a shorter latency to fall off of the accelerating rotarod than WT littermates in every trial (difference in intercepts), but all groups learned at a rate of 40 s per trial (no difference in slopes).</p>
<p id="P86">(J and K) Male (J) and female (K) <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice showed impaired motor learning (significant or suggestive difference in slopes) compared to WT littermates. Male and female WT mice learned at a rate of 32 and 33 s per trial, respectively; male and female <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice learned at a rate of 14 and 18 s per trial, respectively.

<p id="P102">(C and D) <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice had decreased AMPAR–mEPSC amplitude (C, left) and frequency (D, left). <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice also had decreased NMDAR–mEPSC amplitude (C, right) and frequency (D, right). <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice trended toward decreased NMDAR–mEPSC amplitude (C, right) and had decreased NMDAR–mEPSC frequency (D, right).</p>
<p id="P103">(E) Representative traces of AMPAR– and NMDAR–mEPSCs from WT, <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/−, and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− L5 PNs in the motor cortex (M1).</p>
<p id="P104">(F and G) <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice showed no difference in AMPAR– (F) or NMDAR–mEPSC (G) decay time. <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice showed no difference in AMPAR–mEPSC decay time (F) but increased NMDAR–mEPSC decay time (G). To consistently analyze <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice independently, unpaired t tests identified differences between groups (n = 28–36 neurons from 5–7 mice per group).</p>
<p id="P105">(H) Representative traces of eEPSCs from WT, <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/, and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− L5 PNs in the motor cortex (M1) evoked by paired–pulse stimulation of M1 layer 2/3.</p>
<p id="P106">(I) An increase in the paired–pulse ratio was observed in <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice, suggesting a deficit in presynaptic release probability. A one–phase decay global fit analysis identified differences between groups. Post hoc Bonf MC test indicated that <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− was significantly different from WT at35* and 60** ms (p = 0.07 at 300 ms), and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− was significantly different from WT at 35****, 60****, 100***, and 300** ms (p = 0.18 at 200 ms; n = 20–26 neurons from 5–7 mice per group).</p>
<p id="P107">(J) <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice had impaired LTP in the motor cortex, showing only slight induction and no potentiation compared to WT controls. LTP was induced at 0 min. RM two–way ANOVA with post hoc Bonf MC test identified differences (n = 9–11 neurons from ≥6 mice per group).</p>

<p id="P109">(A) Heatmap illustrating the log<sub>2</sub> fold change (FC) of select proteins compared to WT quantified by mass–spectrometry–based proteomics. All selected proteins were reduced in the motor cortex of <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− mice compared to WT.</p>
<p id="P110">(B) Representative immunoblots for selected proteins in the cortex are shown for male <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− and WT mice (P42); bands of interest are marketed by arrows (single band) or brackets (multiple bands).</p>
<p id="P111">(C) PDE4D, CHC, PDE4A, and PAK4 protein levels were reduced in the cortex of <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− mice relative to WT littermates.</p>
<p id="P112">(D and E) PDE4A5 protein levels were reduced in the cortex of <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− (D) and <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− (E) mice. Representative immunoblots are shown. Ratio paired t test identified differences (n = 6 littermate pairs).</p>
<p id="P113">(F) Scatterplot representing the average log<sub>2</sub> FC compared to WT for PKA substrates detected in the kinase–substrate pair enrichment analysis. The log<sub>2</sub> FCs at phosphorylation sites are plotted against the log<sub>2</sub> FCs of the respective protein levels. Each color represents a distinct PKA substrate phosphorylation site; half circles represent <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>+/− data, and open circles represent <italic>NEX–Trio</italic>−/− data.</p>
<p id="P114">(G) Representative immunofluorescence images of <italic>Trio</italic><sup>+/flox</sup> neurons transfected with just GFP (WT) or GFP–P2A–Cre (Cre<italic>–Trio</italic>+/−; top) for 6 days. A subset of neurons was treated with PDE4A5 overexpression (middle) or 100 μM Rp–cAMPS (bottom). Scale bar represents 5 mm.</p>
<p id="P115">(H) Dendritic spine density was increased in Cre–positive <italic>Trio</italic><sup>+/flox</sup> neurons, and this was rescued with overexpression (o/e) of PDE4A5 for 6 days or treatment with 100 mM Rp–cAMPS for 3 days. Unpaired t tests identified differences between groups (n = 15–21 dendrite segments from R3 cells per group).</p>
