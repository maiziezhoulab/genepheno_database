<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and communication, but precisely which AVP cell groups are involved is largely unknown. To address whether the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct in AVP-iCre-positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and increased urine marking (UM) in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex differences in social behavioral function.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Despite over thirty years of indirect evidence implicating sexually-dimorphic arginine vasopressin (AVP) cells within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the control of social and anxiety-related behavior in mammals, the function of these cells has never been directly tested. Here, we show that deletion of these cells in male, but not female, mice reduce investigation of same-sex conspecifics and alter social communication without changing aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. Although AVP cell deletion in the BNST did not alter male copulatory behavior, it impaired female sexual behavior. These results indicate that sexually-dimorphic AVP cells in the BNST drive specific aspects of sexually-differentiated social investigation, behavior, and communication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social behavior and communication show profound sex differences in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Darwin, 1871</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Bradbury and Vehrencamp, 1998</xref>), and in humans, dysfunction in social behavior and communication is prominent in chronic, debilitating, and pervasive psychopathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Insel, 2010</xref>) that show sex differences in prevalence and clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Halladay et al., 2015</xref>), such as autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Schultz, 2005</xref>). One reasonable hypothesis is that sex differences in the underlying neural circuitry contribute to sexually differentiated function and dysfunction in social behavior and communication. A particularly well-positioned circuit in this respect is the arginine vasopressin (AVP) innervation of the brain, which shows marked sex differences across many species, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Goodson and Bass, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">De Vries and Panzica, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">de Vries, 2008</xref>). Research across taxa confirms an important role for AVP in social behavior. For example, AVP has been implicated in aggression, pair bonding, maternal behavior, and communication across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Goodson and Bass, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Albers, 2012</xref>). However, the anatomy of AVP projections suggests that AVP control of social behavior is complex and, in most cases, the anatomic substrate of AVP’s control of social behavior is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Kelly and Goodson, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Ludwig and Stern, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Dumais and Veenema, 2016</xref>). In most animals, AVP is synthesized in several cell groups, each of which projecting to distinct brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">De Vries and Boyle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Rood and De Vries, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Rood et al., 2013</xref>). AVP cells in the medial amygdala (MeA) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) contribute to the most pronounced sex differences in AVP innervation in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">De Vries and Boyle, 1998</xref>). For example, male rats and mice have about two to three times as many AVP cells as females in these nuclei and the projections of these cells to areas such as lateral septum (LS) are denser as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">van Leeuwen et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Rood and De Vries, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Rood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Otero-Garcia et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Various studies suggest that AVP cells in the BNST and MeA modulate pro-social as well as antagonistic behaviors. In birds, for example, partial knock-down of AVP gene expression in the BNST reduces prosocial vocalizations and social interactions in birds while increasing male-male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Kelly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Kelly and Goodson, 2013a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">b</xref>). Evidence for involvement of AVP projections from the BNST and MeA in social behavior in mammals is less direct. For example, the density of AVP fibers in BNST and MeA projection areas and c-Fos activation in AVP cells in the BNST correlate negatively with aggression in male mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Compaan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Everts et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Ebner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Beiderbeck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">Veenema et al., 2010</xref>) but positively with prosocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Goodson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Ho et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, injecting specific V1a receptor agonists or boosting V1a receptor expression in target areas of AVP cells in the BNST and MeA promotes affiliation in voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">Wang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Pitkow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Lim and Young, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Lim et al., 2004</xref>) and social recognition and active social behaviors in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Dantzer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">Veenema et al., 2012</xref>). In rats, where AVP release in the septum, one of the most prominent projection areas of BNST and MeA AVP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">De Vries and Buijs, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">De Vries and Panzica, 2006</xref>), correlates positively with intermale aggression in a resident-intruder test, a behavioral response could be blocked by retro-dialysis of an AVP antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">Veenema et al., 2010</xref>). None of these results, however, can be tied with certainty to AVP cells in the BNST and MeA, as all these areas receive AVP input from other sources as well, most importantly the PVN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Rood et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, AVP released dendritically from neurosecretory neurons in the hypothalamus may reach these areas as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Ludwig and Stern, 2015</xref>). To directly test the hypothesis that AVP cells in the BNST modulate social behavior, we injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) with a Cre-dependent, genetically modified executioner caspase-3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">Unger et al., 2015</xref>) into the BNST of adult AVP-iCre+ and AVP-iCre– (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Mieda et al., 2015</xref>) male and female mice, which specifically deleted AVP cells in the area, and tested the effects of these deletions on social investigation, courtship ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Chabout et al., 2015</xref>), and territorial urine marking (UM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Arakawa et al., 2008b</xref>), all aspects of mouse communication known to show pronounced sex differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Crawley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Lehmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">Wöhr, 2014</xref>).</p>

<p>All mice were maintained at 22°C on a 12/12 h reverse light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum, housed in individually ventilated cages (Animal Care Systems), and provided with corncob bedding, a nestlet square, and a housing tube. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Georgia State University animal care committee regulations and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p>
<sec id="s3A1">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Founding AVP-iCre mice were obtained from Dr. Michihiro Mieda (Kanazawa University, Japan). These mice were generated using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) that expressed codon-improved Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Shimshek et al., 2002</xref>) under the transcriptional control of the AVP promoter (AVP-iCre mice). In these animals, iCre expression is found in the BNST and the MeA, as well as in hypothalamic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Mieda et al., 2015</xref>). Subjects were derived by crossing heterozygous iCre+ mutants to wildtype C57Bl/6J mice and genotyped (ear punch) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 21–24 d of age (Transnetyx). Both iCre+ and iCre– littermates were used in behavioral experiments. All subject mice were singly-housed for a minimum of one week.</p>

<title>Stimulus animals</title>
<p>CD1(ICR) (Charles River Laboratories) mice were used as stimuli for behavioral testing and to provide male and female subjects with social experience because strain differences between subjects and stimulus mice increase social investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Gheusi et al., 1994</xref>). Mice were used at 9–16 weeks of age and were novel and unrelated to the subject to which they were exposed.</p>
<p>Female stimulus mice were group-housed, ovariectomized, and implanted with an estradiol capsule (GDX+E), and given two sexual experiences before testing. Two groups of stimulus males were used for behavioral testing. Mice that were used as subordinate mice in the home cage aggression tests and for providing aggressive experience to subjects, were group housed, gonadectomized (GDX), and subjected to two aggressive encounters with a dominant male. Mice in the second group, which provided sexual experience to female subjects and served as sexual partners during copulatory tests and as stimulus animal in the three-chamber social test, were singly-housed, GDX, and implanted with testosterone (GDX+T), and given two sexual experiences before testing.</p>

Gonadectomy, group housing, and social defeat of our subordinates reduce offensive aggression in mice, while GDX+T male urine provides subjects with a male urinary cue that elicits offensive aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Beeman, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Connor and Winston, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">Van Loo et al., 2001</xref>). Subordinate stimulus males were placed in the subject’s home cage and removed after the subject’s first offensive attack (biting) within a 10-min period. All subject males attacked the intruder male stimulus by the second encounter, and all subordinate stimulus males displayed submissive behavior, defined as defensive postures (e.g., on-back), fleeing, and non-social exploring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Koolhaas et al., 2013</xref>). Female subjects were exposed to a female intruder; however, this did not elicit any attacks from either animal.</p>

<title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>All testing occurred within the first 6 h of the dark cycle under red light illumination, with the exception of the elevated plus maze (EPM). All tests were scored by an experimenter blind to the genotype of the subject. Three to four weeks after viral injections, subjects were habituated to the testing room and apparatus by handling and placing mice (for 5 min) in the three-chamber apparatus (see below) each day for 3 d. On experimental days, subjects were adapted to the experimental room for 15 min before testing. First, we tested mice on an EPM to test for anxiety-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Lister, 1987</xref>). Mice were then tested in the three-chamber apparatus over six consecutive days with a day off on the fourth day. Lastly, odor discrimination, copulatory, and aggressive behavior were measured in the subject’s home cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Female subjects were tested irrespective of estrous cycle day, except during copulation testing, when they were in behavioral estrus. Prior research indicates minimal effects of estrous cycle on female mouse communicative behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Maggio and Whitney, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Coquelin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Moncho-Bogani et al., 2004</xref>). Following testing, subjects were killed and their brain tissue was processed for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to detect AVP expression in BNST and nearby hypothalamic areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3F">
<title>Social behavior</title>
<p>USV, UM, and social investigation were recorded in an acrylic three-chamber apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Crawley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Arakawa et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Moy et al., 2009</xref>; Harvard Apparatus; dimensions: 20.3 × 42 × 22 cm). Instead of a solid floor, the apparatus was placed on absorbent paper (Nalgene Versi-dry paper, Thermo Fisher Scientific) so as to accurately measure UM. Animals were also tracked using motion detection software (ANY-maze, San Diego Instruments, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014289">SCR_014289</ext-link>). During testing with stimulus animals, subjects had access to either a stimulus animal in a cage [8 cm (D), 18 cm (H); 3-mm diameter steel bars, 7.4 mm spacing] or an empty cage placed at opposite corners of the outermost chambers of the apparatus. For testing with social odors, subjects had access to 50 μl of fresh urine from a stimulus animal or 50-μl saline pipetted onto a clean piece of filter paper (3 cm<sup>2</sup>), that was taped on the outside of cages. The location of stimulus and the “clean” cage were counterbalanced across animals. After placing the subject in the center of the middle chamber, we measured, across a 5-min trial, close investigation of clean and stimulus cages, distance traveled throughout the apparatus, time spent in the stimulus and clean cage chambers as well as USVs and UMs. After testing, the apparatus and cages were thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol and allowed to dry before further testing. In all cases, urine stimulus from one sex was presented first followed by a live stimulus of that same sex; this order was then repeated for the opposite sex. In this fashion, mice experienced first weak (urine) then stronger social stimuli (stimulus animal; the order of male and female stimuli presentation was counterbalanced.</p>
<sec id="s3F7">
<title>Investigation and USVs</title>
<p>Close investigation was defined as time spent sniffing within 2 cm of the stimulus or clean cage; climbing on the cage was not scored as investigation. USVs were detected using a condenser microphone connected to an amplifier (UltraSoundGate CM16/CMPA, 10–200 kHz, frequency range) placed 4 cm inside the apparatus and directly above the center compartment. USVs were sampled at 200 kHz (16-bit) with target frequency set to 70 kHz (UltraSoundGate 116Hb, Avisoft Bioacoustics). Recordings were then analyzed using a MATLAB (MathWorks, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>) plug-in that automates USV analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">Van Segbroeck et al., 2017</xref>). Using this program, sonograms were generated by calculating the power spectrum on Hamming windowed data and then transformed into compact acoustic feature representations (Gammatone Filterbank). Each 200-ms window containing the maximum USV syllable duration was then clustered, via machine learning algorithms, into USV syllable types (repertoire units) based on time-frequency USV shape. Repertoire units that appeared as background noise were discarded. We counted the number of all USV produced by each subject. USV syllable types were identified from a subset of males (iCre– <italic>n</italic> = 6; iCre+ <italic>n</italic> = 7) using criterion previously described: short, composite, downward, upward, 1 frequency jump, modulated, multiple frequency jumps, u-shape, flat, chevron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Hanson and Hurley, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3F8">
<title>UM</title>
<p>Following testing, the substrate sheet was allowed to dry for 1 h and then sprayed with ninhydrin fixative (LC-NIN-16; Tritech Forensics Inc.) to visualize urine marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Meyer, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Lehmann et al., 2013</xref>). After 24 h, sheets were imaged (Sony DSC-S700 camera), binarized and analyzed using a computer-aided imaging software (ImageJ, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>). UM was measured as the total area (cm<sup>2</sup>) of visualized ninhydrin urine marks in the entire arena. Urine marks that were larger than 6 cm<sup>2</sup> and directed toward corners were counted as eliminative “pools” and were counted separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Bishop and Chevins, 1987</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3F9">
<title>Copulatory and aggressive behavior</title>
<p>To measure copulatory behavior, the stimulus mouse was placed in the subject’s home cage and then removed 5 min after one ejaculation had occurred or if 90 min had elapsed without copulation. The latency and total time investigating the anogenital region, latency to mount, percentage of females that were mounted, percentage of male ejaculations, and number of mount rejections (female kicking male off during mounting attempt) in female subjects was recorded. To measure territorial aggression, subordinate stimulus males were placed in the subject’s home cage and then removed after the subject’s first offensive attack (biting) within a 10-min period; the latency to first bite was recorded.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s3G">
<title>Odor discrimination</title>
<p>We used a habituation-discrimination procedure on a subset of subjects to test whether they could distinguish between social odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Baum and Keverne, 2002</xref>). Subjects were given five consecutive 2-min presentations of an odor stimulus with one min intervals between presentations. Subjects were first presented with deionized water, followed by two non-social odors (100% almond, lemon, or vanilla extract, Frontier Natural Products), and then two urine samples (one from each sex) within their home cage. The sequence of odor presentation was counterbalanced within non-social or social odor category. Each odor stimulus (30 μl) was placed onto a clean piece of filter paper (3 cm<sup>2</sup>) taped to an empty food hopper such that subjects could contact the urine samples. Time spent sniffing within 2 cm of the filter paper was recorded. Food hoppers were cleaned with 70% ethanol and allowed to dry between each odor presentation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3H">
<title>EPM</title>
<p>The EPM consisted of two open arms (30 × 5 cm) and two closed arms (30 × 25 × 5 cm) crossed perpendicularly and raised 60 cm above the floor. Subjects were placed at the arm intersection facing the open arm and were allowed to habituate to the apparatus for 1 min; subjects were then observed for an additional 5 min. Animals were tracked by ANY-maze so that measurements of time spent in open and closed arms were recorded automatically whereas the number of risk assessment behaviors (stretch-attend posture, head-dips) were manually scored from video (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Cole and Rodgers, 1993</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3I">
<title>Urine collection</title>
<p>Pooled urine samples were collected from stimulus females induced into estrus and from stimulus males (five to eight mice per sample). Estrous state was verified by color, swelling, and expanded size of vaginal opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Caligioni, 2009</xref>). To collect urine, mice were picked up by the tail base and held by dorsal neck skin; this method was often sufficient to induce urination. If the mouse did not urinate, stroking its belly from an anterior to posterior direction stimulated bladder voiding. Each mouse provided 15–50 μl of urine that was pooled into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Urine samples were used fresh within 1 h of collection to prevent chemosignal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Roullet et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Histology and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</title>
<p>Following testing, subjects were killed via CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation. Brains were extracted and flash frozen via submersion in 2-methyl-2-butanol (Sigma) for 10–20 s and stored at −80°C until sectioned. Coronal sections (20 μm) were cut with a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S, Leica Biosystems) into three series and stored at −80°C. All tissue was handled in a RNase-free environment. Tissue was postfixed in paraformaldehyde, followed by a wash in 2× saline-sodium citrate (SSC) and acetylation in a triethanolamine/acetic anhydride solution, rinsed in dH<sub>2</sub>O, washed in acetone/methanol solutions (1:1), and again in 2× SSC. Tissue was first incubated at 65°C in hybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 1% yeast tRNA, 10% dextran sulphate, 1× Denhardt’s solution, 5% 20× SSC) for 30 min before probe application. Riboprobes were developed from linearized PK Bluescript SK(+) with inserted mouse-vasopressin gene (NM_027106.4, Genscript) using digoxygenin (DIG)-conjugated uracil. Riboprobe synthesized from this plasmid was added to hybridization buffer at a concentration of 100 ng/100 μl and denatured at 90°C for 5 min. Tissue was then hybridized at 65°C for 24 h in a humid chamber. The tissue was then subjected to two 10-min washes in 2× SSC at room temperature followed by a 15-min digestion with RNase A (10 g/ml in 2× SSC) at 37°C. This was followed by a 30-min 2× SSC wash at 56°C and two 10-min 2× SSC washes at room temperature. The tissue was then quenched in 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 1× SSC for 15 min, rinsed twice in 1× SSC with 0.1% Tween followed by one 5-min TBS (20 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) wash. Blocking solution (normal sheep serum and bovine caesin) was applied and tissue was incubated for 30 min followed by a 2-h, room temperature incubation with anti-DIG-HRP (1:200, Roche Applied Sciences). Unbound antibody was washed away with three 10-min washes in TBS-T (0.05% Tween in TBS). DIG-labeled probe signal was amplified and visualized using a TSA Plus Fluorescein kit (PerkinElmer) by incubating sections in a 1:50 dilution of the Fluorescein working solution for 12 min followed by three 10-min washes in TBS. Tissue was then cover-slipped using Prolong Gold (Life Technologies) for subsequent imaging and tissue analysis. Tissue processed using sense RNA probe generated no specific labeling. A subset of brain sections was Nissl stained to determine whether viral vector injections resulted in a non-specific loss of BNST cells.</p>

<sec id="s3K">
<title>Tissue analysis</title>
<p>Bilateral images were taken at 10× magnification using a Zeiss Axio Imager.M2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging), which transferred fluorescent images (FITC contrast reflector) to image analysis software (Stereo Investigator, MicroBrightField, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002526">SCR_002526</ext-link>). Imaging domains (2 mm<sup>2</sup>) were placed with reference to anatomic landmarks (ventricles, fiber tracts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Paxinos and Franklin, 2012</xref>). Fluorescently labeled AVP mRNA-expressing cells were counted in the BNST in both hemispheres and averaged over three sections covering the extent of the AVP cell population in the BNST. In addition, we counted nearby accessory AVP mRNA expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Rood and De Vries, 2011</xref>) as well as average label intensity for AVP mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN; ImageJ) to determine any possible off-target effects of our injections. Although we counted AVP mRNA-expressing cells in the PVN as well, AVP mRNA label intensity was chosen as the preferred method for quantification due to the difficulty of discriminating between overlapping AVP cells in PVN. Lastly, we Nissl stained and imaged BNST tissue at 20× magnification to confirm no significant cell loss.</p>

<sec id="s3L">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data were analyzed and graphed in R (3.4.4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">R Core Team, 2017</xref>). Histology, social investigation, movement, UM (in male subjects), odor discrimination, and EPM data met the assumptions of parametric statistical tests. Therefore, we analyzed histologic data with <italic>t</italic> tests and data on social investigation, movement (distance traveled, time in chambers containing stimulus and clean cages) and male UM with mixed-model ANOVAs [between-subject factor: genotype (iCre+, iCre–); within-subject factors: sex of stimulus (male, female); preference for stimulus (stimulus, clean) followed by <italic>t</italic> tests assessing genotype effects]. Total distance traveled within the apparatus was analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA (between-subject factor: genotype; within-subject factor: sex of stimulus) as was time spent in open/closed arms in the EPM test (between-subject factor: genotype; within-subject factor: arm); effects of genotype on additional anxiety behaviors (stretch-attend, head-dips) were analyzed using <italic>t</italic> tests. We determined whether subjects could discriminate between odors by comparing odor investigation on the last trial for one odor and odor investigation on the first trial of the subsequent odor using paired <italic>t</italic> tests. The number of female UMs, USVs, USV syllable type, measures of copulatory behavior, and aggression behavior were not normally distributed and could not be transformed, therefore, we analyzed genotype effects using pairwise Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests. Differences in proportion of animals engaging in copulatory/aggressive behaviors across genotype was assessed using χ<sup>2</sup> tests. All <italic>post hoc</italic> pairwise comparisons report Bonferroni-corrected <italic>p</italic> values and Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> for effect size when statistically significant. Results were considered significant if <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. All statistical tests are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Injection of a viral vector encoding a Cre-dependent cell-death construct into the BNST highly effectively reduced AVP cell numbers in both iCre+ males and females, which had only 10% of the number found in iCre– subjects (males: <italic>t</italic><sub>(22)</sub> = 4.57, <italic>p</italic> = 0.00014, <italic>d</italic> = 2.64; females: <italic>t</italic><sub>(19)</sub> = 3.58, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0025, <italic>d</italic> = 2.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), without significantly reducing the number of nearby accessory AVP mRNA-expressing cells (males: <italic>t</italic><sub>(22)</sub> = –0.16, <italic>p</italic> = 0.98; females: <italic>t</italic><sub>(19)</sub> = –0.15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.89; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>) or total level of AVP mRNA label in the PVN (males: <italic>t</italic><sub>(20)</sub> = 0.66, <italic>p</italic> = 0.947; females: <italic>t</italic><sub>(19)</sub> = –1.10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.29; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>), suggesting that there were no significant off-target effects.

Two iCre+ males and two iCre+ females were removed from the analysis as their AVP cell numbers in the BNST were &gt;3 standard deviations above the mean, which we interpreted as off-target injections. Two additional iCre+ females were removed due to unilateral AVP cell loss in the PVN.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that deletion of the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the BNST significantly affected social behavior in males, reducing social investigation of other males and increasing UM in the presence of a female. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP BNST cells, similar deletions minimally affected social behavior and communication. This is the first time that direct alteration of a male-biased, sexually-dimorphic population of neuropeptidergic cells has caused a sex difference in mammalian social responses. While several studies have directly tested the social function of sexually-dimorphic cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">Scott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">Unger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">Wei et al., 2018</xref>), only one has found a strong sex difference in social behavior tied to an anatomic sexual dimorphism, in this case a female-biased one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). Our results indicate that sex differences in AVP cells in the BNST contributes to sexually dimorphic components of social communication.</p>
<p>Our experiments do not allow us to conclude that removal of AVP production in the BNST, by and of itself, caused the behavioral effects observed in this study. Lesioning AVP cells also removed all other neuroactive substances co-expressed by these cells, for example, galanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Miller et al., 1993</xref>), which also has been implicated in control of social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, our behavioral results may be due to depletion of AVP, or of co-transmitters from BNST projections, or both. Our finding of reduced male-male investigation following BNST AVP cell deletion, however, is strikingly similar to the effects of RNA interference for the homologous peptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) in the BNST of territorial finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Kelly and Goodson, 2013b</xref>) and suggests that this effect is mainly due to a reduction of AVP signal from the BNST.</p>
<p>Our cell deletion approach is, by design, permanent, and so behavioral effects may reflect molecular, cellular, and anatomic adjustments or compensations to chronic depletion of AVP cells in the BNST. Indeed, long-term pharmacological reduction of V1a receptor activity in the LS, a key target of AVP cells in the BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">De Vries and Panzica, 2006</xref>), produces different changes in behavior than acute receptor blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Liebsch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Everts and Koolhaas, 1999</xref>). A lack of an effect on a behavior, therefore, does not exclude involvement of these cells in that behavior. Nevertheless, our findings of male-specific alterations in social interactions and communication following deletion of AVP cells in the BNST strongly indicate that in males these cells are critical for these functions.</p>
<p>One of the strongest effects of deletion of AVP cells in the BNST was the reduction of same-sex social investigation, which we found in males but not in females. Importantly, this reduction was not due to a lack of general social interest, as investigation of females was unchanged. It was not due to changes in general chemosensory function or motor behavior either, as odor habituation or discrimination of non-social odors and detection of social odors (male or female urine) was unaffected and measures of general activity were also not changed. This reduction can also not be explained by a general increase in anxiety-like behaviors, because the lesions did not affect behavior in the anxiogenic EPM. Instead, it suggests that one function of AVP cells in the BNST is to generate male-typical approach, investigation, and assessment of potential territorial competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Oldfield et al., 2015</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that knocking down AVT mRNA in the BNST of territorial birds reduces social contact with other males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Kelly and Goodson, 2013b</xref>), and that overexpression of V1a receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Landgraf et al., 2003</xref>) or AVP injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Koolhaas et al., 1991</xref>) in the LS, a key target for AVP projections from the BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">De Vries and Panzica, 2006</xref>), increases active male-male interactions and aggressive behavior in rats. Indeed, retrodialysis of V1aR antagonist into the LS of male rats blocks further territorial aggression during repeated resident-intruder tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">Veenema et al., 2010</xref>). Our finding that deleting AVP cells in the BNST reduced investigation of potential competitors is consistent with these findings. Our failure to see a change in aggressive behavior is not. One explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that AVP from other sources contribute to stimulating effects on aggressive behavior in areas such as the LS. For example, AVP cells in the MeA show similar dimorphisms as BNST cells and project to overlapping areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">De Vries and Panzica, 2006</xref>). Lesioning both cell groups may be necessary to identify all behaviors in which these sexually dimorphic cell groups are critically involved. Nevertheless, AVP cells in the BNST appear to be required for the proactive investigation of credible social threats rather than for offensive aggression per se.</p>
<p>Ablation of AVP cells in the BNST of male, but not female, mice strongly increased UM toward females, suggesting that these cells normally suppress male scent marking toward females. This increase in UM is not due to excessive eliminative urination because it was not observed toward male stimuli nor was it manifested as an increase in pooled urine. It is possible that this increase is simply due to increased proximity and interest in females. However, males with deletions of AVP cells in the BNST did not differ from control animals in time spent investigating female stimuli, making this explanation less likely. Although UM strongly depends on chemosensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Maruniak et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Labov and Wysocki, 1989</xref>), the increase in UM by lesioned males was not driven primarily by female urine cues because marking to female urine was not increased, suggesting that other cues, chemosensory as well as non-chemosensory, may drive this increase in scent marking. Given the metabolic costs of urination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Gosling et al., 2000</xref>) and the increased risks associated with attraction of aggressive competitors and predators toward urine marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Desjardins et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Roberts et al., 2001</xref>), UM should be strongly regulated so that signaling occurs in only specific social contexts. The present results indicate that the BNST-AVP cells may be a key part of the neural system that adaptively regulates this critical signaling behavior.</p>
<p>Although AVP/AVT has been implicated in the production of vocalizations across taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Goodson and Bass, 2001</xref>), deleting the AVP cells in the BNST did not significantly alter the production of USVs in a reproductive context. This is consistent with the few studies examining male courtship vocalizations (in birds) that report no effect of central infusions of AVT or V1a antagonists on female-directed singing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Goodson and Adkins-Regan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Goodson and Evans, 2004</xref>) or got mixed results from antisense knock-down of BNST-AVP, with one study finding no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Kelly et al., 2011</xref>) and another observing decreased singing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Kelly and Goodson, 2013b</xref>). Most other studies supporting a role for AVP/AVT in vocalizations have not identified the relevant neuroanatomical source of the peptide or its locus of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Wilczynski et al., 2017</xref>) or tended to focus on stress-related or aggressive vocalizations across development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">Winslow and Insel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Bleickardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Iijima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Lukas and Wöhr, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Paul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Freeman et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study also points to a limited, sexually dimorphic role of BNST AVP cells in reproductive behavior. Removal of these cells in males did not alter copulatory behavior, which is consistent with the absence of copulatory deficits in whole-animal knock-outs of V1a or V1b receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Wersinger et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">2007</xref>). However, unexpectedly, ablating these cells in females delayed, and reduced the number of times they were mounted by males. This effect may represent reduced attractiveness of the female or an increased rejection of the male. The latter possibility seems less likely, as we did not detect any change in male investigation toward lesioned females, nor did such females reject males more frequently. It is possible that these females show decreases in cryptic proceptive and/or receptive behaviors. Although AVP has been implicated in female rat sexual behavior, the pattern of prior results is opposite to our findings: in rats, AVP reduced, whereas V1a receptor antagonists increased, female sexual behavior in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">Södersten et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Pedersen and Boccia, 2006</xref>). However, as in these studies peptides were injected into the lateral ventricle, it is unclear with what AVP system they interacted.</p>
<p>Although central AVP has been repeatedly implicated in the generation of anxiety states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Ebner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Bielsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Raggenbass, 2008</xref>), we did not observe changes in anxiety-like behavior of lesioned males or females in a non-social anxiogenic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Hogg, 1996</xref>). This is somewhat surprising because AVP in the LS, an important target of the BNST AVP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">De Vries and Panzica, 2006</xref>), controls anxious states. For example, injections of AVP or V1aR antagonists, or V1aR knock-down within LS all support the idea that AVP is anxiogenic at this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Landgraf et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Liebsch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Beiderbeck et al., 2007</xref>). However, since large lesions of BNST have no effect on anxiety-like behavior in the EPM task either (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Treit et al., 1998</xref>), it may simply mean that, as with aggressive behavior, AVP cells in the BNST are not critically involved in anxiety-like behaviors, and that AVP derived from other sources, such as the PVN or the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Rood et al., 2013</xref>), also drive AVP’s anxiogenic action in the septum and elsewhere.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A growing body of literature indicates that vasopressin plays a sexually dimorphic role in control of social and anxiety-related behaviors. In humans, for example, intranasal vasopressin stimulates reciprocation of cooperation in males and conciliatory behavior in females, while activating brain areas implicated in reward, social bonding, arousal and memory in males, but not in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Rilling et al., 2014</xref>). In hamsters, hypothalamic injections of vasopressin stimulate aggression in males, while reducing it in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">Terranova et al., 2016</xref>). In mice, a genetic knock-out of the vasopressin V1a receptor gene reduces anxiety-related behaviors in males, but not in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Bielsky et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2005</xref>). In rats, a V1a antagonist reduces social play in males while increasing them in females when injected intracerebroventricularly, but has the exact opposite effect when injected into the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">Veenema et al., 2013</xref>). Although, these studies clearly point at a sexually dimorphic role of vasopressin and its cognate receptor in behavior, they do not identify which AVP system is involved, and the opposite effects in play behavior, depending on the area injected, suggests that more than one system may be involved. By targeting a specific AVP cell group directly, our study has identified the sexually dimorphic AVP cells in the BNST as contributing to sex differences in social behavior, and has shown the feasibility of following a similar approach in identifying the contributions of other AVP systems in the brain as well.</p>

<p>This manuscript uses a cre-dependent caspase expressing AAV to ablate vasopressin producing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and reports the effects on behavior in male and female mice. The authors use in situ hybridization to validate selective vasopressin knock-down with the bed nucleus and assess behavior across an impressive series of behavioral analyses. Surprisingly, the authors find that the behavioral effects are limited to social approach and scent marking in a sex-dependent fashion: deletion of BNST vasopressin cells leads to a sex-specific actions on social and sexual behaviors: BNST vasopressin deficient males exhibit decreased social investigation of same-sex conspecifics and increased urine marking toward opposite sex conspecifics, whereas BNST vasopressin deficient females exhibit deficits in sex behavior. These results are exciting because the majority of studies assessing the functional effects of vasopressin have relied on pharmacological approaches that target V1a receptors, and so the source of vasopressin is usually unknown. This study introduces a significant advance in the tools used to test the role of individual vasopressin pathways, and represent an important advance in our understanding of population-specific effects of vasopressin neurons. </p>
<p>Both reviewers were enthusiastic about the manuscript and its significance. They offer a number of suggestions for improving the manuscript, primarily by clarifying certain aspects of the methods and results, and by providing additional context and nuance in both the introduction and discussion. Please consider each of the comments below and revise the manuscript accordingly. </p>
<p>Significance Statement</p>
<p>“Despite over thirty years of circumstantial evidence implicating sexually-dimorphic arginine vasopressin (AVP) cells within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the control of social and anxiety-related behavior in mammals, the function of these cells has never been directly tested.” </p>
<p>To me, the use of agonists and antagonists at the projection sites of these cells (e.g., lateral septum), is a fairly good test of the function of these AVP cells and is more than circumstantial evidence. What is unique to this study is the ablation of the cell bodies, which impacts AVP function at all target projections - this has never been done before. Rather than referring to the 30 years of research occurring prior to this study as ‘circumstantial,’ the authors could state precisely how their manipulation is different - manipulation of a specific population of AVP cells rather than targets that could receive input from multiple AVP populations. Also, the authors should be careful with their use of the word cells; cells include axons, aka projections.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The discussion of the literature on vasopressin role in aggression is oversimplified. </p>
<p>1) The authors claim that, unlike hypothalamic vasopressin, BNST vasopressin appears to regulate prosocial behavior rather than aggression. The authors then go on to point out a negative relationship between vasopressin and aggression. Yet a negative association still suggests regulation of aggression - inhibitory regulation. I believe the authors mean that hypothalamic AVP promotes aggression, whereas BNST AVP promotes prosocial behavior. Instead of using the words ‘mediate’ and ‘regulate,’ the authors may want to consider using ‘stimulate’ or ‘promote.’ </p>
<p>2) The authors state that “...release of AVP in the areas that receive BNST projections </p>
<p>correlate negatively with aggression in male mice and rats (Compaan et al., 1993; Everts et al., 1997; Ebner et al., 2000; Beiderbeck et al., 2007; Veenema et al., 2010)...” I believe that Veenema et al. (2010) found a negative correlation of AVP release and aggression in the BNST, but a positive correlation in the lateral septum (a projection of the BNST AVP cells). </p>
<p>Methods and Results</p>
<p>Many parts of the methods section are not written clearly and are difficult to understand. Below are some examples that should be addressed, but the authors may want to consider editing and reorganizing some of the paragraphs/sections to make the methods more readable. </p>
<p>1) I am assuming that the GNX + T stimulus males were used for sex testing with females and GNX - T stimulus males were for male-male aggression tests. If so, it would be helpful to state that explicitly immediately before describing how the gonadectomy and hormone replacement procedures were performed. </p>
<p>2) “...some males were gonadectomized, but did not receive a T implant (GDX + T).” </p>
<p>I am assuming this should be ‘GNX - T’ rather than ‘GNX + T.’ </p>
<p>3) Sexual and Aggressive Experience sections. </p>
<p>It would be easier for the reader if the rationales for the sexual and aggressive experience were moved to the first paragraph under the heading, “Social Experience.” </p>
<p>4) “Subordinate stimulus males were placed in the subject's home cage and removed after the subject's first offensive attack (biting) within a ten-minute period. All subject males defeated the intruder male stimulus by the second experience.” </p>
<p>How were the stimulus males defeated if they were removed after the subject's first offensive attack? What were the criteria for ‘defeat?’ </p>
<p>5) EPM, “Subjects were placed at the arm intersection facing the open arm and were allowed to explore all arms for one minute; subjects were then observed for five minutes.” </p>
<p>How are subjects observed for 5 minutes if they are only allowed to explore the arms for 1 min? </p>
<p>6) Histology Results: What were the criteria for removing the iCre+ animals? It would seem that an outlier analysis would be the most appropriate method for removal of subjects. </p>
<p>7) All Figure Legends: Much of the text in the results is repeated in the figure legends. Consider removing text in the figure legend to eliminate unnecessary redundancy. </p>
<p>8) Figure 2: a) The legend is confusing. It indicates that the color of the bar graphs represents the Cre genotype of the stimulus, but appears to be the Cre stimulus of the test subject. If true, the clean cage stimuli should also be colored according to the Cre genotype of the test subject. b) Consider increasing the scale on the graphs illustrating female investigation (panels b and d). At the current scale, it is difficult to evaluate the data. It can be noted in the figure legend that the scales of male and female test subject graphs are not equivalent and that they were adjusted to facilitate evaluation of the female test subject data. </p>
<p>9) Table 2: The title of Table 2 should not include statistics. In addition, the authors should check the statistics reported in these two parts of the manuscript as they appear to differ - or perhaps further specification of the precise comparison has been left out? </p>
<p>10) Table 1? There is no Table 1. This is important both for the labeling of Table 2 and the reference to Table 1 in the odor discrimination results section. </p>
<p>11) The authors should state what serotype of AAV was used (AAV2, AAV5, etc). </p>
<p>12) The authors should be consistent with how they report ISH results. Either number of cells or fluorescence intensity for all areas quantified. I also think they should correct for the area quantified (eg cells/mm2). </p>
<p>Discussion </p>
<p>1) “While several studies have directly tested the social function of sexually-dimorphic cell populations (Scott et al. 2015; Unger et al. 2015; Wei et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2013), only one has found a strong sex-difference in social behavior tied to an anatomical sexual dimorphism, in this case a female-biased one (Scott et al. 2015).” </p>
<p>This may be technically true, but manipulations of the sexually dimorphic projections of BNST/MeA vasopressin cells in the septum causes a sex difference in social play behavior (Veenema et al. 2013, Bredewold et al. 2014). </p>
<p>2) Given that vasopressin cells in the medial amygdala are thought to project to the same areas as, and act in concert with, BNST vasopressin cells, it is surprising that this is not mentioned in the discussion. This may be particularly important for the negative results. If vasopressin cells were deleted from both the BNST and medial amygdala the effects may have been even greater or more behaviors may have been affected (e.g., EPM). The authors may want to qualify their conclusions regarding the negative results as medial amygdala vasopressin cells may be compensating for the loss of BNST vasopressin cells. </p>
<p>3) Given the uniqueness of the manipulation in how it impacts all target areas rather than just a single target area, the authors may want to include this in the discussion along with mentioning the putative projection areas of the BNST. </p>
<p>4) The authors state that in species with stronger territoriality, increased AVP/V1a receptor expression is observed in the BNST, then go on to state that their results are inconsistent with these previous findings. I'm not sure I agree with this statement. First, the authors state that the hormone status of intruders in resident-intruder tests may have not provoked aggression. Second, AVP originating in the BNST might be more important for driving social approach to intruders than aggression itself. For example, Duque-Wilckens et al. 2016 reported that inhibition of V1a receptors in the BNST reduced social interaction in males but not offensive aggression. </p>
<p>Minor comments</p>
<p>1) The authors should check the results section for typos, such as this case where the authors include an unnecessary ‘t’ (males: t(22) t = 4.57, p = 0.00014).</p>
<p>2) Histology Results: the text refers to the incorrect panels of Figure 1. </p>
<p>3) Has proceptive behavior (eg ear wiggling etc) ever been quantified in female mice? This could be one way that AVP ablation may have affected the rate at which females were mounted by males. </p>
<p>4) Discussion: “Our experiments do not allow us to conclude that specifically removal of AVP production in the BNST caused the behavioral effects observed in this study.” </p>
<p>Awkward phrasing, consider revising.</p>

<title>Author Response</title>
<p>Point-by-point response to reviewers' comments</p>
<p>“Both reviewers were enthusiastic about the manuscript and its significance. They offer a number of suggestions for improving the manuscript, primarily by clarifying certain aspects of the methods and results, and by providing additional context and nuance in both the introduction and discussion. Please consider each of the comments below and revise the manuscript accordingly.” </p>
<p>We thank the editor and reviewers for their insightful comments (pasted below in bold), which, we believe, have allowed us to greatly improve the manuscript. Portions of the manuscript that address reviewer's comments are identified by page and line number in our responses and printed in red. We also made a number of grammatical improvements, which we did not highlight.</p>
<p>Significance Statement </p>
<p>“Despite over thirty years of circumstantial evidence implicating sexually-dimorphic arginine vasopressin (AVP) cells within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the control of social and anxiety-related behavior in mammals, the function of these cells has never been directly tested.” </p>
<p>To me, the use of agonists and antagonists at the projection sites of these cells (e.g., lateral septum), is a fairly good test of the function of these AVP cells and is more than circumstantial evidence. What is unique to this study is the ablation of the cell bodies, which impacts AVP function at all target projections - this has never been done before. Rather than referring to the 30 years of research occurring prior to this study as ‘circumstantial,’ the authors could state precisely how their manipulation is different - manipulation of a specific population of AVP cells rather than targets that could receive input from multiple AVP populations. Also, the authors should be careful with their use of the word cells; cells include axons, aka projections.</p>
<p>We agree that the agonist and antagonist studies strongly support for a role of AVP projections to the BNST in social behavior in mammals. One of the strongest studies, in this respect was the Veenema et al., 2010 study, mentioned by the reviewer in point #2 for the Introduction. We now highlight that study in the Introduction. We also make clearer that none of these studies can identify with certainty which specific AVP cell systems they targeted, because all of the targeted areas get a mixture of AVP inputs. Rather than using ‘circumstantial,’ which may be taken negatively, we now use ‘indirect.’ We also start with the research in birds, as this will make the distinction between direct and indirect evidence clearer.</p>
<p>‘Introduction’ </p>
<p>The discussion of the literature on vasopressin role in aggression is oversimplified. </p>
<p>1) The authors claim that, unlike hypothalamic vasopressin, BNST vasopressin appears to regulate prosocial behavior rather than aggression. The authors then go on to point out a negative relationship between vasopressin and aggression. Yet a negative association still suggests regulation of aggression - inhibitory regulation. I believe the authors mean that hypothalamic AVP promotes aggression, whereas BNST AVP promotes prosocial behavior. Instead of using the words ‘mediate’ and ‘regulate,’ the authors may want to consider using ‘stimulate’ or ‘promote.’ </p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and have changed the text accordingly, now focusing mainly on BNST projections (Page 7, lines 244-252). This version does not use the words ‘mediate’ and ‘regulate’ anymore and indicates the direction of the effect, if appropriate.</p>
<p>“2) The authors state that “...release of AVP in the areas that receive BNST projections correlate negatively with aggression in male mice and rats (Compaan et al., 1993; Everts et al., 1997; Ebner et al., 2000; Beiderbeck et al., 2007; Veenema et al., 2010)...” I believe that Veenema et al. (2010) found a negative correlation of AVP release and aggression in the BNST, but a positive correlation in the lateral septum (a projection of the BNST AVP cells).”</p>
<p>Thank you for catching this. We have corrected this and now give special attention to the Veenema et al., 2010 paper (see our response above) (Page 7, lines 248-264).</p>
<p>Methods and Results </p>
<p>Many parts of the methods section are not written clearly and are difficult to understand. Below are some examples that should be addressed, but the authors may want to consider editing and reorganizing some of the paragraphs/sections to make the methods more readable. </p>
<p>1) I am assuming that the GNX + T stimulus males were used for sex testing with females and GNX - T stimulus males were for male-male aggression tests. If so, it would be helpful to state that explicitly immediately before describing how the gonadectomy and hormone replacement procedures were performed. </p>
<p>We have moved the description of stimulus animals and how they were generated to the section on Stimulus Animals and have deleted redundant text (Page 9, lines 295-302) We have revised this sentence. We also carefully screened the entire Materials and Methods sections and edited sections to make them clearer.</p>
<p>2) “...some males were gonadectomized, but did not receive a T implant (GDX + T).” I am assuming this should be ‘GNX - T’ rather than ‘GNX + T.’ </p>
<p>This is now corrected (Page 11, lines 327-328). </p>
<p>3) Sexual and Aggressive Experience sections. </p>
<p>It would be easier for the reader if the rationales for the sexual and aggressive experience were moved to the first paragraph under the heading, “Social Experience.” </p>
<p>We have moved the relevant information under the heading as suggested (Page 11, lines 339-342).</p>
<p>4) “Subordinate stimulus males were placed in the subject's home cage and removed after the subject's first offensive attack (biting) within a ten-minute period. All subject males defeated the intruder male stimulus by the second experience.” How were the stimulus males defeated if they were removed after the subject's first offensive attack? What were the criteria for ‘defeat?’ </p>
<p>We have changed the wording of ‘defeat’ to ‘attack’. Stimulus males displayed uniformly defensive behavior (on-back, huddling), while the subjects attacked the stimulus (lunge-bite) (Page 12, lines 355-357).</p>
<p>5) EPM, “Subjects were placed at the arm intersection facing the open arm and were allowed to explore all arms for one minute; subjects were then observed for five minutes.” </p>
<p>How are subjects observed for 5 minutes if they are only allowed to explore the arms for 1 min? </p>
<p>We changed the wording to clarify that the mice were exploring the EPM for 6 minutes total, with a one-minute habituation period before behavior was scored. (Page 15, lines 448-450). </p>
<p>6) Histology Results: What were the criteria for removing the iCre+ animals? It would seem that an outlier analysis would be the most appropriate method for removal of subjects. </p>
<p>iCre+ mice with BNST-vasopressin cell counts higher than 3 standard deviations from the mean of other iCre+ mice were considered ‘misses’ and removed from the study. The criteria of 3+ standard deviations was added to the text. (Page 19, lines 543-545). </p>
<p>7) All Figure Legends: Much of the text in the results is repeated in the figure legends. Consider removing text in the figure legend to eliminate unnecessary redundancy. </p>
<p>We removed redundant statistics that were in the figure legends and left the p values in place for clarity. </p>
<p>8) Figure 2: a) The legend is confusing. It indicates that the color of the bar graphs represents the Cre genotype of the stimulus, but appears to be the Cre stimulus of the test subject. If true, the clean cage stimuli should also be colored according to the Cre genotype of the test subject. b) Consider increasing the scale on the graphs illustrating female investigation (panels b and d). At the current scale, it is difficult to evaluate the data. It can be noted in the figure legend that the scales of male and female test subject graphs are not equivalent and that they were adjusted to facilitate evaluation of the female test subject data. </p>
<p>In figure 2, we have changed the colors for clarity and adjusted the y-axis scale for several graphs to aid in visualizing the data. </p>
<p>9) Table 2: The title of Table 2 should not include statistics. In addition, the authors should check the statistics reported in these two parts of the manuscript as they appear to differ - or perhaps further specification of the precise comparison has been left out? </p>
<p>The statistics are now removed from the title of the table and reported in the text and statistics table (Table 1). We report the F value from the ANOVA, with no post-hoc comparisons because there were no significant effects. The table values represent the median and interquartile range similar to how we visualize our other data in boxplots. </p>
<p>10) Table 1? There is no Table 1. This is important both for the labeling of Table 2 and the reference to Table 1 in the odor discrimination results section. </p>
<p>Table 1 is the statistics table required by the journal and because of its large size. We have placed it at the end of the manuscript for ease of reading. </p>
<p>11) The authors should state what serotype of AAV was used (AAV2, AAV5, etc). </p>
<p>Under the ‘viral vector’ section, we have added additional description of the serotype. </p>
<p>12) The authors should be consistent with how they report ISH results. Either number of cells or fluorescence intensity for all areas quantified. I also think they should correct for the area quantified (eg cells/mm2). </p>
<p>As indicated in the text, the density of AVP cells in PVN made it difficult to accurately count cells in this population. For that reason, we chose to report intensity measurement. However, we now also report approximate cell counts, but doing so does not change outcomes. We have also indicated the size of the counting area (2 mm2). (Page 17-18, lines 498, 504-506, 539-541). </p>
<p>Discussion </p>
<p>1) “While several studies have directly tested the social function of sexually-dimorphic cell populations (Scott et al. 2015; Unger et al. 2015; Wei et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2013), only one has found a strong sex-difference in social behavior tied to an anatomical sexual dimorphism, in this case a female-biased one (Scott et al. 2015).” This may be technically true, but manipulations of the sexually dimorphic projections of BNST/MeA vasopressin cells in the septum causes a sex difference in social play behavior (Veenema et al. 2013, Bredewold et al. 2014). </p>
<p>We agree that these studies provide strong support for a function of the projections from the BNST/MeA in social play, but for reasons we now make clearer (see our response to the comment on the Significance Statement and Introduction above), this study represents the first direct test of the function of the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the BNST. </p>
<p>2) Given that vasopressin cells in the medial amygdala are thought to project to the same areas as, and act in concert with, BNST vasopressin cells, it is surprising that this is not mentioned in the discussion. This may be particularly important for the negative results. If vasopressin cells were deleted from both the BNST and medial amygdala the effects may have been even greater or more behaviors may have been affected (e.g., EPM). The authors may want to qualify their conclusions regarding the negative results as medial amygdala vasopressin cells may be compensating for the loss of BNST vasopressin cells. </p>
<p>We actually did mention this in the Discussion, but if the reviewer missed it, so will other readers. Therefore, we now state this potential explanation of negative results more explicitly (Page 29, lines 774-778, and Page 31, last two sentences before ‘Conclusions’).</p>
<p>3) Given the uniqueness of the manipulation in how it impacts all target areas rather than just a single target area, the authors may want to include this in the discussion along with mentioning the putative projection areas of the BNST. </p>
<p>We trust that the changes to the Introduction makes this point clear, and that readers will understand that by deleting the AVP cells in the BNST one automatically deletes the projections of these cells to all target areas as well. </p>
<p>4) The authors state that in species with stronger territoriality, increased AVP/V1a receptor expression is observed in the BNST, then go on to state that their results are inconsistent with these previous findings. I'm not sure I agree with this statement. First, the authors state that the hormone status of intruders in resident-intruder tests may have not provoked aggression. Second, AVP originating in the BNST might be more important for driving social approach to intruders than aggression itself. For example, Duque-Wilckens et al. 2016 reported that inhibition of V1a receptors in the BNST reduced social interaction in males but not offensive aggression. </p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer's concern and now describe previous results more accurately. (Page 28, lines 769-772). </p>

<p>1) The authors should check the results section for typos, such as this case where the authors include an unnecessary ‘t’ (males: t(22) t = 4.57, p = 0.00014). </p>
<p>This is now corrected </p>
<p>2) Histology Results: the text refers to the incorrect panels of Figure 1. </p>
<p>This is now corrected </p>
<p>3) Has proceptive behavior (eg ear wiggling etc) ever been quantified in female mice? This could be one way that AVP ablation may have affected the rate at which females were mounted by males. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, female mice do not display easily quantifiable proceptive behaviors (hop-dart, ear-wiggling in rats). In the future, we will measure female investigation of the male during copulation tests as an additional metric. </p>
<p>4) Discussion: “Our experiments do not allow us to conclude that specifically removal of AVP production in the BNST caused the behavioral effects observed in this study.” </p>
<p>Awkward phrasing, consider revising.</p>
<p>We have revised this sentence. (Page 27, lines 735-736).</p>
