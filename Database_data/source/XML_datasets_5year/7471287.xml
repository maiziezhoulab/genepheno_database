<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Gamecock chickens are one of the earliest recorded birds in China, and have accumulated some unique morphological and behavioral signatures such as large body size, muscularity and aggressive behavior, whereby being excellent breeding materials and a good model for studying bird muscular development and behavior. In this study, we sequenced 126 chicken genomes from 19 populations, including four commercial chicken breeds that are commonly farmed in China, 13 nationwide Chinese typical indigenous chicken breeds (including two Chinese gamecock breeds), one red jungle fowl from Guangxi Province of China and three gamecock chickens from Laos. Combined with 31 published chicken genomes from three populations, a comparative genomics analysis was performed across 157 chickens. We found a severe confounding effect on potential cold adaptation exerted by introgression from commercial chickens into Chinese indigenous chickens, and argued that the genetic introgression from commercial chickens into indigenous chickens should be seriously considered for identifying selection footprint in indigenous chickens. LX gamecock chickens might have played a core role in recent breeding and conservation of other Chinese gamecock chickens. Importantly, <italic>AGMO</italic> (<italic>Alkylglycerol monooxygenase</italic>) and <italic>CPZ</italic> (<italic>Carboxypeptidase Z</italic>) might be crucial for determining the behavioral pattern of gamecock chickens, while <italic>ISPD</italic> (<italic>Isoprenoid synthase domain containing</italic>) might be essential for the muscularity of gamecock chickens. Our results can further the understanding of the evolution of Chinese gamecock chickens, especially the genetic basis of gamecock chickens revealed here was valuable for us to better understand the mechanisms underlying the behavioral pattern and the muscular development in chicken.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">China as a possible origin of domestic chickens and a vast country with abundant diversities in geography and culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, it has accumulated the most abundant genetic resources in Chinese indigenous chickens under extensive natural and artificial selections, with considerable genetic variations and phenotypic diversity in terms of morphology and physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A comprehensive and deep understanding of the genome diversity of the Chinese indigenous breeds could reveal the population dynamics of the breeds, providing a theoretical basis for facilitating conservations and breeding programs. Also, this can provide us a good opportunity in understanding the interplay between genetic variations and phenotypic diversities in chicken.
</p>
<p id="Par3">Chicken has been the main source of protein in the human diet but at the onset of thousands of years of chicken explorations, symbolic and social domains such as cockfighting are ahead of economic explorations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Chinese gamecock chickens are one of the earliest recorded birds in China which can be dated back to 2700 <sc>bc</sc> and characterized by their special utility for cockfighting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Accompanied by a long artificial selection, Chinese gamecock chickens have accumulated some unique morphological and behavioral signatures such as small comb size, large body size, muscularity and aggressive behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, whereby being excellent breeding materials and a good model for studying bird behavior.</p>
<p id="Par4">In a previous pioneering study concerning selective signatures in BN gamecock chickens, Guo et al. highlighted several numbers of candidate selective genes underlying signatures of gamecock chickens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, such as organ development-related genes: <italic>CBFB</italic> (<italic>Core-binding factor beta subunit</italic>), <italic>GRHL3</italic> (<italic>Grainyhead like transcription factor 3</italic>), <italic>Gli3</italic> (<italic>GLI family zinc finger 3</italic>), <italic>PTCH1</italic> (<italic>Patched 1</italic>) and <italic>EFNA5</italic> (<italic>EphrinA5</italic>), aggressive behavior related genes: <italic>BDNF</italic> (<italic>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor</italic>), <italic>NTS</italic> (<italic>Neurotensin</italic>) and <italic>GNAO1</italic> (<italic>G protein subunit alpha o1</italic>), energy metabolism-related genes: <italic>RICTOR</italic> (<italic>RPTOR independent companion of MTOR complex 2</italic>) and <italic>SDHB</italic> (<italic>Succinate dehydrogenase complex iron-sulfur subunit B</italic>). However, this study is likely to be biased by genetic drift and confounded by potential artificial selection undergone in Chinese indigenous and commercial chickens, as this study just concerned one gamecock breed, and did not fully consider potential introgression from Chinese indigenous and commercial chickens into Chinese gamecock chickens because an introgression from commercial chickens into indigenous chickens seems common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Incorporating more gamecock breeds and taking Chinese indigenous and commercial chickens into account in a subsequent whole genome re-sequencing study can help us totally reveal the pivotal variants/genes underlying signatures in gamecock chickens.</p>
<p id="Par5">Also, natural selections especially the extreme environments have proved to be important driving forces in shaping genome diversity of animals (pig, cattle, sheep and horse) since their domestications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Chicken has spread worldwide since possibly domesticated in Southeast Asia and Southwest China before 2000–6000 <sc>bc</sc><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and evolutionarily adapted to a variety of local environments, such as high altitude, aridness and stressful African conditions (e.g., disease resistance, poor nutrition, oxidative and heat stresses)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Similarly, the Chinese indigenous chickens from high-latitude zones have also evolutionarily adapted to the cold winter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, compared with the wild ancestor red jungle fowls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which inhabit in tropical areas. Distinct from commercial chickens, Chinese indigenous chickens are less intensively selected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, decreasing the possibility of those genomic footprints left by natural selection are to be obscured by strong artificial selection. Aside from a potential introgression from commercial chickens into indigenous chickens, the Chinese indigenous chickens from low-latitude to high-latitude zones are likely to be a good model for exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation to cold weather in birds within a short period of time.</p>
<p id="Par6">In this research, we sampled and whole-genome re-sequenced 126 chicken individuals, which included four typical commercial chicken breeds that are commonly farmed in China, two Chinese gamecock breeds, another 11 Chinese nationwide canonical indigenous chicken breeds, one red jungle fowl population from Guangxi Province of China, and three gamecock chickens from Laos (Note <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S1</xref>). Combined with the genome sequencing data of 31 chickens (Tibetan chicken, BN gamecock breed, Yunnan village chicken, and Red jungle fowls) that were previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, these together allowed us to get a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the genomic variants/genes underlying the signatures in gamecock chickens, and evaluate the potential genomic footprints left by cold adaptation.</p>

<title>Sequencing and genomic variant</title>
<p id="Par7">In the present study, we whole-genome re-sequenced a total of 126 chicken samples, generating a panel of clean data ranging from 9.5 to 60.2 billion base pairs (bp), corresponding to genome coverage ranging from 7.0<bold>× </bold>to 48.9<bold>× </bold>(Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S2</xref>). Except for the Sample Laos03 (mapping rate = 94.85%), the mapping rate of the other 125 individuals was greater than 97%. The ratio of the genome covered with at least one sequencing base ranged from 89.1 to 93.5%, while covered with at least four sequencing bases ranged from 75.0 to 91.60%.</p>
<p id="Par8">After incorporating the sequencing data of another public 31 Chinese indigenous chickens, we identified a total of 17,375,012 raw SNPs and 1,726,022 raw InDels via SAMtools, and a total of 43,643,339 raw SNPs and 4,326,184 InDels via GATK pipeline, in which a total of 17,349,501 SNPs and 1,673,029 InDels shared by both SAMtools and GATK pipelines were further identified. Following the filtration criteria in “<xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec10">Materials and methods</xref>” (2.2), a total of 10,119,242 genome-wide population SNPs (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S3</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S1</xref>) and 837,787 genome-wide population InDels (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S4</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S2</xref>) were obtained. For this set of 10,119,242 genome-wide population SNPs, which composed of 9,463,354 known and 655,888 novel SNPs, and included 9,794,983 autosomal SNPs. Compared with previous whole-genome resequencing studies in Chinese chickens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, the number of novelSNPs and InDels identified here is relatively smaller, and this is probably because we employed two pipelines together to call the variants and large non-uniformity in terms of sequencing depth existed in 157 samples. For the SNPs abundance in all 22 populations, RJF harbored the highest in terms of both total and novel SNPs. Apart from RJF, in the populations sequenced in this study, TLF gamecock chickens exhibited the highest abundance in terms of both total and novel SNPs, while LH exhibited the lowest. For the 837,787 genome-wide population InDels, it had 382,059 insertions and 455,728 deletions. The abundance pattern across 22 populations in terms of InDels was similar to that in SNPs.</p>

<p id="Par10">Except three breeds (BC, SK, and YOU) with muffs and beard phenotype, the other Chinese indigenous chickens have undergone much less intensive artificial selection compared with commercial chickens, which are basically consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, as one of the earliest recorded chicken populations in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, Chinese gamecock chickens have been supposed to be under strong artificial selection since they have been consistently selected for cockfighting. But in the present study, similar to most Chinese indigenous chickens, the gamecock chickens also harbored relatively low levels in terms of nucleotide diversity and LD, and high level of heterozygosity, suggestive to a limited number of genes possibly underlying the signatures observed in gamecock chickens.</p>

<title>Genome-wide genetic differentiation</title>
<p id="Par11">We observed the highest levels (mean weighted Fst &gt; 0.2) of genetic differentiation between each commercial population and Chinese indigenous chickens, especially between LH chickens and BC chickens (Weighted Fst = 0.4365) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). Between the Chinese indigenous chicken populations, a higher level of genetic differentiation occurred between the three populations with Muffs and Beard phenotype (BC, SK, and YOU chickens) and others (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>), which were all higher than that of RJF chickens against other Chinese indigenous chickens (P &lt; 0.01), suggestive of the driving force of this unique external trait in shaping the genomic variation pattern. In particular, the weighted Fst values (0.255 ± 0.07) between BC chickens and other Chinese indigenous chickens could be comparable to those of four commercial populations against other Chinese indigenous chickens. BC as a Chinese indigenous chicken breed originated from Guangdong Province, which is adjacent to the habitat of RJF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>A). This does not totally support the argument given by Nie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, that a critical role in shaping the genomic variation within Eurasia continent chicken breeds might have been played by isolation based on distance. We propose strong artificial selection, together with isolation by distance are the main driving forces in shaping chicken genomic variation.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table

<title>Population genetic structure analysis unveiled a high level of admixture across Chinese gamecock chickens</title>
<p id="Par12">According to the neighbor-joining tree, all the 157 chickens from 22 populations could be separated into three clusters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>A). Of them, Cluster 1 included four commercial populations, seven ZJ, and eight RJF individuals; Cluster 2 included the populations of four gamecock populations and YNVC chickens, and the individuals of 3 ZJ and 2 RJF, suggestive of a possible same origin of the Chinese gamecock chickens included here; while the remaining 11 Chinese indigenous populations composed the Cluster 3. Consistent with the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, RJF and ZJ chickens could be separated into two different clusters in the present study. Except for the populations of RJF, ZJ, YNVC and Laos gamecock chickens, all the left populations could be separated into its own clade.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Population structure analyses of 22 chicken populations of this study.

<p id="Par13">However, the PCA results could not completely reproduce the phylogenetic relationships. The top two PCs (4.31% and 3.45% variances explained totally, respectively) could separate the four commercial populations from non-commercial populations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>B). Especially, the 10 RJF chickens here were genetically classified very near the Chinese indigenous chickens but away from commercial chickens, which is consistent with the study of Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and probably due to that these RJF chickens belong to <italic>G. g. spadiceus</italic>. LH as a population harboring the highest level of genetic differentiation with others (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>), its unique genetic variation pattern could also be evidenced in the top two PCs being an independent cluster from others. But the four gamecock populations, together with YNVC, 3 ZJ, and 2 RJF chickens could not be well grouped into one cluster as indicated by the above phylogenetic analysis, suggestive of a complex genetic structure of them. Within each population, we observed 3 and 2 outlier samples in ZJ and RJF chickens, which were also revealed in the above phylogenetic analysis. Besides, it was hard to separate the populations of Laos, BN, ZJ and, YNVC from each other, suggestive of potential admixture among them.</p>
<p id="Par14">To infer the admixture degree across 157 samples, we further performed an unsupervised Admixture analysis, with K run from 2 to 16. We found at K = 2, consistent with the above PCA result (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>B), genetic divergency first occurred between commercial populations and non-commercial ones. Except for BC and SK (except SK06), a potential widespread genetic introgression from commercial populations to other Chinese indigenous ones was observed across K = 2 to K = 5 (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S3</xref>), inclusively. As suggested by the cross-validation errors (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S4</xref>), K = 6 was the best assumed genetic groups in this study. At K = 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>C), LH, WRR, SK (except SK06) and BC chickens, these four populations could still keep distinct; RS and RIR chickens formed another group; While the last group was mainly represented by RJF chickens. For the gamecock chickens, they genetically appeared to be the admixture of RJF, Chinese indigenous and commercial chickens. Clearly, except for SK (excluding SK06) and BC chickens, we could still observe a potential widespread genetic introgression from commercial chickens to most Chinese indigenous chickens, at K = 6, which agrees with the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>TreeMix analysis revealed evidence of gene flows from LX gamecock chickens into other gamecock chickens</title>
<p id="Par15">Given that a potential widespread introgression from commercial chickens to most Chinese indigenous breeds has been suggested by above Admixture analysis, and to better understand the historical relationship within the 22 populations, we further employed TreeMix to reconstruct a maximum likelihood (ML) tree, in which it allows both populations split and migration events. We found the inferred migration edges at seven could return the smallest residuals (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S5</xref>), thus being the best fit for our data. In this ML tree (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>), two gene flows from LH chickens into two Chinese indigenous breeds, including ZJ and LD chickens could be evidenced, which conformed with the Admixture results of that a potential widespread introgression from commercial chickens into Chinese indigenous chickens. Noticeably, among the three gene flows between Chinese indigenous breeds, two of them both indicated the gene flows from LX gamecock chickens into the other three gamecock breeds. LX gamecock chicken can be dated back to 700 <sc>bc</sc><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and is one of the earliest documented Chinese indigenous chicken breeds, conferring it more advantages in the utilization of cockfighting. This may together suggest a core role played by LX gamecock chickens in recent breeding and conservation of Chinese indigenous gamecock chickens.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>TreeMix analysis of Chinese indigenous and commercial chickens.

<title>Severe confounding effect on selective signatures of cold adaptation exerted by genetic introgression from commercial chickens to Chinese indigenous chickens</title>
<p id="Par16">We observed strong artificial selection that has been undergone in commercial populations here, which exhibited lower nucleotide diversity, lower heterozygosity and higher LD level within populations, and strikingly high genetic differentiation with Chinese indigenous chickens, at the genome-wide level. More importantly, Admixture analysis inferred a potential widespread genetic introgression from commercial chickens into Chinese indigenous chickens except for BC and SK, which can be also partially evidenced. This means any selective signatures especially presented by natural selection to be identified in Chinese indigenous populations will be probably extremely confounded by strong artificial selection undergone in commercial chickens. We argued here that the genetic introgression from commercial chickens into indigenous chickens should be quite seriously considered when identifying selective signatures presented in indigenous chickens, in terms of natural and artificial selections.</p>
<p id="Par17">Given an example concerning to potential cold adaptation in Chinese high-latitude indigenous chickens, this confounding effect exerted by genetic introgression from commercial chickens could be observed by performing correlation analysis between the average eigenvalues (population eigenvalues) of each Chinese indigenous population from PC1 to PC10 (Raw data was from above PCA; Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S5</xref>) and the corresponding inhibiting extreme temperatures of each population in winter (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S1</xref>), population eigenvalues of the Chinese indigenous in PC2 (3.45% variance explained totally) was found to be strongly positively (Correlation = 0.643; P = 0.005) correlated with temperature index (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>A), whereas in this scenario it suggested RIR (Eigenvalue = − 0.1728), WRR (Eigenvalue = − 0.1542) and RS (Eigenvalue = − 0.1192) chickens should be best-adapted to cold. Besides, population eigenvalues of the Chinese indigenous in PC7 (1.98% variance totally explained) and PC6 (2.07% variance totally explained) were found to be moderately positively (Correlation = 0.511; P = 0.036) and negatively (Correlation = − 0.445; P = 0.076) correlated with temperature index (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>B,C) respectively. Similarly, WRR (Eigenvalue = − 0.0282) and RS (Eigenvalue = 0.2955) chickens would separately be the best-adapted to cold in these two scenarios. Considering that, a potential widespread genetic introgression from commercial chickens to Chinese indigenous high-latitude chickens has been observed and it will be hard to conclude that the cold-related variation to be identified from the Chinese indigenous chickens inhabiting in extreme temperature in winter is not because of genetic introgression from commercial chickens.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Correlation analyses between the extreme temperature in winter and the eigenvalues of each Chinese indigenous population from PC2 (<bold>A</bold>), PC7 (<bold>B</bold>) and PC6 (<bold>C</bold>).

<title>Selective signatures in gamecock chickens</title>
<p id="Par18">After removing 198 and 1,326 windows with SNP number &lt; 5, 92,010 and 91,940 were retained in subsequent statistics of Fst values and Hp scores respectively. With the threshold of top 1% outliers of windows being the putatively selective genomic regions, we identified 920 genomic regions in both ZFst (threshold score &gt; 3.925) and ZHp (threshold score &lt; − 2.251) analyses. This threshold proved to be robust enough to detect the genomic regions under selection in gamecock chickens after checking the distributions of ZFst value and ZHp score of each window along the autosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S6</xref>). We further annotated the candidate genomic regions above, allowing us to identify 169 and 165 candidate genes in terms of ZFst and ZHp analyses respectively (Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S6</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S7</xref>). However, only 31 genes were shared by both ZFst and ZHp analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S7</xref>). In a previous report by Guo et al. concerning selective signatures in BN gamecock chickens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, which was also based on Fst (BN_vs_RJF) and Hp (within BN population) analyses (threshold: top 5% outliers), 343 candidate genes were identified (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S8</xref>). While in the present study, we could just re-identify only 53 genes out of the earlier reported 343 genes (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S7</xref>), indicating that most of the selective genes previously identified were possibly the common ones by artificial selection during chicken domestication or biased by genetic drift. For instance, <italic>CBFB</italic>, <italic>GRHL3</italic>, <italic>Gli3</italic>, <italic>BDNF</italic>, <italic>NTS</italic>, <italic>GNAO1</italic> and <italic>SDHB</italic> as seven highlighted autosomal candidate selective genes were previously identified. Here, we just detected strong selective signals in <italic>Gli3</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S9</xref>). Especially for <italic>BDNF</italic>, a gene involving the nervous system and aggressive behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, its selective signals in our study were very weak (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). Further gene function annotation on the putatively selected genes from ZFst showed no biological processes (BPs) or KEGG pathways could be significantly enriched in, while for those from ZHp, several candidate genes could be significantly enriched in several BPs, including regulation of localization, regulation of cell migration, regulation of transport, regulation of cell motility, and positive regulation of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S10</xref>). In particular, candidate selective genes, including <italic>APP</italic>, <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>MAP3K7</italic>, <italic>TCIM</italic>, <italic>CALR</italic>, could be significantly (Adjusted <italic>P value</italic> = 0.049) enriched in positive regulation of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling, which concerns any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling. Importantly, NIK/NF-kappaB signaling is closely associated with immunity, and its loss function can induce a primary immunodeficiency with multifaceted aberrant lymphoid immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. These candidate selective genes may be conducive to the inflammation control of gamecock chickens in the context of their frequent fighting.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Genome-wide putatively selective signatures in the Gamecocks population.

<p id="Par19">In this study, the sweeping loci with the highest ZFst values and much lower ZHp scores were observed from Chromosome 2:27,910,001–28,410,000 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>A,B), within which <italic>AGMO</italic> (<italic>Alkylglycerol monooxygenase</italic>), <italic>MEOX2</italic> (<italic>Mesenchyme homeobox 2</italic>), and <italic>ISPD</italic> (<italic>Isoprenoid synthase domain containing</italic>) could be further identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>A). Only <italic>AGMO</italic> and <italic>ISPD</italic> exhibited a moderate level of linkage disequilibrium between each other (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S8</xref>), and two shared long-range haplotypes across gamecock chickens could be observed in <italic>AGMO</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>B) and <italic>ISPD</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>C), respectively, suggestive of strong sweeps of these two genes in gamecock chickens. Among those SNPs detected across the genomic regions of <italic>AGMO</italic> and <italic>ISPD</italic>, there were two possibly damaging and three probably benign missense mutations (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S11</xref>). Particularly, the possibly damaging missense mutation (p.Ala312Thr) in exon 8 of <italic>AGMO</italic> was nearly fixed in non-gamecock chickens (fixation degree = 92.2%), but much less fixed in gamecock chickens (fixation degree = 30.2%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>D). While, the probably benign missense mutation (p.Arg84Lys) in exon 2 of <italic>ISPD</italic> was likely to be highly selected and favored in gamecock chickens, with a fixation degree reaching 91.0% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>E). Further, conservativeness analysis of ISPD amino acid sequence across all 38 available avian species showed that the missense mutation (p.Arg84Lys) was conservative in birds and the missense Lys (K) detected in gamecock chickens could be just detected in Common Ostrich and American Crow (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S9</xref>).

<p id="Par21">To further identify the genomic regions under selection in gamecock chickens concerning aggressive behavior, we mapped the candidate selective genomic regions in gamecock chickens to the chicken aggressive behavior quantitative trait loci (QTL) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/GG/traitmap?trait_ID=2402">https://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/QTLdb/GG/traitmap?trait_ID=2402</ext-link>). Thus, we discovered that the genomic region covering <italic>CPZ</italic> (<italic>Carboxypeptidase Z</italic>) was the only common one, for which it has been identified to be significantly associated with chicken fighting times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and missense mutation within this gene can induce neuroblastoma in human beings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Further haplotype homozygosity pattern analysis of genomic region covering <italic>CPZ</italic> across 157 chickens showed that a long-range haplotype was shared by gamecock chickens compared with RJF, Chinese indigenous and commercial chickens, suggestive of a strong selective sweep of this region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>A,B). Additionally, we also identified three missense mutations from <italic>CPZ</italic> genomic region across 157 chickens, one from exon 2 (p.Ala34Thr) and two from exon 11 (p.Thr610Ala; p.Gln616Arg), with fixation degrees reaching 72.9% and 69.6% from exon 1 and exon 2 in gamecock chickens respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>C). However, we could not exclude the hitchhiking effect on <italic>CPZ</italic> selection exerted by a downstream genomic region of Chr4:81,840,001–81,873,000. This downstream genomic region of <italic>CPZ</italic> harbored the highest genetic differentiation between gamecock chickens and others, within 500-kb upstream and downstream genomic regions of <italic>CPZ</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>A). Further LD analysis on those SNPs between <italic>CPZ</italic> (n = 247) and it is a downstream highly differentiated genomic region (n = 98) revealed some SNPs from these two genomic regions were at a high level of linkage disequilibrium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>D).

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par23">In conclusion, we here characterized the genome diversity, linkage disequilibrium pattern, genetic differentiation, population structure and migration events, across the 157 chickens (126 ones sequenced here) from 22 populations, and re-identified the selective signatures in gamecock chickens with potential confounding effects exerted by introgression and genetic drift fully considered. Our results showed that the Chinese indigenous chickens except those breeds having muffs and beard phenotype were less intensively selected, and a widespread introgression from commercial chickens into them might have occurred, for which it could have severely confounded the selection footprints in indigenous chickens, such as cold adaptation. Importantly, we identified <italic>AGMO</italic> and <italic>CPZ</italic> might be crucial for determining the behavioral pattern, while <italic>ISPD</italic> might be essential for the muscularity observed in gamecock chickens. These results together can facilitate conservation of the 13 canonical Chinese indigenous breeds, and the genetic basis of gamecock chickens revealed here is valuable for us to better understand the mechanisms underlying the behavioral pattern and the muscular development in chicken.</p>

<title>Sampling and genome sequencing</title>
<p id="Par24">A total of 126 blood samples from 19 chicken populations were collected from 19 populations which composed of 13 Chinese nationwide indigenous chicken breeds, including six Huiyang Bearded chickens (BC), nine Xinghua chickens (XH), six Hetian chickens (HT), six Baier Yellow chickens (BEH), 11 Silkies (SK), six Xianju chickens (XJ), six Liyang chickens (LY), six Jining Bairi chickens (BR), six Yunyang Da chickens (YY), ten Beijing You chickens (YOU), six Lindian chickens (LD), ten Luxi gamecock chickens (LX) and six Tulufan gamecock chickens (TLF) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>A); four typical commercial populations, including six White Leghorn chickens (LH), six White Recessive Rocks (WRR), six Cobb RS308 chickens (RS) and six Rhode Island Reds (RIR); one Red jungle fowl population from Guangxi Province (five individuals, RJF) and one gamecock population from Laos (three individuals, Laos). Genomic DNA was further extracted from the collected blood samples using NRBC Blood DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instruction, and the quality of the extracted Genomic DNA was tested using Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer at 260/280 nm ratio (NanoDrop Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). To provide a more comprehensive understanding and profound insight into the genome diversity of Chinese indigenous chickens and the genetic base underlying Chinese gamecock chickens, we incorporated the sequencing data of another eight Xishuangbanna gamecock chickens (BN), eight Yunnan village chickens (YNVC), ten Tibetan chickens (ZJ) and five Red jungle fowls (RJF), which has been previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Overall, we generated a panel of 157 miscellaneous chickens, which were from 22 populations. These 157 chickens from 22 populations could be further grouped into eight categories, including Low-latitude (BC, XH, and YNVC), Middle-latitude (HT, BEH, XJ, SK, BR, YY and LY), High-latitude (LD and YOU), High-altitude (ZJ), Gamecocks (Laos, TLF, LX, and BN), Commercial broilers (WRR and RS), Commercial layers (RIR and LH) and Ancestry (RJF) (Note <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par25">More than 3 μg of genomic DNA from the above samples were used to construct a paired-end sequencing library with an insert size of approximately 350 bp following the manufacturer’s instructions, thereby being sequenced on Illumina HiSeq X Ten and HiSeq 2000 platforms (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at Novogene Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) and Beijing Institute of Genomics (Beijing, China). After removing the sequencing paired-end reads with adaptors, N content ratio &gt; 10% and low-quality base ratio (Q ≤ 5) &gt; 50%, clean reads were retained for subsequent genome mapping and variant calling.</p>

<sec id="Sec13">
<title>Genome mapping, variant calling and annotation</title>
<p id="Par26">Firstly, we used Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) version 0.7.15 to map the clean sequencing reads to the Gallus gallus 5.0 reference genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000002315.4/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000002315.4/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, generating the Sam file for each sample. SAMtools version 1.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, was then used to filter out the unmapped and non-unique reads from the above Sam files following the command “rmdup” and generate the corresponding BAM format files. Meanwhile, Picard version 2.9.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>) was employed to sort the SAM files into coordinate order and further saved as binary alignment map files (BAM files), followed with duplicate reads marked and BAM files indexed. We here utilized SAMtools version 1.3 and GATK version 3.7.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, simultaneously to detect SNP and InDel at a population level, only with the SNPs and InDels detected by both pipelines kept for further analysis. For SAMtools calling, raw SNPs and raw InDels were called using the SAMtools mpileup package with default parameters. Before GATK calling, we performed a step of base quality score recalibration to get more accurate base qualities, in which a set of over 14 million known chicken SNP data from Ensembl database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-94/variation/gvf/gallus_gallus/">ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-94/variation/gvf/gallus_gallus/</ext-link>) was used together with GATK version 3.7.0 “BaseRecalibrator” to generate the recalibrated BAM files. Further, the engine “Unifiedgenotyper” in GATK (default settings) was employed to call the raw SNPs and InDels. Finally, the common sites of SNP/InDel identified by both SAMtools and GATK were retained, and the SNPs were further submitted to VCFtools version 0.1.14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, for quality control using the following filtration criteria: (1) max-missing 0.1; (2)—maf 0.05; (3)—minQ 20; (4)—min-meanDP 5; (5) max-meanDP 1,000; (6)—minGQ 5, in which the SNPs and InDels sites with missing data &lt; 0.1, minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; 0.05, quality value &gt; 20, mean depth values between 5 and 1,000, and genotype quality above 5 were kept for subsequent analyses. To annotate the SNPs and InDels identified here, ANNOVAR (Version: 2013-05-20) was employed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Considering our samples which consisted of males and females, we further extracted the autosomal SNPs for genetic differentiation, pooled-heterozygosity, LD, population genetic structure and selective sweep analyses at the genome-wide level to avoid non-stochastic effects.</p>
