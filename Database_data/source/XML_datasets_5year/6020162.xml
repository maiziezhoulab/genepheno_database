<abstract>
<p id="P2">Prenatal exposure to the anti-epileptic, mood-stabilizing drug, valproic acid (VPA), increases the incidence of autism spectrum disorders (<bold>ASD</bold>s); <italic>in utero</italic> administration of VPA to pregnant rodents induces <bold>ASD</bold>-like behaviors such as repetitive, stereotyped activity and decreased socialization. In both cases males are more affected than females. We previously reported that VPA, administered to pregnant mice at gestational day 12.5, rapidly induces a transient, 6-fold increase in BDNF protein and mRNA in the fetal brain. Here we investigate sex differences in the induction of <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression by VPA as well as the underlying epigenetic mechanisms. We found no sex differences in the VPA stimulation of total brain <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA as indicated by probing for the BDNF protein coding sequence (exon 9); however, stimulation of individual transcripts containing two of the nine 5’-untranslated exons (5’UTEs) in <italic>Bdnf</italic> (exons 1 and 4) by VPA was greater in female fetal brains. These <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts have been associated with different cell types or subcellular compartments within neurons. Since VPA is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, covalent histone modifications at <italic>Bdnf</italic> 5’UTEs in the fetal brain were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. VPA increased acetylation of multiple H3 and H4 lysine residues in the vicinity of exons 1, 2, 4, and 6; minimal differences between the sexes were observed. H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at those exons was also stimulated by VPA, moreover, the VPA-induced increase in H3K4me3 at exons 1, 4, and 6 was significantly greater in females than in males; i.e., sexually dimorphic stimulation of H3K4me3 by VPA correlated with <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts containing exons 1 and 4, but not 6. Neither H3K27me3 nor cytosine methylation at any of the 117 CpGs in the vicinity of the transcription start sites of exons 1, 4 and 6 was affected by VPA. Thus, of the six epigenetic marks analyzed, only H3K4me3 can account for the sexually dimorphic expression of <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts induced by VPA in fetal brain. Preferential expression of exon 1- and exon 4-<italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts in females may contribute to sex differences in <bold>ASD</bold>s by protecting females from adverse effects of genetic variants or environmental factors such as VPA on the developing brain.</p>
