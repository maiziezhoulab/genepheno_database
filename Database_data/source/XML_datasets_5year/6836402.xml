<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders without a unique or definite underlying pathogenesis. Although savant syndrome is common in ASD, few models are available for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this syndrome. In this study, we generated urinary induced pluripotent stem cells (UiPSCs) from a 13-year-old male autistic savant with exceptional memory. The UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant exhibited upregulated expression levels of ASD genes/learning difficulty-related genes, namely PAX6, TBR1 and FOXP2, accompanied by hypertrophic neural somas, enlarged spines, reduced spine density, and an increased frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. Although this study involved only a single patient and a single control because of the rarity of such cases, it provides the first autistic savant UiPSC model that elucidates the potential cellular mechanisms underlying the condition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par39">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a constellation of early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders. It is characterized by social communication deficits and repetitive sensory-motor behaviors, and it is often accompanied by abnormalities in language development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. According to recent surveys, the prevalence of ASD among 8-year-old children in the United Sates was approximately 16.8 per 1000 children; the estimated prevalence in China was lower than those in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. ASD is a highly heritable mental disorder. Approximately 80% of cases of ASD have no clear etiopathology or related model, although many genetic variants have been identified in syndromic and non-syndromic ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Many ASD risk gene variants have been linked to brain connectivity, the excitation-inhibition balance, and synaptic functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. According to reports on risk-genes, <italic>TBR1</italic> and five other genes, namely <italic>CHD8</italic>, <italic>KYRK1A</italic>, <italic>GRIN2B</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>TBL1XR1</italic>, may contribute to 1% of sporadic ASD cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recently, a group of 65 genes were identified with strongest statistical evidence, and this identification has expanded knowledge of the sets of highest-confidence risk genes associated with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Among these genes, <italic>TBR1</italic>—a putative transcription factor (TF)—is highly expressed in glutamatergic early-born cortical neurons; it dictates the expression of other risk genes, controls cortical development, and is implicated in intellectual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. <italic>TBR1</italic> expression requires <italic>PAX6</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and <italic>PAX6</italic> is related to autistic behaviors and speech abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Following <italic>TBR1</italic> dictation, <italic>FOXP2</italic> is also related to some severe speech-language disorders and plays a role in cortical neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par40">Savant syndrome is a condition in which prodigious talent can co-occur with developmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In some cases of ASD, special abilities are accompanied by deficits; moreover, according to parental reports and psychometric tests, a third of adults with ASD exhibit savant skills in different domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Special isolated memory skills were the most frequently reported special abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. ASD children with special abilities exhibit more autistic traits, and multiple talent genes also influence the differences across individuals with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, few models are available for studying the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of autistic savants. In the study of neurodevelopmental disease, the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) approach has been particularly useful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Human iPSC models can enable the analysis of neuronal phenotypes and the investigation of cellular mechanisms after the derivation of autistic savants’ somatic cells into neurons.</p>
<p id="Par41">In this study, we generated a urinary iPSC (UiPSC) model of a 13-year-old autistic boy with a photographic memory and speech-language deficit. This idiopathic savant exhibited repetitive behaviors and impaired social communication. We discovered that compared with control neurons, upregulated transcription of ASD risk genes co-occurred with dysregulated cellular cortical development and synaptogenesis in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant on day 42 after neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiation. Our study is the first to provide a UiPSC model of an autistic savant with a photographic memory.</p>

<title>Generation of UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant</title>
<p id="Par42">Exfoliated renal epithelial cells were isolated from the urine of the autistic savant and an unrelated healthy control; the cells were then cultured for expansion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>a and b and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1a). Approximately 3 weeks after isolation, urinary cells were replicated in sufficient quantity for the subsequent infection and exome sequencing studies (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S1). Attached urinary cells were infected using a Sendai-virus delivery system carrying the human OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC TFs; the urinary cells were then reprogramed into human UiPSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>c and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1b). The advantages of this procedure have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We obtained three clone lines of UiPSCs from the autistic savant and two lines from the healthy control; all lines positively expressed pluripotent markers such as OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, SSEA4 and TRA-1-60 (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1c). All five UiPSC lines used in this study maintained a normal karyotype (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1d). The pluripotency of the UiPSC clones in vivo was confirmed by the generation of teratomas in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Furthermore, all UiPSC clones could generate teratomas that contained all three embryonic germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1e). The results of teratomas generation proved that the five UiPSC clones could differentiate in vivo. Otherwise, positive alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities were also observed, confirming that all UiPSCs could maintain an undifferentiated proliferative state in vitro (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1f). These results indicated that the reprogramming of UiPSCs was successful.

<p id="Par43">The procedure for forebrain-specific neuronal differentiation is outlined in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>d. We initiated neuron differentiation by forming embryoid bodies (EBs). After approximately 3 weeks of differentiation, neural tube-like rosettes were manually collected, dissociated, and re-plated. All vital phases of NPC formation are illustrated in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1g. The UiPSC-derived NPCs were confirmed to positively express early neural precursor markers, such as nestin, SOX2 and musashi1 (Mui1) (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1g). After further neuron differentiation, the NPCs were differentiated into MAP2<sup>+</sup> neurons with abundant expression of VGLUT1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S2a), this observation is consistent with a previous description [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Six-week-differentiation constitutes a sufficient maturation process for detecting spontaneous synaptic activity in human iPSC-derived forebrain neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this study, we mainly focused on analyses of UiPSC-derived neurons on day 42 after NPCs differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>e).</p>

<title>Upregulated expression of PAX6, TBR1, and FOXP2 in UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant</title>
<p id="Par44">On day 42, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses in UiPSC-derived neurons, without astrocyte co-culture, from all five clones. We detected 794 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 408 upregulations and 486 downregulations in the group of neurons from the autistic savant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>a and b). Moreover, we observed an enrichment of upregulated pathways associated with mental disorders, such as the glutamatergic synapse pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway and pathway of long-term potentiation, in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>c). An analysis of upregulated gene ontology (GO) enrichment revealed an abundance of genes associated with organ development, particularly neural system development, such as regulation of nervous system development, forebrain development, neurogenesis and negative regulation of nervous system development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>d).

<p id="Par45">Among the aforementioned DEGs, we observed 55 upregulated TFs and 43 downregulated TFs in UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S2b). High-confidence ASD risk genes, such as <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>TBR1</italic>, and <italic>FOXP2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], were significantly upregulated in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>a and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S2b). Both <italic>PAX6</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic> constituted the vital TFs of the upregulated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in the group of neurons from the autistic savant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>e). Cortical connections are shaped by sequential maps of regional identity, propagated by the <italic>PAX6</italic>-<italic>TBR1</italic> TF cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>TBR1</italic> was reported to be a putative TF that was highly expressed in glutamatergic early-born cortical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and was demonstrated to be a highest-confidence risk gene associated with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the present study, Western blot analysis results revealed that TBR1 in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant was upregulated by approximately six times compared with that in the neurons of the control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>f). This finding was unexpected because most studies have reported many impaired conditions in <italic>TBR1</italic> in cases of ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We also determined that PAX6 and FOXP2 in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant were upregulated by approximately two and three times compared with those in the neurons from the control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>f).</p>

<title>Hypertrophic neural somas with enlarged spines and reduced spine density in UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant</title>

To investigate whether the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant had any morphological alterations when compared with the control neurons, we specifically labeled the membranes of the UiPSC-derived neurons with Dil by using a gene gun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The UiPSC-derived neurons, co-cultured on confluent astrocyte layers for 42 days after NPCs differentiation, were labeled with Dil and analyzed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>a and b). Morphological analyses of the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant revealed that the dendritic spine density in these neurons was significantly reduced when compared with that in the control neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>c). However, the average spine area and average spine length of the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant were greater than those of the control neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>d and f). The average spine area of the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant was approximately three times larger than that of the control neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>d). We measured the soma sizes of UiPSC-neurons without astrocyte co-culture on day 42. We conducted such measurements by analyzing bright-field images, and the analysis results showed that the average soma size of the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant was significantly larger than that of the control neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>e). Overall, these data indicate the presence of hypertrophic neuronal somas with enlarged spines and reduced spine density in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant.

<title>Increased frequency but not amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par49">We studied an autistic savant with a photographic memory and speech-language deficit. Our study demonstrated that PAX6, TBR1, and FOXP2 (as vital TFs) were significantly upregulated in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant when compared with the control neurons. In addition, our genomic data reveal that both the autistic savant and healthy control had amplifications in different loci of <italic>PAX6</italic>. No clear interpretations for the upregulation of PAX6 could be gleaned from the genomic data. This requires further investigation with regard to our models. Notably, in most previous reports on ASD and intellectual disability, <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>TBR1</italic> and <italic>FOXP2</italic> were either deficiently expressed or had lost functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. <italic>TBR1</italic> mutations have been implicated in impairments in social interaction, vocalization, memory and cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. <italic>PAX6</italic> and <italic>FOXP2</italic> have also been observed to be involved in the regulation of higher cognitive functions, including speech and language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In the present study, all of them were upregulated in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant. According to studies on songbirds, FOXP2 is upregulated in a striatal region essential for song learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. On the basis of our results, we could hypothesize that PAX6, TBR,1and FOXP2 upregulation explains the superior memory along with the speech-language deficit of the idiopathic autistic savant.</p>
<p id="Par50">A decrease or increase in dendritic spine density is commonly observed in animal models of ASD-related genes, such as <italic>Tbr1</italic>, <italic>Mecp2</italic>, <italic>Ube3a</italic>, <italic>Shank3</italic>, <italic>Tsc1</italic>, <italic>Fmr1</italic>, and <italic>Grin2b</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In a mouse model, <italic>Tbr1</italic>, which is a potential master regulator in ASD, promotes synapse numbers through <italic>Wnt7b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Knockdown of <italic>FoxP2</italic> reduces spine density in Area X of the zebra finch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In mice carrying two alleles of the human <italic>FOXP2</italic> gene, dendrite length in the striatum increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The downstream <italic>TBR1</italic> target genes <italic>CDH10</italic>, <italic>GPC6</italic>, <italic>LMO7</italic>, and <italic>CNTN2</italic>, which encode membrane proteins that regulate cell adhesion and axonal outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], were upregulated in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant. The upregulation of these genes may explain the hypertrophic neural somas with enlarged spines and reduced spine density in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant. To further explain the changes in soma size and dendritic spine density and size, studies on autistic savants regarding <italic>TBR1</italic> or <italic>FOXP2</italic> knockdown in UiPSC-derived neurons or overexpression of control neurons must be conducted in the future.</p>
<p id="Par51">We did not observe a difference in the expression levels of <italic>GAD1</italic> and <italic>SLC32A1</italic>, which encode GAD67 and VGAT, between the two neuron groups in the RNA-seq analyses and Western blot analysis results, respectively. Notably, GAD65 levels were obviously decreased in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant, although no difference in <italic>GAD2</italic> was observed in RNA-seq analyses. The analyses indicated the relationship between protein and mRNA levels under various scenarios, such as steady state, spatial and temporal variations of mRNAs, and local availability of resources for protein biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying decreased GAD65 are still unclear and require further investigations. Previous studies have determined that GAD65 and GAD67 differed with regard to their cellular and subcellular locations, transcription times, and functional purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. GAD65 is localized in nerve terminals and synthesizes GABA for neurotransmission in functions such as synaptogenesis and protection from neural injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Moreover, GAD65 transcription occurs slightly later on in the development period when synaptic inhibition is more prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. GAD65-synthesized GABA was reported to play a crucial role in the dynamic regulation of neural network excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. During neurotransmission, GAD65 forms a complex with VGAT; this helps to package GABA into vesicles for release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Our results suggest a deficit of presynaptic inhibition in the synaptic release of the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant. This is a potential mechanism underlying the increased frequency of sEPSCs in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant. The mechanism underlying the increased frequency of sEPSCs in the UiPSC-derived neurons of the autistic savant is not clear. The study showed that surviving TG (rTg(tauP301L)4510 tau mutant mice) cells had a significantly reduced total spine density but that the frequency of sEPSCs was increased, suggesting that during progressive tauopathy, cortical pyramidal cells compensate for the loss of afferent input with increased excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The compensation might be the reason for the increased frequency of sEPSCs. However, further investigation is required on this topic, including recording mEPSCs, mIPSCs and sIPSCs parameters in the future.</p>
<p id="Par52">Our results illustrated a possible link between dysregulated ASD genes, an aberrant cellular and synaptic morphology, and impaired electrophysiological function in cases of ASD accompanied by savant syndrome. Our UiPSC model of the autistic savant is useful for further research on the mechanisms underlying such conditions. Although this study generated UiPSC models of an autistic savant, it has some limitations that warrant consideration. The primary limitation is the inclusion of only one autistic savant and one control; it has been very hard to find other autistic children with a photographic memory and speech-language deficit. In addition, considering the high level of clonal variation in iPSCs, our study findings apply to only this autistic savant with a photographic memory and speech-language deficit.</p>

The procedure and appearances are illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>b and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S1a. We collected urine samples (approximately 100–400 mL) by using a sterile bottle containing a 5-mlL penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco, cat. no. 15070063). The samples were subsequently transferred to 50-mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The pellets were collected into a single tube and washed with washing buffer, which was Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Gibco, cat. no.

Urinary cells were resuspended in UC medium and transferred to a single well of a 12-well plate that had been coated with 0.1% gelatin (Millipore, cat. no. ES-006-B). The UC medium was a 1:1 mixture of complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing DMEM/high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and the renal epithelial cell growth medium (REGM; Lonza, cat. no. CC-3190). For each day during the first 4 days, we added 1 mL of UC medium. At approximately 96 h after plating, the urinary cells were removed all the medium, washed with DPBS, and added fresh UC medium. Half of the UC medium was replaced daily for approximately 10 days until the attached cells reached a density of 90%. Subsequently, the cells were passaged with TrypLE Select enzyme (Gibco, cat. no. 12563011) onto a 10-cm dish that was coated with gelatin for further expansion. This was considered passage 1 (P1). We continued to passage cells if required. The generation of UiPSCs from urinary cells at passages 1–3 was of a higher efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>

The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST; 0.05% Tween-20) for 2 h at room temperature, incubated overnight with primary antibodies (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Table S3) at 4 °C, incubated with secondary antibodies (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Table S3) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed with TBST (0.05% Tween-20). Antibodies were prepared in primary/secondary antibody dilution buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, cat. no. P0256/P0258). Horseradish peroxidase signals were detected by a Tanon (5200) system. The derived images were analyzed using ImageJ (NIH).</p>

<title>Preparation of primary astrocytes</title>
<p id="Par63">Primary astrocytes were prepared from the cortices of Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice on postnatal day 0 (P<sub>0</sub>). P<sub>0</sub> cortices were dissected, cut into small pieces, and dissociated with papain (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 88285) in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed with HBSS and filtered, and epithelial cells were removed by differential time attachment. The cells were resuspended in astrocyte medium (AM) that comprised DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 1% GlutaMAX and Primocin, and they were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, cell suspension was collected and transferred to T25 flasks that have been coated with 0.1 mg/mL poly-D-lysine (PDL; Sigma, cat. no. P0296). Confluent astrocytes were treated with 20 μM cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC; Sigma, cat. no. C6646) for 72 h to further eliminate other cell types. A total of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded on PDL-coated tissue culture slides in 24-well plates with AM for further use in co-culture.</p>

<sec id="Sec20">
<title>Electrophysiological analyses</title>
<p id="Par64">On days 41–43, patch clamp recordings from UiPSC-derived neurons with astrocyte co-culture were obtained at room temperature by using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, Digidata 1550, and the corresponding acquisition software Clampex 10.3 from Molecular Devices (USA). Coverslips seeded with derived neurons were transferred into recording chambers and perfused continuously with an extracellular solution containing the following (in mM, all from Sigma-Aldrich): 128 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 HEPES, and 10 glucose (added before use) with pH 7.4. All recordings were obtained with a glass patch electrode (3–6 MΩ tip resistance), which was filled with pipette solutions, in whole-cell recording mode and filtered at 1 kHz. In addition, sEPSCs were recorded for 5 min at a holding potential of − 60 mV by using Cs-based pipette solution containing the following (in mM, all from Sigma-Aldrich): 135 CsCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, and 0.5 Na-GTP (pH 7.3). The series resistance was not compensated for but was monitored. Recordings with a &gt; 25% change in series resistance were discarded. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.3 software.</p>

<title>UiPSC-derived neurons labeled by gene gun</title>
<p id="Par65">On day 42, UiPSC-derived neurons with astrocyte co-culture were washed with DPBS and rapidly fixed with 4% PFA for 1–2 min at room temperature. The UiPSC-derived neurons were removed from the fixative and specifically labeled with a Helios Gene Gun (Bio-Rad, 297BR). Bullets were prepared using Dil Stain (1,1′-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-Tetramethylindocarbocyanine Perchlorate; Invitrogen, cat. no. D282). A slice with neurons was shot three times by one bullet. We added 100 μL DPBS to the neurons f to prevent them becoming dry, and we incubated the neurons for 3 h in the dark at room temperature. Slices were mounted with antifade mountant. The excitation and emission wavelengths of Dil (D282) were 549 and 565 nm, respectively. Images were captured by a TCS SP8 STED 3X multiphoton confocal microscope and were analyzed using Fiji software (ImageJ).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec22">
<title>Morphological structure of UiPSC-derived neurons analyses</title>
<p id="Par66">We analyzed the morphological structure of the UiPSC-derived neurons; our analysis focused on spine density, spine area, spine length, and soma size. Illumination is presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>b. Images of neurons were captured and analyzed. Specifically, dendritic lengths were measured using a plug-in (Simple Neurite Tracer). Dendritic diameters, spine lengths, number of spines, and total areas of threshold (dendrite areas and spine areas) were measured using Fiji software. The average spine density was defined as the number of spines per 10 μm of dendritic length. The average spine area was defined as the total spine area divided by the number of spines. The area of total spines was defined as the difference between the total area of fluorescence and dendritic area. At least 950-μm-long dendrites from five or more neurons (from at least three cultures) were analyzed for each UiPSC line. Soma size was analyzed through ImageJ. At least 247 somas from three cultures without astrocyte co-culture were statistically analyzed for each UiPSC line.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec23">
<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p id="Par67">All experiments were replicated at least three times, and data from parallel cultures were acquired, except the wWestern blot of PAX6. GraphPad Prism (6.07) software was used for all statistical analyses. All individual data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was accepted at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. We used Student’s unpaired <italic>t</italic> test to compare two groups. If five lines were compared, we used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc tests between groups corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey). Statistical analyses and scale bars are described in each figure legend.</p>
