<abstract>
<p>The neuroplasticity hypothesis of depression proposes that major
depressive disorders are related to decreased hippocampal and cortical
neural plasticity, which is reversed by antidepressant treatment.
Astroglial cells have emerged as key mediators of neural plasticity
and are involved in the cause and treatment of depression and
anxiety-like behaviors. One of the ways that astroglia modulate
neuroplasticity is through the formation and maintenance of
perineuronal nets (PNNs). Perineuronal nets are important
extracellular matrix components that respond to stress and are
implicated in anxiety-like behaviors. Normally, astroglial cells
continuously turnover PNNs by degrading and donating PNN proteins;
however, chronic stress slows PNN protein degradation and increases
cortical PNN expression overall. In this report, we used weighted gene
co-expression network analysis and eigengene analysis to further
delineate the pathways and key regulators involved in the
astroglial-PNN relationship following chronic stress. Our analyses
indicate that chronic variable stress induces the expression of PNNs
through inhibition of trophic pathways and key transcription factors
in astroglial cells. These data further support the integral role of
astroglial cells in the neuroplasticity hypothesis of depression
through their modulation of anxiety-like behaviors and PNNs.</p>

<body>
<p>The neuroplasticity hypothesis of depression described by Pittenger and Duman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1179069519870182">1</xref></sup> postulates that the development of depression is characterized by decreases
in neural plasticity, including neurogenesis, a reduction in dendritic
arborization, and synaptic plasticity. Decreases in neuroplasticity can be induced
with chronic stress and have been described in the hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex (PFC); moreover, antidepressant treatment increases the same neuroplastic
events and is associated with a remediation of the associated behavioral
phenotype. A growing body of work implicates astroglial cells in a number of
neuroplastic events including neurogenesis and the development, maturation, and
elimination of synapses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1179069519870182">2</xref></sup> Given this role, it is not surprising that recent work has suggested that
astroglia are important mediators of both the cause<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1179069519870182">3</xref></sup> and the pharmacologic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1179069519870182">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1179069519870182">5</xref></sup> of depression. In fact,
ablation of PFC astroglia induces a depressive/anxiety-like phenotype, whereas PFC
neuronal ablation does not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1179069519870182">3</xref></sup> In addition to the critical role astroglial cells play in synapse
integrity, they are involved in the cyclical production, degradation, and
maintenance of perineuronal nets (PNNs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1179069519870182">6</xref></sup> through the donation of component proteins and through enzymatic
degradation. Perineuronal nets are proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix (ECM)
complexes that surround and stabilize, through inhibition of plasticity,
inhibitory interneuron synapses in the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1179069519870182">7</xref></sup> In a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069519870182">8</xref></sup> in which we sequenced the translatome of neocortical astroglial cells in
response to chronic variable stress (CVS; a mouse model of depression),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069519870182">8</xref></sup> we found that several components of PNNs were increased including
proteoglycans (<italic>BCAN</italic>), collagens (<italic>COL1A2, COL8A2</italic>,
and <italic>COL9A3</italic>), laminins (<italic>LAMB2</italic>), and the link
protein <italic>HAPLN1</italic>. To validate that this reflected a change in the
PNNs themselves, we counted Wisteria Floribunda agglutinin (WFA, a PNN
marker)-positive cells and found that the number of PNNs increased in response to
CVS throughout the neocortex. Moreover, the PNN increase was related to increases
in anxiety and depressive-like behavior, alluding to the importance of PNNs in the
neuroplasticity hypothesis of depression. Finally, degradation of PNNs in the PFC
alone was sufficient to reverse the effects of CVS on depressive and anxiety-like behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069519870182">8</xref></sup> This suggests that although PNN upregulation was seen across the frontal
and parietal cortices and is a global response to CVS or, perhaps, sustained
glucocorticoid exposure, PNN integrity in the PFC is directly related to the
effects of CVS on anxiety and depressive behaviors. This is not surprising given
the central role of PFC plasticity in the control of these specific behaviors,
whereas the parietal cortex is central to control of motor behaviors. Indeed,
psychomotor retardation is a feature of major depressive disorder and has been
associated with hypoconnectivity and hypoactivity of the parietal cortex,
consistent with an increase in PNNs.</p>
<p>Previously, we generated a translatomic database of differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) in cortical astroglial cells from mice exposed to CVS. The gene ontology of
the top DEGs suggested that CVS impaired PNN degradation, contributing to a
decreased neuroplastic environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069519870182">8</xref></sup> Using the expression levels of our entire data set from our original study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069519870182">8</xref></sup> we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1179069519870182">9</xref></sup> to integrate the different altered gene sets into a coherent system-level
context ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1179069519870182">Supplemental Data File 1</ext-link>). Weighted gene co-expression analysis
was used to identify co-expression modules across the entire data set of gene
expression levels as log-transformed RPKM (ie, log2(RPKM + 1)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1179069519870182">9</xref></sup> The WGCNA function blockwiseModules was run with the following
parameters:</p>
<list id="list1-1179069519870182" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>maxBlockSize=500000, corType=”bicor”, power=24, networkType=”signed”,
deepSplit=2, minModuleSize=20, verbose=3, pamRespectsDendro=F). The
power parameter was estimated using the pickSoftThreshold function,
setting networkType=”signed”.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Weighted gene co-expression network analysis module regulatory network analysis was
done using the Expression2Kinases package, using the member of each module as the
input list and default parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1179069519870182">9</xref></sup> Analysis across the 6 samples grouped 14 525 genes into 64 modules (plus
the unassigned gray modules genes). Two of the modules were overrepresented with
upregulated genes, one of which was enriched in pathways related to ECM
proteoglycans as well as genes related to astroglial activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179069519870182">Figure 1</xref>, magenta), with
the other enriched in pathways related to lysosome and protein transport, and
interestingly, some autism and Alzheimer disease–related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179069519870182">Figure 1</xref>, turquoise).
Together, these may suggest increased production of ECM proteins, in particular
proteoglycans, and an increase in protein degradation, consistent with astroglial
activation. This pathway is particularly interesting because of the role
astroglial cells play in the organization and maintenance of PNNs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1179069519870182">6</xref></sup> Three of the modules were overrepresented with downregulated genes, one of
which was enriched in MAP kinase genes associated with cytokine and growth factor
signaling (nerve growth factor in particular) and Rho GTPases, which are important
to changes in cytoskeleton and cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179069519870182">Figure 1</xref>, blue), with the others enriched
in pathways related to signaling by growth factors and regulation of transcription
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179069519870182">Figure 1</xref>, brown),
whereas the smallest module shows weak enrichment of metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179069519870182">Figure 1</xref>, orange).
Overall, these modules point to an impairment or downregulation of signal
transduction and transcription, possibly associated with a decrease in astroglial
metabolism. Downregulation of neurotrophin signaling is consistent with active inflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1179069519870182">10</xref></sup> and the downregulation of MAPK pathway genes also supports decreased levels
of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 and brain-derived growth
factor, which is consistent with previous studies of depression and depressive
behaviors and the role of fibroblast growth factor in the stress
response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069519870182">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1179069519870182">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1179069519870182">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>Eigengene analysis of the co-expression modules is a useful tool to understand
module-to-module relationships and, in combination with upstream regulation
analysis, can help elucidate the regulatory network driving the present
transcriptional/translational alterations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1179069519870182">13</xref></sup> The results from the eigengene analysis, after filtering for correlation
coefficients (abs(cor) &gt; 0.8), show a strong anticorrelation (1) between the
turquoise and both the blue and brown modules and (2) between the brown and
magenta. Strong anticorrelations are, in part, expected as a result of the signed
network definition, which splits positive and negative correlations. Nevertheless,
it may suggest the presence of negative feedback loops or mutually exclusive
programs of transcription. The brown module contains the largest number of strong
(and significant) correlations, making the (downregulation of) transcription
factor activity and regulation of transcription a network hub.</p>
<p>We then used Expression2Kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1179069519870182">14</xref></sup> to infer key upstream regulators that cause the observed
transcription/translation patterns by testing each of the 5 main network modules
as the input. We assessed each group of regulators for differential expression,
co-expression, and module of origin, to identify the potential upstream regulators
responsible for the observed translational patterns. Strikingly, 50% of all the
differentially expressed upstream regulators belong to the blue module (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1179069519870182">Supplemental Data Files 2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1179069519870182">3</ext-link>), placing it potentially upstream of the other modules. In
particular, gene members of the brown, magenta, and turquoise modules are under
the control of differentially expressed regulators in the blue module, and
furthermore, most of the differentially expressed regulators of the blue module
itself are also a part of the blue module (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1179069519870182">Supplemental Data Files 2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1179069519870182">3</ext-link>). This is particularly interesting because the blue module
represents decreases in growth factor signaling and Rho GTPases, which potentially
control (ie, promoting or no longer inhibiting) the upregulation of ECM
proteoglycans, astroglial activation (magenta), and protein degradation components
(turquoise) and the downregulation of transcription factor activity (brown).
Furthermore, the upstream regulators of the magenta module are mostly in the blue
and turquoise modules, suggesting that the upregulation of ECM proteoglycans (ie,
PNNs) is potentially driven by the downregulation of the growth factor signaling
and upregulation of the protein degradation components of the system. The
module-to-module relationships implied by the distribution of differentially
expressed upstream regulators (based on transcription factors (TFs),
protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and kinase databases) are in agreement with
the (data driven) eigengene analysis, which suggests internal consistency across
our analyses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1179069519870182">Supplemental Data Files 2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1179069519870182">3</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these analyses suggest that chronic stress impairs trophic activity
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179069519870182">Figure 1</xref>, blue) in
astroglial cells. These lead to inefficiencies in degradation of proteins
associated with PNN maintenance, therefore increasing PNN expression and
subsequently decreasing plasticity. Perineuronal nets have been associated with
fear conditioning in the amygdala, such that increases in PNNs are observed
following fear conditioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1179069519870182">15</xref></sup> Perineuronal nets appear to preserve memories and prevent extinction of the
fear conditioning cues, presumably as an adaptive response to protect the organism
and allow it to recognize future threats. It is possible, therefore, that a
similar process occurs in the PFC; however, in response to chronic rather than
acute stress, this becomes maladaptive and leads to decreased plasticity and
cognitive flexibility. Indeed, cognitive functions are also impaired when PNNs are
not present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1179069519870182">16</xref></sup> and of course are a core feature of mood disorders in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1179069519870182">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1179069519870182">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perineuronal nets surround only a subset of the cortical parvalbumin, somatostatin,
and reelin interneuron populations, and functional changes in each of these cell
populations have been implicated in major depressive disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1179069519870182">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1179069519870182">19</xref></sup>
Importantly, it is not clear what is the functional difference between a PNN- or
non-PNN-surrounded interneuron, although it is believed that these cells show
different plasticity potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1179069519870182">20</xref></sup> The putative link between PNNs, GABAergic function, and depressive and
anxiety-like behaviors remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>The question as to how stress induces the astroglial changes noted in our previous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069519870182">8</xref></sup> and this study remains. One obvious factor may be that these changes
reflect direct responses to prolonged glucocorticoid exposure. Indeed, astroglia
express glucocorticoid receptors and we demonstrate that our CVS model induces
sustained glucocorticoid increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069519870182">8</xref></sup> Moreover, several studies have shown direct functional changes in astroglia
in response to glucocorticoids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1179069519870182">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1179069519870182">22</xref></sup> Both in vivo and in
vitro models show that glucocorticoid receptors act as transcriptional regulators
in astroglia to change levels of adenosine triphosphate, glutamate transporters,
and connexon component proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1179069519870182">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1179069519870182"></xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1179069519870182">25</xref></sup> inducing functional
changes in neocortical astroglial cells. Another possibility (ie, not mutually
exclusive) is that astroglial changes occur in response to sustained decreases in
PFC activity previously reported to be induced by CVS and in major depressive
disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1179069519870182">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1179069519870182">27</xref></sup> Further studies are required to test these hypotheses
and understand the upstream factors involved in stress-induced changes in
astroglia. Altogether, these data consider the effects of stress in the PFC from a
multicellular, systems, perspective. It is important to note, however, that these
are predicted models and future in vivo work will be needed to confirm the
translational validity of these findings. Nevertheless, taken together with
previous work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1179069519870182">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069519870182">8</xref></sup> these findings reinforce an important role for astroglia in
the interplay between stress, neurons, and anxiety and depressive-like
behaviors.</p>
