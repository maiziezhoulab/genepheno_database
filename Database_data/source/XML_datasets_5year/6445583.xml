<p>Proteins of the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) subfamily take up amino acids from the environment for use in the cell. Bartoccioni et al. show that the bacterial amino acid exchanger BasC is functionally similar to the human LAT Asc1, making BasC a useful model for this class of transporters.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Many key cell processes require prior cell uptake of amino acids from the environment, which is facilitated by cell membrane amino acid transporters such as those of the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) subfamily. Alterations in LAT subfamily amino acid transport are associated with several human diseases, including cancer, aminoacidurias, and neurodegenerative conditions. Therefore, from the perspective of human health, there is considerable interest in obtaining structural information about these transporter proteins. We recently solved the crystal structure of the first LAT transporter, the bacterial alanine-serine-cysteine exchanger of <italic>Carnobacterium sp AT7</italic> (BasC). Here, we provide a complete functional characterization of detergent-purified, liposome-reconstituted BasC transporter to allow the extension of the structural insights into mechanistic understanding. BasC is a sodium- and proton-independent small neutral amino acid exchanger whose substrate and inhibitor selectivity are almost identical to those previously described for the human LAT subfamily member Asc-1. Additionally, we show that, like its human counterparts, this transporter has apparent affinity asymmetry for the intra- and extracellular substrate binding sites—a key feature in the physiological role played by these proteins. BasC is an excellent paradigm of human LAT transporters and will contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying substrate recognition and translocation at both sides of the plasma membrane.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amino acid availability regulates cellular physiology. The transfer of amino acids across the plasma membrane is mediated by specific amino acid transporters. Heteromeric amino acid transporters (HATs) comprise two subunits, a polytopic membrane protein (the light subunit; SLC7 family) and a disulfide-linked N-glycosylated type II membrane glycoprotein (the heavy subunit; SLC3 family; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fotiadis et al., 2013</xref>). The light subunits of HATs belong to the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) subfamily, which is part of the large amino acids, polyamines, and organic cations (APC) family of transporters, and are the catalytic component of the transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reig et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, the heavy subunit appears to be essential only for trafficking to the plasma membrane. Two heavy subunits (4F2hc and rBAT) and eight light subunits have been identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernández et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Several human pathologies highlight the physiological roles of HATs. Two transporters of this family are responsible for inherited aminoacidurias, and mutations in either of the two genes coding for the subunits of system b<sup>(0,+)</sup> (rBAT and b<sup>(0,+)</sup>AT) lead to cystinuria (MIM 220100; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calonge et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feliubadaló et al., 1999</xref>), while mutations in y<sup>+</sup>LAT1 (a 4F2hc-associated system y<sup>+</sup>L) result in lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI; MIM222700; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Torrents et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borsani et al., 1999</xref>). Additionally, mutations in LAT1 and LAT2 are associated with autism and age-related hearing loss, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tărlungeanu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espino Guarch et al., 2018</xref>), and Asc-1/CD98hc is a druggable target in schizophrenia as it is the major D-serine transporter in brain, which acts as a coagonist of NMDA glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sakimura et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, xCT and LAT1 are overexpressed in many human tumors, thereby suggesting that amino acid transporters are essential for tumor cell survival and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">del Amo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Savaskan and Eyüpoglu, 2010</xref>). In this regard, two different anticancer therapies involving both xCT and LAT1 have been proposed. On the one hand, these transporters mediate the uptake of several amino acid–derived anticancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">del Amo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Savaskan and Eyüpoglu, 2010</xref>). This observation thus suggests that these proteins are involved in the cellular internalization of these antineoplasic drugs. On the other hand, a novel strategy based on the inhibition of xCT and LAT1 activities has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">del Amo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Savaskan and Eyüpoglu, 2010</xref>), thus reducing tumor proliferation and progression. Targeting amino acid transporters in cancer is conceptually novel since specific inhibitors are scarce. In this regard, the development of drugs with greater activity against these transporters is expected to challenge the scene.</p><p>The atomic structures of plasma membrane transporter proteins are the most powerful tools for the design of more specific and active therapeutic molecules and for understanding substrate binding and translocation mechanisms. Considerable homology with human amino acid transporters may provide crucial insights into intelligent drug design for the treatment of several cancers and neuronal diseases, as well as knowledge of the effect of pathological mutations on transporter protein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). To date, the atomic structure of a LAT transporter has not been published. The closest available crystal structures correspond to those of remote bacterial homologues (17–22% sequence identity [SI]), namely the amino acid exchangers AdiC and GadC, and the proton-coupled amino acid transporters ApcT and GkApcT, which belong to the APC family of transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shaffer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kowalczyk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ilgü et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jungnickel et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the generation of robust and reliable structural models of LAT transporters based on these distant crystallized homologues is precluded by low amino acid SI with human LAT (hLAT) transporters. In this regard, an hLAT1 model based on a mixed sequence alignment of AdiC and ApcT with hLAT1 has been reported as a tool to identify structurally novel molecules of pharmacological interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geier et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Close prokaryotic homologues have emerged as excellent structural and functional paradigms of their human counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Penmatsa et al., 2013</xref>). In this regard, the serine/threonine exchanger (SteT) was shown to be a good functional homologue of hLAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reig et al., 2007</xref>). However, despite significant efforts that have led to an increase in the crystalizability of the protein, no crystal structure was obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodríguez-Banqueri et al., 2016</xref>). We recently solved the crystal structure of the first transporter of the LAT subfamily (bacterial asc; BasC; unpublished data). Here we report the complete functional characterization of BasC, showing extremely similar functional features to those of hLAT, thus making it a suitable protein for further studies on LAT subfamily members.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s03"><title>Identification and sequence analysis of prokaryotic LAT transporters</title><p>To identify prokaryotic homologues of LAT subfamily transporters, initial sequence analysis was performed using the BLAST algorithm (default settings; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) to compare a prototypical hLAT transporter sequence (particularly LAT1) against a nonredundant protein sequence database. Seven bacterial sequences encoding for putative LAT transporters sharing between 25% and 30% SI with LAT1 were selected for protein expression and purification. Multi-sequence alignment was done with the PSI/TM-Coffee server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floden et al., 2016</xref>) using the members of the APA (2.A.3.2), CAT (2.A.3.3), ABT (2.A.3.6), GGA (2.A.3.7), and LAT (2.A.3.8) subfamilies of the APC family (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tcdb.org">www.tcdb.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saier et al., 2016</xref>), and a phylogenetic tree was drawn by iTOL tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Letunic and Bork, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Cloning of prokaryotic LAT transporters</title><p>Ecolized complementary DNAs encoding the seven selected putative amino acid transporter proteins were obtained from GenScript and subcloned into the EcoRI and PstI sites of a modified PTTQ18 expression vector. A variant of a GFP, lacking the start codon, was added in frame to the C terminus of the transporter sequence. Additionally, the sequence of HRV-3C protease was inserted between the transporter protein and GFP sequences. Finally, four additional histidines were added to the preexistent hexahistidine tag in the PTTQ18 vector. Single point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). All DNA constructs were verified by sequencing. The A20C mutant was generated on a cys-less mutant (C427A) background to finally generate the double A20C-C427A mutant (referred to as A20C mutant) that has been used to study the sidedness of the substrate interaction of BasC.</p></sec><sec id="s05"><title>Protein expression of prokaryotic LAT transporters in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic></title><p>Expression experiments were performed with freshly transformed cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 Star (DE3). Initially, the expression of all seven putative LAT transporters was studied in 50-ml samples cultured in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin. When the absorbance measured at 600 nm (<italic>A<sub>600</sub></italic>) had reached 0.5, protein expression was induced at different isopropyl-β-<sc>D</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche) concentrations (0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, or 1 mM), incubation times, 4 h or overnight, and temperatures (25°C, 30°C, or 37°C). To estimate protein expression, GFP fluorescence was measured and protein quantity calculated as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drew et al., 2005</xref>). The putative LAT transporter of <italic>Carnobacterium sp AT7</italic> (BasC hereafter) was identified as a stable protein species suitable for crystallographic studies by application of fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drew et al., 2005</xref>). BasC was overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 Star (DE3) cells grown in Luria-Bertani media as a C-terminal fusion with GFP. Expression was induced by 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside at 37°C for 22 h. Cells were harvested at 5,000×<italic>g</italic> for 15 min and stored at −80°C until use.</p></sec><sec id="s06"><title>Preparation of <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes</title><p>Cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-Base, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4.

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (1 h at 15,000×<italic>g</italic>, 4°C), and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation (2 h at 200,000×<italic>g</italic>, 4°C). The membrane pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris-Base, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, and 10% glycerol at a protein concentration of between 8 and 12 mg/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until use.</p></sec><sec id="s07"><title>Purification of prokaryotic LAT transporters</title><p>All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. Membranes at 3 mg/ml protein concentration were solubilized using 1% (wt/vol) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM; Affymetrix) for 1 h in purification buffer (20 mM Tris-Base, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% DDM, and 10% glycerol). After ultracentrifugation (2 h, 200,000×<italic>g</italic>, 4°C), the soluble fraction was incubated for 3 h at 4°C with equilibrated Ni<sup>2+</sup>–nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) Superflow beads (QIAGEN) with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-Base, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% DDM, 10% glycerol, and 20 mM imidazole). Protein-bound beads were washed three times with 10 column volumes of washing buffer before elution with 15 ml of elution buffer (washing buffer supplemented with 350 mM imidazole). The purified protein was concentrated by centrifugation in an Amicon Ultra (100,000 D molecular weight cut-off; Millipore) at 3,220x<italic>g</italic> until reaching the desired protein concentration. To assess BasC quality and purity after Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA purification, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of GFP-fused BasC was performed in a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in SEC buffer (20 mM Tris-Base, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.05% DDM). AdiC was purified for functional studies as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kowalczyk et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s08"><title>Reconstitution into proteoliposomes (PLs)</title><p>BasC and AdiC proteins were reconstituted in <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipids (Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reig et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kowalczyk et al., 2011</xref>). Lipid was dried under N<sub>2</sub> and suspended in reconstitution buffer (20 mM Tris-Base and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The suspension was sonicated to clarity, and purified BasC protein was added to the desired protein/lipid ratio (wt/wt; 1:100). To destabilize the liposomes, 1.25% β-D-octylglucoside was added and incubated in ice with occasional agitation for 5 min. DDM and β-D-octylglucoside were removed by dialysis for 40 h at 4°C against 100 volumes of dialysis buffer. PL suspensions were used or frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at −80°C until use.</p></sec><sec id="s09"><title>Amino acid transport assays in PLs</title><p>For transport measurements, PLs were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). For uptake experiments, the desired intracellular amino acid concentration was added to the PL suspension, which was then subjected to three freeze–thaw cycles. The extraliposomal amino acid content was then removed by ultracentrifugation. Amino acid uptake assays were initiated after mixing 10 µl of cold PLs with 180 µl of transport buffer (20 mM Tris-Base and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), 0.5–1 µCi/data point of radiolabeled L-amino acid (PerkinElmer), and unlabeled amino acid to the desired concentration, and this mixture was then incubated at room temperature for the indicated periods of time. Efflux measurements were performed by filling the liposomes by three freeze–thaw cycles with transport buffer plus 10 µM L-serine and 0.5 µCi/data point of [<sup>3</sup>H]L-serine. The release of [<sup>3</sup>H]L-serine was measured by adding 180 µl of transport buffer with or without 4 mM cold amino acid. Transport experiments were stopped by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (5 mM L-serine in transport buffer) and filtration through 0.45-µm pore size membrane filters (Sartorius Stedim Biotech). Filters were then washed two times with 2 ml of stop buffer and dried, and the trapped radioactivity was counted. Transport measured in PLs containing no amino acid was subtracted from each data point in order to calculate the net exchange. Transport measurements are normalized to the BasC protein concentration measured for each proteoliposome batch. Saturation kinetics were evaluated by nonlinear regression analysis, and the kinetic parameters derived from this method were confirmed by linear regression analysis of the derived Eadie–Hofstee plots. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM of three experiments performed on different days and on different batches of protein and PLs.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Use of cysteine-modifying reagents</title><p>MTSES or MTSEA (Anatrace) were freshly prepared by dissolving the reagent in ice-cold water just before use.

In labeling experiments, liposomes with BasC A20C mutant were treated with HRV-3C protease (2 h at 4°C), adding 1 mM DTT and 0.5 mM EDTA to the buffer. Then, 1 mM Cy5-maleimide was added (ON at 4°) after 1–5 mM MTSES or MTSEA treatment for 60 min.

Indeed, BasC-GFP is inserted randomly into the PLs as the arginine/agmatine exchanger AdiC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). This was evidenced by the partial cleavage of GFP by HRV-3C protease from outside the PLs. Because GFP is fused to the C terminus (intracellular side), the cleaved BasC corresponds to the inside-out inserted transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). To address whether the apparent high-affinity component would correspond to the extra- or intracellular sides of the transporter, we used a strategy similar to that previously reported to study the sidedness of substrate interaction in AdiC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). We used BasC-GFP A20C mutant in an otherwise BasC cysless background (BasC-A20C-GFP). This mutant is homologous to the mutant S26C in AdiC, in which residue Cys 26 is only accessible from the extracellular side. Similarly, Cys 20 in BasC is also only accessible from the extracellular side. Thus, BasC-A20C-GFP PLs were treated with HRV-3C protease to cleave GFP from the inside-out oriented transporter molecules as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>. Then, the sample was pretreated with 1 mM MTSES (nonpermeable sulfhydryl-reagent) or with 5 mM MTSEA (permeable sulfhydryl-reagent; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>) to block Cys20 residue.

Pre-treatment with MTSES did not block Cy5 labeling of the inside-out oriented BasC-A20C molecules (i.e., BasC with GFP cleaved out), indicating that MTSES reached residue A20C only from the extracellular face of BasC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). As expected, the permeable reagent MTSEA almost completely abolished Cy5 labeling of Cys 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>).

As expected, 10 µM [<sup>3</sup>H]L-serine/4 mM L-alanine exchange in PLs reconstituted with cysless BasC-GFP was not affected by either MTSES or MTSEA treatment (Fig. S2). These results indicate that the side of BasC-A20C-GFP showing detectable transport of 10 µM [<sup>3</sup>H]L-serine (i.e., the apparent high-affinity side) is accessible to the nonpermeant reagent (MTSES) and therefore corresponds to the extracellular side of BasC.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Sidedness of the transport activity of BasC in PLs.

In contrast, MTSES-treated PLs did not show the extracellular apparent high-affinity component. In these conditions and due to the low activity of A20C mutant, the low-affinity <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> could not be determined because of the low signal/background ratio at high L-serine concentrations. In all, these results support that BasC has asymmetric interaction with substrates, being the extracellular face of apparent high affinity (<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> in the µM range) and the intracellular face of apparent low affinity (<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> in the mM range) for substrates. Indeed, this is similar to human LATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meier et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>HATs are gaining relevance as their essential physiological role joins the increasing number of mutations associated with several diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feliubadaló et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sperandeo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tărlungeanu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espino Guarch et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, in recent years it has been shown that the pharmacological inhibition of some of these transporters provides an effective strategy for the treatment of some types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">del Amo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Savaskan and Eyüpoglu, 2010</xref>). However, knowledge of the effects of deleterious mutations on the structure or function of these transporters, as well as the generation of specific target drugs, has been greatly hindered by the lack of structural information. In this regard, only structures of distant homologues both in sequence (18–22% SI) and function have been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kowalczyk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ilgü et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jungnickel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Some years ago, we cloned, expressed, and purified SteT, the L-serine/L-threonine antiporter of <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> the first prokaryotic member of LATs to be characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reig et al., 2007</xref>). For this reason, SteT emerged as a good bacterial paradigm of LATs. Nevertheless, although a great deal of effort in recent years has been channeled into improving SteT stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodríguez-Banqueri et al., 2016</xref>), crystallization assays have failed to render results, thus fueling the search for a new prokaryotic paradigm suitable for atomic structure determination.</p><p>The crystal structure of BasC (unpublished data) is the only high-resolution structural information available for the LAT subfamily of transporters. The present study reports on the functional reconstitution and characterization of BasC to identify those features shared with other LAT members: (1) phylogenetic analysis clustered the BasC amino acid sequence with those of LAT family members within the APC superfamily; (2) BasC showed obligate amino acid exchange activity, which is characteristic of the catalytic subunits of HATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fotiadis et al., 2013</xref>); (3) kinetic and biochemical studies support an asymmetric binding site in terms of apparent affinity, as reported for several human LATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Torras-Llort et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meier et al., 2002</xref>); and (4) both substrate and inhibitor selectivities in BasC are nearly identical to the eukaryotic LAT subfamily member Asc-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukasawa et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The phylogenetic tree of the APC family placed BasC within the LAT subfamily, and sequence alignments of BasC with the core members of the human LATs revealed amino acid identities ranging from 26 to 28% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and Fig. S1). Additionally, nearly 63% of pathogenic mutations present in LAT transporters are conserved or semi-conserved in BasC (Fig. S1). This higher SI, compared with the distant homologues AdiC, ApcT, GadC, and GkApcT, together with its nearly complete sequence alignment with hLATs, makes BasC an excellent template for homology modeling of human transporters. Reliable models of hLAT transporters would help to unravel the molecular defects underlying pathogenic mutations, as well as identify specific molecules that regulate LAT activity. In this regard, molecular docking for ligand discovery in structural models for LAT-1 based on atomic structures of distantly related prokaryotic homologues (AdiC and GadC) has produced promising results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geier et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>BasC is a protein from <italic>Carnobacterium sp. AT7</italic>, a piezophilic strain isolated from the Aleutian trench (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lauro et al., 2007</xref>). Protein adaptation to high pressure is conferred, in part, by weaker intramolecular interactions that favor higher catalytic efficiencies and greater molecular flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Somero, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brindley et al., 2008</xref>). In this regard, BasC is an extremely fast and efficient amino acid exchanger. Additionally, the lack of intramolecular disulfide bridges, due to the presence of only one cysteine in the whole BasC amino acid sequence (Cys 427), is consistent with these adaptations to high-pressure environments. This particular characteristic of BasC makes it an excellent model for biochemical studies involving single cysteine substitutions. In this regard, the single cysteine mutant A20C-C427A (mutant A20C) used in the present study to address the sidedness of the substrate’s apparent affinity is a clear example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of BasC in PLs by SDS-PAGE, after HRV-3C protease treatment, indicated that the protein is integrated into PLs in two orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Distinct substrate affinities can be expected for the two orientations (almost two orders of higher apparent affinity for the external than the cytoplasmic side), as demonstrated for the reconstituted catalytic subunit (b<sup>(0+)</sup>AT) of system b<sup>(0+)</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Torras-Llort et al., 2001</xref>) and for other HATs expressed in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meier et al., 2002</xref>). In agreement, fine-tuning the experimental conditions both outside and inside BasC-PLs allowed us to calculate two distinct apparent <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values of 45 ± 5 µM and 2.5 ± 0.4 mM for L-serine, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Nevertheless, whether these different affinities corresponded to the extra- or intracellular sides of the transporter remained unclear. To address this issue, using a strategy similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsai et al. (2012)</xref> developed for the AdiC transporter and adapted to BasC, we identified that the high-affinity binding site corresponded to the extracellular site and the low-affinity one to the intracellular site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Interestingly, our kinetic analysis showed that the substrate extracellular <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> was independent of the concentration of substrate in the cytosolic medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting a ping-pong mechanism compatible with the alternative access model of transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kowalczyk et al., 2011</xref>). This is compatible with a binary complex (one substrate molecule per transporter molecule) that induces transport, as revealed by the available structures of APC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kowalczyk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jungnickel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>This asymmetry in the substrate apparent affinity is a key feature of mammalian LAT transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Torras-Llort et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meier et al., 2002</xref>) that allows them to fulfill their physiological role in maintaining intracellular amino acid pools in the mM range while taking up extracellular amino acids at µM concentrations. The molecular bases underlying this asymmetry in the substrate apparent affinity of BasC and LATs is at present unknown. Different substrate binding affinities at both faces of the transporter and/or impact of different steps of the translocation mechanisms might be at the basis of this asymmetry.</p><p>Among the members of the LAT family, BasC showed the highest substrate and inhibitor selectivity similarity to Asc-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), thereby suggesting a very similar substrate binding site design in both cases. In this regard, the extracellular binding site of Asc1 accepts, although with lower affinity, larger neutral amino acids (e.g., leucine, isoleucine, and valine), while the intracellular site seems to be strictly designed to recognize small neutral amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukasawa et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, BasC intra- and extracellular binding sites seem to be restricted to small neutral amino acids (and asparagine) as uptake of larger neutral amino acids is negligible. Asc-1, like BasC, is a Na<sup>+</sup>-independent amino acid transporter that is noninhibitable by 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid, and it has a distinctive property among LATs, namely the capacity to mediate D-serine uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukasawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). D-serine is present in the mammalian brain, where Asc-1 is strongly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ehmsen et al., 2016</xref>) and has been proposed to be an endogenous modulator of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate–type glutamate receptors. Thus, further knowledge of this specific characteristic shared by Asc-1 and BasC would help elucidate pathological situations associated with altered D-serine levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sason et al., 2017</xref>). In this regard, human Asc-1 is considered a potential target to treat schizophrenia and cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sakimura et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about the structure of the light subunits of HATs (LAT subfamily). The elucidation of their structure is limited mainly by the low HAT expression in native cells and tissues and the difficulty to overexpress these proteins in heterologous systems. The elucidation of the atomic structure of a prokaryotic transporter with high SI to eukaryotic light subunits of HATs emerges as an excellent alternative to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying HATs. To this end, we have identified, cloned, overexpressed, and purified a novel prokaryotic Na<sup>+</sup>-independent neutral amino acid transporter, BasC, which exhibits the functional properties of the LAT subfamily. BasC is also the first member of this LAT subfamily to be crystallized, and analysis of its atomic structure would help elucidate the amino acid recognition and translocation mechanisms of LATs, the study of pathological mutations associated with LAT transporters, and the generation of reliable models of the hLAT transporters that would contribute to the intelligent design of more specific and potent drugs.</p></sec>
