<abstract>
<p id="P1">The widespread use of genome-wide diagnostic screening methods has
greatly increased the frequency with which incidental (but possibly pathogenic)
copy number changes affecting single genes are detected. These findings require
validation to allow appropriate clinical management. Deletion variants can
usually be readily validated using a range of short-read next-generation
sequencing strategies, but the characterization of duplication variants at
nucleotide resolution remains challenging. This presents diagnostic problems,
since pathogenicity cannot generally be assessed without knowing the structure
of the variant. We have used a novel Cas9 enrichment strategy, in combination
with long-read single-molecule nanopore sequencing, to address this need. We
describe the nucleotide-level resolution of two problematic cases, both of whom
presented with neurodevelopmental problems and were initially investigated by
array CGH. In the first case, an incidental 1.7-kb imbalance involving a partial
duplication of <italic>VHL</italic> exon 3 was detected. This variant was
inherited from the patient’s father, who had a history of renal cancer at
38 years. In the second case, an incidental ~200-kb <italic>de
novo</italic> duplication that included <italic>DMD</italic> exons 30-44 was
resolved. In both cases, the long-read data yielded sufficient information to
enable Sanger sequencing to define the rearrangement breakpoints, and creation
of breakpoint-spanning PCR assays suitable for testing of relatives. Our Cas9
enrichment and nanopore sequencing approach can be readily adopted by molecular
diagnostic laboratories for cost-effective and rapid characterization of
challenging duplication-containing alleles. We also anticipate that in future
this method may prove useful for characterizing acquired translocations in
tumour cells, and for precisely identifying transgene integration sites in mouse
models.</p>

<p id="P2">The ubiquitous adoption of short-read next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms
has transformed the availability of diagnostic tests for the analysis of Mendelian
disease genes. Laboratory workflows typically rely on hybridization enrichment reagents
that target the coding regions of genes of interest and can be incorporated into an
automated common laboratory process that also includes production of instrument specific
sequencing libraries. Assay designs are typically constrained by sequencer capacity;
instruments producing a higher yield can accommodate assays targeting a larger genomic
footprint and/or sequence more patient libraries in a single run.
“Population-scale” sequencers, capable of performing cheap whole genome
sequencing (WGS) have been used extensively by large research programs, but they are now
also being deployed in diagnostic practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].
Despite this shift towards WGS, which simplifies laboratory workflows by eliminating the
need for target enrichment, a number of clinically relevant genomic regions are known to
be intractable to analysis by short-read-sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p>
<p id="P3">Two manufacturers, Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies,
currently lead in the production of long-read “third generation”
sequencers. “Real-time” single-molecule sequencing is a defining
characteristic of these new technologies. In the Pacific Biosciences single molecule
real-time (SMRT) workflow, library preparation involves ligation of hairpin adapters to
both ends of the target molecule, creating a circular ‘SMRTbell™’
molecule. In combination with a sequencing primer and polymerase, library fragments
diffuse into a nanoscale observation chamber where the incorporation of fluorescently
labelled nucleotides is recorded. High per-base consensus accuracy is achieved following
multiple polymerase passes around the SMRTbell™, with shorter fragment inserts
enabling a greater number of circuits. Regardless of accuracy, maximum read lengths are
determined by polymerase processivity. By contrast, nanopore sequencing is defined by
changes in ionic current across an isolated membrane, as DNA molecules are ratcheted
through a protein pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Typically,
“1D”-sequencing is performed, which results in a single pass of the DNA
strand. While this restricts per-base accuracy, read-length is limited only by the size
of the DNA molecule (under optimal conditions sequencing reads of up to 2 Mb have been
reported).</p>
<p id="P4">Exploiting the long-read capabilities of third generation sequencers presents a
number of technical challenges. To undertake targeted enrichment of specific genomic
regions, while also maintaining large fragment lengths, various PCR-free approaches have
been developed. Several of these methods are based on components of the bacterial
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system. A
ribonucleoprotein complex comprising a CRISPR-associated protein (such as
<italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9), together with two RNAs (a generic
tracrRNA and a unique crRNA) is sufficient to generate target-specific double-strand
breaks. After such cleavage, various selection methods have been described, ranging from
pulse-field gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] to
hybridization and magnetic bead capture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].
Genomic regions with tandem repeat arrays are particularly attractive targets for
PCR-free workflows, and analyses of a number of clinically relevant loci have been
reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. One UK hospital has obtained ISO15189 diagnostic accreditation to
characterise the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat using nanopore sequencing, albeit using
a PCR-based enrichment approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p>
<p id="P5">Here we describe an approach that enables targeted clinical validation of
duplication sequence variants. We used locus-specific guide RNAs and Cas9 endonuclease
to linearize bulk genomic DNA prior to library preparation and long-read sequencing on
the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION. Our enrichment strategy exploits the
sequencer’s ability to process DNA fragments bound by only a single adapter
molecule, thus eliminating any requirement to perform PCR amplification. We exemplify
this approach using two cases for which the duplication integration site, originally
identified by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), was resolved at nucleotide
resolution. In each case, our long-read findings were confirmed by Sanger sequencing,
allowing a facile diagnostic assay specific for the duplication breakpoint to be
deployed in the extended family.</p>

<p id="P6">DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes using a Chemagic 360 DNA
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Ethical approval for this study was given by the
Leeds East Research Ethics Committee (07/H1306/113).</p>
<p id="P7">Diagnostic aCGH analysis for Case 1 was performed using an Illumina ISCA
8x60K OligoArray (v.2.0) and analyzed using BlueFuse Multi (v.4.1) (Illumina, Inc.,

Ultra™ reagents (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA) following
manufacturer’s protocols. The final library was sequenced on an Illumina
NextSeq500 using paired-end 151-bp reads (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). Raw
data were converted from BCL to fastq.gz format using bcl2fastq v.2.17.1.14. These
data were processed using Cutadapt (v.1.9.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] (for adapter trimming and read quality filtering) prior to alignment

on either the ‘+ or ‘−‘ strand (design IDs and sequences
are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table

of 100 μM crRNA, 1 μl of 100 μM Alt-R<sup>®</sup>
CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA and 8 μl of Duplex buffer (Integrated DNA Technologies,
Inc., Skokie, IL, USA) at 95°C for 5 minutes. For each guide RNA,
ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) were created by combining 6 μl of
10× CutSmart<sup>®</sup> buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA,
USA), 48.8 μl nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O, 4.8 μl of the annealed
crRNA-tracrRNA duplex (10 μM) and 0.4 μl of Alt-R<sup>®</sup>
S.p. HiFi Cas9 V3 (62 μM) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Skokie, IL,
USA), which was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. A dephosphorylation
reaction comprising 3 μl of 10× CutSmart<sup>®</sup> buffer, 3
μl nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O, 21 μl genomic DNA (357 ng/μl)
and 3 μl Quick CIP (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) was incubated at
37°C for 10 minutes then 80°C for 2 minutes. The dephosphorylated DNA
sample was halved before being linearized in separate (+) or (−)
strand-specific cleavage and dA-tailing reactions that comprised 5 μl of Cas9
RNPs, 0.5 μl 10mM dATP (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and 0.5
μl <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (5,000 U/ml) (New England Biolabs,
Ipswich, MA, USA). The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes and then
72°C for 5 minutes. Directional bias is created at the cut site, due to the
retention of bound RNPs on cleaved DNA fragments that are distal to the PAM site.
Cleaved genomic samples were combined, and adapter ligation was performed in a
reaction comprising 20 μl LNB (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK), 10
μl T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), 3 μl
nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O and 5 μl AMX (Oxford Nanopore Technologies,
Oxford, UK), which was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. A 0.3×
Agencourt AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was
performed to allow buffer exchange of the sequencer-ready library and remove excess
unligated adapters and short DNA fragments. The beads were washed twice with 250
μl long fragment buffer and 12 μl of buffer EB eluted library was
recovered following a 10-minute incubation. A MinION FLO-MIN106 flowcell was primed
for loading using SpotON priming mix (30 μl FLT and 1170 μl FLB); 800
μl was initially loaded via the priming port and incubated for 5 minutes. A
further 200 μl was subsequently loaded prior to dropwise addition of the
sequencing mix (which consisted of 12 μl of the eluted library, 25 μl
of SQB and 13 μl of LB) via the SpotON port. A 48-hour sequencing run was
then initiated using MinKNOW software (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford,

<title>Results</title>
<p id="P13">To allow the nucleotide-resolution analysis of genomic duplication events
that are refractory to analysis by short-read sequencing, we developed a simplified
method for target enrichment and long-read sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore
Technologies MinION sequencer. Our goals were to obtain a workflow suitable for
rapid deployment in a diagnostic setting. In addressing this, we aimed both to
eliminate the need for laborious purification of size-selected fragments, and to
avoid the use of PCR. The principle of the approach is that targeted cleavage of the
duplicated region is followed by adapter ligation to the cleaved ends; background
from random DNA fragmentation is reduced by a dephosphorylation reaction prior to
cleavage. In our implementation, a “+” and a “−“
strand-specific guide RNA, positioned within the duplicated sequence, were used to
perform independent strand-specific cleavage reactions. Below, we demonstrate the
utility of this method with reference to two exemplar cases, in each of which an
incidental duplication variant had been identified using routine aCGH.</p>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Case selection and initial molecular analyses</title>
<p id="P14">A 13-year-old boy was referred with suspected autistic spectrum disorder
and learning and social communication difficulties. Array CGH was undertaken,
and a small copy number gain was identified at 3p25.3, which included
<italic>VHL</italic> exon 3. The estimated minimum size of the duplicated
region was 1.7 kb (chr3:10,191,757-10,193,407) and the maximum size was 12.1 kb
(chr3:10,191,474-10,203,584). The aCGH log<sub>2</sub> profile is displayed in
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure
1A</xref>. The duplication was confirmed by MLPA analysis, in which there
were two <italic>VHL</italic> exon 3 probes whose dosage quotient values (1.43
and 1.57) were indicative of one extra copy of the target. Their genomic
locations (01161-L00717 at chr3:10,191,523/4 and 01162-L00718 at chr3:
10,191,592/3) were upstream of the aCGH-defined minimum boundary, enabling the
duplicated interval to be refined by 234 bp.</p>
<p id="P15">The duplication variant was subsequently shown to have been paternally
inherited, with minimum and maximum sizes of 2.48 kb
(chr3:10,191,660-10,194,136) and 14.92 kb (chr3:10,188,692-10,203,613). (The
difference in the reported genomic interval, between the proband and his father,
is due to the two different aCGH platforms; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>.)
Given the involvement of <italic>VHL</italic>, the father’s past history
of renal cancer at 38 years of age was of particular concern. The histology of
this had been of a mixed clear cell and papillary type. Magnetic resonance
imaging of the spine showed a number of L3/L4 vertebral hemangiomas, but
computerized tomography imaging of the left kidney was normal, and no retinal
angiomas were detected. No other notable family history was reported.</p>
<p id="P16">To more closely delineate the variant identified at the
<italic>VHL</italic> locus, whole genome short-read sequencing was performed
in the proband. Summary sequencing metrics for these data are displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.
Six aligned read pairs were identified with a discordant (outward-facing) read
orientation and a larger than expected library insert (&gt;3.7 kb) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Having mapped these data to the
genome browser, we concluded that the duplication boundaries lay outside the
aCGH maximum interval originally identified in the proband. We also identified
only a single region of discontinuity with the reference sequence, suggesting
the presence of only one integration site.</p>
<p id="P17">The second case, a 3-year-old girl, was referred with and speech and
communication delay in addition to learning difficulties. Behavioral
abnormalities, including a lack of play skills, poor spatial awareness, and
repetitive movements, were also noted. On aCGH analysis, a copy number gain was
identified at Xp21.1, including <italic>DMD</italic> exons 30-44. The aCGH
log<sub>2</sub> profile displaying the 195-kb minimum extent
(chrX:32,234,746-32,430,152) and 211-kb maximum extent
(chrX:32,226,980-32,437,515) of the duplicated interval is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>.
MLPA analysis confirmed that the duplication was a single copy gain and was
absent from parental lymphocyte-derived DNA, consistent with it having arisen
<italic>de novo</italic>.</p>

(Data File 1). This analysis yielded 28 reads for Case 1 and 51 reads for Case
2. The remaining reads were not informative, either because they were derived
from the normal allele or because they were too short to span the duplication
integration site.</p>
<p id="P20">For both patients, BLAT-determined 5′ and 3′ mapping
positions confirmed that the duplicated sequence contained only a single
integration site and that the duplication was arranged in tandem (without
inversion). For Case 1, the duplicated sequence begins within the exon 3
untranslated region and incorporates both the distal end of intron 2 and the
proximal end of exon 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Reads
originating from duplication-containing alleles are mostly restricted in length,
because the genomic DNA fragments are truncated due to the presence of two
copies of the cleavage site. However, four <italic>VHL</italic>-aligned reads
from Case 1 were identified for which there was incomplete Cas9 cleavage. The
longest of these was a 53,757-bp read which mapped to the (+) strand and
extended into intron 2 of the adjoining <italic>IRAK2</italic> gene
(NM_001570.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The longest
incompletely digested (−) strand read was 11,497 bp and extended as far
as <italic>VHL</italic> intron 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P21">For Case 2, the duplication begins within <italic>DMD</italic> intron 29
and extends to <italic>DMD</italic> intron 44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>); no incompletely digested reads were identified, which was
probably due to the large genomic distance (~200 kb) between recurring
Cas9 probe sites.</p>
<p id="P22">Genome-wide read distributions were assessed by determining read count
across 500-kb windows. Maximum values, for both cases, were in the window
containing the target locus (see Data File 2). Read counts exceeded the baseline
for a number of other windows (especially those in centromeric regions) however
manual inspection of the read alignments within these windows revealed
low-quality mapping scores.</p>

<title>Validation of long-read sequencing data</title>
<p id="P23">The presence of RepeatMasker-identified elements near the integration
sites of both variants made specific amplification of the region challenging.
Despite this, we generated amplification products, which when sequenced, were
consistent with the long-read data. For Case 1, we confirmed that the variant
intersects two SINE family elements (AluSc8 and AluYa5). A 26-bp region of
identity at either side of the integration site, which may have led to the
formation of the variant, was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure
4A</xref>). The variant integration site was also confirmed to be identical
in the proband and his father. For Case 2, the intron 44 breakpoint intersects
an L1MEc LINE family repeat, and a 10-bp insertion was identified at the
duplication junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P24">When copy number gains are detected by genomic screening methods such as
aCGH or WGS, the genomic localization and orientation of the duplicated material
often remain unknown. This hinders clinical interpretation, particularly when the
patient phenotype does not match the known pathologies attributable to the
duplicated gene. Possible questions that arise include (but are not limited to): Is
the extra genomic material inserted at another genomic locus? Is the duplicated
locus rearranged in another way (<italic>e.g.</italic> inverted)? Is there loss or
gain of material at the breakpoints, not detected by the aCGH? A recently reported
example of an exon 45–51 <italic>DMD</italic> duplication localized to
chromosome 17 (and therefore not disrupting the X-linked <italic>DMD</italic> gene)
highlights the importance of nucleotide-resolution variant characterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p>
<p id="P25">Robust and sensitive techniques for copy number assessment include multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and qPCR. However, these approaches
can only be applied in a targeted locus-specific way. More recently, widely-used
hybridization-capture-based NGS methods (such as exome sequencing) have incorporated
comparative read depth analysis to detect copy-number changes. In principle, this
allows a single laboratory method to be used for detecting both sequence and
copy-number variants across a large number of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. This approach has increased diagnostic yield for many rare disease
genes, for which analyses of copy number were previously infeasible due to the
limited scalability of lower-throughput methods. However, the sensitivity of
mutation detection by this method remains incompletely understood. The size, and
class (deletion <italic>vs.</italic> duplication) and genomic architecture of the
variant are all likely to influence the sensitivity of detection. In addition, the
disproportionately high GC content of many first exons makes them harder to capture
and sequence, reducing the sensitivity of mutation detection in these regions.</p>
<p id="P26">As an alternative to targeted comparative read-depth analysis, array
comparative hybridisation (aCGH) platforms and low-coverage WGS copy number
detection techniques, are enabling the identification of copy number variants (CNVs)
in a genome-wide, hypothesis-free manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. This has led to an increase in the detection of incidental findings, in
the form of CNVs that intersect known OMIM morbid genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Making clinical predictions in the face of such incidental
findings can be difficult, often requiring more detailed laboratory analysis. While
there are numerous short-read NGS approaches for characterizing genomic deletions at
nucleotide resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], defining the
integration site and orientation of a duplicated sequence is a more challenging
task. That these variants typically arise in so-called “dark” regions
of the genome, defined by low-confidence alignments of short-read sequences, further
complicates their analysis.</p>
<p id="P27">The use of Cas9 that we describe, to specifically cleave genomic DNA in the
neighborhood of the duplication, offers a rapid and straightforward assay for the
characterization of duplication variants identified using standard molecular genetic
methods (aCGH, MLPA or comparative read depth analysis of targeted NGS data). The
enrichment methodology is particularly well suited to use with the Oxford Nanopore
Technologies (ONT) range of sequencers, since only one end of the target DNA
fragment requires a ligated adapter in order for sequencing to proceed. Furthermore,
there is also no requirement for a “large-fragment” DNA isolation
workflow, allowing the approach to be readily adopted by diagnostic healthcare
laboratories using samples for which retrospective variant characterization may be
required. We note that only standard laboratory equipment is required to perform our
Cas9 enrichment protocol and less than a few hours of hands-on time are required to
complete the protocol.</p>
<p id="P28">In Case 1, we sought to refine the risk of VHL-associated cancer in a
patient identified to be an incidental carrier of an exon 3 <italic>VHL</italic>
duplication. While we were able to determine that the duplicated sequence is located
at the <italic>VHL</italic> locus, in tandem, in this particular case the functional
and therefore clinical consequence of the rearrangement remains uncertain. Despite
this, molecular characterization of the locus is now complete. Our observation that
the maximal extent of the duplication, in the proband, was inaccurately determined
by aCGH highlights a weakness resulting from the limited number of data points
examined by this technology (as well as our inability to empirically validate the
performance of each aCGH probe). With the adoption of sequence-based methods to
identify copy number variation, using low-coverage whole genome sequencing and
comparative read depth analysis, it is anticipated that this limitation will be
overcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p>
<p id="P29">For Case 2, we again confirmed that the variant is an intragenic duplication
(with 10-bp insertion) arranged in tandem, which is predicted in this case to retain
the reading frame in the mRNA if all exons are spliced. This result also confirms
that the presenting neurodevelopmental phenotype is not accounted for by the
duplicated sequence insertionally disrupting a disease-associated gene elsewhere in
the genome.</p>
<p id="P30">While Cas9 enrichment is a widely applicable methodology, each new assay
requires a specific guide RNA to target the region of interest. <italic>In
vitro</italic> assays using PCR amplification products or synthetic gene
fragments (<italic>e.g.</italic> the Integrated DNA Technologies’
gBlocks<sup>®</sup>) as the reaction substrate, can be used to assess RNP
activity. Despite this, probe specificity cannot be known without empirical data
from a successful cleavage and sequencing reaction on a genomic DNA sample. To
improve the likelihood of cleavage, and the yield of reads at the target locus, it
may be preferable to design multiple guide RNAs located close to one another. Future
improvements to guide RNA design software may also increase probe specificity,
enabling either sample multiplexing or use of the lower-throughput sequencing
devices (<italic>e.g.</italic> the ONT “Flongle” which is available
for a tenth of the price). We achieved approximately 500-fold enrichment in the
vicinity of the cleavage site, which is comparable to a recent report by Gilpatrick
et al., (2019) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Our assessment of
genome-wide read distribution revealed a more or less random distribution of
off-target reads. Manual inspection of windows whose read count visually exceeded
the baseline identified the presence of low-quality alignments and we found no
evidence of off-target Cas9 cleavage hotspots.</p>
<p id="P31">Early short-read library preparation workflows made extensive use of focused
acoustic fragmentation, for the random shearing of genomic DNA. More recently
restriction enzyme-based fragmentation has become a popular alternative. This is in
part due to the lack of expensive equipment needed to setup the digestion reactions,
and the reduction in sample transfer steps between proprietary shearing vessels.
Adjustments to enzyme cocktails, and incubation times (resulting in a partial
digest), allows accurate prediction of restriction-site associated DNA tags and has
become a popular short-read method for SNP discovery and mapping, especially for
model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. As long-read workflows
continue to be developed it is likely that the utility of restriction enzyme-based
approaches will be further demonstrated.</p>
<p id="P32">The lack of PCR, both for fragment enrichment and sequencing, is a
distinctive aspect of our present workflow, and is likely to be advantageous in some
applications. For example, access to genomic variants in some regions can be
difficult (<italic>e.g.</italic> due to the high GC-content typical around exon 1
regions). Similarly, some insertion variants can be refractory to PCR-based methods
because generic thermocycling conditions fail to amplify the modified locus
(<italic>e.g.</italic> when a repeat element expands or a mobile element
integrates within a coding region). Against this must be set the requirement for a
larger mass of starting DNA, which will not be available for all clinical
specimens.</p>
<p id="P33">The ability of long-read “third-generation” sequencers to
identify single-nucleotide and small insertion/deletion variants continues to be
assessed, with several encouraging reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. In our approach, the small number of reads required to determine
the integration site of a targeted structural variant means that manual data
analysis remains feasible. As base-calling accuracy continues to improve, we
envisage that read filtering, on a per-allele (normal <italic>vs.</italic> mutant)
basis, could be performed using the sequence content of each read. This would reduce
ambiguity between reads derived from the “normal allele” and those
reads which were too short to provide informative information about the integration
site.</p>
<p id="P34">In other settings, we anticipate that the approach could be applied to the
identification of somatic gene rearrangements in cancer. That only a single cleavage
reaction is required could aid the discovery and characterization of unknown
translocation partners. Further studies are however needed to determine the
sensitivity of the approach when the allelic fraction of the target locus is skewed.
Outside diagnostics, the method may be useful for the precise characterization of
transgene integration sites in established transgenic mouse models.</p>
<p id="P35">The accurate molecular characterization of structural variants, in cases
where the imbalance is inherited, enables a less resource-intensive assay to be
designed for subsequent testing of family members. In practice, the time required to
iterate through the design and optimization process is highly dependent on the
genomic architecture of the target locus. The two cases reported here as exemplars
proved challenging due to the number of low-complexity repeats close to the
integration site. While the immediate clinical utility of the Cas9-based enrichment
and ONT sequencing for the characterization of other complex variants is evident,
the difficulties associated with the validation of these data will require a more
thorough assessment on a case-by-case basis.</p>
