<p id="Par1">Cocaine addiction is characterized by dysfunction in reward-related brain circuits, leading to maladaptive motivation to seek and take the drug. There are currently no clinically available pharmacotherapies to treat cocaine addiction. Through a broad screen of innate immune mediators, we identify granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a potent mediator of cocaine-induced adaptations. Here we report that G-CSF potentiates cocaine-induced increases in neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex. In addition, G-CSF injections potentiate cocaine place preference and enhance motivation to self-administer cocaine, while not affecting responses to natural rewards. Infusion of G-CSF neutralizing antibody into NAc blocks the ability of G-CSF to modulate cocaine’s behavioral effects, providing a direct link between central G-CSF action in NAc and cocaine reward. These results demonstrate that manipulating G-CSF is sufficient to alter the motivation for cocaine, but not natural rewards, providing a pharmacotherapeutic avenue to manipulate addictive behaviors without abuse potential.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Drug addiction is a debilitating psychiatric condition characterized by dysregulated drug intake, enhanced motivation to both seek and take drugs, persistent use despite negative consequences, and recurring cycles of abstinence and relapse. Treatment of addiction to psychostimulants such as cocaine has proven particularly difficult despite extensive work characterizing the dopaminergic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, glutamatergic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and neuronal signaling cascades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> underlying the neurobiology of cocaine use. Even with our advances in knowledge, targeting these systems clinically in cocaine use disorder has proven to be difficult for a number of reasons, including problems with side effects, routes of delivery, or abuse potential of agents tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, currently there are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for treatment of psychostimulant use disorders.</p>
<p id="Par4">Studies of patients with cocaine use disorders have shown dysregulation of multiple peripheral cytokines—some of which correlate with extent of drug use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and addicts show altered immune system reactivity in response to drug cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While cocaine and other abused drugs are known to have effects on immune system functioning, only recently have studies begun to examine the mechanistic link between altered immune function and pathological substance use behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Here we aimed to define the complex interaction between cocaine use and cytokine signaling and how these factors alter reward, motivation, and economic decision making to drive cocaine addiction.</p>
<p id="Par5">To this end, we characterize the regulation of innate immune system effector proteins in mice treated with cocaine. Via a broad multiplex screen of serum immune factors, we define several that are altered with cocaine exposure. However, while multiple immune factors are regulated by cocaine, only one—granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)—demonstrates upregulation in multiple treatment paradigms as well as correlation with an addictive phenotype. G-CSF has previously been shown to play a neuroprotective role in stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, to delay degeneration in models of neurodegenerative disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and to be important for learning and memory processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that G-CSF is upregulated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, by both cocaine and by the activation of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to NAc projections, and is a potent regulator of both neuronal and behavioral response to cocaine. Together, these findings suggest that manipulation of G-CSF function may represent a new target for possible pharmacotherapies for patients with substance use disorders.</p>

<title>Identification of immune targets altered by cocaine</title>
<p id="Par6">To identify potential soluble factors in blood associated with cocaine use, serum from mice treated with 10 daily doses of cocaine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>—20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> i.p.) or 10 days of self-administration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c, d</xref>—0.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> for each infusion) was processed 24 h after the final dose for multiplex analysis of 32 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. The values for each analyte, represented as the fold-change from the respective saline group, are shown as a heatmap in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref> (Experimenter admin: <italic>n</italic> = 11 saline, 15 cocaine; Self-admin: <italic>n</italic> = 6 saline, 10 cocaine; *<italic>p &lt; </italic>0.05; **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Raw pg/ml values for each analyte and exact <italic>p</italic> values are available in Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>. To identify potential targets for further study, several factors were considered. First, if the effects were due directly to cocaine exposure, we expected the analyte to be significantly altered in the same direction in both experimenter and self-administered cocaine paradigms. Second, if it was related to behavioral response to cocaine, we expected the analyte to be correlated with cocaine sensitization and/or intake during the self-administration period. Several analytes were significantly affected by cocaine exposure, but only two–G-CSF (Experimenter-Admin: two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test; t<sub>(24)</sub> = 2.48, <italic>p = </italic>0.020; Self-Admin: <italic>t</italic>

Interestingly, while some analytes that were significantly regulated in only one paradigm showed a trend in the same direction in the other paradigm (e.g., KC, MIP-2), there were several that showed a relatively strong regulation in one cocaine administration paradigm, but no change at all in the other (for statistics and values, please see Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>). The biological significance of these discrepancies is not clear from these experiments, but our findings highlight important differences between the two administration paradigms.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Serum multiplex analysis after self- and experimenter-administered cocaine in mice. <bold>a</bold> Timeline of experimenter-administered chronic cocaine injections. <bold>b</bold> Cocaine resulted in robust locomotor sensitization (<italic>n</italic> = 10 saline, 9 cocaine; two-way ANOVA–time: F<sub>(1,17)</sub> = 7.795, <italic>p</italic> = 0.013; cocaine treatment: F<sub>(1,17)</sub> = 326.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; interaction: F<sub>(1,17)</sub> = 9.035, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0080; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 vs control). <bold>c</bold> Timeline of cocaine self-administration in mice (saline: <italic>n</italic> = 6 saline; cocaine: <italic>n</italic> = 10). <bold>d</bold> Average daily intake of cocaine across self-administration sessions. <bold>e</bold> Multiplex serum analysis of 32 chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors after experimenter- or self-administered cocaine.

</p>
<p id="Par7">As a marker of which differentially expressed analytes might be playing a role in behavioral responses to cocaine, we performed a correlation analysis between the serum level of each analyte with level of sensitization (in the i.p. injection paradigm), and the amount of average daily cocaine intake (in the self-administration paradigm). A heatmap of Pearson’s r values for all analytes is presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> (full correlation matrices with exact r and <italic>p</italic> values are available in Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>. Interestingly, only serum levels of G-CSF were increased by both experimenter-delivery (two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(24)</sub> = 2.48, <italic>p = </italic>0.020) and cocaine self-administration paradigms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>; t<sub>(9.40)</sub> = 2.51, <italic>p = </italic>0.032) and showed positive linear correlation with extent of both sensitization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>; Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.771, <italic>p = </italic>0.025) and self-administration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1i</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = 0.768, <italic>p = </italic>0.026). While G-CSF showed both regulation and correlation in both paradigms, this was not true for all regulated cytokines. Monokine-induced by gamma interferon (MIG, also known as CXCL9) was upregulated only after cocaine self-administration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1j</xref>; <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(10.3)</sub> = 3.74, <italic>p = </italic>0.0036), and showed positive correlation with levels of self-administration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1l</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = 0.766, <italic>p = </italic>0.027). However, levels of MIG were completely unaffected by experimenter-administered cocaine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1j</xref>; <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(24)</sub> = 0.177, <italic>p = </italic>0.86) and unrelated to cocaine-induced sensitization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1k</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = −0.361, <italic>p = </italic>0.38). Similarly, levels of IL-1α were significantly downregulated in both cocaine administration paradigms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1m</xref>—exper-admin: <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(13.6)</sub> = 2.19, <italic>p = </italic>0.047; self-admin.: <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(13)</sub> = 7.29, <italic>p &lt; </italic>0.0001), but showed no correlation with either behavior (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1n, o</xref>). Based on this evidence for the unique regulation of G-CSF by cocaine, it was chosen as the subject of more in depth functional analyses.</p>

<title>Identifying the effects of G-CSF on neuronal activation</title>
<p id="Par8">Because we found that serum G-CSF levels were highly correlated with the extent of cocaine experience, we aimed to define where in the brain it might influence cocaine responses. Despite being a ~20 kDa protein, G-CSF is a soluble factor that readily crosses the blood brain barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To identify G-CSF-responsive brain regions, we assessed transcript levels of the immediate early gene <italic>c-Fos</italic>, which is used as a marker of neuronal activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, after an acute i.p. injection of cocaine across several regions implicated in the motivation to self-administer cocaine: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal striatum, ventral hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). In the medial prefrontal cortex we saw the expected main effect of cocaine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>; two-way ANOVA F<sub>(1,27)</sub> = 16.41, <italic>p = </italic>0.0004), a main effect of G-CSF (F<sub>(1,27)</sub> = 5.243, <italic>p</italic> = 0.030), and a trend towards a cocaine by G-CSF interaction (F<sub>(1,27)</sub> = 3.759, <italic>p = </italic>0.063). Post-hoc analysis revealed significantly enhanced <italic>c-Fos</italic> induction when comparing cocaine alone to cocaine + G-CSF (Holm–Sidak post-hoc: <italic>p</italic> = 0.026), but no effect when comparing saline to saline + G-CSF (<italic>p = </italic>0.80). We saw a similar pattern in the nucleus accumbens with a main effect of cocaine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>; F<sub>(1,29)</sub> = 33.62, <italic>p &lt; </italic>0.0001), as well as a statistically significant main effect of G-CSF (F<sub>(1,29)</sub> = 6.803, <italic>p = </italic>0.014) which was driven by a G-CSF by cocaine interaction (F<sub>(1,29)</sub> = 5.215, <italic>p = </italic>0.030). As with the medial prefrontal cortex, in the nucleus accumbens of mice pre-treated with G-CSF there was significantly enhanced potentiation of <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression after cocaine compared to cocaine alone (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0059). This pattern was not seen in the other brain regions analyzed: there was a significant main effect of cocaine increasing <italic>c-Fos</italic> levels in the dorsal striatum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>; F<sub>(1,28)</sub> = 20.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and the ventral hippocampus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>; F<sub>(1,24)</sub> = 11.46, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0024), but there were no main effects of G-CSF or any significant interactions, and in the basolateral amygdala we found no significant main effects or interactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>G-CSF potentiates cocaine-induced neuronal activation in specific brain regions. <bold>a</bold> Experimental Timeline (left).

<title>Regulation of G-CSF gene expression in the NAc and mPFC</title>
<p id="Par10">Given that G-CSF treatment controls patterns of neuronal activation in the NAc and mPFC in response to cocaine, we examined how treatment with cocaine might affect the expression of G-CSF and its receptor locally within these regions. Transcript for G-CSF itself (<italic>Csf3</italic>) was significantly induced in both regions 90 min after an acute (20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) i.p. injection of cocaine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>; two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test—NAc: t<sub>(17)</sub> = 2.60, *<italic>p = </italic>0.019; mPFC: <italic>t</italic>

The primary output neurons in the NAc are composed of two primarily non-overlapping populations of GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), defined by the predominant expression of D1 or D2 dopamine receptors. Thus, we performed immunohistochemistry to examine both expression levels of G-CSF and its receptor in these two subpopulations using mice that express tdTomato under the control of the D1 receptor promoter, and thereby identifying both D1<sup>+</sup> and D1<sup>−</sup> populations. G-CSFR was highly expressed in both D1<sup>+</sup> and D1<sup>−</sup> cell populations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref> upper), suggesting expression in both cell types.

<title>G-CSF in the NAc is increased by mPFC to NAc stimulation</title>
<p id="Par13">While there were clear increases in G-CSF expression in NAc following cocaine exposure, we aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. To this end, a two-part experiment was designed to determine if central or peripheral actions of cocaine were critical in G-CSF induction. First, we aimed to determine if increases in the activity of specific projection pathways in brain were capable of increasing central or peripheral G-CSF levels using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). Second, using a cocaine analog (cocaine methiodide) that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, we tested the effects of increased peripheral cocaine on central and peripheral G-CSF levels.</p>
<p id="Par14">In the first series of experiments, a retrograde traveling CAV2 virus that drove the expression of Cre-recombinase was injected into the NAc. Cre-dependent expression of the excitatory G<sub>q</sub>-coupled DREADD receptor was then induced in either the mPFC or the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This allows for pathway-specific stimulation of the mPFC to NAc or VTA to NAc projections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). 7 days of daily clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) injections (1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, i.p.) robustly increased the expression of <italic>Csf3</italic> in the NAc after mPFC to NAc, but not after VTA to NAc, stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref> One-way ANOVA - Main effect: F<sub>(2,12)</sub> = 13.4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0009; Sidak post-hoc: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0037).

<title>G-CSF enhances cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization</title>
<p id="Par16">To examine a possible causal link between systemic G-CSF and locomotor sensitization to cocaine, mice were injected i.p. with PBS or G-CSF (50 μg kg<sup>−1</sup>) on the morning of each monitoring day one hour before testing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). For the first 2 days, animals then received a saline injection and activity was monitored. Importantly, G-CSF on its own had no effect on locomotor behavior.

Holm–Sidak’s post-hoc testing revealed that there were significantly different effects on days 2–5 of cocaine treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>), but not on the first day of cocaine—demonstrating that systemic G-CSF enhances locomotor responses to repeated injections of cocaine. It is noteworthy that in this set of experiments the PBS-treated animals seemed to show a delayed sensitization curve, however, the G-CSF treated animals were indeed increased when both groups seem to have reached a plateau at day 5. Importantly, given that G-CSF can mobilize immune cells from the bone marrow, we ensured that prolonged treatment with G-CSF at this dose does not cause infiltration of peripheral monocytes into the brain parenchyma (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>G-CSF enhances cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization and CPP.

<title>G-CSF alters preference formation specifically for cocaine</title>
<p id="Par17">While locomotor sensitization reflects behavioral plasticity associated with repeated cocaine exposure, it is dissociable from the subjective “rewarding” effects of cocaine. To assess whether systemic G-CSF also alters the ability of an animal to associate predictive contextual cues with the rewarding properties of cocaine, we used an unbiased conditioned place preference (CPP) assay in mice (typically used as a measure of cocaine “reward”)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We tested a range of cocaine doses beginning with a dose that does not lead to formation of preference in control animals (3.75 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) up to a relatively high dose (15 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) which does. For these experiments, animals were injected with G-CSF on each morning of the paradigm to maintain a high serum level of G-CSF. Treatment with G-CSF resulted in a significant leftward shift of the dose response curve (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>; two-way ANOVA main effect of G-CSF: F<sub>(1,36)</sub> = 11.76, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0015) leading to the formation of a robust preference for the lowest cocaine dose–which did not result in significant preference in control animals (Holm-Sidak post-Hoc: <italic>p</italic> = 0.028; <italic>n</italic> = 6 PBS, 9 G-CSF) – and a significantly enhanced preference for the 7.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> dose (Holm–Sidak post-Hoc: <italic>p</italic> = 0.035; <italic>n</italic> = 6 PBS, 10 G-CSF), but no change at the highest dose (Holm–Sidak post-Hoc: <italic>p</italic> = 0.38; <italic>n</italic> = 5 saline, 6 G-CSF).</p>
<p id="Par18">We next determined whether G-CSF has rewarding value on its own. In the first experiment, mice were injected with G-CSF each morning similar to the treatments used in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>, but in this case both chambers were paired with saline. Animals did not form any preference or aversion for either chamber (two-tailed Student’s t-test: t<sub>(7)</sub> = 0.0862, <italic>p</italic> = 0.93). In addition, we determined if animals would form associations between predictive contextual cues and G-CSF itself. We found no preference or aversion that resulted from G-CSF pairings (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>
<italic>t</italic>

<p id="Par19">We next determined if G-CSF’s modulatory effects on cocaine reward learning were specific to cocaine or generalized to natural reward-related behaviors. We thus performed a two-bottle sucrose preference task in which animals choose between a water bottle and another bottle with sucrose. Mice were treated daily with G-CSF. We found no difference between the two treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>; two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test: <italic>t</italic>

</p>
<p id="Par22">Rats were then treated with G-CSF (50 μg kg<sup>−1</sup> i.p.) on the evening following the last acquisition session and each morning 30 min before each self-administration testing session to ensure that G-CSF levels were adequately increased during testing. First, animals underwent testing using a behavioral economics threshold procedure, which is a within-session method used to assess an animal’s motivation to self-administer a reinforcer in the face of increasing price (in this model price is equated to the number of responses that the animal must emit to obtain 1 mg of drug)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref> shows the dose-response curve indicating that G-CSF-treated animals lever-pressed more at lower doses as compared to PBS-treated animals. It is important to note that in this experiment price is inversely related to dose, where an increase in price (in responses per mg) is because the dose is low. Animals pre-treated with G-CSF increased the number of responses for lower doses of cocaine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>; repeated-measures two-way ANOVA: main effect of G-CSF: F<sub>(1,15)</sub> = 4.623, <italic>p</italic> = 0.048).</p>
<p id="Par23">The threshold procedure is particularly powerful because it allows for the application of economic principles to drug consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In this task, animals self-administer cocaine on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement with no time outs. The dose starts high, therefore the price the animal has to pay in effort (relative price = number of responses that the animal must emit to obtain 1 mg of drug) is very low. As the session progresses, the dose is lowered, and animals’ response rates will increase. While the responses increase, the relative drug consumption stays the same. This allows the data to be plotted as demand curves by plotting consumption as a function of price. Animals will maintain a preferred drug level when the cost is low and continue maintaining this level as the price of cocaine increases. Eventually the cost becomes too great and the animal will choose to reduce its intake. The inflection point of the curve occurs at P<sub>max</sub>, the maximal price the animal is willing to pay for its preferred dose of drug. Animals pretreated with PBS had a P<sub>max</sub> of ~150 responses per milligram (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8e</xref>). Animals pretreated with G-CSF had significantly higher P<sub>max</sub> at around 225 responses per milligram (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8f, h</xref>; two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test: <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(14)</sub> = 2.002, <italic>p</italic> = 0.033). Group demand curves were significantly different (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8g</xref>; repeated-measures two-way ANOVA: main effect of price: F<sub>(9,135)</sub> = 72.88, <italic>p &lt; </italic>0.0001; main effect of G-CSF: F<sub>(1,15)</sub> = 5.036, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04), further substantiating the interpretation of an increase in motivation induced by G-CSF.</p>
<p id="Par24">In addition to the G-CSF-induced increase in motivation, there was an increase in <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>0</sub>, a measure of cocaine intake (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8i</xref>; <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(14)</sub> = 2.374, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016). Further supporting that G-CSF increased consummatory behavior, intake was also increased on FR1 schedule of reinforcement (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8j</xref>; <italic>t</italic>
<sub>(15)</sub> = 2.87, *<italic>p</italic> = 0.12). To assess how G-CSF affected the appetitive and consummatory responses controlled by natural rewards, we performed a similar threshold task using food reward, in which rats were treated with G-CSF or PBS prior to the threshold sessions. Interestingly, G-CSF did not affect <italic>Q</italic>
<sub>0</sub> or P<sub>max</sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3b, c</xref>). Altogether, G-CSF increases both the motivation to self-administer cocaine and the amount of cocaine an animal wants to consume while not affecting either parameter for natural rewards.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par25">Here, using quantitative serum multiplex analysis, we identify G-CSF as an innate immune factor upregulated peripherally and within the NAc by multiple paradigms of cocaine administration. By using in vivo manipulations of G-CSF function, we identify its role in promoting neural responses to cocaine, as measured by upregulation of <italic>c-Fos</italic>, and find that G-CSF is a potent enhancer of behavioral responses to cocaine, but not natural rewards, in multiple behavioral tasks. Our data suggest that the locus of effect for G-CSF in both neural and behavioral responses to cocaine is the NAc, a limbic structure well characterized for its role in addictive behaviors.</p>
<p id="Par26">Of the many analytes we evaluated initially, G-CSF was chosen for further study as it was found to be upregulated by both experimenter-administered and self-administered cocaine, and in a manner that correlated with behavioral output in response to the drug. Interestingly, a number of other cytokines were upregulated in one paradigm or another—an effect that may be due to myriad causes. First, the pattern of intake in experimenter-administered cocaine is that of a large bolus of drug given over a few seconds. Self-administering animals took less total drug over the course of the experiment, and the infusions were in small doses spaced over several hours. The longer-spaced intake might explain why some analytes such as IL-6 and KC showed matching directional changes in both paradigms, but with smaller amplitude of effect in self-administering animals. The bolus dosing that is achieved with experimenter-administered cocaine results in a larger surge of sympathetic nervous system activity, which has been shown to alter immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, the voluntary nature of self-administering cocaine is complicated and results from combinatorial effects of multiple circuits involved in decision making, motivation, and assessing subjective value of the drug. In experimenter-delivered paradigms all animals are given the same amount of drug without volitional control, which can alter the subjective perception of the drug. This is important, as pattern, drug level, and preferred intake level have been shown to play a critical role in drug-induced plasticity and neural adaptations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par27">While this is one of the first studies to directly and causally link a soluble immune factor to motivation for drugs of abuse, this is not the first study to demonstrate neuroimmune interactions in response to cocaine. Cocaine has long been known to have effects on immune function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and is thought to increase the risk of HIV infection even when controlling for behavioral covariates in drug-abusing populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Studies in humans have shown alterations in cytokines long after cessation of drug use, with some of the abnormalities correlating with extent of previous use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, treatment-seeking cocaine users show enhanced serum expression of pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and decreased anti-inflammatory IL-10 in response to either stress or drug cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par28">These human studies provide correlational evidence of clinical relevance of neuroimmune interactions in the behavioral response to cocaine, but mechanistic studies examining the basis of such interactions have only begun to be published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A recent study by Northcutt and colleagues used in silico modeling and binding assays to demonstrate cocaine activation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Activation of TLR4 and downstream production of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) in the VTA was found to be crucial for striatal dopamine release, expression of cocaine place preference and self-administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In our peripheral cytokine assays, we found IL-1β was expressed at very low levels after experimenter-administered cocaine, and showed a trend toward an increase after self-administered cocaine, but no correlation was seen with behavioral output. Another recent study found that TNF-α specifically released from microglia in the NAc was a key modulator of neuronal and behavioral plasticity in response to cocaine, and served as a brake on the development of locomotor sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. We did not find significant upregulation of TNF-α in our samples, but there was a strong trend toward positive correlation between TNF-α levels and cocaine self-administration. It is important to note that our assays were serum based, and the studies from Lewitus et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and Northcutt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> were both focused on central cytokine signaling, with the Lewitus study focusing specifically on microglial-derived TNF-α. In a number of other studies, G-CSF has been shown to reduce CNS levels of both TNF-α and IL-1β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and one possible mechanism by which it may be having its effect in our study is via affecting the production of other immune mediators. Future studies will focus on how G-CSF affects other innate and adaptive immune mediators in ways that influence behavioral responses to drugs of abuse.</p>
<p id="Par29">Once G-CSF was identified as a cytokine altered by cocaine exposure, the next goal was to determine the role of G-CSF in modulating cocaine-associated behaviors and to define the precise neural mechanisms that control these effects. The receptor for G-CSF has been shown to be expressed on neurons throughout the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, suggesting a role as a modulator of neuronal activity. Indeed, G-CSF has been shown to induce <italic>c-Fos</italic>, a marker of cellular activation, in midbrain neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In our study, mRNA levels of G-CSF and its receptor were induced in the NAc after acute and chronic cocaine treatment, suggesting a role for mesolimbic system modulation in these cocaine-mediated behavioral effects. This prompted further investigation into the cellular localization of G-CSF and its receptor in the NAc. We observed expression in D1 and D2 MSNs, as well as in glial cells, showing that receptor localization alone likely did not confer any pathway-specific actions.</p>
<p id="Par30">One important feature of G-CSF, defined within this study, is its ability to modulate cocaine-induced behavioral outputs independent of any rewarding effects of G-CSF itself. Further, G-CSF did not alter sucrose preference, food-maintained responding on low effort schedules, or motivation for food rewards, suggesting that G-CSF could provide a powerful tool to modulate addictive behaviors with limited side effects on naturally rewarding stimuli. The disparity between the modulation of drug and food is particularly interesting; however, not surprising. While motivation for food and drugs of abuse are modulated by some of the same circuitry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, motivation for food has many redundant pathways that can modulate motivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Further, homeostatic pathways driving food intake are tightly regulated and are modulated by internal state and need<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. It is possible that G-CSF is only capable of modulating reward behaviors that are particularly salient. It would be interesting in the future to conduct experiments that modulate satiety state to determine if G-CSF is capable of altering motivation for food when need is high.</p>
<p id="Par31">Our studies provide insight into the central role of G-CSF in controlling the neural and behavioral responses to cocaine and define the locus of these effects to specific projection pathways. G-CSF signaling in the NAc was critical in modulating the behavioral responses to cocaine, as a G-CSF-neutralizing antibody injected peripherally resulted in only a slight decrease in the formation of cocaine conditioned place preference, but infusion directly into the NAc robustly decreased behavior. Further, <italic>c-Fos</italic> has been shown to be robustly induced in NAc by acute cocaine exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, and we found that pre-treatment with systemic G-CSF significantly potentiated this induction, suggesting that G-CSF acts to increase the activity of cells in the NAc either directly or through modulation of inputs into the region. Interestingly, c-Fos was also increased in the mPFC and the increased activity was correlated between the mPFC and NAc regions, suggesting that activity of this specific projection pathway may play a role.</p>
<p id="Par32">We conducted two separate experiments to determine how cocaine was acting to increase G-CSF levels within the brain. First, we used a brain impenetrable cocaine analog, cocaine methiodide, to see if central actions of cocaine were necessary to increase G-CSF levels. We did not see increases in either central or peripheral levels of G-CSF, suggesting that the increase in serum G-CSF is dependent on some component of signaling from the CNS and that cocaine induction of G-CSF in NAc requires central actions of the drug.</p>
<p id="Par33">Second, we used pathway-specific DREADD stimulation to determine if activation of mPFC to NAc or VTA to NAc circuits in isolation were sufficient on their own to change G-CSF levels. We found that G-CSF and its receptor in the NAc were induced only by stimulation of the glutamatergic mPFC to NAc pathway, but not the VTA to NAc pathway. Interestingly, G-CSF is also robustly and rapidly upregulated in the CNS in response to stroke or other neuronal insults in which there is rapid upregulation of glutamatergic signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and has repeatedly been shown to be neuroprotective in models of stroke and neurodegenerative conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the case of cocaine abuse, this sets forth an interesting positive feed-forward model where cocaine-induced activation of the mPFC to NAc pathway is capable of increasing brain G-CSF levels. G-CSF in the brain can then enhance cocaine-induced neuronal activation in these regions, further augmenting the rewarding and reinforcing properties of cocaine itself.</p>
<p id="Par34">While we have defined a causal role of G-CSF in several models of cocaine reward, motivation, and the plasticity induced by repeated exposure, one of the most interesting things about G-CSF was its lack of effect on its own. G-CSF did not induce CPP or lead to a large increase in <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression in brain, but rather played a role in enhancing stimulus-driven activation and learning mechanisms. In our behavioral assays, G-CSF augments the formation of locomotor sensitization in response to cocaine, leads to enhanced formation of conditioned place preference, and enhances motivation to self-administer cocaine, but does not affect preference for, or intake of, natural rewards. Other studies have demonstrated significant behavioral and cognitive effects of G-CSF in animal models. Mice with a constitutive knockout of G-CSF have significantly impaired performance on a Morris Water Maze task, and do not form hippocampal LTP in ex vivo slice preparations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Treatment of animals with exogenous G-CSF during a spatial learning task enhances acquisition of the task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and cognitive impairments in animal models of Alzheimer’s pathology are slowed or reversed by treatment with G-CSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. It is possible that signaling downstream of G-CSF enhances synaptic connectivity in ways that promote associations of context or cues with a rewarding stimulus such as cocaine.</p>
<p id="Par35">Giving further credence to this idea is our self-administration data showing that G-CSF modulates performance, without disrupting it, on tasks where animals are making complex decisions about economic value. This is important for two reasons. First, it is important that simple measures of reward are not contaminated with reductions in arousal, attention, or cognitive performance. For tasks like conditioned place preference, this can be the case as it depends on associative learning mechanisms. Thus, animals that cannot attend to cues or have impaired memory will exhibit behaviors that look like reduced reward. However, with behavioral economics tasks, animals have to make complex decisions in a changing environment; thus, a drug that alters factors other than motivation and reward value would prevent animals from effectively completing the task. G-CSF did not alter the ability of animals to complete the self-administration tasks, suggesting that it modulates reward and reinforcement directly. Second, a major shortcoming of some behavioral paradigms is that findings have not translated to the clinic. Behavioral economics provides a potential tool to improve this translation. Indeed, P<sub>max</sub> is disrupted in drug-addicted human subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and is directly correlated with addiction severity, where increased P<sub>max</sub>, and reduced sensitivity to cost, are characteristics of drug addiction. Thus, treatments that allow individuals to reduce the value that they place on cocaine, without disrupting decision-making processes, are critical to develop cocaine treatments. G-CSF has these components, and here we show that G-CSF can directly modulate P<sub>max</sub> and that reducing G-CSF levels reduces cocaine reward, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of drug addiction.</p>
<p id="Par36">Altogether, this work has defined the role of a soluble immune factor in complex behavior related to addiction, defined the mechanistic and causal role G-CSF in this process, and provides a potential pharmacotherapeutic target to improve treatment outcomes in addicted individuals. While these studies suggest that increases in G-CSF may be maladaptive in the setting of drug abuse, targeted manipulations of G-CSF and its downstream signaling pathways may represent tractable treatment strategies. These findings represent an important advance in the understanding of the pathophysiology of, and possible treatment for, substance use disorders. Identification of an innate immune effector that is capable of affecting behavioral responses to cocaine has high relevance for potential clinical translation, and recombinant G-CSF has been FDA-approved for many years to treat neutropenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> and is now in clinical trials for both stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> and Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The idea of using an immune modulator to treat psychiatric pathology is not novel, and early stage clinical trials of pharmacotherapies aimed at targeting the immune system have shown promise in treating major depressive disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Treatment with a G-CSF modulator would have the distinct advantage that it may be harnessed to reduce drug taking while ostensibly having no abuse potential on its own—a known confound in many previous trials for psychostimulant use disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. While further study and care will be necessary before transitioning these findings toward a clinical population, we posit that this study represents the possibility of a highly tractable strategy for clinical translation with a good potential for success.</p>

<p id="Par41">To assess the effects of peripheral cocaine on expression of G-CSF in both the periphery and the CNS we utilized the charge cocaine analog cocaine methiodide—which does not cross the blood brain barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> to dissociate central vs. peripheral effects. For these experiments animals received daily injections of cocaine methiodide (20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) or saline for 7 days and were then sacrificed 24 h after the final dose for analysis.</p>

<title>Locomotor sensitization</title>
<p id="Par42">Locomotor sensitization was measured, as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Activity was monitored in rat-sized cages free of bedding that were set up in a locomotor apparatus designed to measure extent of ambulations in the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> planes. On each of the assessment days the animals were given an injection of G-CSF (50 μg kg<sup>−1</sup>, i.p.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> in their home cage 30 min prior to injection of saline or cocaine. On the first 2 days of each experiment the animals then received an i.p. injection of normal saline (10 ml kg<sup>−1</sup>) and locomotor activity was monitored for 45 min. For each of the next 5 days animals were injected with 7.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> cocaine i.p. and their activity was monitored for 45 min.</p>

<title>Conditioned place preference</title>
<p id="Par43">An unbiased conditioned place preference assay was carried out as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. In brief, mice were evaluated for cocaine place preference using three chambered CPP Med Associates boxes and software. The two end chambers have distinct visual (gray vs. striped walls) and tactile (small grid vs. large grid flooring) cues to allow differentiation. On the pre-test day, animals were allowed to freely explore all three chambers for 20 min and those that showed a significant preference for one of the two chambers were excluded from further analysis (&lt;10% of animals tested). Groups were then balanced and adjusted to balance out any pre-existing chamber bias. For G-CSF dose–response experiments, animals were injected each day with G-CSF (50 μg kg<sup>−1</sup>, i.p.) in their home cage one hour prior to the start of any conditioning. For G-CSF neutralizing antibody experiments animals were injected with anti-G-CSF antibody (10 μg, i.p.) one hour before the start of each day, and minipump animals had anti-G-CSF infused into the NAc at a rate of 1 μg/side/day (details below). CPP was carried out by pairing an injection of saline with one chamber in the morning, and a second injection of cocaine (3.75, 7.5, 15 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) with the other chamber in the afternoon for two consecutive days. A cocaine dose of 7.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> was used for G-CSF antibody experiments. Conditioned place preference testing was carried out on the fourth day when each animal was again allowed to explore all chambers freely. Place preference score was taken as time on the cocaine paired side—time on the saline paired side.</p>

<title>Minipump experiments</title>
<p id="Par44">Mice were surgically implanted with two subcutaneous Alzet minipumps (Durect corporation model 1007D) and bilateral guide cannulae (Plastics One) targeting the nucleus accumbens. On the day before surgery cannulae were loaded with antibody solution and attached to pumps filled with either anti-G-CSF or pre-immune IgG. The pumps were set to each deliver 1 μg of antibody/day based on flow rate. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with Ketamine (100 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) and Xylazine (10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) and an incision was made over the skull and the skin over the scapulae was blunt dissected from underlying fascia to allow for implantation of the pumps. Bilateral cannulae were delivered into the NAc according to previously published coordinates (From bregma: anteroposterior, + 1.5; mediolateral, + 1.0; dorsoventral, −4.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. The cannulae were permanently fixed to the skull with Loctite adhesive, and cannulae tubing and pumps were all secured under the skin using several interrupted sutures.</p>

<title>Sucrose preference</title>
<p id="Par45">To test for preference for natural rewards individually housed mice were allowed to habituate to two bottles of water for 1 day followed by three consecutive days of one bottle of water and one bottle of 1% sucrose. The bottles were weighed daily and the side was switched each day to prevent animals forming a preference for location. The ratio of sucrose/water intake was used as the measure of preference.</p>

<title>Self-Administration surgery and training</title>
<p id="Par46">Rats and mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) and xylazine (10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) and implanted with chronic indwelling jugular catheters as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Animals were singly housed, and all sessions took place during the active/dark cycle (1200–1500 hours). After a 6-day recovery period, animals underwent training for self-administration where they were given access to a cocaine-paired lever on a fixed ratio one (FR1) schedule, which, upon responding, initiated an intravenous injection of cocaine (0.8 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> for rats, 0.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> for mice, infused over 5 s). After each response/infusion, the lever was retracted and a stimulus light was illuminated for a 20 s timeout period. A second lever (the inactive lever) was available; however, responding on this lever was recorded, but resulted in no programmed consequence. Acquisition was considered to have occurred when an animal allocated &gt; 70% of their responses on the active lever (and &gt; 20 injections) for two consecutive days and a stable pattern of infusion intervals was present. Subsequently animals went on to complete the threshold procedure (described in detail below) to assess how GCSF altered the motivational properties of cocaine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec23">
<title>Threshold procedure</title>
<p id="Par47">Following acquisition of cocaine self-administration, the threshold procedure was used to determine differences in cocaine consumption and motivation between groups. A total of 20 animals underwent surgery and 4 were discarded to do catheter failure or failure to meet acquisition criteria. A total of 16 animals performed the threshold procedure. For this procedure, rats were injected with G-CSF (50 μg kg<sup>−1</sup>) thirty minutes prior to each testing session<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The threshold procedure is a behavioral economics approach to assessing drug taking/seeking and reinforcing efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. It consists of giving rats access to reinforcer while increasing the price, in effort, an animal must pay to obtain the reward. For the procedure with cocaine a descending series of 11 unit doses of cocaine (421, 237, 133, 75, 41, 24, 13, 7.5, 4.1, 2.4, and 1.3 μg/injection) are available on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement with no timeout. Each dose is available for 10 min, with each bin presented consecutively across the 110-min session. A similar approach was used for food reinforcement; however, increasing price was achieved by increasing the FR requirement (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 25, 31, 44, 56, 78, 100) to obtain each food pellet. During this time, the lever is never retracted, and the only time out periods occur during the infusion of cocaine or the delivery of food. By plotting the consumption of cocaine or food as a function of price (number of responses need to obtain 1 mg of cocaine/food) demand curves are generated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>) and behavioral economic principles can be applied to assess a variety of economic measures (described in detail below). During the initial bins of the procedure the dose is high, thus minimal effort is needed to obtain a preferred level of drug, i.e., the cost of cocaine is low. With decreasing doses the cost progressively increases and animals are required to exert more effort to obtain their preferred level of cocaine. Eventually, the dose becomes low enough that preferred levels of cocaine cannot be maintained and responding decreases. This point, where the cocaine level cannot be maintained (i.e., the first derivative point slope of the function = −1) is termed the P<sub>max</sub>, or the maximal price paid. P<sub>max</sub> is directly correlated with traditional measures of reinforcing efficacy like progressive ratio responding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Shifts in responding across the demand curve can be analyzed using behavioral economics principles, as described below. Responding during the first bin of the procedure is considered to reflect a loading phase and is not included in the analyses.</p>
<p id="Par48">Behavioral economic analysis was used to determine the parameters of maximal price paid (P<sub>max</sub>) and consumption at a minimally constraining price (<italic>Q</italic>
<sub>0</sub>), as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Briefly, P<sub>max</sub> and Q<sub>0</sub> values were derived mathematically using a demand curve. Demand curves were generated by curve-fitting individual animals’ intake using an equation: log(<italic>Q</italic>) = log(<italic>Q</italic>

In this equation, P<sub>max</sub> was determined to be the unit price at which the first derivative point slope of the function = −1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. The value k was set to two for all animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par49">
<italic>Q</italic>
<sub>0</sub>
<underline>:</underline>
<italic>Q</italic>
<sub>0</sub> is a measure of the animals’ preferred level of cocaine consumption. This can be measured when the dose is high and cocaine is available at low effort, or a minimally constraining price. This preferred level of consumption is established in the early bins of the threshold procedure.</p>
<p id="Par50">P<sub>max</sub>: Price is expressed as the responses emitted to obtain 1 mg of cocaine, thus as the dose is decreased in each consecutive bin of the threshold procedure, price increases. As the session progresses, animals must increase responding on the active lever in order to maintain stable intake. P<sub>max</sub> is the price at which the animal no longer emits enough responses to maintain intake and consumptions decreases. Thus, animals with higher P<sub>max</sub> will increase responding to maintain cocaine levels farther into the demand curve; in other words, they will pay a higher price for cocaine. Previous work has demonstrated that P<sub>max</sub> is highly correlated with break points on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, confirming that the threshold procedure accurately assesses reinforcing efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p id="Par51">For these studies, we utilized two transgenic mouse lines. CX3CR1<sup>GFP</sup>/CCR2<sup>RFP</sup> mice express GFP in microglia and RFP in peripherally derived monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>, and were generously provided by Dr. Miriam Merad. In addition, to identify cells expressing the D1-type dopamine receptor we utilized D1-tomato mice purchased from Jackson Labs (Stock #: 016204). Staining was performed using previously published methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Briefly, mice were transcardially perfused first with ice-cold PBS and then with a fixative solution containing 4% PFA paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were post-fixed for 24 h in 4% PFA at 4 °C. Sections of 30 µm thickness were cut in the frontal plane with a vibratome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) and stored at −20 °C in a solution. Sections were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, followed by blocking with 35 normal donkey serum. Primary antibodies against G-CSF (Abcam, ab181053, 1:500 dilution), GCSF-Receptor (Life Science, LS-C393437, 1:100 dilution) and ds-Red/tdTomato (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-390909, 1:500) were diluted in blocking solution and sections incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, donkey anti-goat Rhodamine Red, donkey anti-rabbit Cy5; Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:500 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, sections were incubated for 5 min with DAPI (NucBlue, Invitrogen) to achieve counterstaining of nuclei before mounting in Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). Protein expression was assessed in the nucleus accumbens using a LSM 710 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) imaged using a ×20, ×40 or ×63 objective with a 1.0 digital zoom.</p>
