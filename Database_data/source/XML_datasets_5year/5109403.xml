<abstract>
<p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder typically arising from spontaneous mutations in the X-chromosomal methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (<italic>MECP2</italic>) gene. The almost exclusively female Rett patients show an apparently normal development during their first 6–18 months of life. Subsequently, cognitive- and motor-impairment, hand stereotypies, loss of learned skills, epilepsy and irregular breathing manifest. Early mitochondrial impairment and oxidative challenge are considered to facilitate disease progression. Along this line, we recently confirmed <italic>in vitro</italic> that acute treatment with the vitamin E-derivative Trolox dampens neuronal hyperexcitability, reinstates synaptic plasticity, ameliorates cellular redox balance and improves hypoxia tolerance in male MeCP2-deficient (<italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic>) mouse hippocampus. Pursuing these promising findings, we performed a preclinical study to define the merit of systemic Trolox administration. Blinded, placebo-controlled <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment of male mice started at postnatal day (PD) 10–11 and continued for ~40 days. Compounds (vehicle only, 10 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg Trolox) were injected intraperitoneally every 48 h. Detailed phenotyping revealed that in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice, blood glucose levels, lipid peroxidation, synaptic short-term plasticity, hypoxia tolerance and certain forms of environmental exploration were improved by Trolox. Yet, body weight and size, motor function and the rate and regularity of breathing did not improve. In conclusion, <italic>in vivo</italic> Trolox treatment partially ameliorated a subset of symptoms of the complex Rett phenotype, thereby confirming a partial merit of the vitamin E-derivative based pharmacotherapy. Yet, it also became evident that frequent animal handling and the route of drug administration are critical issues to be optimized in future trials.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that almost exclusively affects girls with an incidence of ~1/10,000 live female births (Rett, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">1966</xref>; Hagberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">1985</xref>; Chahrour and Zoghbi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2007</xref>). Spontaneous mutations in the X-chromosomal methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (<italic>MECP2</italic>) are present in 95% of classic Rett patients (Amir et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">1999</xref>; Shahbazian and Zoghbi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">2001</xref>). RTT is characterized by an apparently normal development for the first 6–18 months of life. This is then followed by a gradual appearance of mental, neurological and physical symptoms. Rett girls often show autism-like behaviors, severe mental impairment, slowed growth, motor dysfunction and seizures. Other symptoms include cardiac abnormalities and pronounced breathing disturbances (Shahbazian and Zoghbi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">2001</xref>). Especially the awake state is characterized by phases of irregular breathing with apneas and associated transient drops in arterial O<sub>2</sub> saturation (Julu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2001</xref>; Stettner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Mitochondrial alterations contribute to cellular redox imbalance, and are therefore expected to be involved in the pathogenesis of RTT (De Felice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2012b</xref>; Müller and Can, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">2014</xref>; Filosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2015</xref>). Typical morphological changes of these organelles include a swollen appearance with vacuolization, granular inclusions and membranous changes, and they were detected in biopsy material obtained from Rett patients as well as Rett mice (Eeg-Olofsson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1990</xref>; Dotti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">1993</xref>; Belichenko et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>). Furthermore, expression of certain subunits of respiratory complexes I and III seems to be indirectly controlled by MeCP2 (Kriaucionis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2006</xref>), and just recently it has been shown that the mitochondrial overproduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Rett mice is mainly due to an aberrant activity of complex II (De Filippis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2015</xref>). Interestingly, oxidative stress does not only occur in MeCP2 deficiency but also in <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome (Signorini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">2016</xref>). In view of the irregular breathing and the resulting frequent intermittent hypoxic episodes in RTT, it is reasonable to assume that such transiently reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply may further aggravate the conditions of already disturbed mitochondria and cellular redox imbalance.</p>
<p>Various oxidative stress markers—such as non-protein-bound iron, protein carbonyls, malondialdehyde (MDA) and F2-isoprostanes—are increased in blood samples of Rett patients (Sierra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">2001</xref>; De Felice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2012b</xref>). These blood analyses also revealed a reduced activity of the pivotal scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase (Sierra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">2001</xref>) as well as decreased vitamin E levels (Formichi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1998</xref>). Recently, we confirmed an increased oxidative burden and mitochondrial dysfunction also in hippocampal tissue of male MeCP2-deficient (<italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic>) mice (Großer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2012</xref>), by taking advantage of genetically-encoded optical redox indicators which allow to quantify redox conditions and dynamics (Hanson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2004</xref>; Funke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2011</xref>). Interestingly, these redox- and mitochondrial alterations in MeCP2-deficient brains already start to manifest at the neonatal stage, i.e., long before erratic breathing and other characteristic Rett symptoms are evident. Therefore, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and downstream redox changes are considered pivotal elements driving the pathogenesis of RTT (Sierra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">2001</xref>; De Felice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2009</xref>; Großer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2012</xref>; Müller and Can, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The pathogenic potential arising from redox alterations may not necessarily be linked to tissue damage only. Since the activity and function of various ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors is closely controlled by ambient redox conditions (Aizenman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1989</xref>; Hammarström and Gage, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2000</xref>; Müller and Bittner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2002</xref>; Sah et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">2002</xref>; Hidalgo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2004</xref>), any transient or sustained redox imbalance may easily contribute to the disturbed function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Blue et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1999</xref>; Dani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2005</xref>; Medrihan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2008</xref>), the impaired synaptic plasticity (Asaka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2006</xref>; Moretti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2006</xref>), and the neuronal hyperexcitability (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">2008</xref>; Calfa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2011</xref>) which are closely linked to MeCP2-deficiency. These redox-mediated changes may be transient or persisting, result from too oxidizing or too reducing conditions, and they can be expected to occur way before any oxidative tissue damage is manifesting.</p>
<p>In view of the mitochondrial dysfunction, the associated oxidative stress and their assumed role for the pathogenesis of RTT, improving mitochondrial function and/or reinstating cellular redox balance appear to be promising treatment concepts in RTT. Indeed, supplementation with ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) successfully reduced the levels of several oxidative stress biomarkers in the blood of Rett patients and ameliorated some of the typical Rett symptoms (De Felice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2012a</xref>; Maffei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2014</xref>). Along this line, we recently evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> the therapeutic merit of the free-radical scavenger Trolox, a vitamin E-derivative. In acute hippocampal slices of adult and symptomatic <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice, we confirmed that acute incubation with Trolox dampens neuronal hyperexcitability, reinstates synaptic plasticity, ameliorates cellular redox balance and improves the hypoxia tolerance in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> hippocampus (Großer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2012</xref>; Janc and Müller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these promising <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, we performed this preclinical trial, to define the merit of chronic Trolox treatment <italic>in vivo</italic>. Starting at postnatal day (PD) 10/11, Trolox was given to wild type (WT) and <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice every other day by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection for ~40 days. We screened for possible improvements in systemic and blood parameters, behavioral aspects and respiration. Markers of protein- and lipid-oxidation were quantified in isolated brain tissue, and detailed <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses on acute brain slices rated synaptic function and plasticity, hypoxia tolerance and mitochondrial metabolism. Also, potential changes in brain gross morphology were assessed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2" sec-type="materials and methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>As mouse model for RTT, we used, as in our earlier studies mice lacking the <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene B6.129P2(C)-Mecp2<sup>tm 1.1Bird</sup> (Guy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>). The entire study was performed on male mice, as <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice show an earlier and more severe disease onset and present the more uniform conditions of complete MeCP2 deficiency. All procedures are in accordance with national German regulations, and were authorized by the Office of Animal Welfare of the University Medical Center Göttingen and the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety.</p>
<sec id="s2-1">
<title>Systemic Trolox Treatment</title>
<p>The systemic treatment was designed as blinded, placebo-controlled study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Mice were randomly assigned to a treatment group, and starting from PD10–11 they received either vehicle (phosphate buffered saline, PBS), low-dose Trolox (10 mg/kg body weight) or high-dose Trolox (40 mg/kg body weight). Compounds were administered by i.p. injection every 48 h for a duration of ~6 weeks, i.e., until the mice had reached an age at which characteristic Rett symptoms are clearly evident (~PD47–50). In case of complications (massive weight loss, infections, edema, obvious signs of pain or suffering, tremors, lethargy, ruffled fur, difficulty breathing) treatment was terminated and the respective mouse euthanized. Injections, phenotypic analyses, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and data analyses were team efforts, with some overlap among those performing injections, running experiments and analyzing data. Everyone actively involved was blinded with respect to both mouse genotype and type of treatment. Yet, in view of the severe phenotype of the <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice and the differences in body weight, their genotype became more and more obvious once they reached PD30 and beyond.</p>

<p><bold>Treatment plan and study design.</bold> Mice were randomly assigned to a treatment (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) only, 10 mg/kg Trolox, 40 mg/kg Trolox). Injections were started PD10–11, given every 48 h, and continued up to PD47–50. Mice then underwent behavioral testing before the final experiment (tissue isolation or transcardial perfusion). The schematic refers to a single cohort, consisting of at least 20 mice. Six of these cohorts (three treatment paradigms per genotype) were run in parallel fully blinded, identified for correct treatment by color codes only. Unblinding was done after all mice had been treated and all data had been analyzed.</p>

</fig>
<p>Details on the pharmacokinetics of Trolox are not available, and its high blood brain barrier transferability has been demonstrated only very recently (Wada et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">2016</xref>). Therefore, our compound dosing was chosen in accordance to earlier reports in which Trolox was i.p. injected or orally fed to rats/gerbils and successfully ameliorated neurotoxic effects as well as ischemia-related neurodegeneration (Gupta and Sharma, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>; Al Mutairy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2010</xref>). At the same time, the higher Trolox dose of 40 mg/kg is the consequence of the maximum soluble amount in saline (~4 mg/ml without additional solvents) and the maximum allowable volume for i.p. injections in mice. The 48 h injection interval is based on a report on mice, which shows that upon administration, the levels of the vitamin E compound tocopherol in blood, brain, lung, kidney and liver remain stable for at least 24 h upon a single dose administration (Baxter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2012</xref>). Furthermore, we were concerned that i.p. injections performed on a daily basis for several weeks—especially in view of the early onset of treatment (PD10/11)—would be too stressful for the fragile Rett mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-2">
<title>Solutions</title>
<p>All chemicals and assays were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, unless indicated otherwise. Trolox ((±)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid) was dissolved in PBS (1 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml injection solution), stored at 4°C, and used within 1 week. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) required for <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments contained (in mM): 130 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 10 glucose. Constant aeration with carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) adjusted pH to 7.4. Cyanide (CN<sup>−</sup>) was dissolved as aqueous 1 M stock and stored at −20°C. FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone, Tocris Bioscience) and rhodamine 123 (Rh123) were dissolved as 10 mM stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at 4°C. Final DMSO concentration was ≤0.02%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-3">
<title>Behavioral Testing and Whole-Body Plethysmography</title>
<p>For detailed phenotyping, all mice underwent various behavioral tests prior to final experiments, to rate motor function and activity, environmental exploration, and working memory. However, to prevent an “overtesting” not every animal underwent each test available, but typically only three of the behavioral tests. Motor coordination was tested on three consecutive days (~PD43), using a mouse Rotarod (Ugo Basile). The first day allowed the mice to adapt to the treadmill, the second day defined motor performance, and improvement from the second to the third day represents motor learning. Mice were placed on the rotating drum (non-skid surface, 30 mm diameter), the speed continuously accelerated from 5 rpm to 50 rpm within 5 min, and the time each animal stayed on the rod was measured as latency to fall. Occasionally, mice clasped to the rotating drum without running. In these cases the timing was stopped after five full rotations of clasping.</p>
<p>Motor activity and environmental exploration were rated in open field and hole board tests (~PD47–50). In the open field (45 cm × 45 cm), the motility of mice was monitored for a duration of 5 min. Any lateral movements were detected by a grid of 16 infrared beams and tracked using ActiTrack v2.7.13 software (Panlab, Harvard Apparatus). For detailed analyses, the open field was divided in three zones (a 95 mm wide periphery, the respective 95 mm × 95 mm corners and the remaining 260 mm × 260 mm center) which were defined as a virtual mask in the tracking software (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"></xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In the hole board configuration, a base-plate with 16 equally spaced holes (25 mm diameter) was inserted into the arena, and an additional grid of infrared beams detected the head-dipping behavior of the mice.</p>
<p>Working memory was analyzed in a Y-maze (32.5 cm long and 8.5 cm wide arms, equally spaced at 120° angles), in which mice were tracked by video camera and ANY-maze software (Stoelting). Around PD47–50, mice were placed in the start arm and allowed to explore the maze for 10 min while one arm was blocked. After 1 h the test was repeated for a duration of 5 min with all arms being accessible, and the number of spontaneous alterations was counted. An alternation is defined as consecutive entry of all three arms in any order. Thus, the number of maximum possible alternations is the total sum of arm entries minus two. To compare mice, the number of spontaneous alternations was normalized to the maximum possible alternations.</p>
<p>To analyze breathing (PD47–50), mice were placed in a whole-body plethysmograph (Data Sciences International) and allowed to breathe naturally under conscious and unrestrained conditions. Breathing patterns were recorded by Ponemah v5 control software. After a ~10 min adaptation, breathing was analyzed for the following 3 min. The individual respiratory cycles were detected by the threshold crossing method (Clampfit 10.3, Molecular Devices), and breathing frequencies calculated as the reciprocal of the averaged inspiratory interval. The irregularity score was determined as the normalized difference between a pair of subsequent breaths (Barthe and Clarac, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1997</xref>; Telgkamp et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2002</xref>; Wegener et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">2014</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-4">
<title>Preparation and Transcardial Perfusion</title>
<p>To obtain brain tissue, mice (~PD50) were deeply anesthetized with ether and decapitated. The brain was isolated and placed in chilled ACSF for ~2 min. Coronal brain slices of 400 μm thickness were cut using a vibroslicer (752M Vibroslice, Campden Instruments) and split along the sagittal midline. Depending on the experiment they were transferred to an interface recording chamber or a submersion-style storage chamber. Prior to the experiments, slices were left undisturbed for at least 90 min, to ensure their recovery from dissection and slicing. Any brain tissue not required for acute analyses was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for later biochemical assays. Blood samples collected upon decapitation served to determine hematocrit and blood glucose levels (Contour<sup>®</sup> blood glucose meter; Bayer).</p>
<p>For transcardial perfusion, deep ether anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of foot-pinch reflexes. The chest was opened, the heart exposed, and an injection needle inserted in the left ventricle. Remaining blood was removed from the vascular system by PBS perfusion, then perfusion fixation was performed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Once isolated, brains were postfixed for 3 days in 4% PFA and long-term stored in PBS with 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Perfusion-fixed brains were cut into coronal sections (30 μm) using a microtome (VT1200S Leica). The sections were placed on microscope slides, passed through a descending ethanol series (95% for 15 min; 70% and 50% for 1 min each) and washed twice in demineralized water. They were then stained in an aqueous cresyl violet/acetate solution (5 mg/ml cresyl violet, 30 μl/ml acetic acid) for 2 min. Remaining dye was washed out by water, followed by an ascending ethanol series (50% for 1 min, 70% plus 1% acetic acid for 2 min, 95% for 2 min, 99.9% for 2 min). Finally, sections were cleared in xylol (5 min), dried (15 min), and coverslipped with Eukitt quick-hardening mounting medium. For the morphometric studies a rostrocaudal location of about −1.7 mm with respect to Bregma was chosen, and three sections per brain were analyzed using a digital microscope (Coolscope, Nikon) with NIS-Elements 3.2 cell analysis software. Quantification of neuronal size is based on soma area, and it was determined by randomly selecting five cells in each section analyzed. Those cells were chosen, which showed clearly identifiable boundaries and were not obstructed by neighboring/overlapping objects. The cross-sectional area was determined in the best focal plane by drawing along the outer cell boundaries (NIS-Elements analysis software).</p>

<title>Electrophysiological Recordings</title>
<p>Electrophysiological recordings were run in an Oslo style interface chamber, which was constantly aerated with carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>; 400 ml/min) and supplied with oxygenated ACSF (3–4 ml/min). Synaptic plasticity and hypoxic responses were analyzed at temperatures of 31–32°C and 35–36°C, respectively. Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries (GC150TF-10, Harvard Apparatus) on a horizontal electrode puller (Model P-97, Sutter Instruments) and filled with ACSF. Their tip resistance was trimmed to ~5 MΩ. Schaffer collaterals were stimulated with stainless steel electrodes (50 μm diameter microwire, AM-Systems), delivering 0.1 ms unipolar stimuli (S88 stimulator with PSIU6 stimulus isolation units, Grass Instruments). Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and extracellular DC potentials were recorded in CA1 <italic>st. radiatum</italic>, using a locally constructed field potential amplifier (Hepp et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2005</xref>). Data were sampled with an Axon Instruments Digitizer 1322A and analyzed by PClamp 9.2 software (both Molecular Devices). Synaptic function was rated based on input/output (i/o) curves and long-term potentiation (LTP). For LTP experiments, stimulus intensity was set to obtain half-maximum responses. Stable LTP was induced by three subsequent trains of high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s, 5 min train interval; Janc and Müller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>). Hypoxia-induced spreading depression (HSD) was elicited by switching the interface chamber’s gas supply to nitrogen (95% N<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>); O<sub>2</sub> was resubmitted 30 s after HSD onset (Hepp et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Optical Recordings</title>
<p>Mitochondrial metabolism and membrane potentials were monitored in CA1 <italic>st. radiatum</italic> using computer-controlled epifluorescence imaging systems. They were composed of a polychromatic xenon-light source (Polychrome II, Till Photonics), a CCD-camera (SensiCam QE, PCO) and an upright microscope (either Axiotech or Axioskop I, Zeiss). Hippocampal slices were imaged in a submersion-style chamber (30–33°C), using a 40× 0.8NA water immersion objective (Achroplan Zeiss). FAD and NADH tissue autofluorescence were monitored in a ratiometric approach (Duchen and Biscoe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1992</xref>), by alternating excitation at 360 nm (NADH, 70 ms exposure) and 445 nm (FAD, 40 ms exposure). Image pairs were taken every 5 s (0.2 Hz frame rate), and autofluorescence was separated by a 450 nm dichroic mirror and a 510/80 nm emission bandpass filter (Gerich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2006</xref>; Janc and Müller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>For Rh123 imaging of mitochondrial membrane potential changes, slices were dye-loaded (5 μM, 15 min) in a miniaturized staining chamber (Funke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2007</xref>). As Rh123 was used in quenching mode, depolarization of mitochondria is indicated by an increase in Rh123 fluorescence (Emaus et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">1986</xref>; Foster et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>). Rh123 was excited at 480 nm using frame rates of 0.2 Hz and 5 ms exposure times; its emission was separated using a 505 nm dichroic mirror and a 535/35 nm bandpass emission filter.</p>

<title>Lipid Peroxidation and Protein Carbonylation</title>
<p>To assess oxidative tissue damage, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation were quantified in cryopreserved tissue samples of frontal cortex. Lipid peroxidation was determined in ~10 mg neocortical tissue using a colorimetric assay (MAK085), which is based on the reaction of MDA with thiobarbituric acid (TBA). Tissue samples were homogenized on ice in 300 μl MDA lysis buffer containing butylhydroxytoluene (100×), and debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 g, 10 min). Then 0.2 ml of homogenate was added to 600 μl TBA solution. This mixture was incubated for 60 min at 95°C, cooled down on ice to room temperature (RT), and centrifuged again (13,000 g, 30 s) before absorbance at 532 nm was determined against a MDA standard curve.</p>
<p>Protein oxidation was determined using a protein carbonyl assay (MAK094), which reports the interaction of protein carbonyl groups with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH). The resulting stable dinitrophenyl (DNP) hydrazone adducts are detected spectrophotometrically. Tissue samples were homogenized in 500 μl CelLytic M buffer and incubated for 15 min before debris was removed by centrifugation (14,000 g, 15 min). The supernatant was collected and its protein content determined by Bradford assay (B6916). To quantify protein carbonyl levels, 0.15 ml of tissue supernatant (~10 mg/ml protein) was mixed with 0.15 ml of DNPH solution and incubated at RT for 10 min. Then, protein was precipitated by adding 0.45 ml of 100% trichloroacetic acid (5 min incubation on ice) and subsequent centrifugation at 13,000 g for 2 min. The pellet was dissolved in ice-cold acetate, incubated for 5 min at −20°C and centrifuged again at 13,000 g for 2 min, before the previous acetate washing step was repeated. Then the precipitated protein was re-dissolved in 0.33 ml of 6 M guanidine solution and incubated for 20 min at 60°C. Samples were allowed to cool down to RT; their carbonyl content was calculated from the absorbance at 375 nm, and their final total protein content determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA1 AND B9643).</p>

<p>Blood analyses detected ~29% lower blood glucose levels in PBS-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice than in the corresponding WTs. Those <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice receiving low or high Trolox doses, showed a trend towards higher glucose levels and they did no longer differ significantly from PBS-treated or Trolox-receiving WTs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In contrast, Trolox tended to reduce glucose levels in WTs, which reached the level of significance in the high-dose treated group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The increased hematocrit, which we reported already earlier for <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice (Fischer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2009</xref>), was still evident in all <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> groups; any modulation by Trolox was not observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p>

<title>Behavioral Testing</title>
<p>Rett patients and Rett mice show complex motor impairment.

After habituation (first day), all <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> groups showed a poorer performance on the rotarod on the second day and only stayed on the treadmill for markedly ( &gt;40%) shorter intervals than the respective WTs.

In the <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> groups, any improvement of motor learning between the second and third day was not seen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Exploratory behavior and locomotor activity of mice was determined in an open field arena (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This test mimics the natural conflict of mice between exploring a novel environment and avoiding illuminated, open areas. All mice avoided the center region, rather preferring the periphery and even more the corners (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,C</xref>). Marked differences in the relative times spent within the three zones were not obvious between <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> and WT mice. <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice treated with PBS and low-dose Trolox were significantly less active than WTs, as indicated by their reduced average velocity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), longer relative resting time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), and shorter total distance traveled (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Interestingly, these activity parameters did not significantly differ among high-dose Trolox-treated WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice, as WTs tended to become less active under this treatment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,E,F</xref>).</p>
<p>Environmental exploration of mice was tested by the hole board. <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice receiving PBS or low-dose Trolox showed significantly fewer head-dips than the respective WTs and rested longer (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G,H</xref>). High-dose Trolox-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice became clearly more active than the other <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> groups, showing more head-dips and resting less than PBS-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice. Also their head dipping did no longer differ from high-dose treated WTs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>).</p>
<p>For the assessment of spatial working memory, the Y-maze is considered a useful initial test (Dudchenko, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2004</xref>). It can be performed relatively easily, does not require multiple repeats, and does not impose high levels of stress or pronounced motor challenge on the mice. In view of the clear learning/memory deficits of MeCP2-deficient mice (Pelka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2006</xref>) and their motor impairment, we therefore established this test. Against expectation, the number of spontaneous alterations did not differ among the respective WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> groups, nor did genotype-matched comparison indicate any effects of Trolox (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref>). This suggests that the spatial complexity of only three arms is not sufficiently challenging to detect clear genotypic effects.</p>
<p>To evaluate the breathing pattern, unrestrained whole-body plethysmography was performed. Breathing was clearly disturbed in PBS-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice as compared to WTs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), and Trolox treatment failed to improve the regularity of breathing in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice. All <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> groups still showed a higher incidence of breathing arrests and lower breathing frequencies than WTs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B,C</xref>). Accordingly, the irregularity score, i.e., the variability of respiratory cycle duration, remained increased in all <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).</p>

<title>Mitochondrial Metabolism and Function</title>
<p>RTT is accompanied by mitochondrial alterations. To assess whether Trolox-treatment may mediate any effects on mitochondrial metabolism, we monitored FAD/NADH autofluorescence as well as Rh123 fluorescence in acute hippocampal tissue slices of the treated mice. In correspondence to the electrophysiological recordings, these imaging experiments were performed in CA1 <italic>st. radiatum</italic>. The basal ratio of FAD/NADH autofluorescence did not differ among PBS and high-dose Trolox treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> and WT mice; but it was slightly decreased in low-dose Trolox-treated WTs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by low (100 μM) and high (1 mM) doses of CN<sup>−</sup> provoked the expected decreases in FAD/NADH ratio, whose magnitudes were similar among treatment groups and genotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).</p>

<p><bold>Systemic Trolox treatment does not in general interfere with mitochondrial function.

Note however, that low-dose treated WTs showed lower FAD/NADH baseline levels than the corresponding <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> group (<sup>##</sup><italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).

<p>Mitochondrial polarization and anoxia vulnerability were assessed in Rh123-loaded slices, by evoking maximum depolarization with the uncoupler FCCP (5 μM, 5 min) and blocking mitochondrial respiration with CN<sup>−</sup> (100 μM, 2 min), respectively. The maximum mitochondrial depolarization, indicated by a massive increase in Rh123 fluorescence, did not differ among genotypes and treatment groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Neither did CN<sup>−</sup>-mediated inhibition of respiration evoke any different mitochondrial depolarizations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). It therefore can be concluded that Trolox treatment—even when applied systemically over a longer period—does not generally interfere with mitochondrial metabolism and function.</p>

<title>Lipid Peroxidation and Protein Carbonylation</title>
<p>The redox alterations associated with RTT were reported to culminate in oxidative damage in the brains of Rett mice (De Felice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2014</xref>). Therefore, we determined the extent of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation in brain tissue of the treated mice (~PD50), to rate the antioxidative capacity of Trolox. These tests were performed on neocortex, as the hippocampi had already been used for the previously described FAD/NADH and Rh123 imaging experiments. First, we verified the feasibility of the chosen assays, and incubated neocortical tissue samples with the oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP; 500 μM, 10 min) to induce oxidative damage. As compared to control tissue, TBHP increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content by 59.4 ± 8.2% and 79.7 ± 16.1% (each <italic>n</italic> = 3), respectively, confirming that both assays are functional.</p>
<p>Comparing neocortical samples from PBS-treated WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice, did not reveal any genotypic differences in lipid peroxidation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). In <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice treated with high-dose Trolox, however, the degree of lipid peroxidation was significantly dampened as compared to PBS- and low-dose Trolox injected <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice and high-dose Trolox treated WT mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). In WTs, high-dose Trolox just showed a tendency to decrease lipid peroxidation. Protein carbonyl content was increased in PBS-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice as compared to the corresponding WTs, whereas in low- and high-dose Trolox treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice this genotypic difference was no longer detectable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Accordingly, the degree of oxidative damage in brain tissue can be ameliorated at least partly by Trolox treatment.</p>

<title>Morphological Analyses</title>
<p>MeCP2-deficiency is associated with decreased brain size, thinning of neocortical layers and smaller neurons (Belichenko et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2008</xref>; Fischer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2009</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our earlier <italic>in vitro</italic> tests revealed promising effects of Trolox on hippocampal network function in symptomatic <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice (Janc and Müller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>). As the next logical step we therefore assessed, whether <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment with this free-radical scavenger would be equally efficient and improve the physical constitution of <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice or slow down disease progression. Chronic treatment and frequent injections were largely well-tolerated over the entire ~6 weeks. Only a small number of mice (3 WTs, 14 <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic>) died or had to be euthanized before the end of treatment. The survival rate of all treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice was 86% at PD47–50, and this average does not noticeably differ from that of naïve, untreated animals in our Rett mouse colony or the observations of others (Guy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>). Taking a closer look at the specific survival rates of the different treatment groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) indicates, however, that the mice which died or had to be euthanized even included three WTs and that they all (with the exception of one <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mouse) had received Trolox and not placebo. It therefore seems that even though the administered doses of Trolox were far below the LD50 lethal dose for mice (i.p. injection 1700 mg/kg see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drugfuture.com/toxic/q28-q963.html">http://www.drugfuture.com/toxic/q28-q963.html</ext-link>), some adverse effects of systemic Trolox treatment cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>For example, WT mice receiving high-dose Trolox showed lowered blood glucose levels, and a trend towards decreased motor activity as well as reduced environmental exploration, whereas low-dose Trolox treated WTs had lower FAD/NADH baseline ratios and a tendency to decreased fEPSP amplitudes. The very underlying causes are unclear, but nevertheless this observation emphasizes the importance of proper antioxidant dosing and optimized titration of redox conditions. Without question, cellular viability suffers from an increased oxidant load, but in view of the numerous functions controlled by redox conditions, also an “over-buffering”, i.e., too reducing conditions may be equally damaging.</p>
<p>This preclinical trial is part of a long-lasting research line, and we have reference data on some of the parameters assessed, which were recorded earlier also from naïve mice. Comparing the data sets shows that some of the genotypic differences seen in naïve mice were either not present or less pronounced among PBS-treated WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In several parameters WTs became worse, which dampened the phenotypic differences to <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice. An obvious cause may be the frequent injections and animal handling, which might have resulted in adverse stress. During study design, we chose i.p. injections, as they ensure a highly reliable drug delivery and are applicable also to neonates. Osmotic mini pumps are not feasible for mice at the early postnatal age and oral feeding (via drinking water or chow) could only start after weaning, i.e., not before PD20, unless the (foster) mothers are treated as well.</p>
<p>There are of course further reasons which may explain the reduced efficacy of Trolox <italic>in vivo</italic> as compared to <italic>in vitro</italic>. Even though Trolox shows a relatively high blood-brain barrier transferability (Wada et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">2016</xref>), it reaches an antioxidative effect of only ~65% of that observed in blood. Thus, it may not have reached sufficiently high doses to reverse all of these symptoms arising as a consequence of redox-imbalance and oxidative stress. Since higher doses of Trolox cannot be achieved without the use of additional solvents, shorter intervals and/or different routes of administration may be preferable for future trials. Furthermore, recent studies have pointed out that combinations of antioxidants—even applied at lower doses—may potentiate each others efficacy, and that this strategy may be more promising than just increasing the dose of a single compound (Tarnopolsky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2008</xref>; López-Erauskin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s4-1">
<title>General Physical Appearance and Blood Parameters</title>
<p>The detailed assessment of body weights and BMI revealed that Trolox treatment did not ameliorate the reduced growth of <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice. Once separated from their foster mothers and required to feed on their own, all <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> groups gained less weight than their WT littermates, as was reported earlier also for non-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice (Guy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Weaning marks a switch in metabolism from milk (high fat diet) to mouse chow (carbohydrate rich diet; Ferré et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1986</xref>), and this transition seems problematic in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice. Loss of MeCP2 function increases insulin levels, decreases insulin signaling and results in a dissociation of insulin levels and their appropriate metabolic effects on glucose regulation (Pitcher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2013</xref>; Krishnan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2015</xref>). Also in Rett patients, increased glucose utilization indicates altered glucose regulation and/or metabolism (Villemagne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">2002</xref>). We found ~29% lower blood glucose levels in PBS-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice than in WTs. This difference was abolished in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice receiving high or low Trolox doses, indicating that chronic Trolox treatment rescued the altered glucose regulation/metabolism.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it was shown in rats that glucose-mediated production of mitochondrial ROS is mandatory for insulin secretion; higher mitochondrial ROS levels increased insulin secretion, whereas antioxidants decreased it (Leloup et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2009</xref>). Thus the lower glucose levels observed in placebo treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup> mice</italic> may at least in part be a consequence of the systemic oxidative stress in these mice, which is then antagonized by Trolox. In contrast in WT mice, high-dose Trolox slightly lowered blood glucose levels by an as yet unidentified mechanism. For male C57BL6 mice (PD 56–70), the vendor specifies a blood glucose content of 13.7 ± 3.4 mM (<italic>n</italic> = 114; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.criver.com/files/pdfs/rms/c57bl6/rm_rm_d_c57bl6n_mouse.aspx">http://www.criver.com/files/pdfs/rms/c57bl6/rm_rm_d_c57bl6n_mouse.aspx</ext-link>). High-dose Trolox treated WTs showed glucose levels of 12.1 ± 2.1 mM (<italic>n</italic> = 23), which are well within this range. As neither the growth curves of high-dose Trolox treated WT mice, nor any other of their behavioral parameters showed a significant decline, adverse systemic consequences of these moderate blood glucose changes seem unlikely.</p>
<p>The hematocrit was not affected by Trolox, and remained increased in all <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>−<italic>/y</italic></sup> groups. As the high hematocrit represents an adaptive response of <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>−<italic>/y</italic></sup> mice to irregular breathing and the associated intermittent systemic hypoxia (Stettner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">2008</xref>; Fischer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2009</xref>), this suggests that <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>−<italic>/y</italic></sup> mice, despite chronic Trolox treatment, still suffered from intermittent systemic hypoxia. The unchanged breathing irregularities detected in all <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> groups during plethysmography support this notion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4-2">
<title>Behavioral Testing and Plethysmography</title>
<p>Motor problems and insufficient motor skills are evident in various MeCP2-mutant mice (Guy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>; Shahbazian et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">2002</xref>; Moretti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2005</xref>; Wegener et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">2014</xref>). Compared to WTs, the treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice failed markedly earlier on the rotarod, and their impaired motor function was not ameliorated by Trolox. The poor rotarod performance likely arises from an insufficient motor coordination, as is suggested by the pronounced hind limb clasping in symptomatic <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice (Guy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>). General muscle weakness is a less likely cause. We found most <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice being able to climb around in their cages, and others confirmed normal muscle strength of <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice in wire suspension tests (Santos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2007</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice are also less active (Guy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>), which in part may be due to their motor deficits. They traveled shorter distances than WTs, which in the open field and hole board tests was accompanied by a decline in mean velocity and prolonged resting times. Marked genotypic differences in the relative times spent in the defined areas were not found, but low-dose Trolox-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice stayed slightly more in the periphery and less in the corners than the respective WTs. Environmental exploration in the hole board was also less pronounced in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice. Yet, the number of head-dips was increased in high-dose Trolox-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice as compared to the other <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> groups, and they did no longer differ from high-dose Trolox-treated WTs. This was paralleled by a shortened mean resting time of the respective <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice. Accordingly, environmental exploration in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice slightly improved upon Trolox treatment.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent symptoms in RTT is erratic breathing (Julu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2001</xref>; Weese-Mayer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">2006</xref>; Stettner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">2008</xref>; Katz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2009</xref>). Each episode of irregular breathing evokes a drop in arterial O<sub>2</sub> saturation, which is restored only after normal ventilation resumes. Such intermittent systemic hypoxia may provoke damage and/or induce redox stress in highly vulnerable neuronal tissue. Also the regulation of breathing itself might be affected. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-evoked oxidative stress modulates the <italic>in vitro</italic> breathing pattern generated in the isolated medullary pre-Bötzinger Complex of neonatal WT mice: Biphasic responses were reported, consisting of an initial depression followed by augmented respiratory activity (Garcia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2011</xref>). Therefore, we also assessed whether Trolox may improve breathing. As expected, <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice showed highly irregular breathing patterns. High- or low-dose Trolox did not improve the regularity of breathing, and the number and duration of apneas did not decrease. Yet, a further deterioration of breathing was not observed either. It should be mentioned though that the individual <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice varied greatly; some displayed only mild breathing disturbances with just 1–2 apneas during the evaluated 3 min interval, whereas others showed up to 49 apneas exceeding 750 ms.</p>

<title>Hypoxia Susceptibility and Synaptic Function</title>
<p>In contrast to our earlier studies on naïve mice (Fischer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2009</xref>; Janc and Müller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>), PBS-treated WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice did not differ in their hypoxia susceptibility assessed as time to HSD onset. Nevertheless, treatment with low-dose Trolox increased the hypoxia tolerance of <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice as compared to the respective WT and the PBS-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> group. This effect was not seen with high-dose Trolox, emphasizing the importance of well-adjusted cellular redox balance and careful antioxidant dosing. In view of the irregular breathing and intermittent hypoxia, the Trolox-mediated increase in hypoxia tolerance is clearly of merit, as it may prevent additional complications especially in highly anoxia-vulnerable neuronal networks such as the hippocampus and cortex.</p>
<p>Synaptic plasticity is impaired in <italic>Mecp2</italic>-mutant mice (Asaka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2006</xref>; Moretti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2006</xref>; Fischer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2009</xref>; Janc and Müller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>). Yet, the differences among PBS-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> and WT mice were less evident than in naïve mice (Janc and Müller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>). As suggested by the normalized fEPSP amplitudes recorded in CA1 <italic>st. radiatum</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), this seems to result from PBS-treated WTs showing a higher degree of neuronal excitability than naïve WT mice. This variability of genotypic differences in synaptic plasticity may be explained by earlier reports identifying stress and stress-hormones as a cause for impaired hippocampal LTP (Kim and Yoon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">1998</xref>; Kim and Diamond, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2002</xref>). Repeated i.p. injections for several weeks could represent a chronic stressor (Ryabinin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">1999</xref>) which induces stress hormone release and dampens LTP in slices of frequently handled/injected WT mice. In <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice, LTP is already impaired to a degree that it may not have responded to any additional stress.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <italic>in vivo</italic> Trolox treatment mediated some positive effects on synaptic plasticity. Low-dose Trolox-treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice showed a significantly improved STP as compared to the respective WTs and the other <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> groups. The final amount of LTP also tended to increase, but did not reach the level of significance. High-dose Trolox treatment failed to improve synaptic plasticity in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> or WT mice. This may result from a probably too high concentration mediating adverse effects. As a certain ROS level is necessary for signal transduction cascades during normal physiological processes (Serrano and Klann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2004</xref>), optimum synaptic plasticity can be achieved in a well-balanced redox environment only. Accordingly, superoxide scavenging and overexpression of superoxide dismutase 3 impair hippocampal LTP (Klann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">1998</xref>; Thiels et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">2000</xref>). Along this line, high-dose Trolox may have shifted hippocampal redox balance beyond the optimum. Similar effects we found earlier in naïve mice, in which Trolox rescued STP and LTP in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> hippocampal slices, but dampened it in WTs (Janc and Müller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4-4">
<title>Mitochondrial Metabolism and Function</title>
<p>Trolox did not mediate any consistent changes in mitochondrial metabolism or polarization. A slight decrease of the FAD/NADH baseline ratio was found in low-dose Trolox treated WTs, but this was not accompanied by any changes in mitochondrial polarization, estimated here as Rh123 fluorescence. Hence, general negative side effects of this compound on mitochondrial function can be excluded. In contrast to our earlier studies on naïve mice (Großer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2012</xref>; Janc and Müller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>), PBS injected/handled WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> did no longer differ in their hippocampal FAD/NADH ratios and Rh123 responses (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Again, the stress associated with the frequent i.p. injections, might have affected mitochondrial metabolism, thereby diminishing the genotypic differences. Most primary mediators of stress responses exert numerous effects on mitochondrial metabolism and ROS generation and may even induce apoptosis (Manoli et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4-5">
<title>Lipid Peroxidation and Protein Carbonylation</title>
<p>RTT is closely linked to oxidative stress and redox imbalance (Sierra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">2001</xref>; De Felice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2012b</xref>; Großer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2012</xref>; Müller and Can, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">2014</xref>). Unclear is, however, which particular brain regions are affected and whether the oxidative damage mainly targets proteins, lipids or both. Earlier studies on whole brains of various Rett mouse models indicated that in particular lipids are subject to oxidative damage, whereas protein damage is not detectable in each model (De Felice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2014</xref>). Our comparison of neocortical tissue of PBS-treated WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice did not reveal obviously different levels of lipid peroxidation, but high-dose Trolox decreased the extent of lipid peroxidation in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> neocortex below WT levels. Furthermore, the increased protein carbonyl content detected in PBS treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice, was no longer evident upon Trolox treatment. This confirms that systemic Trolox administration is capable of ameliorating oxidative brain tissue damage. However, it also should be noted here that the sensitivity range of these assays may not be ideal to detect reliably also more subtle changes in protein and lipid oxidation. We verified both assays by provoking oxidative tissue damage via direct oxidant (TBHP) treatment. This resulted in a clear peroxidation of lipids and carbonylation of proteins in neocortical samples, but it also revealed that despite direct oxidant stress only marked but not massive changes in spectrophotometric readout were obtained.</p>

<sec id="s4-6">
<title>Merits of Antioxidant and Free-Radical Scavenger Treatment in RTT</title>
<p>Various earlier studies verified that antioxidants and free-radical scavengers ameliorate certain aspects of the complex clinical appearance of RTT (Chapleau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2013</xref>). In female Rett mice, alterations in vascular endothelium were reversed by administration of curcumin, an anti-inflammatory compound which also mediates antioxidative effects (Panighini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">2013</xref>). In Rett patients, ω-3 PUFA-supplementation led to an improvement of motor function, non-verbal communication and breathing regularity (De Felice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2012a</xref>; Maffei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2014</xref>). Ultimate proof for a pathogenic role of oxidative alterations in RTT is the brain-specific reactivation of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene, which resulted in a clear phenotypic improvement in concert with a normalization of various oxidative stress markers (De Felice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>As vitamin E levels are decreased in blood serum of Rett patients (Formichi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1998</xref>) and as this vitamin as well as its derivatives act as chain-breaking antioxidants, which prevent the propagation of free radicals in membranes and plasma lipoproteins (Traber and Stevens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">2011</xref>; Alberto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2013</xref>), these compounds appear especially promising. Applied <italic>in vivo</italic> by oral uptake or i.p. injection, Trolox ameliorates ischemia-induced hippocampal cell loss and 3-NPA-mediated striatal lesions (Gupta and Sharma, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>; Al Mutairy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2010</xref>) as well as oxidative-stress related retinal damage (Dorfman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2006</xref>). Our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> tests confirmed the efficacy of Trolox also in a Rett mouse model, in which it improved synaptic function as well as hypoxia tolerance and opposed neuronal hyperexcitability in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> hippocampal slices (Janc and Müller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, the systemic administration of Trolox improved some of the tested parameters as well. Yet, this <italic>in vivo</italic> Trolox treatment did not noticeably change the most characteristic Rett symptoms. Obvious signs that the disease progression was slowed down in <italic>Mecp2<sup>−/y</sup></italic> mice were not obtained either. It has to be considered though that these male Rett mice are very severely affected. Therefore, to understand completely the merits of systemic Trolox administration, it needs to be assessed in future trials, how efficient this treatment would be in heterozygous female Rett mice. They represent the conditions of a cellular MeCP2 mosaicism, truthfully reflecting the genetic conditions of the female patients. As disease progression and symptom severity are milder in female Rett (<italic>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup></italic>) mice, this will require, however, prolonged treatment durations of several months or even over a year. This certainly cannot be achieved by i.p. injections and the associated stress, as we learned in this present study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this detailed <italic>in vivo</italic> study confirms some pharmacotherapeutic merit of systemically applied antioxidants in MeCP2-deficient brains. Unfortunately, frequent animal handling and repeated injections apparently modulated the phenotypic appearance of mice and diminished the genotype-related differences of numerous parameters. Therefore, the route of drug administration and the frequent mouse handling are critical issues in study design, which need to be further optimized in future trials. Also, as Trolox ameliorated only a few of the multiple complex Rett symptoms, one may consider its use as adjuvant, i.e., its combination with other compounds improving different symptoms, in order to complement the spectrum of effects. For example, respiration, which was not improved by Trolox was shown earlier to be normalized by norepinephrine uptake blockers, GABA uptake inhibitors, and serotonin 1a receptor agonists (Zanella et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">2008</xref>; Abdala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2010</xref>) or the antidepressant mirtazapine which furthermore prevented cortical atrophy (Bittolo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2016</xref>). In view of the complex phenotype of RTT, such combination therapies, designed to the particular needs of each individual patient are probably the most promising but also the most challenging strategy.</p>
