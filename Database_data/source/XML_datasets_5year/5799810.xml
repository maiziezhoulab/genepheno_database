<abstract>
<p>The cerebral cortex is essential for integration and processing of information
that is required for most behaviors. The exquisitely precise laminar
organization of the cerebral cortex arises during embryonic development when
neurons migrate successively from ventricular zones to coalesce into specific
cortical layers. While radial glia act as guide rails for projection neuron
migration, pre-formed vascular networks provide support and guidance cues for
GABAergic interneuron migration. This study provides novel conceptual and
mechanistic insights into this paradigm of vascular-neuronal interactions,
revealing new mechanisms of GABA and its receptor-mediated signaling via
embryonic forebrain endothelial cells. With the use of two new endothelial cell
specific conditional mouse models of the GABA pathway
(<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ΔTie2-Cre</sup></italic> and
<italic>Vgat<sup>ΔTie2-Cre</sup></italic>), we show that partial or
complete loss of GABA release from endothelial cells during embryogenesis
results in vascular defects and impairs long-distance migration and positioning
of cortical interneurons. The downstream effects of perturbed endothelial
cell-derived GABA signaling are critical, leading to lasting changes to cortical
circuits and persistent behavioral deficits. Furthermore, we illustrate new
mechanisms of activation of GABA signaling in forebrain endothelial cells that
promotes their migration, angiogenesis and acquisition of blood-brain barrier
properties. Our findings uncover and elucidate a novel endothelial GABA
signaling pathway in the CNS that is distinct from the classical neuronal GABA
signaling pathway and shed new light on the etiology and pathophysiology of
neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, anxiety,
depression and schizophrenia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Today, one in four people worldwide suffer every year from some form of
neuropsychiatric illness. Drugs used in psychiatry usually act to ease symptoms
with no cure, due to lack of mechanistic insights into how these diseases
initiate. One factor known to exert extremely broad influence on brain
development and network formation is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
Abnormalities in GABAergic neurons and defects in cortical inhibition are
implicated underlying the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), epilepsy,
schizophrenia, anxiety and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup>. Given the
significance of abnormal early brain development that leads to these serious
neuropsychiatric conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup>,
GABA-mediated signaling by neuronal progenitors/neurons during development has
been extensively studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup>. Brain development,
however, is not limited to neuronal changes but is also supported by concomitant
development of its vasculature. After establishment of the periventricular
vascular gradient by embryonic day 11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup>, excitatory glutamatergic projection neurons and
inhibitory GABAergic interneurons navigate along diverse courses from
ventricular zones, radially and tangentially, to adopt final laminar positions
and synchronize cortical microcircuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup>. While radial glia were established as the substrate
for radial neuronal migration in the early seventies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup>, our recent studies have shown that the developing
vascular system exquisitely patterned amidst neurons is the substrate for
GABAergic neuronal tangential migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>. These findings highlighted the autonomy of
periventricular versus pial vascular networks and revealed that they are
independently capable of guiding deep versus superficial GABAergic neuronal
populations <italic>en route</italic> to the cortex. Not only is the periventricular
vascular network acting as a physical substrate for the migration of large
populations of deep GABAergic neurons in the embryonic telencephalon, but also
it holds the key to several novel developmental mechanisms. Many genes
traditionally believed to be confined to GABAergic neurons and their precursors
were found to be enriched in forebrain periventricular endothelial cells when
compared to pial endothelial cells or control endothelial cells prepared from
midbrain and hindbrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>. These
results suggested that telencephalic endothelial cells house a novel GABA
signaling pathway that is distinct from the traditional neuronal GABA signaling
pathway with new significance for brain development and neuropsychiatric
disease.</p>
<p>Several mouse models with abnormal GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and GABA function,
which recapitulated defective behaviors similar to those seen in conditions like
autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders as well as human
studies have been vital for understanding the pathobiology of these neurological
and psychiatric illnesses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup>. However, all of the mouse models
reported until now are systemic or region-specific knockouts of the
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-GABA pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup>. With such models, it is impossible to establish a
cause-effect relationship between neuronal and endothelial development.</p>
<p>To discover the significance of GABA-related gene expression specifically in
endothelial cells during embryonic development, we designed strategies to
selectively modulate components of the endothelial GABA signaling pathway <italic>in
vivo</italic>. This approach markedly affected endothelial GABA release levels,
disturbed periventricular angiogenesis and in turn impaired GABAergic neuronal
tangential migration in the embryonic brain. Concurrent vascular dysfunction and
GABA cell deficits persisted in the postnatal cerebral cortex and manifested as
diverse neuropsychiatric behavioral symptoms. Our results highlight the
importance of a novel GABA signaling pathway operating via forebrain endothelial
cells that has an intricate and powerful control of cerebral cortex development
leaving its lasting signature on behavioral outcomes. It shows for the first
time how prenatal forebrain angiogenesis has the remarkable potential to
modulate postnatal and adult behaviors.</p>

<title>Autonomous roles of endothelial GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in
telencephalic development</title>
<p>The earliest GABA expression in the embryonic cerebral cortex has been
described on embryonic day 10 (E10) near the pial surface and it has been
difficult to explain the diffuse GABA staining present throughout the
neuroepithelium between E10 and E12, even before GABAergic interneurons
arrive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup>. With the use of
Tie2-GFP mice, we observed that GFP<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells of the
periventricular vessel gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup>
at E11 express GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). GABA expression
was distinct and robust in periventricular vessels of the E12 dorsal
telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and cultured
periventricular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure
1C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>.
Additionally, we observed expression of several GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
subunits in periventricular endothelial cells with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
β3 subunit (Gabrb3) showing enriched expression, <italic>in vitro</italic>
and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure
S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>. To
discover the functional significance of endothelial GABA<sub>A</sub>
receptors <italic>in vivo</italic>, we selectively deleted GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
β3 subunit from endothelial cells to generate <italic>Gabrb3</italic>
endothelial cell conditional knockout
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ΔTie2-Cre</sup></italic> (also named
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>) mice. While
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> endothelial cells robustly expressed
GABRB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S1B</xref>), endothelial cells of
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon did not express GABRB3
confirming its deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S1C</xref>). Labeling
with multiple markers of vessel components, isolectin B4 and CD31/PECAM-1
revealed reductions in vessel density and pattern formation in E13
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H-1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information,
Figure S1D-S1I</xref>). The tangential stream of GABAergic neurons
that migrate from basal to dorsal telencephalon, examined with GAD65/67
immunoreactivity, was reduced in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
telencephalon when compared to <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> telencephalon
at E13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure
S1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S1K</xref>). Vascular
reductions continued in E15 <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure
S2A-S2E</xref>). The rhombic vascular patterns in the ganglionic
eminence (GE) that ensheath deep GABAergic neuronal populations in a
tube-like form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> were well formed
in E15 <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> telencephalon, but continued to be
disrupted in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), along with concurrent reduction in
GAD65/67 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L-1N</xref>). In
histological stainings, cortical lamination in E18 dorso-lateral
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon appeared normal
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1P</xref>)
but the medial telencephalon showed morphological defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1R</xref>). While in
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> telencephalon, corpus callosum,
hippocampal layer stratum oriens, triangular septal nucleus and ventral
hippocampal commissure could be clearly visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>), these anatomical landmarks were perturbed in
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>). Ventricular abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S</xref>), reduced hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure
1S</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1T</xref>) and enlarged striatal
compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>) were frequently
observed in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon. Cortical vascular
densities were reduced in E18 <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon
when compared to <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1U-1W</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary
information, Figure S2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S2G</xref>). Significant changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB)
properties were not observed in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> versus
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> telencephalon. Subtle changes in
tight junction protein, claudin 5 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S2I</xref>) as well as dilated and abnormally stretched vessels
were noticed by immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining in
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon, when compared to
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> telencephalon, but no IgG leakage
was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure
S2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S2K</xref>).
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice were smaller in size than
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice at birth and during postnatal
stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1X</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1Y</xref>), but showed long-term survival into adulthood. This
provided us with a unique opportunity for studying the consequences of
developmental perturbations due to loss of endothelial <italic>Gabrb3</italic> in
the mature brain.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Postnatal consequences of selective loss of endothelial
Gabrb3</title>
<p>The vascular and GABA cell deficit observed in the
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) was also reflected in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
adult brain (P90) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-2D</xref>). Significantly
affected regions in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> adult brain were the
cingulate cortex, motor cortex and somatosensory cortex, in which concurrent
reductions in isolectin B4<sup>+</sup> vessels and GABA<sup>+</sup>
interneurons were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-2D</xref>). In
the piriform cortex of <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice, vascular
reduction was observed at the three bregma levels analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but GABAergic neurons were reduced
significantly only at −1.5 bregma level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure
2D</xref>). We next used a combination of retro-orbital lectin
perfusion and CD31 immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques, and focused on the
P90 cingulate cortex for further analysis of vasculature. Microvessel
densities were significantly reduced in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
cortex in comparison with <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, vessel diameters were
markedly increased in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> cortex indicative of
morphological alterations when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The average lectin<sup>+</sup> area per vessel was
also increased in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Larger vessel diameters likely correlated with the
increased perfusion and are indicative of functional changes in
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> vessels. Enlarged vessels continued
to be detected by IgG staining in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> cortex
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S2L</xref>,
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S2M</xref>). The hippocampus of
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice at P90 also showed a deficit in
GABAergic neurons when compared to <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The decreased number of
interneurons in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> cortex was not due to
apoptosis as confirmed by anti-active caspase-3 IHC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S2N</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S2O</xref>).</p>
<p>We next questioned whether the vascular abnormalities and reduction of
GABAergic neurons in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> cerebral cortex
contributed to altered behavior. As a first indication of pathological
behavior, 15% of the <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice showed seizure-like
symptoms from P14 onward. Common characteristics that overlap across many
neuropsychiatric disease categories are impaired reciprocal social
interactions, communication deficits and heightened anxiety. Therefore we
performed behavioral tests to screen for stress, anxiety and sociability in
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice. Mice are expert and flexible
nest builders, so <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> and
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were housed individually in
cages containing wood chip bedding and two nestlets (pressed cotton) or more
naturalistic material like shredded paper strips.
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice showed poor nest building behavior
in both normal and enriched environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure
2I-2K</xref>) as well as moderate to severe grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) indicative of impaired home cage social
behavior and increased stress/anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup>. Anxiety was also assessed with the classic
light-dark avoidance test, which triggers a struggle between the desires to
explore an unknown area versus dislike of a brightly lit open
space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup>.
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice made several entries into the
brightened space and spent equivalent times between the light and dark sides
of the open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M-2O</xref>). On the other
hand, <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice showed an aversion to brightly lit
open space and preferred the dark area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure
2M-2O</xref>).</p>
<p>We next performed the tail suspension test, a screening test for depression
in which normal mice will struggle to face upward and climb to a solid
surface. When the animal stops struggling and hangs immobile, it is
considered to have 'given up'. <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice showed
longer periods of immobility than wild-type (WT) littermates in the tail
suspension test that is characteristic of a depressive-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). We used the tube dominance test to
assess cognition in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice, in particular
social dominance through measurement of aggression. Both
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
mice were released into opposite ends of a tube and evaluated for the winner
who forced its opponent out of the tube. <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice
showed fewer wins in a tube dominance test in comparison to their WT
littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref>). To test for social
communication, a three-chambered social approach task (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S3</xref>) was used in which we
scored time spent in a side chamber with a novel mouse versus time spent in
a side chamber with a non-social novel object as a measure of sociability.
While <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice showed preference for a stranger
mouse over an inanimate object, <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice showed
no preference for the stranger mouse and spent approximately similar time
investigating stranger and object signifying impaired sociability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2R</xref>). In the social novelty phase, when a new
stranger mouse was introduced into the previously empty cylinder,
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice showed a marked preference for
stranger 2 versus the now familiar stranger 1, while
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice did not show a significant
preference for stranger 2 versus stranger 1 indicative of decreased social
motivation, memory and novelty exploration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure
2S</xref>). We confirmed that the abnormal social behavior was not due
to an olfaction defect since <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice performed
slightly better than <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice in the buried food
olfaction test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2T</xref>).
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice did not show gender-specific
differences in behavior in all of these behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I-2S</xref>). These results provided novel evidence
that prenatal loss of a single GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit from
endothelial cells is sufficient to modulate postnatal behavior. It therefore
became critical to gain mechanistic insights into endothelial
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor actions during embryonic brain
development.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Mechanistic insights into endothelial GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
function and dysfunction</title>
<p>We first questioned whether embryonic forebrain endothelial cells possess
functional GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. WT periventricular endothelial cells
showed higher expression of the cation-chloride cotransporter —
NKCC1 versus KCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), similar to
embryonic neurons. We prepared pure cultures of periventricular endothelial
cells from E15 CD1 embryonic telencephalon and tested if endothelial
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors were able to respond to the GABA<sub>A</sub>
receptor agonist muscimol. We found that application of muscimol in
whole-cell patch-clamp recording of periventricular endothelial cells at a
holding potential of −70 mV, resulted in an inward current
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The muscimol induced inward
current was blocked by application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure
3C</xref>). This pharmacological profile provided evidence that
periventricular endothelial cells have functional GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors
that account for the GABA responses. Muscimol application induced no current
response in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> periventricular endothelial cells
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Muscimol application induced
inward currents in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> cortical neuronal cells that were
blocked by BMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>). These results ascertained that there was no change in the
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor response in cortical neuronal cells and
emphasized the specific loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function in
endothelial cells. Furthermore, muscimol application produced an increase of
intracellular calcium in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> periventricular
endothelial cells in calcium imaging assays, but no marked increase in
intracellular calcium in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> periventricular
endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-3I</xref>). Calcium
transients have been shown to tightly regulate proliferation in many cell
types, including cells in the neocortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup>.
Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can influence advancement of progenitor cells
through the cells cycle. Transitions of cells from G1 to S phase and
progression through M phase have been reported to be highly calcium
dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup>. Since GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activation in
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> periventricular endothelial cells
leads to an influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is likely to influence cell
proliferation, we incubated <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> periventricular endothelial cells
isolated from E15 telencephalon in the presence of muscimol and the mitotic
marker 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to examine the impact on
proliferation of these cells. Muscimol application significantly increased
proliferation in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3L</xref>). However,
there was no discernible difference in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
endothelial cell proliferation before or after muscimol application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3L</xref>).
Together, these results indicate that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> periventricular endothelial cells are
dysfunctional and elucidate how activation of endothelial GABA<sub>A</sub>
receptors modulates endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding is that endothelial-specific deletion of
<italic>Gabrb3</italic> significantly decreased GABA expression in embryonic
periventricular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>,
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S4A</xref>,
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S4B</xref>). We observed robust GABA expression
by IHC in control periventricular endothelial cells and this is illustrated
at both low and high magnifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>,
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S4A</xref>).
All <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial cells, in sharp contrast
showed a marked reduction in GABA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure
3M</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure
S4B</xref>). Variability in GABA expression with respect to fold
decrease was observed in the <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial cell
population and this was quantified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary
information, Figure S4C</xref>). Next, we measured secreted GABA by
ELISA from <italic>Gabrb3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> periventricular endothelial cells. As
expected, there was a significant reduction in GABA secretion upon
<italic>Gabrb3</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). These
data lay the foundation for a novel positive feedback signaling pathway in
endothelial cells that functions via GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated GABA
release. Since pial endothelial cells do not express GABRB3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>, they are unaffected by the deletion,
and GABA secretion from these cells is unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S4D</xref>). Thus the
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mouse is a model of partial loss of
endothelial cell-secreted GABA in the embryonic telencephalon. Together
these observations suggested that loss of functional endothelial
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and partial loss of endothelial GABA can
impair telencephalic angiogenesis and angiogenesis-guided GABAergic neuronal
migration <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>) as
observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The consequences persist
in the adult brain, reflecting as reduced vascular densities and reduction
of cortical interneurons and manifest as multifaceted behavioral deficits
common in many overlapping psychiatric disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>The importance of endothelial cell-derived GABA for telencephalic
development</title>
<p>Since partial loss of endothelial GABA during embryonic brain development
resulted in long-term repercussions, we were curious as to the effect of
complete loss of endothelial GABA release <italic>in vivo</italic> on brain
development and postnatal behavior. We had detected both GAD1 and GAD2
expression in CNS endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, conditional deletion of GAD1 alone from
endothelial cells will not be sufficient to deplete endothelial GABA due to
presence of GAD2 and <italic>vice versa</italic>. We thus examined the expression of
GATs, GABA transporters that can serve to store and release GABA. No GATs
were present, but we found that <italic>slc32a1</italic> (also named <italic>Vgat</italic>,
vesicular GABA transporter) mRNA was highly enriched in periventricular
endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>. We did not
find glycine receptors, glycine, β-alanine or taurine expression in
periventricular endothelial cells, suggesting that a GABA pathway is
exclusively active in this cell type during early embryonic development.
This suggested that GABA release from periventricular endothelial cells may
be vesicular and deletion of endothelial <italic>Vgat</italic> is likely to have
profound influence on adjusting the balance of GABA release and local GABA
concentrations. Therefore, VGAT expression in both WT and Tie2-GFP
telencephalic endothelial cells was first confirmed by IHC and found to be
robustly expressed both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure
4A-4C</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure
4D</xref>). Next, we used <italic>Tie2-cre</italic> mice and <italic>Vgat
floxed</italic> mice to selectively delete <italic>Vgat</italic> from endothelial
cells and generate <italic>Vgat</italic> endothelial cell conditional knockout
<italic>Vgat<sup>ΔTie2-cre</sup></italic> (also named
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>) mice. VGAT expression was not detected
specifically in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary
information, Figure S5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S5B</xref>). No marked change or variability in GABA or GAD65/67
expression was observed in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> periventricular
endothelial cells when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure
4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G</xref>). Then, we determined
whether endothelial GABA secretion was affected in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> embryonic telencephalon by isolating
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> periventricular endothelial cells and
testing for GABA secretion by ELISA. We found that deleting <italic>Vgat</italic>
from endothelial cells successfully abolished GABA secretion during
embryonic stages from periventricular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These experiments confirmed that VGAT is the
primary GABA transporter in periventricular endothelial cells and that GABA
release by these endothelial cells is executed through a vesicular
mechanism. Telencephalic angiogenesis was more markedly affected in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon when compared to
<italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon. Vascular densities
were significantly reduced in E13 <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4I</xref>-4K). Reduction in vessel density and
loss of normal periventricular vessel plexus formation continued in E15
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S5C-S5G</xref>). Cortical vessel
densities in E18 <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon were also
significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information,
Figure S5H-S5J</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we performed a transwell migration assay to examine migration of
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial cells labeled with Qdot
nanocrystals versus controls. <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial cells
showed a significant reduction in migration when compared to
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4M</xref>). Tube formation
assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> showed that the
angiogenic potential of <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> periventricular
endothelial cells was significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure
4N-4R</xref>). The tube network was quantified to measure the two
parameters: number of junctions and number of tubules, both of which showed
a significant reduction in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial cells
when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4Q</xref>). <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial cells
formed fewer polygons or 'honey comb' structures, which indicated the lack
of organizing into complex structures. Furthermore, we quantified the
angiogenic score using published methodology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> by taking into account the number of sprouting
cells, connected cells and polygons. The angiogenic score of
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial cells was significantly
reduced versus <italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R</xref>).</p>
<p>Since vascular endothelial cells that advance in the telencephalon form a
functional BBB during embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup>, and extrinsic addition of GABA (5 μM) was
able to increase expression of claudin 5 in WT periventricular endothelial
cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure
S5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S5L</xref>), we tested the barrier
properties in <italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
dorsal telencephalon in detail. Claudin 5 showed robust expression in E16
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cortical blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S</xref>) but <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> vessels
showed a loss of tight junctions and reduced claudin 5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4T</xref>). Another tight junction protein, ZO-1,
was also reduced in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial cells versus
control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure
S5M</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S5N</xref>). We next checked
for leakage of IgG using IHC, since IgGs are restricted to the insides of
vessels. Contrary to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4U</xref>), IgG
leakage and extravascular IgG staining was observed in the dorsal and medial
telencephalon (developing hippocampus) of E17 <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4V</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4W</xref>). To better determine barrier properties, E18
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice and littermate controls were given
a trans-cardiac perfusion of biotinylated dextran.
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice showed an increase in tracer staining
in the dorsal telencephalon indicative of increased vascular permeability
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4X</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4Y</xref>).
Together, these results suggested an impairment of the BBB in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice. It illustrates the importance of
endothelial cell-derived GABA for angiogenesis and formation of barrier
properties in the embryonic telencephalon.</p>

<sec>
<title>Endothelial GABA promotes long-distance GABAergic neuronal
migration</title>
<p>By turning off endothelial GABA secretion during embryonic brain development,
we were able to evaluate the significance of endothelial GABA for key events
during brain development — neurogenesis and neuronal migration. No
marked changes were seen in neuroepithelial cell proliferation in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon as observed by the 2.0 h
BrdU labeling index at early (E13) and late (E17) embryonic stages
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S6</xref>).
Since periventricular blood vessels have been shown to influence ventral
telencephalic progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup>, cell
proliferation was further analyzed in the ventral telencephalon of E15
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice by examining interkinetic nuclear
migration with phosphohistone 3 (PHH3), a specific marker for cells
undergoing mitosis. There were no differences in the number of
PHH3<sup>+</sup> cells at the ventricular zone (VZ) of
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> versus <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
ventral telencephalon. However, abnormal PHH3<sup>+</sup> profiles were
observed in the extra-VZ surface of <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> ventral
telencephalon, along with a small but significant increase in the number of
PHH3<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information,
Figure S7A-S7E</xref>). Ki67 labeling (a marker for all phases of
the cell cycle: S, G2, M and G1) was increased at the extra-VZ surface of
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> ventral telencephalon versus
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> ventral telencephalon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S7G</xref>). Some microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)
immunoreactive postmitotic neurons were observed within the neuroepithelium
in the GE in the <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> embryos, revealing evidence of
impaired differentiation and perturbed neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S7H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S7I</xref>). The GABAergic neurons in the
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon were significantly
affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), while tyrosine
hydroxylase<sup>+</sup> neurons were not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S7J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S7K</xref>). The GABAergic neuronal tangential migratory profile,
examined with GAD65/67 immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in E13 and
E15 <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> dorsal telencephalon when compared to
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-5D</xref>). Since <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial
cells did not secrete GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), they
were valuable for testing whether it was specifically endothelial
cell-derived GABA that acted as a chemoattractant and provided directional
cues to migrating neurons. Our experimental strategy was to seed either E15
WT periventricular endothelial cells, control endothelial cells (from WT
midbrain and hindbrain combined) or <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
periventricular endothelial cells (that do not secrete GABA) in a specific
track spanning a 35 mm culture dish. WT GE-derived neurons from E15
GAD65-GFP telencephalon were plated at one end of the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). GE neurons migrated robustly on a bed of
WT periventricular endothelial cells from one end of the dish to the other
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>).
The control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>) confirmed that GE neuronal migration was specifically
affected by periventricular endothelial cells. Most importantly, GE neurons
failed to migrate long distance on <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
periventricular endothelial cells that cannot secrete GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>). Similar
results were obtained when GE explants were cultured on
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> or <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
periventricular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).
Extrinsic addition of GABA (5 μM) was able to rescue GE neuronal
migration on <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> periventricular endothelial cells
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S8</xref>)
indicating the importance of the endothelial GABA source for neuronal
migration. To test whether loss of endothelial GABA has consequences for
GABA neuronal migration routes and distribution <italic>in vivo</italic>, we
performed a BrdU birthdating study. We followed a single cohort of
GE-derived interneurons by labeling cells born at E13 with a single BrdU
pulse and analyzed their distribution in the E17 cortex. BrdU IHC by both
fluorescence and DAB methods revealed several stalled BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells
in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> ventral telencephalon when compared to
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> telencephalon at both rostral and
caudal levels indicative of abnormal GABAergic neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I-5L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary
information, Figure S9</xref>). Double IHC for BrdU and LHX6 (a
marker for migrating interneurons) highlighted layer-specific alterations in
laminar targeting of GABAergic interneurons in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
developing neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M-5R</xref>). While
LHX<sup>−</sup> BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly
reduced only in the cortical plate (CP) suggesting that laminar positioning
of cortical projection neurons may also be affected in the
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q</xref>), LHX6<sup>+</sup> BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were
significantly decreased in the marginal zone, CP and subventricular zone
(SVZ) of <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon indicative of perturbed
GABAergic neuronal tangential migration and final distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5R</xref>). Together, these results signify that
endothelial cell-secreted GABA is essential for long-distance GABAergic
neuronal migration in the embryonic telencephalon.</p>

<title>Disturbances in radial neuronal migration in the absence of endothelial
GABA</title>
<p>Earlier studies have shown that intermediate progenitors, the precursors of
projection neurons in the developing neocortex are very closely associated
with periventricular blood vessels and are influenced by vascular
cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup>. PHH3 labeling
showed an increase in mitotic cells in the SVZ of E15
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon, while no differences
were observed in the ventricular border (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary
information, Figure S10A-S10D</xref>). The distribution of cells
expressing the transcription factor Tbr2 that selectively marks intermediate
progenitors, precursors of cortical projection neurons was next examined in
the dorsal telencephalon. Tbr2-positive cells were predominant in the VZ/SVZ
of <italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> telencephalon, but ectopic increases in
Tbr2-positive cells were observed in the intermediate zone (IZ) and CP of
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S10E-S10G</xref>). Spatial
patterns of neuronal differentiation were examined by expression of MAP2 and
cortical neuron population marker Tbr1, which marks CP and layer VI in WT
embryos. MAP2-positive postmitotic neurons were detected within the SVZ in
E15 <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon, revealing evidence of
perturbed neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary
information, Figure S10H</xref>). Tbr1 immunoreactivity revealed a
continuous uniform band of Tbr1-positive cells in the CP of E18
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> embryos. On the other hand, abnormally

<title>Gene expression profiling of <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon
predicts its postnatal phenotype</title>
<p>Our previous studies have implicated the importance of periventricular
endothelial cells for a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>, therefore we questioned the
significance of loss of the endothelial GABA source for global gene
expression in the embryonic forebrain. We extracted RNA from
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> whole
telencephalon (E18), respectively; performed microarray hybridization on
Mouse Gene 2.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix) and subsequent differential expression
analysis. Two hundred and eighty six genes were differentially expressed
(fold change cut off ≥ ± 50%) in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> versus <italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>
telencephalon of which the top 20 genes rated by significance have been
depicted as a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Genes were
further classified into three categories that are essential for embryonic
forebrain development: angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>),
neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and GABAergic neuronal
development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Top 20 differentially
expressed genes in each category are shown. The gene expression profile
revealed that loss of endothelial GABA has far reaching consequences for
critical events during brain development and can modulate signaling events
at the level of extracellular receptors, ion channels, transporters,
intracellular signaling molecules as well as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-6D</xref>). For instance, critical regulators of
vascular morphogenesis and structure formation (<italic>Wasf2</italic>,
<italic>Rasip1</italic>, <italic>Fmnl3</italic> and <italic>Tbx4</italic>) were downregulated in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Genes involved in cell proliferation, cell
adhesion and cytoskeletal organization pathways were altered in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon (either significantly
upregulated or downregulated) when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-6D</xref>). Since <italic>Vgat</italic> (<italic>Slc32a1</italic>) had been
deleted from endothelial cells, the heat map showed decreased expression of
<italic>Slc32a1</italic> in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> whole telencephalon as
expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). <italic>Gabrb3</italic>, on the
other hand, was significantly upregulated in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Another interesting
gene, <italic>Shank3</italic>, that is widely linked with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> was
significantly downregulated in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>What may be the signaling mechanisms perturbed by the loss of <italic>Vgat</italic>
specifically in periventricular endothelial cells that contribute to the
impaired telencephalic angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>)?
How does endothelial GABA interact with other signaling systems previously
shown to regulate angiogenesis? To address these questions, we looked at
three signaling pathways — VEGF signaling, Delta-Notch signaling
and Wnt signaling, that are implicated in regulating diverse aspects of CNS
angiogenesis. We examined expression of ligand/receptor combinations:
vascular endothelial growth factor (isoform A; <italic>Vegfa</italic>) and its
receptors <italic>Flk1</italic> and <italic>Flt1</italic>, <italic>Dll4</italic> and its receptor
<italic>Notch1</italic>, Wnt signaling ligands (<italic>Wnt7a</italic> and
<italic>Wnt7b</italic>) and receptor <italic>Frizzled6</italic>, specifically in
periventricular endothelial cells, isolated from E15
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
telencephalons. There was a significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) decrease
in <italic>Vegfa</italic>, <italic>Flk1</italic>, <italic>Dll4</italic>, <italic>Wnt7b</italic> and
<italic>Frizzled6</italic> mRNA (but not <italic>Flt1, Notch1</italic> and
<italic>Wnt7a</italic> mRNA) in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> endothelial cells
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Since loss of endothelial
<italic>Vgat</italic> altered the expression of molecules critical for
telencephalic angiogenesis, our results suggest that other important
angiogenesis signaling pathways may be either under direct control of or
actively interacting with the endothelial GABA signaling pathway.</p>
<p>We next questioned whether the gene expression profile of
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> embryonic telencephalon could be used
to predict the postnatal phenotype of <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice
using the Comparative Toxicogenomic Database. When genes were classified
according to disease categories, the genes expressed in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon showed enrichment in
neuropsychiatric disease categories like seizures, epilepsy, depression and
autism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S11</xref>). Several different
types of epilepsies appeared in the list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure
6F</xref>). Epilepsy-related genes that were altered in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon were isolated and grouped
into specific categories, from the CTD database and from an elegant
study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> describing the
genetic landscape of early postnatal (infancy and childhood) epilepsies
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Table S1</xref>).
Childhood epilepsies comprise many age-related epilepsy syndromes
characterized by specific seizure types and neurological features and are a
heterogeneous group of devastating disorders that cause developmental delays
or regression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>. Scatter plots
depict the changes in epilepsy-related gene expression in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon when compared to controls
for all genes combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), McTague only
genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) and genes isolated from the
CTD database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Specific genes that
showed changes in expression in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon,
with respect to different groups of childhood epilepsies (isolated

<title>Postnatal phenotype of <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>No marked perturbation of cortical cytoarchitecture (e.g., heterotopias,
dysplasia) was observed in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon at
late embryonic stage E18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-7E</xref>).
However, enlarged lateral ventricles were routinely seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-7E</xref>), and abnormal cellularity in the CP was observed
along the rostrocaudal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D</xref>). Interestingly, the postnatal phenotype of
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice turned out similar to the
predictions offered by the prenatal gene expression signature.
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice were smaller in size at birth than
their floxed littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice started to show seizure-like
activity between P7 and P14. Alterations in postnatal behavior were
characterized by periods of quiescence, interrupted by tremors and a
reduction in voluntary movement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary
information, Movie S1</xref>). <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice
were fragile and died between P20 and P35. Since
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice were unable to survive the surgical
procedure for <italic>in vivo</italic> EEG recordings, we performed field potential
recordings to measure the degree of hyperexcitability in hippocampal slices.
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> slices displayed ictal-type discharges
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7J</xref>),
discontinuous interictal activity and spreading depression (SD), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7J</xref>) when
compared to floxed controls that showed continuous interictal activity and
no SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7J</xref>). Control slices displayed ictal-type discharges with a
significantly lower frequency than <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> slices
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Furthermore,
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> slices exclusively showed repetitive
SDs (61.5% of slices), while control slices showed none (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> slices showed no
interictal discharges in 23% of the preparations, continuous interictal
activity in another 23% and discontinuous interictal activity in 54% of the
preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). On the other hand,
controls showed discontinuous interictal activity in 20% of the
preparations, and in 80% only continuous interictal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). The ictal type activity in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> slices is indicative of higher network
excitability and epileptogenicity. Higher SD susceptibility has also been
linked to higher epileptogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup>. Furthermore, SD has been reported to trigger
ictal-like activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (in rat brain slices)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup>, or enhance evoked
activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup>. Importantly,
SD has also been shown to enhance excitability in human epileptic neocortex
<italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup>. In
conclusion, increased SD susceptibility is also a sign of increased
excitability.</p>
<p>Developmental milestones of <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice were
significantly affected. Beginning on postnatal day 1 (PND 1), the mice were
examined daily for acquisition of somatosensory reflexes and
neurodevelopmental markers: surface righting, air righting, grasping and
negative geotaxis. <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice showed a deficit in
surface righting and forelimb grasping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure
7L</xref>). Maternal scent preference, a test for social
communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> was
conducted on PND 14 pups. While <italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice spent
significantly more time in the mother's bedding, indicative of social
recognition of maternal scent when compared to the scent of a stranger
female, <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice showed significantly lower
preference for maternal scent by comparison to the stranger's scent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>). <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice did
not show signs of impaired movement capability in the maternal scent test.
These data indicate that developmental milestones and social recognition are
impaired in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice. Collectively, these results
suggest that <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice can serve as a model for
infantile/childhood epilepsy or ASD.</p>

<title>Marked vascular and interneuron deficits in the
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> cerebral cortex</title>
<p>Cortical regions — cingulate, motor, somatosensory and piriform
cortex in the <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> brain at P30 were more
significantly affected than in the <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> brain, and
reductions in vessel density were observed at all of the bregma levels
examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>). To evaluate the putative damage of the BBB at P30, we
looked for a leakage of serum IgGs using IHC. No IgG leakage was observed in
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> somatosensory cortex while on the
other hand, extra-vascular IgGs were detected in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). IgGs formed halos with a concentration gradient
around <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> microvessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure
8D</xref>). Next we performed a double fluorescence labeling for IgG
and isolectin B4 on P30 <italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> sections. While immunohistochemical
localization of IgG and isolectin B4 was observed in
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure
8E</xref>), IgG leakage along with neuronal uptake was observed in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> somatosensory cortex, 6 or 24 h after
limbic status epilepticus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8G</xref>) indicative of a rapid BBB impairment.</p>
<p>Concurrent reductions in GABAergic interneurons was observed in cingulate,
motor, somatosensory and piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure
8H-8I</xref>). Layer-specific loss of GABAergic interneurons along
with abnormal GABAergic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>) and
glutamatergic neuronal distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary
information, Figure S14A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S14B</xref>) was marked in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> cerebral
cortex, which is indicative of an asynchronous cortical circuitry.
Activation of caspase 3 was insignificant in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
cortex, further demonstrating that the GABA cell deficits were not due to
GABAergic neuronal cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary
information, Figure S14C-S14E</xref>). We also tested whether
specific subtypes of GABAergic interneurons were affected in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> cerebral cortex. Our results showed
that while the calretinin population was not affected,
somatostatin<sup>+</sup> and NPY<sup>+</sup> neurons were reduced, but
the most significantly affected population was the parvalbumin<sup>+</sup>
neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). This is particularly
interesting since parvalbumin<sup>+</sup> neurons account for ∼50%
of the GABAergic interneurons in the rodent cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup>. The parvalbumin subpopulation seems to be
markedly affected in epilepsy and ASDs, possibly because these cells are
less proficient at inhibiting pyramidal cells. In
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice, similar to the GABAergic interneuron
profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>), parvalbumin<sup>+</sup>
neurons also showed abnormal distribution and layer specific reductions in
somatosensory cortex. Cells appeared to be stuck and clustered in lower
layers (layer V) in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> cortex, while layers II/III
showed the most significant reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure
8K-8M</xref>).</p>
<p>Parvalbumin<sup>+</sup> interneuron class comprises of basket cells that
focus on targeting the somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons
and interneurons, and this gives them the unique advantage to regulate the
gain of the integrated synaptic response. Large basket cells are classic
basket cells with extensive axonal arborizations that can inhibit neurons in
lower and upper layers and in neighboring and distant columns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup>. Golgi impregnation and morphological
analysis showed differences in axonal arborizations of large basket cells in
layer II/III from <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> somatosensory cortex when
compared to <italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure
8N-8Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure
S15A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S15B</xref>). While
<italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> basket cells had long horizontally and
vertically projecting axon collaterals that arborized on and around somata
of target neurons, <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> basket cells had
shorter-range axon collaterals that failed to do so. There was a significant
reduction in total dendritic lengths of basket cells (41%) in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8R</xref>).
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> basket cells also showed a reduction in
the number of dendritic segments (37%) as compared to controls. By comparing
the dendritic length versus branch order, <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
basket cells showed a significant reduction in dendritic length in the
middle portion, the 4th and 5th branch orders of the dendritic tree
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure
S15C</xref>). To further investigate dentritic morphology of SS1 basket
cells, Sholl analysis was performed in order to characterize the
morphological changes in reference to a series of concentric circles
(spheres in 3D) around the soma of the basket cell. Frequency of (dendritic)
intersections at a 30-μm interval from the soma of basket cells
between <italic>Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
groups was determined. The <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> group exhibited a
significant reduction in the frequency of intersections in the middle
portion (60-120 μm) of the dendritic field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure
8S</xref>). Also, <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> basket cells showed a
reduction of dendritic lengths in the middle portion (90-120 μm) of
the dendritic field (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure
S15D</xref>). These results illustrate significant alterations in
the dendritic morphology of basket cells of <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic>
somatosensory cortex. It signifies the importance of endothelial
cell-derived GABA for normal formation and synchronization of the cortical
microcircuitry.</p>

<sec>
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Radial glia, which are cortical neural stem cells, cortical progenitors and
migrating GABA neurons have all been reported to express functional
GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors early in development that
respond to ambient GABA levels in many different ways to trigger several
important events during cerebral cortex development. GABA has been well
established as the first excitatory transmitter to become functional in the
embryonic brain, acting as an epigenetic factor to control processes like neural
progenitor proliferation, neuronal migration, dendritic maturation and
synaptogenesis, and is a key player in building the cortical
network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup>. Specifically,
during the tangential neuronal migration process, neocortical GABAergic
interneurons progressively acquire responsiveness to GABA; the paracrine actions
of GABA acting on several receptor subtypes, being the key motility promoting
signal. The functional expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits in
tangentially migrating interneurons derived from the MGE has recently been
characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup>. While early
migrating interneurons express alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits when they are at the
corticostriate junction, they additionally upregulate alpha 1 and gamma 1-3
subunits as soon as they enter the developing cortex and the functional
implications of this upregulation of multiple GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor isoforms
with higher affinity to GABA in the migration process is not known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup>. Within the cortex, GABA's complexity
increases and it has been reported to play contrasting roles on migrating
neurons by acting as a 'GO' signal in lower layers and as a 'STOP' signal in
upper cortical layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup>. These
multiple actions of GABA exerted at different developmental stages all appear to
be mediated through a paracrine, diffuse, non-synaptic mode of action. However,
current views of neocortical development have depicted this source of GABA
during corticogenesis to be exclusively neuronal. And given its multiple roles
in cerebral cortex development, GABA has been epitomized as a deeply interesting
and versatile molecule.</p>
<p>We believe that the cell-type specific source that secretes GABA in the embryonic
forebrain is the key to its versatility. Neuronal GABA seems to be sufficient to
some degree for telencephalic neurogenesis in the absence of endothelial GABA. A
previous study has demonstrated that GABA promotes VZ cell division while
inhibiting SVZ cell divisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup>. Our
study also shows differences in cell proliferation in the absence of endothelial
GABA in the VZ versus SVZ. The increase in cells undergoing mitosis in the SVZ
of <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon suggests that endothelial GABA
functions to inhibit cell proliferation here, while neuronal GABA is sufficient
for VZ cell proliferation. Also, while possible paracrine roles of neuronal GABA
on angiogenesis cannot be overlooked, it was clearly unable to rescue the
vascular defects in the absence of endothelial GABA. Our results show that
endothelial GABA is indispensable for angiogenesis and GABAergic neuronal
tangential migration in the embryonic telencephalon. Neuronal GABA cannot
compensate for these unique roles of endothelial GABA. Endothelial GABA may be a
requisite for fostering neurovascular interactions in the long term. For
instance, if GABA coming from neurons can contribute to GABA<sub>A</sub>
receptor-mediated GABA release from endothelial cells, then it is possible that
loss of this chemotactic signal during development due to stalled and abnormal
neuronal migration as observed in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> telencephalon,
may in turn have affected angiogenesis. Thus, the downstream cellular mechanism
of endothelial GABA-mediated regulation is its key effect on neuronal migration
that is highly concentration, time and location dependent.</p>
<p>Endothelial GABA closely influences key angiogenesis signaling pathways
— VEGF, Delta-Notch and Wnt signaling, that play important roles in
endothelial cell proliferation, migration, sprouting, vascular pattern formation
and induction of BBB properties. The marked impairment of telencephalic
angiogenesis that lead to BBB defects in <italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice may
be due to direct links between endothelial GABA and BBB function, for instance,
regulation of tight junction protein expression by GABA. Since our study has
identified the relevant ligand/receptor pairs, it will facilitate future
mechanistic studies linking endothelial GABA signaling with specific
angiogenesis processes. The stalled GABAergic neuronal migration and
accumulation in the ventral telencephalon due to absence of endothelial GABA
also highlights the importance of endothelial versus neuronal GABA for
subtype-specific contributions to the cerebral cortex. Parvalbumin<sup>+</sup>
neurons derive almost entirely from the MGE, whereas contributions from both MGE
and CGE have been reported for somatostatin<sup>+</sup>, NPY<sup>+</sup> and
CR<sup>+</sup> neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup>. The
marked reduction of the parvalbumin<sup>+</sup> population in
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice highlights the important contribution
of endothelial GABA for MGE-derived GABAergic neuronal migration. Interestingly,
susceptibility of the parvalbumin population has been reported in
neuropsychiatric diseases like schizophrenia, epilepsy and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup>. Though
GABAergic cell death was not significant in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> and
<italic>Vgat<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> brains, we cannot rule out possible
contributions of reactive astrocytosis and microglial activation for some of the
adult phenotypes.</p>
<p>Since development of the periventricular vascular gradient precedes neuronal
migration during embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>, we think that the
mechanism of GABA release from periventricular endothelial cells is constitutive
at first, then facilitated by GABA itself. GABA-mediated activation of
endothelial GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors triggers an increase in intracellular
Ca<sup>2+</sup> that in turn induces endothelial cell proliferation.
Endothelial GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor beta 3 subunit is not only essential for
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor functions, but also modulates GABA expression,
resulting in lowered GABA levels in <italic>Gabrb3<sup>ECKO</sup></italic> mice during
embryonic development. This is of interest, since silencing GABA<sub>A</sub>
receptor subunits alters GABA expression and release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> and correlations between lowered GABA levels and
altered GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors have been reported in many neuropsychiatric
disease scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup>. In addition, our studies show that <italic>Vgat</italic> is
the primary mechanism for GABA release from endothelial cells in the embryonic
telencephalon, since loss of endothelial <italic>Vgat</italic> completely abolished
endothelial GABA secretion. Our experiments thus point to a novel positive
feedback of GABA release that is essential for telencephalic angiogenesis
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Since GABA itself promotes the
developmental switch from excitatory during prenatal development to inhibitory
at birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup>, it would be
interesting for future studies to dissect the specific roles of the endothelial
GABA signaling pathway and novel mechanisms of action in the postnatal and adult
brain.</p>
<p>Disturbances in vessel function, BBB and blood flow have repeatedly been observed
in patients with epilepsy, ASDs, anxiety, depression and schizophrenia using old
and new technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup>. However, these
disturbances are usually linked to inflammation, changes in neural plasticity or
seizure frequency. Our studies provide a direct cause for change in vessel
function in psychiatric disorders that originates from intrinsic defects in
vessels from the earliest developmental points. It illustrates the importance of
a new endothelial GABA signaling pathway that molds neuronal development making
lasting changes to cortical circuits and most importantly is sufficient to cause
behavioral dysfunction. Our study also introduces the novel concept that
variation in endothelial GABA levels during embryonic brain development can
contribute to diversity in psychiatric disease symptoms.</p>
<p>We suggest re-consideration of current concepts that depict GABA signaling during
brain development as predominantly neuronal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure
9B</xref>). The GABA balance in the embryonic telencephalon is maintained
by both endothelial cells and neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure
9C</xref>). Tipping the balance by either reducing or eliminating the
endothelial GABA source can result in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases
such as autism, epilepsy, anxiety, depression or schizophrenia. These findings
establish novel autonomous links between blood vessels and the origin of
neuropsychiatric disease. Additionally, a role for modulation of
vascular/endothelial GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors emerges as a contributing factor
for neuropsychiatric disease origin. Many tranquilizers, sedatives, anesthetics
and anti-epileptic drugs used in obstetric medicine modulate GABA<sub>A</sub>
receptor-GABA function. Such treatments during pregnancy may cause problems in
developing fetuses. Also, it is possible that altered GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
expression, altered NKCC1/KCC2 expression and altered chloride concentrations in
telencephalic endothelial cells may have direct consequences for angiogenesis
and neuronal migration. A 'GABA therapy' might hold significant promise in some
cases for the prenatal treatment or prevention of neuropsychiatric diseases. The
clinical applications of angiogenesis today benefits millions of patients with
cancer, blinding eye diseases, stroke and neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup>; in a similar way we expect this study to
open new doors and accelerate innovative angiogenesis-mediated therapies for
neuropsychiatric diseases.</p>

<title>Histology, immunohistochemistry and microscopic analysis</title>
<p>Paraffin IHC and fixed slice IHC was performed on embryonic brains, while
frozen section IHC was used on postnatal brains. Briefly, for paraffin IHC
— E13, E15 and E17 brains were fixed in zinc fixative (BD
Biosciences Pharmingen) for 24 h and processed for paraffin histology.
Histological stainings with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories) and eosin
(Sigma) were performed on 8 μm coronal sections. Lectin
histochemistry (with biotinylated isolectin B4, 1:50, Sigma) as well as IHC
was performed on 20 μm sections. Primary antibodies used for IHC were
as follows: anti-CD31/PECAM-1 (1:50, BD Biosciences Pharmingen),
anti-GAD65/67 (1:50, Millipore), anti-GABRB3 (1:50; Sigma), anti-VGAT
(1:100, Synaptic Systems), anti-PHH3 (1:200, Millipore), anti-MAP2 (1:50,
Sigma), anti-TBR1 and TBR2 (1:100, Abcam), anti-Ki67 (1:30, Sigma) and
anti-TH (1:200, Millipore) followed by secondary detection with AlexaFluor
conjugates (Invitrogen). DAPI (Vector Laboratories) was used to label
nuclei. For slice preparations and IHC, brains from E13 and E15 embryos were
collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. Vibratome slices
(50 μm) were prepared and incubated in anti-biotinylated isolectin B4
(1:40, Sigma) with 1% TritonX-100 at 4 <sup>ο</sup>C overnight.
After six washes in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), slices were incubated
with secondary antibody (Alexa 594 streptavidin conjugate) for 6 h at 4
<sup>ο</sup>C, washed and mounted. For frozen section IHC, P30
and P90 brains were removed, fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h, cryo-protected in
sucrose gradient, embedded into frozen blocks; sectioned at 40 μm on
a cryostat and immunostained with anti-isolectin B4 (1:50, Sigma), anti-GABA
(1:400, Sigma), anti-calretinin (1:200; Swant), anti-somatostatin (1:2 000;
Bachem), anti-NPY (1:1 000, Millipore), anti-parvalbumin (1:200,
Immunostar), anti-caspase (1:200, Millipore) and anti-VGLUT1 (1:200,
Synaptic Systems) antibodies. Twenty sections from each brain were used for
IHC and histology experiments. Uniform penetration of antibodies or stains
throughout the section was ascertained and quality of the staining in each
digital section was examined. Only those sections which showed uniform
labeling were included in further analysis. All low- and high-magnification
images were obtained from an FSX100 microscope (Olympus).</p>

<title>Morphometry</title>
<p>A stereological point grid was superimposed on digital images of biotinylated
isolectin-B4<sup>+</sup> vessels using ImageJ software. The ratio
between points falling on blood vessels and on brain tissue was calculated
for each section, and average values were obtained for four specific
cortical regions: cingulate, somatosensory and piriform (at bregma levels
1.5, 0.5 and −1.5), and motor (at bregma levels (1.5 and 0.5)
using stereotaxic coordinates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Cell counting</title>
<p>Profiles of GABA<sup>+</sup> immunoreactive cells were counted in the four
areas of cortex: cingulate, somatosensory and piriform (at bregma levels
1.5, 0.5 and −1.5), and motor (at bregma levels (1.5, 0.5) using
stereotaxic coordinates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup>.
Profiles of GABA subtype immunoreactive cells were counted in the
somatosensory cortex (at bregma level 0.5). For each area, cells in the
strip of cortex from the pial surface to the white-gray matter interface was
counted using ImageJ software and plotted. Details of sample size evaluation
are provided in 'statistical analysis' and sample sizes are provided in

<title>Lectin perfusion and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Prior to killing and tissue harvest, animals were injected retroorbitally
with 100 μl Fluorescein-labeled Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato)
Lectin solution (Vector laboratories) over 2 min. About 5 min after
completion of the lectin injection, whole mouse brains were harvested after
intracardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Tissue was then
fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, embedded in paraffin, and
mounted on glass slides in 10-μm thick sections. Prior to IHC, tissue
was deparaffinized and antigen retrieval was performed in a pH 9 solution
(DAKO) at 96 °C. To prevent non-specific staining, sections were
incubated with 5% normal donkey serum in PBS prior to incubation with an
anti-CD31 mAb (1:20, Dianova), followed by secondary detection with a
fluorescent antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). All image analyses were
performed using ImageJ software. In brief, CD31-positive images were
thresholded using an automatic ImageJ thresholding function, binary images
generated, and CD31<sup>+</sup> vessel ROIs (region of interests) generated.
For MVD measurements, this number was correlated with the analyzed tissue
area to compute micro vessel density. Vessel diameter was analyzed by
selectively measuring the Feret's diameter in only elongated vessels. For
lectin measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref></sup>, the CD31
ROIs were overlayed over binary images from the lectin channel. The area
percentage of the lectin positive area in each vessel ROI was measured and
the average lectin area per vessel was plotted using the prism software.</p>

<title>Isolation and primary culture of endothelial cells</title>
<p>Embryonic brains were dissected under a stereo microscope and the
telencephalon was removed. Pial membranes were peeled out and pooled (pial
endothelial cells). The remaining telencephalon without pial membranes was
pooled as well (periventricular endothelial cells). Mesencephalon and
metencephalon were combined to prepare control endothelial cells. Purity of
endothelial cell cultures was established with endothelial cell markers and
determined to be 100%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup>. Isolation and culture of endothelial

embryos. Endothelial cells were labeled with the following primary
antibodies: anti-biotinylated isolectin B4 (1:40, Sigma), anti-GABA (1:400,

(Invitrogen). DAPI (Invitrogen) was used to label nuclei. Images were taken
on an FSX100 microscope (Olympus). One million cells were examined for each
IHC condition.</p>
<p><bold>Transwell assay</bold> Endothelial cell migration was evaluated in 24-well
transwell chambers (8-μm pore size; Corning, Lowell, MA, USA). The
cells were labeled with Qdot nanocrystals (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
seeded into the upper chamber at 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well.
The bottom chamber was filled with serum-supplemented endothelial cell
culture medium to serve as a chemoattractant. Cells were incubated at 37
°C for 24 h in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
Cells that migrated through the membrane were fixed, imaged and the number
of cells from five different fields (upper, lower, right, left and center)
of view was quantified to get an average sum of cells that migrated through
the membrane and quantified.</p>
<p><bold>Long-distance cell migration assay</bold> In preparation for cell migration
assays, square culture inserts (ibidi GmbH) were placed along the entire
diameter of a 35 mm dish to create a long track. Cultures of endothelial
cells were plated throughout the track while E15 GE-derived
GAD65-GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons were plated at one end of the track.
Endothelial cells were labeled with cell trace marker (CellLight Plasma
Membrane-RFP, BacMam 2.0, Invitrogen) to visualize endothelial cell
morphologies during subsequent imaging. The co-culture was maintained for 24
h in FCS-DMEM (Invitrogen). The migration of neurons on endothelial cells
from one end of the dish to the other spanning a distance of 3.5 cm was
imaged and quantified.</p>
<p><bold>Chemoattraction assay</bold> To prepare explants for chemoattraction assays,
the GE region was micro-dissected from GAD65-GFP<sup>+</sup>ve brains and

<p>Immunofluorescence for claudin 5 and IgG were performed on 40 μm cryo
sections with anti-claudin 5 (1:200, Thermo Fisher), anti-mouse IgG antibody
(1:200, Molecular Probes) and anti-ZO1 (1:400, Thermo Fisher), respectively.
For double-fluorescence labeling for IgG and isolectin B4, cryo sections (10
μm) were first incubated with anti-biotinylated isolectin B4 antibody
(1:100, Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, they were
incubated with secondary antibody, streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 488 at room
temperature for 30 min. After being washed in PBS, they were then incubated
with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular
Probes) at a dilution of 1:200 for 30 min. Finally, they were examined in an
FSX100 microscope. Trans-cardiac perfusion of E18 embryos was performed with
3 kDa biotinylated dextran (0.15 mg/ml, Invitrogen), tissue sections were
stained with streptavidin Alexa 594 and fluorescence in tissue sections was
quantified by ImageJ software. Perfusions and analysis was done blinded to

<p>Cultured mouse E15 periventricular endothelial cells and cortical neuronal
cells plated on 10 mm glass cover slips were placed inside a 35 mm culture
dish with cover glass bottom (WPI FD35 FluoroDish) and continuously perfused
with an extracellular solution at a rate of 2 ml/min. The extracellular
solution contained 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM
HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.3. Membrane currents were recorded by whole-cell
configuration of the patch clamp technique using a List EPC7 amplifier
(Medical System), at room temperature and at a holding potential of
−70 mV. The intracellular solution used contained 140 mM potassium
gluconate, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 4 mM
Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM Na-GTP, pH 7.3. With this set of recording solutions, the
chloride reversal potential (E-Cl<sup>−</sup>) was −61.8
mV at 24 °C. Data were filtered digitally at 2 KHz and acquired at 5
KHz by an Axon Instrument digitizer (Digidata 1322B) with pClamp 9 software
using a Dell computer. Muscimol (Sigma) was applied with a puffer pipette
(∼1 μm pore diameter) close to the cell (∼20
μm) by pressure ejection with a Picospritzer (General Valve). BMI
(Sigma) was applied by bath perfusion. Drugs were kept at
−20° as concentrated stock solutions and diluted on the
day of the experiment.</p>
<p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> assays, E15 periventricular endothelial cells (1 million
cells per assay) were incubated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye FluoForte
AM according to manufacturer's instructions (Enzo Life Sciences), loaded
into the chamber of an FSX100 microscope and imaged continuously before and
after muscimol application. Fluorescence micrographs were digitalized and
results were expressed as change in fluorescence over baseline
fluorescence.</p>
<p>To test for cell proliferation, E15 periventricular endothelial cells (1
million cells per experiment) were incubated in the presence of the mitotic
marker 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (0.05% BrdU) for 1 h with or

<title>Hippocampal slice recordings</title>
<p>Procedures for recordings were as described earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref></sup>. In brief, mice were anesthetized with

CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 13 glucose). All solutions were
equilibrated with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub> to yield a pH of 7.4.
Horizontal slices of ventral hippocampus (400 μm) were cut on a
vibratome (Leica) and stored in a chamber filled with artificial

NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3 KCl, 1.25, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5
CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 13 glucose. Then, slices were
gradually brought to room temperature and allowed to recover for at least 60
min before recording. Generally, 2-4 slices per animal were used. For
electrophysiological recordings, slices were transferred to an interface
recording chamber perfused with ACSF (at 32 °C). Field potential
recordings were obtained from the stratum radiatum of CA1 subfield using
glass micropipettes (1 MΩ) filled with ACSF (DC recording,

<p>The significance of endothelial cell-derived GABA for brain development.
<bold>(A)</bold> Summary schema depicting a novel positive feedback GABA
signaling pathway in telencephalic endothelial cells. Endothelial GABA
activates GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, triggering Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and
endothelial cell proliferation. Endothelial GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
β3 subunit can regulate GABA expression. VGAT is the primary
mechanism for GABA release from telencephalic endothelial cells. Endothelial
GABA release is essential for both angiogenesis and GABAergic neuronal
migration in the embryonic telencephalon. <bold>(B)</bold> Current concepts depict
the source of GABA in the embryonic telencephalon as neuronal. <bold>(C)</bold>
Our studies show that the GABA balance in the embryonic telencephalon is
maintained by both endothelial cells and neurons. Neuronal GABA cannot
compensate for the loss of endothelial GABA. Tipping the balance to cause
partial or complete loss of endothelial GABA can result in a spectrum of
neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety
and depression.</p>
