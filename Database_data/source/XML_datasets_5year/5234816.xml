<abstract>
<p>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is substantially heritable, but few molecular genetic risk factors have been identified. Knockout mice lacking SLIT and NTRK-Like Family, Member 5 (SLITRK5) display OCD-like phenotypes including serotonin reuptake inhibitor-sensitive pathologic grooming, and corticostriatal dysfunction. Thus, mutations that impair SLITRK5 function may contribute to the genetic risk for OCD. We re-sequenced the protein-coding sequence of the human SLITRK5 gene (<italic>SLITRK5</italic>) in three hundred and seventy seven OCD subjects and compared rare non-synonymous mutations (RNMs) in that sample with similar mutations in the 1000 Genomes database. We also performed <italic>in silico</italic> assessments and <italic>in vitro</italic> functional synaptogenesis assays on the Slitrk5 mutations identified. We identified four RNM’s among these OCD subjects. There were no significant differences in the prevalence or <italic>in silico</italic> effects of rare non-synonymous mutations in the OCD sample versus controls. Direct functional testing of recombinant SLITRK5 proteins found that all mutations identified in OCD subjects impaired synaptogenic activity whereas none of the pseudo-matched mutations identified in 1000 Genomes controls had significant effects on SLITRK5 function (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.028). These results demonstrate that rare functional mutations in <italic>SLITRK5</italic> contribute to the genetic risk for OCD in human populations. They also highlight the importance of biological characterization of allelic effects in understanding genotype-phenotype relationships as there were no statistical differences in overall prevalence or bioinformatically predicted effects of OCD case versus control mutations. Finally, these results converge with others to highlight the role of aberrant synaptic function in corticostriatal neurons in the pathophysiology of OCD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder consisting of persistent, intrusive, distressing thoughts and repetitive, compulsive behaviors and mental rituals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref001">1</xref>]. Epidemiologic studies have determined that OCD displays a substantial heritable component of risk, however, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref004">4</xref>]. Recent large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) of OCD have identified common polymorphisms that are associated with OCD at near genome-wide significance levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref006">6</xref>]. These studies have demonstrated that the genetic architecture of OCD is very complex likely consisting of hundreds to thousands of common polymorphisms each of small effect size. The small effect sizes of these risk alleles prevents their practical usage as clinical biomarkers but OCD GWAS’s have begun to identify biological processes in which the associated polymorphisms are enriched and thus presumably underlie the pathophysiology of OCD.</p>
<p>Recently it has been appreciated that, in addition to common polymorphisms, rare genetic variation can contribute to the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders in human populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref007">7</xref>]. RNM’s have been implicated in genetic risk for both autism and schizophrenia through whole exome sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref009">9</xref>]. In these studies, rare variants are enriched in cases versus controls to a degree suggesting that they have large effects on autism risk relative to common polymorphisms. In OCD, targeted re-sequencing of the human gene for the postsynaptic synapse-associated protein 90 (SAP90)/postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95)-associated protein 3 (<italic>SAPAP3</italic>), motivated by an OCD-like phenotype in knockout mice lacking SAPAP3, found an overrepresentation of RNM’s in OCD and/or trichotillomania subjects implicating <italic>SAPAP3</italic> in the genetic risk for OCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>We have identified an OCD-like phenotype in mice lacking expression of SLIT and NTRK-Like Family, Member 5 (SLITRK5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref011">11</xref>]. SLITRK5 knockout mice display a pathologic over-grooming phenotype that is accompanied by disrupted corticostriatal circuit activity. Moreover, pathologic grooming behavior in SLITRK5 knockout mice is normalized by serotonin reuptake inhibitors; the most effective pharmacologic treatments for OCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>The SLITRK’s are a family of transmembrane proteins that have two extracellular leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains which facilitate protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref014">14</xref>]. In particular, postsynaptic SLITRK3 has been shown to facilitate inhibitory synaptogenesis through trans-synaptic interactions with presynaptic protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPδ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref015">15</xref>]. All of the SLITRK family members bind PTPδ, and a recently reported structural study of PTPδ and SLITRK1 supports the notion that other SLITRK isoforms may also play a role in synapse formation via interaction with PTPδ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref016">16</xref>]. Slitrk5 expression is enriched in striatal neurons suggesting that altered synaptogenesis due to loss of SLITRK5-PTPδ interactions may provide a mechanism for the selective corticostriatal phenotypes seen in the SLITRK5 knockout mouse: decreased striatal volume, decreased dendritic complexity of striatal neurons, reduced expression of glutamate receptor subunits on striatal neurons, and decreased post-synaptic responses of striatal neurons to stimulation by cortical inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Motivated by the phenotypic similarities between SLITRK5 knockout mice and human OCD, we hypothesized that, as with <italic>SAPAP3</italic>, RNM’s in the human SLITRK5 gene (<italic>SLITRK5)</italic> might contribute to the genetic risk for OCD. We re-sequenced the protein coding sequence of <italic>SLITRK5</italic> in human subjects with OCD and compared RNM’s (population prevalence &lt;1%) from that sample with mutations in the 1000 Genomes Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref017">17</xref>]. Although there were no statistical differences in the distribution or bioinformatically predicted functional effects of SLITRK5 mutations from OCD cases versus controls, direct functional testing determined that all of the <italic>SLITRK5</italic> mutations identified in OCD subjects reduced synaptogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> while none of the most comparable pseudo-matched control mutations from the 1000 Genomes Database we tested had significant effects. These results implicate <italic>SLITRK5</italic> in the population risk for OCD and highlight the role of synaptic function in corticostriatal circuitry in the pathophysiology of OCD.</p>

SLITRK5 expressing transfected cells were identified by immunolabeling with anti-HA antibodies. Synaptogenesis by hippocampal neurons onto SLITRK5 expressing HEK-293 cells was quantified by immunolabeling hippocampal axons using anti-Tau antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref018">18</xref>] and synapses using anti-Synapsin I antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref019">19</xref>]. Synaptogenesis was defined as the total intensity of synapsin I signal in regions positive for both surface HA (labeling transfected SLITRK5-expressing HEK-293 cells) and dephospho-Tau (labeling primary hippocampal axons).

<title>Re-sequencing <italic>SLITRK5</italic></title>
<p>We identified four rare non-synonymous mutations (RNM’s) in 377 OCD subjects (1,1%), non-significantly lower than the prevalence of similar mutations in 1092 unphenotyped controls from the 1000 Genomes Database where there were fifteen (1.4%), Chi-square 0.21, P = 0.65. Each of the OCD-associated mutations was seen in a single chromosome and seven of the control mutations were singletons. Of the remaining control mutations, eight were seen in a single population and one was seen in two of the four populations included in the 1092 subject 1000 Genomes sample (European, EUR; Americas, AMR; African, AFR; Asian, ASN). One of the rare mutations from the 1000 Genomes Database had a population-specific prevalence greater than 1% in the ASN sample (1.6%) and was excluded from further analyses to avoid possible downward biasing of the effects of control RNM’s.</p>
<p>The prevalence of chromosomes containing RNM’s was also non-significantly lower in OCD cases (0.5%; 4 singletons/754 chromosomes) than controls (1.3%; 28 total mutant chromosomes/2184 total chromosomes) for controls Chi-square 2.88, P = 0.09.

<title>Functional analysis of <italic>SLITRK5</italic> RNM’s</title>
<p>For functional testing, we cloned each mutation into an HA epitope tagged fusion protein on the ancestral human SLITRK5 open reading frame background in a mammalian expression vector. We analyzed all OCD mutations and a subset of pseudo-matched mutations from the 1000 Genomes database sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169994.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Pseudo-matched controls were selected as the mutation nearest to an OCD mutation. For the three amino acid substitution OCD RNM’s there were pseudo-controls in the same functional domain; for the amino acid deletion mutant we could not identify an appropriate pseudo-matched control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169994.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). All of the OCD mutations and pseudo-matched controls occur in residues that are absolutely conserved from mouse to human and occur in very highly conserved contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169994.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). For two of the three pseudo-matched pairs the chemical categories of both the ancestral and mutant amino acids were also matched, for the third pair, the OCD mutation (N99K) is an acidic polar amino to basic amino acid substitution and the pseudo control (Q118H) is an acidic to basic substitution. Average normalized CADD score for OCD mutations (21.27± 0.9) and pseudo-matched controls (20.33 ± 2.52) were statistically similar (P = 0.75; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0169994.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPδ) binding</title>
<p>PTPδ is a transmembrane domain protein that binds to members of the SLITRK family. Transsynaptic PTPδ-SLITRK3 interactions have been shown to facilitate formation of inhibitory synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref015">15</xref>]. We have recently shown that PTPδ competes with TrkB, the prototypic BDNF receptor, for binding to SLITRK5. In the absence of BDNF, SLITRK5 forms transsynaptic bonds with PTPδ whereas in the presence of BDNF SLITRK5 interacts in cis with TrkB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref026">26</xref>]. We therefore tested if the remaining mutations, which occur in LRR domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, alter synaptogenesis by impairing SLITRK5-PTPδ interactions. We incubated soluble fusion protein comprised of the PTPδ ectodomain and the human immunoglobulin Fc fragment with HEK-293 cells transfected with surface expressed mutant HA-SLITRK5 alleles and immunolabeled the fusion proteins through their Fc- and HA- epitope tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169994.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref015">15</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have re-sequenced <italic>SLITRK5</italic> to identify RNM’s in OCD patients. When comparing the prevalence of OCD RNM’s with controls from the 1000 Genomes Project, there were no significant differences either in the number of distinct RNM’s or their prevalence. Bioinformatic analysis did not predict that RNM’s from OCD cases were more deleterious than those from controls. Direct testing of the synaptogenic activity of recombinant SLITRK5 and mutant alleles found that all of the RNM’s from OCD subjects impaired synaptogenesis whereas none of the control RNM’s did. These results demonstrate that functionally deleterious mutations in <italic>SLITRK5</italic> are significantly associated with OCD. Our use of controls from the 1000 Genomes Database can be critiqued because participants are not true controls as they are not screened to rule out OCD or other disorders however such a large dataset provides more information on rare mutations than would be possible with screened controls. Moreover, any biasing effects of individuals with OCD in the 1000 Genomes Database sample would tend to include potential OCD-associated functional mutations in our control sample and none of the 1000 Genome RNM’s affected synaptogenesis. Similarly, our functional testing of only a subset of 1000 Genomes RNM’s leaves open the possibility that RNM’s not tested may alter synaptogenesis however our focus on the most similar, closest matched pseudo-control RNM’s was intended to test the RNM’s most likely to affect Slitrk5 function in similar ways to the OCD RNM’s and can therefore be considered conservative. Finally, the ethnic composition of our OCD cases is not identical to the populations represented in the 1000 Genomes Database and differences in the prevalence of rare mutations across populations has been identified as a source of artifactual associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref027">27</xref>]. The issue is minimized in this study because the basis of our association is not based on a relative over-abundance of RNM’s in cases versus controls rather on the fact that those RNM’s present in OCD subjects biologically affect synaptogenesis and those in controls do not.</p>
<p>These studies emphasize the importance of integrating biological approaches into human behavioral genetic studies. In the case of common polymorphisms, biological characterization of human variants using <italic>in vivo</italic> model systems can enhance the reliability of genetic association studies of behavioral domains and facilitate exploratory hypothesis generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref030">30</xref>]. In this report we have demonstrated that direct biological characterization of RNM’s can be essential in dissociating pathology-related from control variation in instances when the case-control distribution and <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of functional effects of RNM’s do not identify statistical associations. Moreover, association based on impaired biological function reduces the risk of common confounding factors such as ethnic stratification that can be a particular problem in association analyses of rare population-specific mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref027">27</xref>] because causality is inferred based on the effects of pathology-associated mutations as opposed to their simple existence.</p>
<p>Impaired synaptic function in corticostriatal circuitry is an emerging theme in the genetics of OCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref032">32</xref>]. Impaired synaptogenesis, either through decreased surface expression or PTPδ binding, is a shared cellular phenotype of the OCD RNM’s we identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169994.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The SAPAP3 knockout mouse was the first model of serotonin reuptake inhibitor-sensitive OCD-like overgrooming phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref033">33</xref>]. SAPAP3, like SLITRK5, is highly enriched at excitatory post-synaptic densities in striatal neurons where it acts as a scaffolding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref033">33</xref>]. Also similar to SLITRK5 knockout mice, SAPAP3 knockouts have reduced post-synaptic responses to stimulation of cortical input through altered expression of glutamate receptor subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref035">35</xref>]. Extending the genetic evidence for a role of altered corticostriatal synapse function in OCD, a polymorphism upstream of the human PTPδ gene (<italic>PTPRD</italic>) was the most significantly associated polymorphism in a recent large-scale GWAS of OCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169994.ref005">5</xref>] suggesting that common genetic effects on PTPδ-SLITRK5 interactions could contribute to risk for OCD in addition to the effects of the rare <italic>SLITRK5</italic> mutations we have identified here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169994.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>
