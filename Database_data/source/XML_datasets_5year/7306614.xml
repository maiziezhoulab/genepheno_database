<p id="para0014">All procedures were approved by Mackenzie Presbyterian University Ethical Committee (CEUA, 126/05/2015 and 150/12/2016). Newly born Wistar male rats were maintained under controlled conditions (07:00–19:00 h, light/dark cycle; 22–24 °C) with their mothers. Pups’ ages were determined from the day of birth (P0). Animals from 8 litters per group were randomly assigned to sociability test (CTR: 16 animals and EXP: 17 animals) and for cognitive function tasks (CTR: 8 animals and EXP: 9 animals). The brain tissue from those assigned to sociability were used for molecular procedures related to oxytocin (OT) and oxytocin receptor and those assigned to cognitive task were used for molecular procedures related to reward system and synapse function.</p>

<title>Social recognition test</title>
<p id="para0016">The social recognition test was adapted from Guan e Dluzen, 1994. Initially, the animals were habituated for 3 consecutive days lasting 10 min to the apparatus (circular arena, 60 cm diameter x 50 cm height, Insight Ltda., Brazil) concomitantly with an acrylic box (23.5 cm x 21 cm x 32 cm) which walls had holes of 1 cm of diameter an each 0.5 cm. After that, an unfamiliar conspecific with 30 days of age (social stimulus) was introduced into the acrylic box for 3 min. The procedure was repeated 3 times (trial 1 to trial 3) at intervals of 6 min. In the subsequent sessions (trials 4 and 5), a novel social stimulus of the same age as the previous one was used. It was measured the time of exploration toward a social stimulus. At intervals, the animal test was removed from the arena and the apparatus was cleaned with 5% ethanol.</p>

<title>Barnes maze test</title>
<p id="para0017">The apparatus, elevated 100 cm above the floor, was a circular platform (100 cm in diameter) with 18 circular holes (9.0 cm in diameter) evenly spaced around the periphery. The apparatus was divided in 6 zones: 0–60°, 60–120°, 120–180°, 180–240° and 240–360° and the escape cage was located at the 0–60° during the training phase and removed during the test phase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0002">Fig. 2</xref>A. Visual cues of different geometric shapes were placed around the maze to assist in spatial orientation. The procedure was divided into four phases: habituation (1day), training (12 days) and test (1day). At the end of each trial, the arena was cleaned with 5% ethanol and rotated clockwise to prevent other cues from the environment, in addition to geometric shapes, serving as spatial orientation. In the habituation phase, the animal was placed in the center of the maze under a dark box for 30 s and subsequently, the box was removed, and the animal could explore the arena for 3 min. If the animal finds the escape cage the timer was interrupted, and the animal remained in the cage for 1 min. If the animal did not find it within 3 min, the animal was gently guided to the cage and remained there for 1 min. In the training phase, the procedure was similar to the previous one, and the animals had up to 2 min to complete the task. In the test phase, performed 24 h after training session, the escape cage was removed, and it was measured the time to locate the escape hole and the time spent in all zones of the apparatus.</p>

<title>Octagonal maze test</title>
<p id="para0018">Testing was carried out in an eight-arm radial maze (Insight LTDA, Brazil) and started 2 days after the habituation period. The habituation occurred for 2 consecutive days. In the first day, animals food deprived, in pairs, explored the maze for 10 min or until the food pellets spread out in the apparatus have been collect. Next day, animals, one at a time, under food restriction were subjected of the same procedure. Visual cues of different geometric shapes were placed around the maze to assist in spatial orientation. The protocol allowed the dissociation between working and reference memories and was divided in training and test phases. In the training phase, all arms were opened, but only four arms were baited with a pellet of cereal covered with dark chocolate. The training phase lasts 10 min or until the animals have collected the food. The test phase was carried out 30 min after training. The following parameters were analyzed: number of entries into baited arms (hits), number of entries into no baited arms (error), number of re-entries into baited arms (error), total number of errors and the time to finalize the task. Entries into no baited arms were considered reference memory errors and re-entered into baited arms was considered working memory errors.</p>

<title>Oxytocin receptor (OTR) quantification</title>
<p id="para0021">OTR quantification in hippocampus and amygdala was assayed using a competitive enzyme immunoassay kit (ELISA) from Elabscience (E-EL-R1446). The procedures were performed following the protocol provided by the kit. Briefly, the brain tissue, free of blood, was sonicated with an ultrasonic cell disrupter till, homogenized in lysis buffer (w:<italic>v</italic> = 1: 5), centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 x g and the supernatant assayed immediately. Samples, standards and blank (100 μL) were loaded in duplicate into each well. The plate was sealed and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the liquid was removed and then 100 μl of Biotinylated OTR´s Detector Antibody was added. The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the wells were washed three times, the Avidin-HRP Conjugate (100 μl) was added into each well and the plate was kept for 30 min at 37 °C. After that, the wells were washed 5 times, the TMB substrate (90 μl) was added and the plate was kept at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of stop solution. Immediately, the plate was reading on the spectrometer at 450 nm. The concentration of OTR was determined from the standard curve, multiplied by the dilution factor and normalized by total protein concentration.</p>

<title>RNA extraction/CDNA synthesis</title>
<p id="para0022">Frozen tissues were directly homogenized in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) at a ratio of 1 ml Trizol/100 mg tissue. Briefly, total tissue RNA was extracted using the RNeasy<sup>Ⓡ</sup> Lipid tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo) d 0.5–1.0 μg total RNA was used to produce cDNA using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche).</p>

<title>Real-Time PCR</title>
<p id="para0023">Gene expression analysis of OT, OTR and the house-keeping gene (Gapdh) was performed using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (assay ID: OT, Rn00564446_g1; OTr, Rn00563503_m1; Gapdh, Rn01775763_g1) following standard procedure: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. All reactions were performed in triplicate and the average was used.</p>
<p id="para0024">The mRNA expression of D1R, D2R, NT3, Synapsin I and house-keeping gene (B-actin) were measured (Step-one Applied Biosystem) using PerfeCTa SYBR Green Fastmix Rox (Quantas). The melting curve protocol was performed to verify the specificity of the amplicon generation. Standard curves consisted of 4–5 points of serially diluted mixed experimental and control group cDNA. The primers used for of D1R (Forward:5´-CGGGCTGCAGCGGAGAG-3´, Reverse:5´- TGCCCAGGAGAGTGGACAGG-3´), D2R (Forward: 5´-AGACGATGAGCCGCAGAAAGNT3-3, Reverse: 5´-GCAGCCAGCAGATGATGAAC-3´), Synapsin I (Forward: 5´-TTGTGGGTAGACACGTGCTC-3´, Reverse:5´-TTCCACGATGAGCTGCTTGT-3´, NT3 (Forward:5´-GGGGATTCCACGGACCAAAT-3´, Reverse: 5´-GAGTCGAAGTAGTAGGGCGC-3´) and B-actin (Forward:5´-TTGCTGACAGGATGCAGA-3´, Reverse:5´-ACCAATCCACACAGAGTACTT-3´) were obtained from Exxtend Biotecnologia, Brazil. PCR amplifications followed standard conditions: 5 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. The coefficient of correlation was greater than 0.99 for all curves, and the amplification efficiency ranged between 80% and 100%. All reactions were performed in duplicate and the average of the duplicate was used. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0014">[14]</xref>.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="para0025">The sociability test and Barnes Maze tasks was analyzed by Mixed ANOVA using sessions as within-subjects factor and groups (EXP versus CTR) as between-subjects factor. Significant effects were probed with post-hoc testing (Bonferroni). Octagonal Maze´s parameters were analyzed by Mann-Whitney for independent sample. Data from q-PCR and Elisa were compared using <italic>t</italic>-test for independent sample. <italic>p</italic> values of 0.05 or less were considered as significant.</p>
