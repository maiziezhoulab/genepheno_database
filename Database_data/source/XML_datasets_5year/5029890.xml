<abstract>
<p><italic>Jmjd1C</italic> is one of the <italic>Jmjd1</italic> family genes that encode putative demethylases against histone H3K9 and non-histone proteins and has been proven to play an indispensable role in mouse spermatogenesis. Here, we analyzed a newly-bred transgenic mouse strain carrying a <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> loss-of-function allele in which a β-geo cassette was integrated into the intron of the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> locus. <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> gene-trap homozygous testes exhibited malformations in postmeiotic processes and a deficiency in the long-term maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Some groups of spermatids in the homozygous testis showed abnormal organization and incomplete elongation from the first wave of spermatogenesis onwards. Moreover, histone H4K16 acetylation, which is required for the onset of chromatin remodeling, appeared to be remarkably decreased. These effects may not have been a result of the drastic decrease in gene expression related to the events but instead may have been due to the lack of interaction between JMJD1C and its partner proteins, such as MDC1 and HSP90. Additionally, significant decreases in <italic>Oct4</italic> expression and NANOG- and OCT4-expressing spermatogonia were found in the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> homozygous mature testis, suggesting that JMJD1C may participate in the maintenance of spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal by up-regulating <italic>Oct4</italic> expression. These results indicate that JMJD1C has multiple functions during spermatogenesis through interactions with different partners during the spermatogenic stages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Germ cells in mammals are the only cell lineage to transmit species-specific genetic and epigenetic information from one generation to the next. Therefore, the lineage leading to gamete production provides a simple but excellent model system to understand the molecular basis underlying every developmental event. Spermatogenesis features three major processes (maintenance of self-renewing stem cells, cyclic and well-organized differentiation through meiosis and maturation accompanying global chromatin remodeling). These processes are held under strict control via the systematic regulation of gene expression, epigenetic modification and genome DNA integrity. Among these processes, the methyltransferases and demethylases responsible for maintaining the dynamic balance associated with the methylation of lysine (K) residues of core histones have been demonstrated to play a central role in the epigenetic modification of transcription and chromatin structures during spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref002">2</xref>]. For instance, <italic>G9a</italic>, which encodes the H3K9 methyltransferase, and <italic>Jmjd1A</italic>, which encodes the H3K9 demethylase, play essential roles in the regulation of the balanced control of spermatogenesis-specific gene expression by methylated H3K9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref004">4</xref>]. However, recent studies have revealed that many histone methylation and demethylation enzymes are not only specific for the K residues of core histones but also act on the K residues of non-histone proteins. Indeed, a methylated K residue is found in more than 400 non-histone proteins located both inside and outside of the nucleus; these proteins are involved in diverse biological events and diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref005">5</xref>]. Moreover, the finding that <italic>G9a</italic> plays roles in the methylation of a histone acetyltransferase (HDAC1) and DNA methyltransferase (DMNT1) indicates that methyl modification consists of a comprehensive network that cooperates with other epigenetic regulation mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on our microarray analysis that compared the expression levels of <italic>JmjC</italic> domain family genes between ES cells, the inner cell mass of blastocysts, epiblasts, and primordial germ cells (PGCs) from E8.5 embryos, we focused on the <italic>Jmjd1</italic> family <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> gene (also known as Kdm3C and Trip8) because its expression level was much higher in ES cells and PGCs than cells of other stages (data not shown). Then, the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> ortholog <italic>Jmjd1A</italic> (<italic>Kdm3A</italic>), which encodes a demethylase to remove mono/di-methyl modifications from histone H3K9, was revealed for the first time to play an essential role in spermatogenesis. A detailed analysis of the spermatogenic deficiency in <italic>Jmjd1A</italic> gene-trap mice demonstrated that JMJD1A participated in the transcriptional control of <italic>Transition protein 1</italic> (<italic>Tnp1)</italic> and <italic>Protamine 1</italic> (<italic>Prm1)</italic> through H3K9 demethylation of the upstream promoter regions, leading to postmeiotic chromatin condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref006">6</xref>]. However, JMJD1A is known to have other functions in metabolic syndrome and sex determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref008">8</xref>]. During the progress of our work, a precedent study on <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>-deficient mice was reported that showed the male infertility phenotype of <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> null-knockout mice due to the progressive reduction of germ cells after 3 months of age, indicating that JMJD1C contributed to the long-term maintenance of male germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref009">9</xref>]. A similar phenotype involving the progressive loss of proliferating spermatogonia was reported in <italic>Promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger</italic> (<italic>Plzf</italic>, also known as <italic>Zfp145</italic> and <italic>Zbtb16</italic>)-knockout mice; the expression of this gene is restricted to undifferentiated spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref010">10</xref>]. The germ cell degeneration due to the <italic>Plzf</italic> defect starts at 2 weeks of age, which is apparently much earlier than the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> defect; thus, it is unlikely that the progress of germ cells found in the mature testis of <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>-deficient mouse is due only to the loss of <italic>Plzf</italic> expression. Furthermore, recent studies reported the contradictory finding that JMJD1C had no enzymatic histone H3K9 demethylation activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref011">11</xref>], which raised a possibility that <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> might play a non-enzymatic role, such as a serving as a scaffold for the construction of a regulatory apparatus, rather than contributing its enzymatic activity alone. In this study, we investigated the spermatogenic deficiency observed in <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> gene-trap mutant mice and revealed that <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> had multiple functions in chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis and the maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells that were accompanied by multiple partner proteins.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> mice and genotyping</title>
<p>Germline transmission (heterozygous) mice generated from a <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> gene-trap ES cell clone (TG Resource Bank, clone #8131) were purchased from TransGenic Inc. (Fukuoka, Japan). The heterozygous mice (<italic>Jmjd1</italic><sup><italic>+/gt</italic></sup>) were backcrossed with 129/svj and Jcl:ICR mice. Homozygous (<italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup>) mice were then generated by intercrossing <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>+/gt</italic></sup> mice and identified by PCR based genotyping using the allele-specific primer pairs listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163466.s007">S1 Table</xref>. 10, 94, 24, 8 and 38 mice were used for flow-cytometry, histochemical, immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, experiments and RNA/DNA analyses, respectively, and total approximately 300 mice including ones for the maintenance of the strain were used for this study. Animal experiments was fully approved by the Keio University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval number: 12023–2) and all animal care and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines on Animal Experimentation at Keio University.</p>

<title>Testicular cell preparation and separation by flow cytometry</title>
<p>After treatment with collagenase type IV (Sigma), the testicular tubules were dissociated with a 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma). The resulting single cell suspensions were used for cell fractionation, nuclear isolation and cell sorting. Subcellular fractionation was performed with the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Tissues (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For flow-cytometry, the cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and then analyzed with the FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>RNA preparation and QRT-PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was prepared from mouse tissues with the Qiagen RNeasy kit or the Sepasol-RNAI SuperG kit (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) and reverse transcribed using an oligo-dT primer and a Superscript III first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions. The real time (RT)-PCR was performed with Ex-Taq (Takara), and the quantitative real-time (QRT) PCR was analyzed using the SYBR Premix EX TaqII kit (Takara) and ViiA7 (Applied Biosystems). The QRT-PCR reactions were normalized against the β-actin transcript levels. The primer pairs used for the cDNA analysis are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163466.s007">S1 Table</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Immunohistochemical staining, X-gal staining and immunoblotting analysis</title>
<p>For immunohistochemistry, the testes and other tissues were fixed with either Bouin’s fixative or 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) phosphate buffer solution and embedded in paraffin. After de-paraffinization, 5 μm-thick sections were stained with Hematoxylin or treated with Target Retrieval Solution (Dako, S1699) for unmasking, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) /0.1% Triton X-100, and then reacted with primary and secondary antibodies as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref012">12</xref>]. Fluorescent immunohistochemical images were obtained with an Olympus IX71 and the MetaMorph software. For X-gal staining, the tissues were fixed with 0.2% glutalaldehyde/2% formalin buffer and then colorized according to the X-gal staining protocol. For the immunoblotting analysis, testicular cell extracts (15 μg per lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE. The blotted membranes (Immobilon-XP) were immunoreacted with primary antibodies and visualized with the ECL Prime Western blotting Detection kit (GE Healthcare) containing secondary antibodies, HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-labeled anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG, and the Quant LAS4000-mini (GE Healthcare) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruction. The antibodies used for immunofluorescence and immunoblotting detection are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163466.s008">S2 Table</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Immunoprecipitation (IP) with an antibody against MDC1 was performed using the Protein G HP SpinTrap (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Testicular cell lysates were prepared with RIPA lysis buffer (10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml). Then, 200 μl of each lysate was reacted with Protein G Sepharose beads pretreated with 2 μg of anti-MDC1 or normal rabbit IgG. IP proteins were extracted from the precipitated beads by the addition of 50 μl of 2x SDS sample buffer. A total of 8 μl of each IP sample and 2 μl of lysate for input per lane were applied for the SDS-PAGE.</p>

<title>Spermatogenic deficiency observed in <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> gene-trap mice</title>
<p>Two major <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> transcript variants have been demonstrated to be driven by alternative promoters. The long-form transcript encodes a 2530 amino acid protein that is 180 amino acids longer than the short-form protein (2350 amino acids) at the N-terminal end. The <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>-deficient mouse line (<italic>Jmjd1C</italic>
<sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup>) used in this study was generated from a gene-trap ES cell clone carrying a mutation allele in which a SA(splicing acceptor)-β-geo cassette was inserted into the third intron of the long-form and the second intron of the short-form protein; the cassette was integrated approximately 1.0 kb upstream of the next exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Theoretically, the β-geo insertion interrupts <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> transcription of both variants and the β-galactosidase translation products precisely reflect the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> transcription activity in vivo, which provides us with a convenient and powerful tool to evaluate the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> expression patterns in embryos and whole adult tissues. X-gal staining of <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>
<sup><italic>+/gt</italic></sup> mice showed cell types with various <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> expression patterns. In mid-gestation embryos (E8.5 onward) undergoing organogenesis, major expression was detected in the neural fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</xref>). The strong expression in neural cells continued throughout embryogenesis and extended to the brain, spinal cord and sympathetic ganglions during adulthood.

<p>Examination of the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> expression kinetics during the first wave of spermatogenesis showed that <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> short form expression was highest at birth and then gradually decreased with development, whereas expression of the long form reached its peak around the onset of meiosis, corresponding with the expression of <italic>Scp3</italic> and <italic>Vasa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

The quantitative real time (QRT)-PCR analysis indicated that the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>+/gt</italic></sup> and <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testes expressed <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> transcripts at levels that were nearly 60% and 20% of the levels in the wild-type testis, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163466.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).

<sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testis by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163466.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Therefore, we think it is feasible that a small amount of wild-type transcript is produced when a <italic>β-geo</italic> cassette is integrated within the intron region of a target gene, possibly by alternative splicing of the read-through precursor transcript containing the inserted β-geo cassette. A similar phenomenon was reported in <italic>Jmjd1A</italic>-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref006">6</xref>] in which even an incomplete knockout led to the same phenotype as the null-type knockout. Therefore, <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> is likely to have a quantitative threshold for completing its function that is probably at least 20% greater than the wild-type level. In contrast, the QRT-PCR analysis did not reveal drastic changes in the expression levels of selected spermatogenesis marker genes, such as <italic>Scp3</italic>, <italic>Vasa</italic>, and <italic>Prm1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g006">Fig 6</xref>).

<title>Chromatin remodeling abnormality during spermiogenesis</title>
<p>Regarding the enzymatic activity of JMJD1C itself, several reports have provided negative evidence against demethylase activity for histone H3K9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref011">11</xref>]. Instead, demethylase activity for non-histone protein(s) has been recently reported. MDC1 (Mediator of DNA damage check-point protein 1), which is a core factor of the DNA damage response (DDR) complex, was first identified as a non-histone target protein of demethylation by JMJD1C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref014">14</xref>]. The well-defined study demonstrated that JMJD1C-dependent demethylation at MDC1 K45 was not required for its function in the DDR. Mice lacking <italic>Mdc1</italic> were demonstrated to undergo meiotic arrest at the mid-pachytene stage, leading to male sterility. Additionally, MDC1 plays an indispensable role in the formation and function of the XY body, which is a meiosis-specific structure formed around the paired X/Y chromosomes in a spermatocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref015">15</xref>]. Staining of sections with antibodies against MDC1 and JMJD1C showed the co-localization of both proteins in the XY body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g008">Fig 8</xref>), corresponding to their functional cooperation during the meiotic processes. However, the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>
<sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testis did not show the meiotic arrest found during MDC1 deficiency and did not exhibit abnormalities in MDC1 localization and XY body formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163466.s004">S4A Fig</xref>), suggesting that JMJD1C was not essential for MDC1-mediated XY body formation. JMJD1C has not been demonstrated to promote an interaction between MDC1 and another core factor, Ring finger protein 8 (RNF8); these three factors bind to one another to form a core DDR complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref014">14</xref>]. Interestingly, mice lacking <italic>Rnf8</italic> (encoding an ubiquitin ligase) also exhibited spermatogenic deficiency, which caused an imperfection at the postmeiotic stage similar to the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> phenotype described above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref016">16</xref>]. The Rnf8 defect was revealed to appear during the histone-protamine transition process via histone H4K16 acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref016">16</xref>].

<p>Approximately 15 μg protein extracts from +/+ and gt/gt testes (postnatal day 56 littermates) were applied on SDS-PAGE (10–20% gradient gel) and blotted onto membranes. A) The membranes were reacted with a mixture of three antibodies against HSC70t, histone H3 (H3) and acetylated H4K16 (H4K16Ac) (left) or four antibodies against VASA, MOF, histone H3 and acetylated H4K16 (right) and then detected with HRP-conjugated anti-IgG and an ECL detection reagent. Specific reactant of each antibody used in this mixed immunoblotting is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163466.s005">S5 Fig</xref>. B) Comparison of the detected protein bands between the +/+ and gt/gt extracts. C) Semi-quantitative comparison of the acetylated H4K16 bands between the +/+ and gt/gt testes extracts.

<title>Deficiency in the maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs)</title>
<p>Previous reports demonstrated that <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> deficiency caused an abnormality in the long-term maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) leading to the degeneration of testicular tubules after 3 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref009">9</xref>]. Almost the same testis degradation time course was observed in the testis from our <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>
<sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The developmental kinetics of <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> expression showed that the short-form variant of <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> was predominantly expressed in spermatogonia containing SSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The JMJD1C function related to stem cell potential has been well investigated in pluripotent ES cells. For instance, OCT4 (POU5F1) and primarily the short form of JMJD1C bind to one another’s promoter regions to activate transcription in a positive feedback-like loop, and <italic>Nanog</italic> expression promoted by an OCT4 and JMJD1C compound plays a critical role in the maintenance of pluripotent stem cell-ness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>In this connection, an interesting finding was the existence of a rare subpopulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia expressing both NANOG and OCT4 that possibly corresponded to radiation-resistant SSCs in a certain quiescent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref026">26</xref>]. By immunohistochemical staining with anti-OCT4 and anti-NANOG, we detected OCT4-positive cells in spermatogonia residing in the outermost layer of the seminiferous tubule and extremely low numbers of NANOG-positive cells attached to the basement membrane of the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>+/gt</italic></sup> testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g013">Fig 13A and 13B</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>-positive cells recognized by X-gal staining of the <italic>Jmjd1C +/gt</italic> seminiferous tubules were detected not only in the meiotic and postmeiotic cell layers but also in a specific portion of the spermatogonial cell layers as scattered cells on the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g013">Fig 13C</xref>). Additionally, extremely low numbers of strongly <italic>Oct4-GFP</italic>-positive cells were detected in a similar location in the <italic>Oct4-GFP/Vasa-RFP</italic> transgenic mouse testis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163466.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). In contrast, OCT4-positive cells were dramatically decreased, and NANOG-positive cells were barely detectable in the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>
<sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g013">Fig 13A and 13B</xref>). The reduction of OCT4 expression in the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>

<p>Several candidate genes important for the maintenance of SSC potential, such as <italic>Bcl6b</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic>, <italic>Etv5</italic> and <italic>Tex19</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, have been nominated based on findings that mouse SSCs can be cultured in a chemically defined medium containing GDNF (which is required for SSC self-renewal) and that withdrawal of GDNF from the medium and long-term culture in vitro leads to a loss of SSC potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref028">28</xref>].

<title>Multi-faceted functions of <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> during spermatogenesis</title>
<p><italic>Jmjd1C</italic> is a member of the lysine demethylase (Kdm) 3 family, which consists of three members (<italic>Jmjd1A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>). Among them, <italic>Jmjd1A</italic> is the first gene shown to play an essential role in the epigenetic regulation of spermatogenic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref006">6</xref>]. The following studies have also revealed its multiple roles in metabolic homeostasis and sex determination through H3K9 demethylase activity and/or non-enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref029">29</xref>], raising the possibility that the KDM3 family has a common function not only as an epigenetic regulator of transcription but also as a fine modulator of the post-translational modification of non-histone proteins. Indeed, <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> showed no demethylation activity towards dimethylated H3K9 when dimethyl-peptides were used as the substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref011">11</xref>], suggesting that the spermatogenic abnormalities found in the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testis were probably due to JMJD1C activities other than the demethylation of histone H3K9. Nevertheless, several findings showed a relationship between JMJD1C and H3K9 demethylation (i.e., the <italic>P450e17</italic> gene promoter in Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref030">30</xref>]). Similarly, the <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>miR302</italic> promoter regions in ES cells have been validated to be under the regulation of JMJD1C-dependent hypomethylation of H3K9 modification to retain their active states of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref032">32</xref>]. The pluripotency-associated microRNA <italic>miR302</italic> represses the neural differentiation of ES cells, whose transcription is enhanced by the OCT4 and JMJD1C compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref031">31</xref>]. Moreover, we found that JMJD1C was associated with a restricted portion of chromatin in pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Altogether, it seems likely that a cell-type specific cofactor(s) may be required to fulfill the JMJD1C demethylase activity towards methylated H3K9 in a locus-specific manner or that locus-specific association of enzymatically inactive JMJD1C is required to maintain the hypomethylated H3K9 state upon chromatin remodeling by blocking repressive methyl modification of the target loci. Here, a precedent study suggested that Jmj-C family proteins had a non-enzymatic function that was required for normal development (i.e., the H3K27 demethylases JMJD3 and UTX played a crucial role in general chromatin remodeling in differentiated cells that was entirely independent of their demethylase potential) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref033">33</xref>]. Therefore, we can generalize that Jmj-C family proteins also have a non-catalytic function through interactions between lineage-specific transcription factors and remodeling complex components to keep the promoter region active in the epigenetic microenvironment.</p>
<p>JMJD1C has been shown to have the ability to demethylate non-histone proteins. For instance, as a core component of the DNA damage response (DDR) complex, JMJD1C binds to and demethylates MDC1 at K45, thereby promoting the MDC1-RNF8/RNF168 interaction required for the recruitment of RAP80-BRAC1 to DNA double-strand break sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref014">14</xref>]. The function of the DDR complex in spermatogenesis was visualized as the co-localization of JMJD1C and MDC1 at the XY body found in the spermatocyte nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Additionally, MDC1 is critical for XY body formation and meiotic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref015">15</xref>]. However, <italic>Rnf8</italic> and <italic>Rnf168</italic>, which encode E3 ubiquitin ligases, and <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> are dispensable for these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref019">19</xref>]. <italic>Rnf8</italic> functions upstream of <italic>Rnf168</italic>. <italic>Rnf168</italic>-deficient mice exhibit a defect in global nucleosome removal in the postmeiotic stages, whereas RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitination promotes H4K16 acetylation, which is an indirect trigger for the replacement of histones by protamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref016">16</xref>]. A reduced H4K16 acetylation level was also found in the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g010">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g011">11</xref>), leading to the speculation that <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> defects were at least partially due to the insufficient interaction between DDR components and that the mutual interactions within the DDR machinery played an important role in general chromatin remodeling through modulating H4K16 acetylation.</p>
<p>Regarding other possible candidate non-histone protein targets of the JMJD1C demethylase, we found several proteins that appeared to be hypermethylated in the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testis compared with the testes of control littermates. Among them, a 90 kDa protein appeared to be identical to a hypermethylated 90 kDa protein that co-immunoprecipitated with MDC1 from the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testis lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Our findings that the cytoplasmic protein chaperone HSP90α, which is a highly methylated protein, was immunoprecipitated with anti-MDC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g009">Fig 9B</xref>) and that both proteins were co-expressed in germ cells at the same spermatogenic stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163466.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) strongly indicated that HSP90α was a possible target of the JMJD1C demethylase function. Moreover, previous studies showed that both HSP90α and JMJD1C co-immunoprecipitated with the histone methyltransferase WHISTLE, which raised a possibility that HSP90α had broad interacting activity with JmjC-family proteins, such as JMJD1A and KDM6A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref030">30</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that a protein-protein interaction between HSP90α and JMJD1C (belonging to the DDR complex) plays a crucial role in the modulation of mutual functions, probably by altering the methylation status.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, <italic>Hsp90α</italic>-deficient mice also exhibit male infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref034">34</xref>]. HSP90α is methylated by SMYD2 and is involved in the organization of cytoskeletal components, such as γ-tubulin and β-actin, leading to the disorganization and abnormal shaping of spermatids observed in the <italic>Hsp90α</italic>-deficient testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref035">35</xref>]. Moreover, a recent report revealed that the H3K9 demethylase activity of JMJD1A was dependent on the interaction with either HSP90α or HSP90β and that the <italic>Jmjd1A</italic> mutant showed cytoplasmic defects in cytoskeletal rearrangement during spermiogenesis in addition to the <italic>Jmjd1A</italic> defects that were reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref029">29</xref>]. Interestingly, because demethylation of the HSP90α K616 residue is not altered by the lack of <italic>Jmjd1A</italic>, another JmjC-containing protein may be responsible for the HSP90 demethylation. These results also support the possibility that HSP90α is a target of JMJD1C’s demethylase activity and raise a question as to whether the JMJD1C-dependent defect in the HSP90 machinery leads to the disorganized rearrangement and malformation of spermatids found in the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> young testes. Altogether, it is quite comprehensible that JMJD1C serves as a scaffold to recruit various partners and promote mutual interactions by modulating their methylation statuses at each spermatogenic stages.</p>

<title>Progressive loss of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs)</title>
<p><italic>Jmjd1C</italic> gene-trap mice in this study were backcrossed on to a 129/svj or Jcl/ICR background, whereas the complete null knockout mice in the previous study were analyzed on a C57BL/6 background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref009">9</xref>]. It has been reported that several lines of <italic>Jmjd1A</italic> knockout mice show a drastic change of phenotype on the different genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref036">36</xref>]. In contrast, although we can not deny a possibility that the difference between gene-trap and null-type knockout, and that of the genetic background causes a subtle phenotypic difference, the testis-restricted deficiency that asynchronous degradation of germ cell layers in the seminiferous tubules was common in both <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>-deficient mouse lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In the null knockout mice, the progressive loss of undifferentiated spermatogonia was detected based on PLZF expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref009">9</xref>]. <italic>Plzf</italic> encodes a repressive transcription factor that is a well-known marker gene expressed in both SSCs and proliferating spermatogonia in the adult testis. Lack of <italic>Plzf</italic> function causes a progressive loss of spermatogonia without any differentiation defects, although the timing of degeneration appeared to be much earlier than the timing observed for the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref010">10</xref>]. Continuous proliferation of SSCs in vitro [referred to as germline stem cells (GSCs)] is maintained in a defined culture medium containing GDNF, LIF, EGF and bFGF. Stem cell potential is evaluated as a frequency of regenerated spermatogenesis based on transplantation into recipient testicular tubules in vivo. GSCs tend to lose their stem cell potential after long-term culture or withdrawal of GDNF. From this perspective, several genes, such as <italic>Lhx1</italic>, <italic>Etv5</italic> and <italic>Bcl6b</italic>, have been identified to be important for stem cell potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref027">27</xref>]. However, we found that these genes showed no significant differences between the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testis and the littermate control testis; instead, the most remarkable difference in the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>
<sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testis was a reduction in <italic>Oct4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g014">Fig 14</xref>). GSCs express a set of iPS cell-inducing genes (<italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic>), although the levels are somewhat lower than the levels in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref037">37</xref>]. However, these cells do not express <italic>Nanog</italic>, which is in contrast to the ES and iPS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref028">28</xref>]. Importantly, a few GSCs spontaneously dedifferentiate into pluripotent stem cells (referred to as multipotent GSCs) during the initiation of GSC cultures from postnatal testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>A recent report that a small subpopulation of NANOG/OCT4-positive cells was found in the outermost cell layer attached to the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules in a specific spermatogenic stage was very intriguing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref026">26</xref>] because it suggested that the conversion of cellular characteristics leading to NANOG expression might occur in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> self-renewing SSCs. NANOG-positive SSCs in the adult testis were also detected in this study but were undetectable in the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> testis, probably due to the remarkable decrease of OCT4-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g013">Fig 13</xref>). JMJD1C has been reported to be essential for the maintenance of pluripotency via promoting the active expression of <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> during ES cell proliferation. Additionally, up-regulation of <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> is required for the generation of completely reprogrammed iPS cells that express endogenous <italic>Oct4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref032">32</xref>]. Provided that the self-renewal of SSCs is based on maintaining their potentially pluripotent state, it is reasonable to speculate that JMJ1C plays a critical role in maintaining the self-renewal and stem cell potential of SSCs via essentially the same function described for pluripotent cells.</p>
<p>Currently, JMJD1C is thought to play an extensive role related to various stem cell potentials. As described above, OCT4 is regarded as a functional partner of JMJD1C in pluripotent stem cells and probably also SSCs. Similarly, JMJD1C is assumed to participate in the maintenance of proliferative stem cells through association with lineage-specific transcription factors. Indeed, several reports have noted that JMJD1C is not required for the survival and self-renewal of leukemia stem cells. For instance, JMJD1C functions as a co-activator for Runx1-Runx1T1 in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref038">38</xref>] and for HoxA9 in mixed lineage leukemia-AF9 and HoxA9-driven leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref039">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that JMJD1C is recruited by partner transcription factors to their target genes and activates their expression by maintaining low H3K9 methylation levels, although whether JMJD1C acquires demethylase activity through association with a partner is not clear.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163466.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> expression was not restricted to the testis. Instead, testicular expression was at a relatively moderate level among adult tissues, and high level expression was primarily observed in the developing nervous system in embryos and neurons in the adult brain. Nevertheless, an apparent morphological or behavioral disorder was not found in the <italic>Jmjd1C</italic><sup><italic>gt/gt</italic></sup> adult mice, which might be due to a functional redundancy with other Jmj family genes. However, recent progress in the genetic analysis of human diseases noted possible causal relationships between <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> mutations and mental disorders as well as relationships with various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref040">40</xref>]. For instance, <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> is a candidate gene for autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref041">41</xref>] because the breakpoint of chromosomal abnormality in the patient is located in the first intron of <italic>Jmjd1C</italic>. Moreover, <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> mutations have been identified in a subpopulation of Rett syndrome patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163466.ref042">42</xref>], suggesting that <italic>Jmjd1C</italic> could be related to higher order brain functions, such as mental faculties.</p>
<p>Further detailed investigations to clarify the partners and targets of JMJD1C functions in each cell lineage will provide important clues to understanding the action mechanism of the JMJD1C-dependent regulatory network and to develop novel therapeutic targets for cancers and mental disorders.</p>

B) Immunoblotting detection of the JMJD1C protein in 1N, 2N and 4N cells, which were fractionated from the adult testis (6-month-old) by flow-cytometry using Hoechst dye vital staining. Approximately 15 μg of the protein extract of each fraction was analyzed. JMJD1C was detected in both the 1N (spermatid) and 4N (primarily spermatocyte) cell fractions but was barely detected in the 2N (spermatogonia and somatic cells) fraction. The detection of α-TUBULIN and spermatocyte-specific SCP3 with antibodies was used as the standard control.</p>
