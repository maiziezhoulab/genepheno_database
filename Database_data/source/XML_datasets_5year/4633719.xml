<abstract>
<p>Vascular lumen formation is a fundamental step during angiogenesis; yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that neural and vascular systems share common anatomical, functional and molecular similarities. Here we show that the organization of endothelial lumen is controlled at the post-transcriptional level by the alternative splicing (AS) regulator Nova2, which was previously considered to be neural cell-specific. Nova2 is expressed during angiogenesis and its depletion disrupts vascular lumen formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, Nova2 depletion in cultured endothelial cells (ECs) impairs the apical distribution and the downstream signalling of the Par polarity complex, resulting in altered EC polarity, a process required for vascular lumen formation. These defects are linked to AS changes of Nova2 target exons affecting the Par complex and its regulators. Collectively, our results reveal that Nova2 functions as an AS regulator in angiogenesis and is a novel member of the ‘angioneurins' family.</p>

<body>
<p>In adulthood most blood vessels remain quiescent; however, in conditions of active physiological tissue growth, such as during embryogenesis or tissue repair, endothelial cells (ECs) migrate and proliferate to form new vessels. This process, known as angiogenesis, is also critical for the pathogenesis of several disorders and to support cancer development and progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Although angiogenesis does not initiate malignancy, it promotes tumour growth by allowing oxygen and nutrients to reach proliferating cancer cells. Targeting angiogenesis represents a particularly promising anticancer therapeutic approach, and several strategies have been attempted so far<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent studies have highlighted significant anatomic, structural and molecular similarities between the vascular and the nervous systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Both systems possess specialized structures—tip cells at the forefront of endothelial sprouts and axonal growth cones—that, through filopodial extensions, probe the environment for guidance cues. Molecules regulating these processes have been termed ‘angioneurins'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The prototypic angioneurin is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which was originally discovered as a key angiogenic factor, but subsequently shown to be important also in the development of the nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Since blood vessels and nerves are functionally interdependent, the malfunctioning of this ‘neurovascular link' can lead to several vascular and neuronal disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p>
<p>Until now, the many molecular pathways regulating vascular development and angiogenesis have been suggested to act primarily through the regulation of transcription. However, recent studies indicate that post-transcriptional and epigenetic programmes cooperate to confer tissue-specific vascular properties.</p>
<p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a molecular process that generates multiple, distinct mature mRNAs from a primary transcript (pre-mRNA), leading to the production of protein isoforms with different structural and functional properties. Since more than 90% of human multiexonic genes undergo AS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, this process represents a major mechanism underlying the expansion of the proteome from a limited repertoire of genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. AS and transcription predominantly regulate different subsets of genes to generate the molecular and cellular complexity of different cell and tissue types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. AS thus provides a versatile, additional layer of regulation to both establish and maintain fundamental properties of different cell and tissue types. Despite the importance of AS, the functional roles of the vast majority of AS events is not well understood.</p>
<p>While there are several examples of splicing variants with a role in angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, the molecular mechanisms responsible for their production are still unknown. Here we describe a novel role for Nova2, previously described as neural cell-specific<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, as a key AS regulator of angiogenesis. Both its expression and the levels of AS of its target exons are regulated during this process. Through gain- and loss-of-function approaches in ECs, we show that Nova2 regulates AS of factors belonging to the Par polarity complex and its regulators. Consequently, vascular lumen formation defects are developed in zebrafish on <italic>nova2</italic> morpholino-mediated knockdown or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-induced genetic mutation. Collectively, our results provide evidence that Nova2 is a new member of the ‘angioneurins' family, and further highlight an important biological role for post-transcriptional regulation of exon networks that contribute to both vascular and neuronal functions.</p>

<title>Nova2 expression and function are regulated in ECs</title>
<p>To identify splicing regulatory factors (SRFs) involved in endothelial growth and quiescence, we studied ECs under sparse and confluent conditions. By mining previously published Affymetrix gene expression data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> comparing mouse ECs grown at different densities, we identified <italic>Nova2</italic> as an SRF that is significantly upregulated in confluent versus sparse ECs (fold change=2.3; <italic>P</italic> value&lt;0.05, Dunnett test). This result was surprising since Nova2 was considered previously to be neural cell-specific<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p>
<p>Nova2 and its paralogue Nova1 are among the best-studied mammalian tissue-specific SRFs. Both proteins bind RNA through KH domains that recognize clusters of YCAY repeats within the pre-mRNA targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. These factors, with indistinguishable biochemical properties but mutually exclusive expression within the central nervous system (CNS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, regulate AS programmes involved in neuronal development and synapse activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p>
<p>Validating the microarray results, we confirmed Nova2 upregulation in confluent versus sparse ECs using reverse transcription–quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). By comparing <italic>VE-cadherin</italic>-null ECs (VEC-null) with the same cells reconstituted with <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> (VEC-positive)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> we also found that <italic>Nova2</italic> upregulation in confluent versus sparse ECs does not require VE-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). On the contrary, we found that <italic>Nova1</italic> is expressed to a negligible level in ECs, while both factors are expressed in E15.5 mouse whole brain that we used as positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), consistent with recently published results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Moreover, expression of the Muscleblind family of tissue-specific AS regulators (<italic>Mbnl1</italic>, <italic>Mbnl2</italic> and <italic>Mbnl3</italic>) was not modified by confluence in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We further confirmed the upregulation of Nova2 in confluent ECs at the protein level by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Comparable results were obtained by using another EC line (adult ECs from the mouse lung) under sparse and confluent conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). Notably, as in the case of mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>), in ECs the anti-Nova2-specific antibody recognized two immunoreactive bands at 50–55 and 70–80 kDa, as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In agreement with available RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>), we found that <italic>Nova2</italic> is also expressed in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and that its levels decreased when HUVECs were grown as sparse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Nova2</italic> expression increased during endothelial differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Fig. 1d), or in adult ECs as compared with embryo or fetal ECs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1e</xref>). Importantly, Nova2 expression correlated with AS changes of its known target <italic>Ank3</italic>: (i) in sparse versus confluent ECs, (ii) during endothelial differentiation of ES cells and (iii) in ECs of different origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>) and AS of this target parallels that observed in brain of <italic>Nova2</italic>-null mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Taken together, these data suggest that Nova2 expression and function may play a role in vascular maturation.</p>
<p>To confirm the vascular expression of Nova2 in a more physiological context, we analysed the postnatal mouse retina, which develops a stereotypical vascular pattern following a well-defined sequence of events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In the retina, we found that Nova2-positive nuclei were reduced but still present in the ECs at the sprouting front as compared with the central part of the retina where the majority of ECs of the mature vessels (arteries and veins) and capillaries were Nova2-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, we found the specific nuclear expression of Nova2 in ECs present in the vessels of different tissues, such as normal human thyroid, skin, bladder, colon and prostate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data indicate that Nova2 is not exclusively expressed in cells of the nervous system, but it is also present in ECs of different types of vessels.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Nova2 regulates the endothelial apical–basal polarity</title>
<p>An important functional similarity in the development of the vascular and nervous systems is the establishment of the apical–basal polarity, as this is a crucial event for the organization of the vascular lumen and for axon guidance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> respectively. Notably, the partitioning-defective (Par) polarity complex is a key determinant of cell polarity in both systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The specific localization and activity of the Par polarity complex involve the association of four key components: Par3, Par6, the small GTPase Cdc42 and the atypical protein kinase C (PKCζ). In addition, the small GTPases Rac1 and Rap1 are important regulators of the Par complex during organization of the vascular lumen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of Nova2 in the endothelium as a possible regulator of vascular development, we generated stable <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that depletion of <italic>Nova2</italic> expression impairs EC polarity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, in two-dimensional (2D) cultures, <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown altered the subcellular localization of the apical surface marker podocalyxin (Podxl) that was distributed all over the cell membrane and also to the basal surface. These findings prompted us to examine whether silencing of <italic>Nova2</italic> alters the junctional staining and/or activity of components of the Par polarity complex. <italic>Nova2</italic>-depleted ECs displayed impaired junctional distribution of Par3, a multiscaffold protein that promotes the assembly of the Par complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown in ECs caused reduced levels of active (GTP-bound) Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), whose association with the Par complex is induced during EC lumen formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Accordingly, we determined that phosphorylation of PKCζ, a Cdc42-GTP-activated protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, is also reduced in <italic>Nova2</italic>-depleted ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown ECs were characterized by reduced levels of phosphorylated Pak4 (p21-activated kinase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), one of the main Cdc42 downstream effectors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>
<p>EC polarization correlates with lumen formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Thus, to test whether Nova2 is required for the formation of the endothelial lumen, we have carried out its knockdown in primary HUVECs that, when are cultured in three-dimensional (3D) collagen gel, rapidly organize into a network of hollow structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, control HUVEC cells forming vascular-like structures were correctly polarized with Podxl and collagen IV localized to the apical and basal surfaces, respectively. On the contrary, knockdown of <italic>Nova2</italic> resulted in the formation of capillary-like tubular networks with irregular lumen and a non-polarized distribution of endothelial Podxl and collagen IV. These results strongly suggest that Nova2 splicing factor is crucial for EC morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Recently, the Par polarity complex has been shown to regulate endothelial cell-cell contacts and affect migratory behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In agreement with these observations we found that silencing of <italic>Nova2</italic> affected junctional clustering of VEC and β-catenin since the architecture of cell–cell boundaries was partially disorganized in <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown ECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). Cell polarity is also established during directional cell migration, where cytoskeletal, adhesive and signalling molecules are distributed asymmetrically. We found that <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown affected the collective behaviour of migrating ECs. During wound closure, migrating ECs depleted of <italic>Nova2</italic> have in part lost their contacts with neighbouring cells positioned at the back (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). The leading edge was more tortuous compared with control ECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). Finally, given the junctional alterations induced by Nova2 knockdown, we tested whether endothelial permeability was also modified. We found that the permeability of confluent endothelial monolayers was indeed increased upon <italic>Nova2</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To comprehensively identify AS events regulated by Nova2 in the endothelium, we performed high-throughput RNAseq of two biological replicates of <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown and control ECs. We used <italic>vast-tools</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> to identify and quantify all major types of AS events. <italic>vast-tools</italic> maps RNAseq reads to comprehensive sets of annotated and novel splice junctions to derive confident estimates of the percentage of alternative sequence inclusion in a given sample. We identified 365 AS events affected by Nova2 depletion, including 188 (51.5%) cassette exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> for details). Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of AS events predicted to generate alternative protein isoforms (41% of all AS events and 64% of cassette exons; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) showed a significant enrichment for genes involved in cytoskeleton and cell adhesion (including tight and adherens junctions, and integrin binding), consistent with the phenotypes described above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In addition, the strongest enriched functional terms corresponded to chromatin remodelling and regulators, suggesting a multilayered impact of Nova2 regulation on endothelial formation. Finally, we also observed multiple GO terms related to neuronal differentiation and function (for example, neurogenesis, synapsis, axon part and calcium transport), similar to those reported for Nova-regulated genes in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Indeed, comparison of differentially included cassette exons in genes expressed in both neurons and ECs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>) revealed a highly significant overlap between alternative exons predicted to be regulated by Nova proteins in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and those showing changes in inclusion levels upon <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown in the endothelium (<italic>P</italic>=1.93<italic>e</italic><sup>−11</sup>, hypergeometric test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), despite the very different approaches used in the two studies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Materials</xref> for details).</p>
<p>These newly identified Nova2 targets expanded the list of previously known targets involved in apical–basal polarity, actin polymerization dynamics and cytoskeletal remodelling, important processes associated with cell polarity, cell shape, motility and adhesion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 4 and 5</xref>). Thus, to confirm a possible molecular link between these AS events and the phenotypes described above, we analysed AS changes in selected targets using RNA extracted from <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Reduced Nova2 expression in ECs resulted in altered AS of transcripts encoding <italic>Par3</italic>, and regulators of Par activity or localization, including <italic>Magi1</italic>, which recruits Rap1 at junctions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, <italic>Rap1GAP</italic> (Rap1 inhibitor)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, <italic>Pix-α</italic>, <italic>Dock6, Dock9</italic> and <italic>DBS</italic> (Cdc42 activators)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Importantly, these AS changes parallel to those observed in the brain of <italic>Nova2</italic>-null mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, or in two stages of brain development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8A</xref>) characterized by different Nova2 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We confirmed the Nova2-dependent AS of target transcripts in RNA samples extracted from <italic>Nova2</italic>-overexpressing ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8B</xref>). Notably, the direction of the observed AS changes is consistent with the position of Nova2-binding sites (YCAY; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that in cultured ECs Nova2 establishes EC polarity by controlling Par3 localization and by regulating the activity of Cdc42. To begin to address the functional relevance of the AS events regulated by Nova2 in ECs, we focused on the Cdc42 activator Pix-<italic>α</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Our results indicate that Nova2 promotes the production of a specific Pix-<italic>α</italic> AS isoform lacking exon 17 (Pix-<italic>α</italic>-Δ17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that Pix-<italic>α</italic>-Δ17 is more efficient than the Pix-<italic>α</italic> isoform containing exon 17 (Pix-<italic>α</italic>-FL) in rescuing the defect of Cdc42 activity caused by <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results provide evidence that Nova2 is required for EC polarity and that it acts by inducing AS of a set of key effectors of cell polarity.</p>

<title>Nova2 promotes vascular lumen formation <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Since EC polarity regulates vascular lumen formation, we tested whether vascular development was affected in the absence of Nova2. To this end, we investigated the role of Nova2 in the embryos and larvae of zebrafish, which constitutes a unique and powerful model to study vertebrate vascular development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Importantly, the Nova2 RNA-binding domain is 94% identical between zebrafish and human<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, and we found that a zebrafish <italic>Nova2</italic> orthologous gene (<italic>nova2</italic>) is expressed in the vasculature during development in addition to CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). To assess the role of <italic>nova2</italic> in zebrafish, we performed a morpholino-mediated knockdown of its expression. To specifically visualize the developing blood vessels, we injected morpholino oligos into transgenic embryos expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (<italic>EGFP</italic>) gene under the control of the endothelial-specific promoter <italic>fli1a</italic> (<italic>Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. We used a morpholino targeting the start codon of zebrafish <italic>nova2</italic> (MO-nova2) to block translation of both maternal and zygotic <italic>nova2</italic> mRNAs. While embryos injected with a control morpholino displayed a normal morphology, more than 90% of <italic>nova2</italic> morphant embryos showed defects at the level of the forming blood vessels. Moreover, during early embryogenesis the pattern of some intersomitic vessels (ISVs) displayed extra-branching formation and a delay in the connection with the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that <italic>nova2</italic> knockdown resulted in altered lumen size of both cephalic vessels and of main trunk blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). To visualize and further characterize the phenotype at the level of the dorsal aorta and posterior cardinal vein, we performed a morphological analysis using transversal paraffin sections stained with haematoxylin–eosin of embryos at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). The analysis showed that in most of <italic>nova2</italic> morphants the lumen of the dorsal aorta had a larger diameter if compared with controls, through all developmental stages analysed. The lumen of the posterior cardinal vein appeared irregular along the length of the trunk, with areas of enlargement but also few restrictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Furthermore, starting from 2 days of development, even ISVs display an enlarged lumen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9A</xref>). To better characterize the phenotype of <italic>nova2</italic> morphants at the level of ISVs during the angiogenic process, we performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> time lapse imaging assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1–3</xref> in <italic>nova2</italic> morphant embryos the apical cells of some ISVs develop many more filopodia and could barely reach the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel. Importantly, co-injection of <italic>nova2</italic> mutants with a morpholino-resistant zebrafish <italic>nova2</italic> mRNA rescued, in more than 60% of the injected embryos, the morphological phenotype of the vessels, confirming the specificity of the effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1–3</xref>). The abnormal phenotype of blood vessels observed in <italic>nova2</italic> morphants was not due to haemodynamic problems, since at 48  h post fertilization (hpf) the heart appeared normal for size, shape and beat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 4 and 5</xref>). In addition, EC proliferation and apoptosis were not significantly modified in the morphants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9B,C</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that <italic>in vivo</italic> nova2 is required for proper vascular morphogenesis and for the formation of a correct vascular lumen.</p>
<p>Since Par complex members and regulators identified as Nova2 targets have putative orthologues in zebrafish, we analysed their AS using RNA extracted from <italic>ctr</italic> and <italic>nova2</italic> morphants. Of the investigated pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), four (<italic>Rap1GAP</italic>, <italic>Pix-α</italic>, <italic>DBS</italic> and <italic>Dock6</italic>) are alternatively spliced in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Interestingly, in all cases nova2 knockdown alters exon inclusion levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>) in the direction predicted by the position of putative Nova-binding motifs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Importantly, aberrant AS events of <italic>nova2</italic> morphants were rescued by co-injection of <italic>nova2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Of note, we found that some nova2 targets (see, for instance, <italic>Rap1gap</italic> and <italic>Pix-α</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9C</xref>) are not expressed at the same level in the different types of vessels suggesting that the effects of the knockdown of <italic>nova2</italic> may have different morphological and functional consequences along the vascular tree.</p>
<p>To assess the apical–basal cell polarity in <italic>nova2</italic> morphant embryos, we analysed the localization of Podocalyxin (Podxl2). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, in <italic>ctr</italic> embryos Podxl2 is localized at the apical region of the ECs forming ISVs, while in <italic>nova2</italic> morphants Podxl2 is mislocalized in ECs of the ISVs. Moreover, this defect persisted at late developmental stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9A</xref>). Likewise, altered Podxl2 localization was also observed in dorsal aorta of <italic>nova2</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), suggesting an altered establishment of apical–basal polarity. Again, co-injection of <italic>nova2</italic> mRNA rescued Podxl2 localization in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>).</p>
<p>Since Nova2 is expressed in neurons as well as in ECs, and these cells influence their reciprocal differentiation and development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, it was important to address whether the vascular phenotype of <italic>nova2</italic> morphants was due to alterations in the nervous or vascular systems. To do this, we used a morpholino-resistant zebrafish <italic>nova2</italic> cDNA, fused with the red fluorescent protein mCherry, under the control of the vasculature-specific <italic>fli1a</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The vascular defects in <italic>nova2</italic> morphants were restored by the mosaic transient expression in the vascular endothelium of morpholino-resistant <italic>nova2</italic> cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b–d</xref>). Moreover, by generating a zebrafish transgenic line, which stably expresses morpholino-resistant <italic>nova2-mCherry</italic> in the vascular endothelium, we found that injection of MO-nova2 did not significantly alter blood vasculature morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>), indicating that the vascular phenotype of <italic>nova2</italic> morphants is cell autonomous.</p>
<p>To independently validate our findings, we used CRISPRs genome engineering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> to generate genetic <italic>nova2</italic> mutant fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11A</xref> and see Methods for details). The characterization of <italic>nova2</italic> mutants strongly supported our results and conclusions obtained using MO-mediated <italic>nova2</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). In particular, <italic>nova2</italic> homozygous mutants displayed overlapping defects with <italic>nova2</italic> morphants, such as shortening of the anteroposterior body axis, reduced head size, curved trunk and slight pericardial oedema (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11B</xref>). Moreover, we observed that <italic>nova2</italic> mutants do not develop the swim bladder and display a strong haemorrhagic phenotype visible both at the level of the head and trunk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11C,D</xref>). Notably, similar to Nova knockout mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, zebrafish <italic>nova2</italic> mutant embryos displayed paralysis. In particular, they have severe difficulty in swimming (probably because of motor–neuronal dysfunction) and died 7–10 days post fertilization, whereas there was no abnormal phenotype in <italic>nova2</italic> heterozygote mutant embryos. Confocal microscopic analyses performed on the <italic>nova2</italic> mutants transgenic for <italic>kdr:EGFP</italic> showed that many blood vessels had an enlarged lumen size, both in the head and in the trunk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11E</xref>), as observed in <italic>nova2</italic> morphant embryos. Similar findings were obtained by histological analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11F</xref>). Finally, <italic>nova2</italic> mutants displayed AS changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11G</xref>) that are comparable to those in <italic>nova2</italic> morphants.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results show that Nova2 controls the development of the vascular system <italic>in vivo</italic> by modulating endothelial polarity and lumen formation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report that AS regulation orchestrates some important aspects of EC biology. In particular, our data demonstrate that the AS factor Nova2, known to be neural cell-specific<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, is also expressed in the vascular endothelium and plays a relevant role in vascular morphogenesis.</p>
<p>In spite of its importance, our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying vascular tubulogenesis is only beginning to be unravelled<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We have shown that Nova2 acts as a post-transcriptional regulator of the molecular mechanisms involved in the organization of the vascular lumen. In zebrafish, depletion and genetic knockout of <italic>nova2</italic> prevents proper formation of the lumen of blood vessels and also results in defects in EC polarization. Interestingly, in avascular organisms, such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the Nova homologue (Pasilla, <italic>ps</italic>), is not expressed in the brain, but instead is expressed at high levels in salivary glands and several other non-neuronal tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Notably, <italic>ps</italic> mutants have altered apical secretion and are characterized by developmental defects of the salivary gland including regions of lumen alteration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. This type of morphology, with a severely altered lumen, is somehow reminiscent of the morphology of the zebrafish vasculature observed on <italic>nova2</italic> depletion. Recently, several regulators of salivary gland lumen formation (such as Cdc42, Pak proteins and cadherins) have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Intriguingly, they are also implicated in vascular lumenogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and, more importantly, regulators of their activity and localization are known Nova2 AS targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data show that, in cultured ECs, Nova2 establishes EC polarity by controlling Par3 localization, the activity of Cdc42 and the phosphorylated state of PKCζ. Notably, signalling downstream of Cdc42 is impaired in the absence of Nova2, as the active form of PKCζ and Pak4 are reduced in Nova2-depleted ECs. Interestingly, Pak4 phosphorylation correlates with EC lumen formation and RNA interference-mediated suppression of <italic>Pak4</italic> strongly inhibits these processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Similarly, depletion of <italic>Nova2</italic> impairs the establishment of EC polarity and the organization of the vascular lumen. These defects are associated with aberrant AS of pre-mRNAs encoding factors belonging to the Par polarity complex and its regulators.</p>
<p>Par complex and downstream effectors play important roles in regulating cell–cell adhesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, in controlling the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, and in promoting directional, collective cell migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Strikingly, we found that downregulation of <italic>Nova2</italic> affected the architecture of cell–cell boundaries and the behaviour of migrating ECs. In particular, in wound closure <italic>Nova2</italic>-depleted ECs failed to move in a cohesive manner with the lack of coordination in the direction of cell movement suggesting that, in addition to its role on lumen formation, Nova2 expression might also control adhesion signals and the directional migration of ECs.</p>
<p>Our current lack of knowledge of the functional implications of most AS events makes it difficult to interpret the global impact of the AS changes we have identified. Moreover, it is plausible that additional AS events are regulated by Nova2 in ECs. Nevertheless, we found that the alteration in Cdc42 activity in <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown ECs is preferentially reverted by overexpression of a specific AS isoform of Pix-<italic>α</italic> (Pix-<italic>α</italic>-Δ17) regulated by Nova2, indicating that AS of this gene plays an important role in Cdc42 activation.</p>
<p>We found Nova2-dependent AS regulation of zebrafish orthologous genes encoding polarity regulators. Among these, there are well-characterized activators (<italic>Pix-α, Dock6</italic> and <italic>DBS</italic>) of Cdc42, which—in turn—plays an essential role in controlling lumen formation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Nova2-regulated pre-mRNA targets encode proteins that interact with each other<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, suggesting that Nova2 regulates a network of apical–basal polarity regulators and that AS plays an important role in affecting physical interactions between these factors during the organization of the vascular lumen. Hence, the phenotypic changes that we observed on <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown are likely the integrated effects of several AS changes that may act in a coordinated and non-redundant manner.</p>
<p>On the basis of the fact that Nova2 affects both neural and vascular cell processes, we suggest that Nova2 is a novel member of the ‘angioneurins' family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Interestingly, Nova2 is the only member of the angioneurin family defined so far that functions as post-transcriptional regulator. Malfunctioning or imbalance in angioneurin signalling contributes to various neurological disorders, indicating that non-neuronal defects contribute to these diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In line with this, in Alzheimer's disease patients' vascular dysfunction can be observed before the onset of the disease, suggesting that vascular alterations might causally contribute to disease initiation or progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Notably, significant AS changes associated with decreased Nova activity were reported in Alzheimer's patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Since Nova2 is an autoimmune target in a severe neurodegenerative disorder paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia (POMA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, an obvious question is whether POMA patients, in addition to displaying neurological symptoms, also develop vascular abnormalities.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>All procedures involving human samples were approved by the Istituto Europeo di Oncologia (IEO) Ethical Committee. When possible, a written informed consent for research use of biological samples was obtained from all patients, and the research project was approved by the Institutional IEO Ethical Committee. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using 3-μm sections from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Samples were rehydrated through xylene and graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was accomplished using 10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween20, pH 6.0. Samples were then incubated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 5 min, followed by 30 min of blocking in 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween20, and then by the incubation with goat anti-Nova2 (1:100 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-16) overnight at 4 °C in 2% BSA and 0.02% Tween20. Immunocomplexes were visualized with LSAB+System-HRP, DAKO (K0690) and acquired with the Aperio ScanScope system. Slides were counterstained with haematoxylin for histological evaluation. Double IHC was performed as follows: antigen retrieval was accomplished using 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween. Samples were then incubated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 5 min, followed by 30 min of blocking in 2% BSA and 0.02% Tween20, and then were incubated with a mix of goat anti-Nova2 (1:200) and mouse anti-CD31 (1:60 DAKO, Clone JC70A) in 2% BSA and 0.02% Tween20 for 2 h at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were visualized with an anti-goat horseradish peroxidase (HRP) detection system (Goat-on-Rodent HRP-Polymer, Biocare Medical), for 30 min at RT, followed by incubation with a Goat Anti-Mouse AP Polymer detection system (MACH 2 Mouse AP-Polymer Biocare Medical) for 30 min at RT.

To analyse the kinetics and the pattern of formation of the ISVs, we mounted in 1.2% low-melting agarose in E3 water <italic>Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1</italic>-dechorionated embryos at 22 hpf, previously anaesthetized using 15 mg l<sup>−1</sup> of tricaine (Sigma). Image acquisition was performed overnight every 10 min with a × 40 water immersion objective on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Confocal stacks from each time point were processed for maximum intensity projections and, subsequently, movies were generated with the Leica LCS software. To observe and evaluate the shape and function of the heart, we mounted under a stereomicroscope 48-hpf dechorionated embryos in 3% methyl-cellulose in E3 water, previously anaesthetized using 15 mg l<sup>−1</sup> of tricaine (Sigma).

Oligonucleotides corresponding to the target region (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>) were annealed and cloned into the pDR274 gRNA expression vector (Addgene, 42250) immediately upstream of the crRNA:trascRNA backbone. The <italic>nova2</italic> genomic target sequence starts with two GG nucleotides at the 5′ end for efficient transcription from the T7 promoter and ends with the protospacer-adjacent motif. The correct position of the target sequence into the pDR274 plasmid was verified through sequencing, using M13-Rev primer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). The <italic>nova2</italic> gRNA was <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and purified from DraI-digested plasmid as template, using the Maxiscript T7 Kit (Life Technologies). Capped and polyadenylated <italic>Cas9</italic> mRNA was <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and purified from 1 μg of PmeI-digested pMLM3613 Cas9 expression vector (Addgene, 42251) as a template, using the mMessage mMachine T7 ULTRA kit (Life Technologies).</p>
<p>A volume of 2 nl of a solution containing ∼13 ng μl<sup>−1</sup> of <italic>nova2</italic> gRNA and ∼300 ng μl<sup>−1</sup> of <italic>Cas9</italic> mRNA was co-injected in one-cell stage zebrafish embryos. On the next day, only embryos with a normal morphological phenotype were allowed to grow. To evaluate the efficiency of Cas9 nuclease activity, genomic DNA was extracted from 48-hpf single injected embryos and the <italic>nova2</italic>-targeted genomic locus was amplified from genomic DNA of each embryo (primers n2-locus-F and n2-locus-R in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). PCR products were then processed for the T7 Endonuclease I (T7EI) assay. PCR products were denaturated at 95 °C and rapidly re-annealed using a PCR thermocycler. PCR products were then incubated for 20 min with T7EI enzyme at room temperature, and the digestion products were visualized on 2% agarose gels.

We then compared the two replicates of <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown ECs versus control ECs. Differentially regulated AS events were defined as those showing an absolute ΔPSI⩾15 between knockdown and control means and a ΔPSI⩾5 between the ranges of the two groups. Only AS events with a minimum read coverage in all four samples were compared, which was defined as:

<p>Additional filtering was used to remove intron retention events with a binomial <italic>P</italic> value score above 0.05 in any of the four samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>.</p>
<p>This resulted in 365 differentially regulated AS events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), which were subdivided according to the predicted impact of <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown on the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>): (i) AS events predicted to generate protein isoforms both when Nova2 is present or depleted (150, 41.1%); (ii) AS events predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) or create a truncated protein when Nova2 is present (135, 37.0%); (iii) AS events predicted to trigger NMD or to create a truncated protein when Nova2 is absent (33, 9.0%); (iv) AS events in noncoding regions (40, 11.0%); and (v) AS events not able to be categorized into previous categories (7, 2%).</p>
<p>GO analysis was performed for each of the subdivided groups using ClueGO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. The background reference was based on multiexonic genes with the same minimum read coverage in the endothelium used above. Two categories had significant enrichment (<italic>P</italic> value&lt;0.05), those generating protein isoforms ((i) 49 terms enriched in 150 genes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>) and those predicted to trigger NMD/disrupted proteins when Nova2 is included ((ii) 15 terms enriched in 135 genes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5C</xref>). Detail of <italic>P</italic> values (as calculated by ClueGO) are found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>To compare AS events that show differential inclusion on <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown in ECs to those regulated by Nova proteins in neural cells, we used the 325 cassette exons previously predicted to be Nova targets in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Nearly all (319/325) exons could be matched to <italic>vast-tools</italic> AS event IDs based on the exact splice site coordinates and official gene symbols. Of these, 195/319 (61%) had enough read coverage to confidently derive inclusion estimates (PSIs) in all four EC RNAseq samples. From these, 28/195 (14.4%) exons showed a ΔPSI⩾10 on <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown in ECs in the same direction as previously predicted for Nova proteins in the brain, compared with only 2/195 (1%) in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). This overlap between Nova-regulated exons in endothelial and neural cells is highly significant (<italic>P</italic>=1.93<italic>e</italic><sup>−11</sup>, hypergeometric test; background event set corresponded to 14,970 cassette exons with a minimal read coverage in the endothelium as described above and in genes with a cRPKM&gt;2 in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Moreover, several methodological differences suggest that the actual overlapping of Nova2 regulation between endothelial and neural cells may be even higher. First, predictions of Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> include Nova1 and Nova2 targets, which may not be fully redundant. Second, exons described in Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. are predicted to be Nova protein targets based on Nova binding and presence of binding sites, among others. However, only half of the full set of Nova targets shows measurable differences in PSI in Nova knockout mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Finally, Nova2 proteins may use different cofactors that may be differentially expressed between endothelial and neural cells.</p>

<title>Supplementary Movie 1</title>
<p>One 22 hpf Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 embryo injected with ctr-MO was time lapsed for 15 hours. The image stack is 60 micron thick, with 5 micron voxel-depth, and 10 min. delay between one stack and the next one. The embryo's head is to the left, dorsal is to the top. Intersomitic vessels develop from the dorsal aorta, ventrally located, and extend dorsally; when they approach the dorsolateral roof of the neural tube, they divide in two branches to fuse together with branches of the adjacent vessel to form the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel (DLAV). During the intersomitic vessels extension, numerous filopodia extend and retract in all directions, exploring all around the vessel but in particular near the dorsal-most leading extension.</p>

<title>Supplementary Movie 2</title>
<p>One Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 embryo was injected at one-two cell stage with nova2 morpholino and left to grow until 22 hpf, when it was time lapsed for 15 hours. The image stack is 60 micron thick, with 5 micron voxel-depth, and 10 min. delay between one stack and the next one. The embryo's head is to the left, dorsal is to the top. One of the intersomitic vessels, during the extension to form the DLAV, grows partially retracting its fillopodia and missing to reach the DLAV.</p>

<p>One Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 embryo was injected at one-two cell stage with a mixture of nova2 morpholino and morpholino-resistant nova2 mRNA and left to grow until 22 hpf, when it was time lapsed for 15 hours. The image stack is 60 micron thick, with 5 micron voxel-depth, and 10 min. delay between one stack and the next one. The embryo's head is to the left, dorsal is to the top. Intersomitic vessels growth and sprouting appear similar to that observed in embryos injected with control MO.</p>

(<bold>b</bold>) Lateral view of the <italic>Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1</italic> embryo with EGFP under the control of the endothelial-specific promoter <italic>fli1a</italic>. The same transgenic zebrafish embryos were co-injected at one-cell stage with a vector (pTol2fli1ep:mCherry-nova2) driving the expression of a morpholino-resistant zebrafish <italic>nova2</italic> mRNA fused to mCherry fluorescent protein under the <italic>fli1a</italic> promoter. In this case individual ECs were mosaically labelled with mCherry-nova2 expression (nova2, red) in the nucleus of some cells of the trunk blood vessels (scale bar, 250 μm). (<bold>c</bold>) Endothelial-autonomous rescue of <italic>nova2</italic> morphants. PTol2fli1ep:mCherry-nova2 plasmid was co-injected with the <italic>nova2</italic> morpholino oligo (MO-nova2) in one-cell stage <italic>Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1</italic> embryos (bar 40 μm; arrowheads and arrows indicate vessels positive and negative for nova2, respectively). (<bold>d</bold>) ISV of the trunk expressing nova2 (arrowheads) showed a normal pattern and developed a correct lumen, whereas an adjacent ISV (arrows), negative for nova2 expression, was not formed properly, so that it failed to reach DLAV (scale bar, 30 μm). (<bold>e</bold>) Lateral view of 28-hpf transgenic embryos injected with the MO-nova2. Embryo showed in the upper row expresses in the vessel endothelium only GFP, whereas the embryo showed in the lower row expresses also a morpholino-resistant <italic>nova2</italic> cDNA fused with mCherry. The presence of <italic>nova2</italic> in the vessel endothelium is sufficient to preserve vessel morphology of <italic>nova2</italic> morphant embryos (scale bar, 50 μm).</p>
