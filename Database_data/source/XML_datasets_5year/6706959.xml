</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Clinical presentations of mutations in the <italic>IQSEC2</italic> gene on the X-chromosome initially implicated to cause non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID) in males have expanded to include early onset seizures in males as well as in females. The molecular pathogenesis is not well understood, nor the mechanisms driving disease expression in heterozygous females. Using a CRISPR/Cas9–edited <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mouse model, we confirm the loss of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> mRNA expression and lack of Iqsec2 protein within the brain of both founder and progeny mice. Both male (52%) and female (46%) <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mice present with frequent and recurrent seizures. Focusing on <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous female mice, we demonstrate increased hyperactivity, altered anxiety and fear responses, decreased social interactions, delayed learning capacity and decreased memory retention/novel recognition, recapitulating psychiatric issues, autistic-like features, and cognitive deficits present in female patients with loss-of-function <italic>IQSEC2</italic> variants. Despite Iqsec2 normally acting to activate Arf6 substrate, we demonstrate that mice modelling the loss of Iqsec2 function present with increased levels of activated Arf6. We contend that loss of Iqsec2 function leads to altered regulation of activated Arf6-mediated responses to synaptic signalling and immature synaptic networks. We highlight the importance of IQSEC2 function for females by reporting a novel nonsense variant c.566C &gt; A, p.(S189*) in an elderly female patient with profound intellectual disability, generalised seizures, and behavioural disturbances. Our human and mouse data reaffirm <italic>IQSEC2</italic> as another disease gene with an unexpected X-chromosome heterozygous female phenotype. Our Iqsec2 mouse model recapitulates the phenotypes observed in human patients despite the differences in the IQSEC2/Iqsec2 gene X-chromosome inactivation between the species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>X-linked intellectual disability is a common, clinically complex disease arising from mutations in more than 140 genes on the X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), affecting between 1/600 and 1/1,000 males and a substantial number of females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). X-linked inheritance is more complex than simply X-linked recessive or dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) with both X-inactivation (including associated tissue specific selection) and the impact of individual mutations contributing to this complexity. In mammals, the sex determination system used is XX/XY, with dosage compensation in females as a result of random inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in every cell. As a consequence, heterozygous females typically have a milder disease phenotype or are not affected. Despite this, there is a growing list of X-chromosome genes which are subject to X-inactivation or escape X-inactivation, including, for example, <italic>PHF6, CLCN4, ALG13, ARX,</italic> or <italic>USP9X, DDX3X</italic>, which display distinct phenotypes in males and females depending on the functional severity of the variant, as well as manifesting in a more severe female phenotype than the heterozygous state would predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). We contend that the IQ motif and Sec7 domain 2 protein (<italic>IQSEC2</italic>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="GenBank" xlink:href="NM_001111125">NM_001111125</ext-link>) (MIM 300522) is another X-chromosome disease gene in which we see a severe female phenotype because of heterozygous loss-of-function mutation.</p>
<p>We previously implicated <italic>IQSEC2</italic> as an X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) gene through identification of variants in affected males in four separate families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). These missense variants were clustered around the Sec7 and IQ-like domains and resulted in reduced enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Clinical features within these non-syndromic XLID families included moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) in all affected males, with variable seizures, autistic traits, and psychiatric problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Since then, unbiased, high-throughput sequencing in ID and epilepsy cohorts have identified familial and increasingly de novo loss-of-function <italic>IQSEC2</italic> variants, typically leading to phenotypic outcomes, including severe ID with epileptic encephalopathy, and a high prevalence of speech development deficits and psychiatric features, including autistic spectrum disorder. Interestingly, these severe phenotypes are noted not only in affected males but also in affected, heterozygous females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). The mechanisms contributing to the disease severity, particularly in heterozygous females is unknown and perplexing.</p>
<p>IQSEC2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which catalyzes exchange of GDP for GTP in a number of ARF superfamily of proteins. <italic>IQSEC2</italic> is highly expressed in the forebrain, specifically localized to excitatory synapses as part of the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor<bold></bold>(NMDAR) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). The exact role IQSEC2 plays at excitatory synapses remains unclear. Limited studies indicate a role in the activity-dependent removal of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPAR) and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Our own studies have shown that IQSEC2 also has a fundamental role in controlling neuronal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). However, there is currently no published research investigating the impact of loss or altered <italic>Iqsec2</italic> function on the development and resulting cognitive outcomes in any animal model. It is not certain if severe loss-of-function mutations in <italic>IQSEC2</italic> can be transmitted in the human setting, with only missense variants giving rise to milder non-syndromic features being maternally inherited. Hence, it was unclear if the loss of Iqsec2 function modelled in mice would survive into postnatal life, be reproductively viable or useful to model disease pathogenicity observed in humans. Here, we show that mice with the complete loss of function of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> by successfully targeting exon 3 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology survive into postnatal life and are viable. In this study, we investigate the effect of severe loss-of-function mutations driving the phenotype in patients, including the emerging female-specific phenotype using a mouse modelling the KO of <italic>Iqsec2</italic>.</p>
<p>We present an elderly female patient with profound ID and generalised seizures with a novel loss-of-function <italic>IQSEC2</italic> variant, providing important life span information for other patients diagnosed with this typically early onset neurodevelopmental disorder. We review the present literature of the growing number of females with loss-of-function variants in <italic>IQSEC2</italic>, who have a more severe phenotype than the heterozygous state would predict. In humans, the prevailing evidence suggests that <italic>IQSEC2</italic> escapes X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>); however, in mice, <italic>Iqsec2</italic> is subject to X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Hence, the mouse modelling heterozygous KO of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> provides an opportunity to assess the impact of X-inactivation and altered <italic>Iqsec2</italic> gene dosage in females. Here, we show that the loss of Iqsec2 function in mice recapitulates key aspects of the human phenotype, irrespective of the X-inactivation status of the gene in the two species, highlighting that our understanding of the traditional X-chromosome inheritance with heterozygous female sparing needs to be revisited.</p>

<title>Animal generation</title>
<p>All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia, and undertaken in accordance with their regulatory guidelines. Founding <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mice were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 by the South Australian Genome Editing facility (SAGE), University of Adelaide, Adelaide; details given below. Mice were maintained in the C57Bl/6N-Hsd background. Animals were of same sex and housed in individually ventilated cages, with sterile food and water available ad libitum. <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous male founder A was bred with a wild-type female to generate <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous progeny, which were subsequently bred with a wild-type stud male to generate <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous, <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous, and wild-type littermates. <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous males (n = 46) and <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous females (n = 153) were monitored and scored daily (from postnatal day [P] 14) for general health and welfare, appearance, weight, and the presence of seizure activity. In addition to standard food available ad libitum, crushed chow was soaked in sterile water and placed in an easily accessible feeding dish, which was refreshed daily.</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>CRISPR/Cas9 guide design</title>
<p>Guides were designed by the SAGE facility, University of Adelaide, under the guidance of Professor Paul Q Thomas as part of a fee for service for the generation of CRISPR/Cas9 <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mice. The online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu/">http://crispr.mit.edu/</ext-link>) was used to search for appropriate CRISPR guide sites targeting the removal of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> exon 3. The most appropriate guide was determined by total score, cut site in target gene, and number of off-target mismatches. Guides’ sequences determined most suitable were upstream CRISPR guide 5′-TCTAGTGTACTCACTCAGTT-3′ and downstream CRISPR guide 5′-AGGCTGGAACTGGCGAAAAC-3′. The CRISPR/Cas9 complex will cause double strand breaks in intron 2–3 of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> and intron 3–4, causing exon 3 to be deleted by a process of non-homologous end joining. CRISPR gRNA generation, microinjections of zygotes, and transfer to pseudopregnant recipients were performed by the SAGE facility as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p>

<title>Genotyping</title>
<p>A small segment of toe tissue was removed by sterile technique at P5 from all pups for genotyping and identification purposes. Genomic DNA was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions for Phire Hot Start II DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genotyping PCR was performed using 10 μM forward and reverse primer pairs (Table S1), 2x Phire Tissue Direct PCR Master Mix, and made up to 20 μl with MilliQ water. Reactions were placed in a thermocycler for one cycle at 98°C for 5 min, 32 cycles at 98°C for 30 s, 62°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, and one cycle at 72°C for 1 min. PCR products were held at 4°C before visualising on a 1.5% (wt/vol) agarose gel with 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide in TBE buffer (1.1 M Tris, 900 mM borate, and 25 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) alongside 1 kb+ molecular weight marker. Images were captured on a SynGene UV dock at 400 ms exposure on GeneSnap v7.05 for SynGene. DNA sequencing analysis was performed using SeqMan Pro version 10.1.2 (DNASTAR, Inc) against <italic>Iqsec2</italic> cDNA reference sequence <ext-link ext-link-type="GenBank" xlink:href="NM_001114664">NM_001114664</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Analysis of Iqsec2 mRNA and Iqsec2 protein</title>
<p>Animals were humanely killed by cervical dislocation. Brain was dissected from the skull and cut into two halves sagittally along the cerebral fissure. The right-hand side brain was separated and minced into cortex (n = 2, one each for protein and RNA) and cerebellum, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C pending analysis. RNA was extracted from 40 mg homogenised brain cortical tissue in TRIzol reagent and converted to cDNA using SuperScript RT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). <italic>Iqsec2</italic> gene expression was performed using both RT-PCR and qPCR. RT-PCR was performed using 50 pmol forward and reverse primer pairs (Table S1), 20U Roche Taq DNA polymerase, FailSafe PCR 2X PreMix J (Epicentre), and made up to 50 μl with MilliQ water. Reactions were placed in a thermocycler for one cycle at 94°C for 2 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 57–60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, and one cycle at 72°C for 5 min. Images were captured as described above. qPCR was performed using TaqMan gene expression assay probes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) spanning exon 3–4 boundary (Mm02344188_m1), exon 11–12 boundary (Mm02344183_m1), and exon 13–14 boundary (Mm02344185_m1) with <italic>gapdh</italic> used as a housekeeper (Mm99999915_g1). Wild types were pooled and averaged based on sex (n = 4 female wild type, n = 5 male wild type). Each individual <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous male or heterozygous female sample was normalised to the averaged wild-type data for their respective sex, with resulting data displayed as relative <italic>Iqsec2</italic> expression to their respective sexed wild-type controls. Protein extraction, SDS–PAGE, and Western blot analysis of protein levels were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). The primary antibodies were rabbit anti-IQSEC2 (1:2,000) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), rabbit anti-IQSEC1 and rabbit anti-IQSEC3, both used at 1:1,000 (Invitrogen), and mouse β-actin (AC-74; 1:20,000; Sigma-Aldrich A2228). Secondary antibodies from DAKO (Santa Clara) were goat antimouse HRP (1:2,000 P0447) and goat antirabbit HRP (1:2,000 P0448). Images were imported into Image Studio (Li-Cor Biosciences), and band intensities of Iqsec proteins were normalised to their respective β-actin loading control, and where required were harmonized across multiple immunoblots using a consistent control sample. Each individual <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous or heterozygous sample was normalised to the averaged pooled wild-type data for their respective sex, with relative intensities presented (n for each as described in figure legends).</p>

<sec id="s7">
<title>Behavioural assessment</title>
<p><italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous and wild-type females underwent monthly behavioural testing from one to 6 mo of age (n = 4 <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous and n = 3 wild-type controls at 1 mo, n = 8 <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous, and n = 6 wild-type controls at all other time points) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>).</p>

<title>Neuroanatomy</title>
<p>The left-hand side brain, separated along the cerebral fissure, was fixed at 4 degrees in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight, before being washed three times in cold PBS, and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 degrees. The samples were processed and paraffin-embedded by the Adelaide University Histology Department. Semi-serial sections, measuring 10 μm thick, were collected using a strategy of mounting every fifth serial section across five slides (series 1–5) with up to five replicates of this strategy per sample (A–E) to span the breadth of the mouse brain in sagittal or coronal orientation. The sections were stained by haematoxylin and eosin or Nissl and scanned using a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 2.0-HT whole slide imager (Meyer Instruments). Images were imported into ImageJ (Fiji; version 2.0.0-rc-59/1.51k, build fab6e1a004) for processing and measurement.</p>

<title>Multielectrode array</title>
<p>Cortical neuronal were isolated from embryonic day (E) 17.5 <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous female (n = 12) and wild-type littermates (n = 7 female) as per Hinze <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Neuronal suspensions were plated at 2.97 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well on 0.1% polyethyleneimine/20 μg/ml laminin-coated 24-well glass bottomed multielectorde array (MEA) plate (product: 24W300/30G-288; MultiChannel Systems). After 21 d in culture, 15-min recordings were captured using MultiScreen (version 1.5.9.0; MultiChannel Systems) at a sampling rate of 20,000 Hz and 1,000 ms baseline duration. Spike binning was performed at 100-ms intervals, with minimum burst duration set at 50 ms, with a minimum spike count in burst set at four spikes. Captured data were uploaded and exported using MultiAnalyser (version 1.2.90; MultiChannel Systems). Data obtained from each individual <italic>Iqsec2</italic> heterozygous female embryo was normalised to the averaged wild-type data.</p>

<p>Protein was extracted from snap-frozen cortical tissue of wild-type male mice (n = 4), KO male mice (n = 6), wild-type female mice (n = 5) and HetKO female mice (n = 9) following the manufacturer’s instructions for use in a G-LISA Arf6 Activation assay Biochem Kit (absorbance based) (Cytoskeleton). The levels of activated Arf6 measured in the cortical tissue were from mice ranging in age from 2 to 9 mo. Each sample was measured with an n = 4 replicates. Within each assay, the levels of activated Arf6 measured in the wild-type animals for each sex was set to 1, and values for each of the KO or HetKO samples were determined relative to these age and sex-matched wild-type controls. The relative levels of activated Arf6 for all WT animals measured in a single assay were used to normalise activated Arf6 levels across multiple assays. An aliquot of protein from each cortical sample analysed in the GLISA assays was also prepared for SDS–PAGE and Western blot analysis and probed for Iqsec2 as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and Arf6 protein abundance using polyclonal Arf6 antibody (PA1-093; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantitated as indicated above for Iqsec2 protein abundance.</p>

<p>The screening protocols were approved by the Women’s and Children’s Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee and the Human Ethics Committee of The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia (approval number REC2361/03/2020) and conforms with the principles set out in the WMA Declaration of Helsinki and Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2018). Informed consent was obtained from carers of the patient, including consent to publish images. DNA from the affected female was whole-exome sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 by the Australian Genome Research Facility. Reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using BWA-MEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) and mapping refined using Genome Analysis Toolkit version 3.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Mapping achieved a minimum median target coverage depth of 49 reads/sample and covered 87.67% of intended targets with at least 20 reads. Single-nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions were called by the genome analysis toolkit haplotype caller version 3.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).

<title>Generation of loss-of-function <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mice by CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of exon 3</title>
<p>Generation of a knockout (KO) mouse line to model the loss of Iqsec2 function was achieved by targeting exon 3 of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> for deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). The sequence and targeting of CRISPR guides to remove exon 3 in both isoforms are detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1</xref>. Exon 3 is invariable between the two main isoforms of <italic>Iqsec2</italic>, with exons 3–13 comprising consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). Injection of the CRISPR/Cas9 guides was performed as a fee for service (South Australian Genome Editing facility, University of Adelaide, Adelaide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). PCR amplification of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2A</xref>) and subsequent breakpoint mapping and sequencing of amplicons demonstrate that Founder A (male) had exon 3 removed with neighbouring exon 2 (short and long isoforms), exon 4, and exon 5 unaffected by the deletion, demonstrating successful targeted deletion of exon 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). Although exon 3 did not amplify in any of the four founders generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2B</xref>), founders B and C (males) had larger deletions than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2A</xref>), both impacting exon 4, and founder D (female) had a homozygous deletion of exon 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2C</xref>). The homozygous loss of <italic>I</italic><italic>QSEC</italic><italic>2</italic> has not been reported in the human population. Given the increasing incidence of mutations in girls (heterozygous) with early-onset seizure phenotypes, it was not unexpected that this female homozygous KO mouse was found dead early in postnatal life, negating the opportunity to collect samples for expression analysis, or attempt breeding. This animal was not included in any further analysis. Overall, the editing of all founders extended past the recognised CRISPR/Cas9 guide cut sites in both directions by nonstandard amounts, with larger deletion sizes of this X-chromosome region noted in males. This finding demonstrates that CRISPR/Cas9, although an effective genome editing tool, requires careful validation.</p>

<p>To confirm that deletion of exon 3 by CRIPSR/Cas9 editing resulted in loss of <italic>Iqsec2</italic>/Iqsec2, we analysed the gene expression and protein level from cortical brain tissue in which <italic>Iqsec2</italic> is highly expressed during postnatal life. We demonstrate in the three founder males and progeny of founder A that <italic>Iqsec2</italic> expression was reduced or absent when detected by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>) and significantly reduced compared with sex-matched wild-type progeny when analysed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). Founder A and founder B had no detectable <italic>Iqsec2</italic> expression by either analysis. The negligible expression levels of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> short isoform detected for founder C in the RT-PCR analysis was not replicated by qPCR. <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous male progeny from founder A also had no detectable <italic>Iqsec2</italic> expression by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>) but demonstrated minimal <italic>Iqsec2</italic> expression by qPCR with the probe spanning across the exon 11–12 boundary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>. (ii) This result is consistent with very low levels of transcript (∼5% of normal) being present before nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous female progeny showed that <italic>Iqsec2</italic> expression by RT-PCR for both the short and long isoforms were reduced to less than half the levels of wild-type female controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Similarly, reduced <italic>Iqsec2</italic> expression in these females was also noted by qPCR, with expression levels dependent on the probe used (range 0–79%, mean 35%), but were still significantly elevated above both founder males and <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous male progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). We note that expression levels were quite varied between individual heterozygous females and cannot discount differences due to levels of X-inactivation in these animals. The three male founders had no discernible Iqsec2 protein in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). Similarly, there was no discernible Iqsec2 protein in KO hemizygous male progeny and reduced levels of Iqsec2 protein (~half of the wild-type control levels) in KO heterozygous female progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). Off-target analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 editing using computational tools (CRISPR design tool by MIT: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu/">http://crispr.mit.edu/</ext-link> and COSMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://crispr.bme.gatech.edu/">https://crispr.bme.gatech.edu</ext-link>) identified that the majority (92%) of predicted off-targets were located in regions that did not harbour genes or impacted intronic regions within genes and were unlikely to effect the coding region of the genome (Table S2). For the 31 genes identified to potentially be impacted by off-target effects, 28 were reported with high numbers of mismatch (n = 4). In contrast, <italic>Iqsec3</italic> was the only gene predicted to be impacted by either CRISPR guide that was identified by both computational tools (Table S2). <italic>IQSEC3</italic> is highly expressed within multiple regions of the brain, including the cortex. Our analysis of the three founder males demonstrates that Iqsec3 protein levels in the cortex were reduced (27%, 14%, and 36% of wild-type, respectively) but were normalised to wild-type levels in subsequent founder A progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest successful outbreeding of the potential off-target effects.</p>

<p>To investigate if the loss (or partial loss) of Iqsec2 protein in the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mice elicited a compensatory effect by other members of the Iqsec protein family, we measured the protein abundance of Iqsec1 and Iqsec3 in cortical samples of the wild-type and <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mice by immunoblot. The levels of Iqsec1 protein were very low compared with the ready detection of Iqsec3 protein in the same samples and were not robust enough for semiquantitative analysis. Despite this, we did not see any empirical evidence of a consistent or stronger signal in the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO animals. In the case of Iqsec3, there was no significant increase in protein abundance in the brains of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous male or KO heterozygous female mice compared with wild-type sex-matched mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3</xref>). Hence, we demonstrate that Iqsec protein family members are unlikely to provide a compensatory role to ameliorate the loss or partial loss of Iqsec2.</p>

The seizures included (i) sudden onset of irregular generalised clonic jerks, where the mouse demonstrated involuntary, uncontrolled, unilateral head movements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">Video 1</xref>); (ii) repetitive forelimb clonus that commenced with intermittent clonic jerking of the head and forelimbs, which then became rhythmic, associated with tonic posturing of the forelimbs, evolving to rearing and generalised tonic–clonic activity lasting ∼60 s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">Video 2</xref>); (iii) uncontrolled convulsions with bilateral forelimb outward stretching were also noted which commenced with the sudden onset of irregular generalised clonic jerks followed by hypermotor activity, which lasted ∼5 s before ceasing (and often reinitiating; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">Video 3</xref>); and (iv) and full body tonic–clonic seizures that started with symmetrical tonic extension of both forelimbs and hindlimbs, which develop into rhythmic generalised clonic activity after ∼15 s, continuing for an additional 30 s before ceasing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">Video 4</xref>). Seizure episodes were frequently accompanied by twitching ears, a straight tail, and an increase in facial grooming/washing pre- and post-seizure occurrence. <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mice that were found dead in their cage were classified as having died because of either a seizure or status epilepticus, as no wild-type control littermates were found dead in this study.</p>

<p>In concordance with the clinical variability noted in both male and female human patients with loss-of-function mutations, we measured large variations in age of onset, seizure severity, and progression amongst individual <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mice. The proportion of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous males exhibiting seizures (all sub-types combined) from birth to 4 mo of age (7–54%, respectively) was significantly increased when compared with heterozygous females (2–37%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). However, after 5 mo of age, the proportion of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mice exhibiting seizures plateaued, with males ranging from 57 up to 65% at the study end point (∼300 d of postnatal life) and females ranging from 54 to 60% across the same time period.

<title><italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous female mice demonstrate altered behavioural phenotyping</title>
<p>Given the striking similarity in the seizure phenotype displayed by the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous male and heterozygous female mice, coupled with the marked overlap in phenotypic outcomes in loss-of-function male and females patients in the human setting, we contend that the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous females provide a representative model for this disorder. Interestingly, the male KO progeny were able to breed and transmit the loss-of-function <italic>Iqsec2</italic> mutation with minimal difficulty. In contrast, the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous females displayed reduced breeding success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig S4</xref>). However limited, this indicates that a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>Iqsec2</italic> is able to be transmitted, at least in mice. Due largely to the limited breeding success of our <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous females, generating the required number of age appropriate KO males for behavioural testing was challenging and precluded testing in hemizygous males. Hence, we undertook a battery of behavioural tests at monthly intervals up to 6 mo of age in the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous females compared with female wild-type controls.</p>

Of the breeders able to produce live young (blue), only 20% produced a milk supply and fed their young (green), whereas most females either never fed their young at all (orange) or only fed/nurtured their young for a maximum of 1 day (pale orange). This phenomenon was observed not only with first-time mothers but also in subsequent litters. Feeding/nurturing success was not obviously correlated with observed seizure occurrence. Breeding females were set up between 3 and 4 mo of age with wild-type C57/Bl6 stud males, with males remaining with their respective female for the duration of breeding.

<p>Nissl stain of both the coronal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>) and sagittal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>) orientations demonstrate there is no gross disturbance to the overall anatomical structure of the brain in heterozygous female compared with wild-type mice. Emerging evidence suggests that severely affected patients with <italic>IQSEC2</italic> loss-of-function mutations display a phenotype that includes thinning of the corpus callosum. We examined the thickness of the corpus callosum at two distinct points, each in three semi-serial coronal sections from an n = 4 animals per genotype (sections relative to the reference Allen Brain Atlas, Mouse, P56, and coronal images 44–46 of 132). Using this approach, we demonstrate that the thickness of these regions was significantly diminished in the heterozygous female mice compared with the wild-type female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>). In line with the increase in hyperactivity and anxiety noted in our <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous females, we observed an increase in total hippocampal volume in heterozygous KO female mice (34%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0008 HET versus WT females) and an increase in the volume of the dentate gyrus (48%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0006 for HET females) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D</xref> (sections relative to the reference Allen Brain Atlas, Mouse, P56, sagittal images 9–10 of 21). Despite these discreet changes to specific neuroanatomical regions of the brain, our analysis indicates there were no significant differences in the area of the brain sections measured between wild-type females and the heterozygous KO females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4E</xref>) (sections relative to the reference Allen Brain Atlas, Mouse, P56, sagittal images 11–12 of 21).</p>

<title><italic>Iqsec2</italic> female mice display hallmarks of immature synaptic networks ex vivo</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of Iqsec2 on the activity of synaptic networks, we analysed cultured cortical neurons using a multielectrode array. Neurons isolated from individual <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous female embryos grown for 21 d in culture display hallmarks of immature synaptic networks when compared with neurons from wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>).

In contrast, <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous cultures showed aberrant synchronicity; with action potentials not consistently clustered in large bursts, but included smaller, randomly spaced events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A.ii</xref>).

<title>Loss of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> function leads to an increased level of activated Arf6 in cortical tissues</title>
<p>There are multiple ArfGEFs, each with a conserved Sec7 domain responsible for catalysing nucleotide exchange and activating members of the small G protein Arfs. Hence, it was not clear what impact the loss-of-function of a single ArfGEF would have on regulating activated Arf-mediated responses to synaptic signalling in vivo. As Iqsec2 is an ArfGEF particularly for the small GTPase Arf6, we analysed the levels of activated (or GTP bound) Arf6 in cortical tissues from individual mice of each genotype. There was no change in the level of Arf6 activation with increasing postnatal age (range 2–9 mo), and although the levels of activated Arf6 were higher in wild-type females relative to wild-type males, this difference was not significant (1.5 fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). In contrast, cortical tissues from heterozygous females exhibited significantly elevated levels of activated Arf6 (2.6 fold; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0186) when compared with sex-matched and age-matched wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>). A similar outcome was observed in cortical tissues from hemizygous males with an elevated, although not statistically significant, level of activated Arf6 (2.45 fold; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0536) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>). The increases in activated Arf6 levels in <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous and heterozygous mice were not reflected by a significant increase in Arf6 protein abundance relative to wild-type for either sex (detected in the same [and additional] cortical tissue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6C</xref>). Nor was Arf6 protein abundance impacted by the presence of an observed seizure (indicated by stars instead of circles; <italic>P</italic> = 0.1009).</p>

<title>Heterozygous loss-of-function variant in <italic>IQSEC2</italic> in a female with a neurocognitive seizure phenotype</title>
<p>Here, we report an elderly, 68-yr-old female (II-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref>) with severe-to-profound ID, early onset of seizures who is nonverbal, and communicates primarily using sounds and gestures. She has a history of normal early development, learning to sit at 8–10 mo and walk at age 18 mo. After seizure onset at 17 mo, she developed repeated, generalised seizures during the daytime and regression was observed. She later developed additional atypical absence and atonic seizure types. Since the age of 11, she has been living in residential care. Her daily functioning skills are poor, and she needs assistance in every-day life. Facial features include low-set, large ears, and asymmetric facial features with prominent angle of the jaw, thick upper lip with mild hypertrichosis over the upper lip and deep-set eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). No brain MRI has been performed because of the requirement of general anaesthesia. A detailed clinical description of the proband is described in <inline-supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e1447" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" mimetype="application" xlink:href="LSA-2019-00386_Supplemental_Data_1.docx">Supplemental Data 1</inline-supplementary-material>. Whole-exome analysis of four Finnish families identified a novel, heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphism at genomic position ChrX:g.53,349,756 (GRCh37/19) in the female proband of one family. The variant has been submitted to the gene variant database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/IQSEC2">https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/IQSEC2</ext-link> (patient ID 00174867; DB-ID #0000398628). Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of this variant in the proband (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C</xref>). Samples were not available for the twin brother or parents of the affected female proband to confirm the inheritance status of this variant. This variant in exon 1 of the <ext-link ext-link-type="GenBank" xlink:href="NM_001111125.2">NM_001111125.2</ext-link> long isoform substitutes a single nucleotide at c.566C&gt;A, generating a predicted premature stop codon, p.(S189*) (<ext-link ext-link-type="GenBank" xlink:href="NP_001104595">NP_001104595</ext-link>) in <italic>IQSEC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7D</xref>). This variant was not found in ExAC, GnomAD, or dbSNP150 project databases. This predicted premature stop codon is located 141 nucleotides from the exon 1–2 junction, with the transcript predicted to be degraded via the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, resulting in loss of the IQSEC2 protein.</p>

<p>Review of the literature shows that the affected female proband adds to the growing number of affected females with loss-of-function variants in <italic>IQSEC2</italic> gene presenting with severe ID and early-onset seizures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>) recently reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> details 31 different variants in <italic>IQSEC2</italic> in 38 separate cases of affected female(s) predicted to cause pathogenic loss of IQSEC2 function. Of these 31 variants, 28 are known to have arisen de novo, one case of gonadal mosaicism in a family of four affected girls, and one case of monozygotic twins, with discordant phenotypes. The inheritance in the proband of the current report was unable to be determined. Although not all cases were accompanied by complete clinical descriptions, 33 of the 38 cases report developmental delay or ID ranging from mild-to-severe or profound and present with a range of comorbid behavioural and psychiatric features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, 28 of the 38 cases reported a range of seizure types in the affected females, including epileptic encephalopathies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In a recent review of the phenotypic spectrum of epileptic encephalopathies in male and female patients with pathogenic <italic>IQSEC2</italic> variants, it was noted that there was no specific electroclinical syndrome that could be defined, with all patients displaying multiple seizure types consisting mainly of atonic, myoclonic, or epileptic spasms. The seizure phenotypes were accompanied with a variety of electroencephalogram (EEG) patterning, including hypsarrhythmia, polyspikes and waves, generalised spikes and waves, slow spikes and waves, as well as background slowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). The advanced age of the female proband (68 yr old) we identify and present as part of this study underscores the importance of considering <italic>IQSEC2</italic> as an explanation of ID and, particularly, seizures in females across their life span. Furthermore, this finding reinforces the fact that a female <italic>IQSEC2</italic> phenotype may still be under-ascertained.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The cellular and molecular pathogenesis of <italic>IQSEC2</italic> mutations is not well understood. To address this, we used CRISPR/Cas9–targeted editing to generate an <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mouse model with no (<italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous males) or reduced (<italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous females) <italic>Iqsec2</italic> mRNA and protein. We validated both successful genome editing and germline transmission. To date, there have been no reports of transmission of loss-of-function mutations in <italic>IQSEC2</italic> in the human setting, with the exception of gonadal mosaicism in a family of four affected female siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). We demonstrate that hemizygous KO males were viable and able to breed and generate healthy female heterozygous KO offspring. This suggests a potential difference in mouse to human phenotypic outcomes related to brain and sexual development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Despite some difficulties, the successful breeding of the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous female mice shows that a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>Iqsec2</italic> can be transmitted, at least in mice.</p>
<p>In agreement with the expanding phenotypic spectrum and the 67% penetrance of seizures in patients with de novo pathogenic variants in <italic>IQSEC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), we demonstrate that severe spontaneous seizures are observed in approximately half of all the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mice. In these mice, we observed four distinct seizure types: (i) involuntary, uncontrolled, unilateral head movements, (ii) repetitive forelimb clonus, (iii) uncontrolled convulsions with bilateral forelimb outward stretching, and (iv) full body tonic–clonic seizures. Using the (human) International League Against Epilepsy classification system, these seizures can be considered equivalent to a (i) generalised clonic seizure, (ii) focal seizure evolving to bilateral tonic–clonic seizure, (iii) focal motor seizure (likely frontal lobe onset), and (iv) generalised tonic–clonic seizure (Personal communication: A/Prof Nigel C Jones, Department of Neuroscience, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). Although EEG analysis was not undertaken in this study, aberrant firing and abnormal burst activity was noted in neuronal cultures of <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO affected embryos. This abnormal activity is consistent with immature synaptic networks, previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>).</p>
<p>Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated cation channels that mediate most of the excitatory neurotransmission in the brain and are classified based on pharmacological selectivity to AMPA, kainic acid, and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). Activation of these receptors couples the electrical signal at the synapse to downstream biochemical signalling pathways. Selected NMDAR subunit genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Synaptic plasticity associated with changes to spine morphology has been shown to be dependent on activation of these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). IQSEC2 is localized to excitatory synapses as part of the protein scaffold downstream of the NMDA receptor complex. Through enzyme activity, IQSEC2 activates ARF6, a member of the Ras superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>) to facilitate downstream remodelling of actin cytoskeleton, a site of convergence with other ID and autism genes. In the present study, we demonstrate that neurons in culture isolated from individual heterozygous female embryos display hallmarks of immature synaptic networks. Investigating which critical components of synaptic signalling are altered in response to Iqsec2 dosage, we show surprisingly the loss of Iqsec2 leads to an increase in the levels of activated Arf6 in cortical tissue during postnatal life. The increase in the active form of Arf6 is independent of changes to the overall abundance of Arf6 protein. Taken together, these data indicate that increased levels of activated Arf6 in the presence of Iqsec2 loss of function are likely to be at the local, dendritic environment in response to neuron signalling. Using the novel and powerful <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO hemizygous male and heterozygous female mouse models will enable further investigations into the critical components altered in response to reduced Iqsec2 dosage and the downstream events contributing to disease outcomes.</p>
<p>Review of the female patients with complete loss-of-function mutations in <italic>IQSEC2</italic> shows that comorbid behavioural and psychiatric features are frequently present in addition to ID (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Hence, it was not surprising that mice modelling <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO in the heterozygous female state displayed a range of phenotypic traits across a series of behavioural tests corresponding to these additional features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Notably, the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous females recapitulated a reduction in intellectual functioning and autistic-like behaviours, demonstrated through a loss of novel recognition on the Y-maze, a reduction in learning and memory during the Barnes maze trial, and an overall reduction in interaction time during the sociability test. Altered anxiety-like/fear responses and hyperactivity in the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous female mice on multiple apparatus correlate with an increase in hippocampal volume, which has been associated with mental retardation and psychiatric issues such as autism, attention-deficit disorder, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). We also observe a thinning of the corpus callosum in the <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO heterozygous female mice, a phenotype emerging in several cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Taken together, these findings highlight that our <italic>Iqsec2</italic> KO mouse model recapitulates the complex phenotypic spectrum observed in female patients with loss-of function <italic>IQSEC2</italic> variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Interestingly, the emergence of a speech phenotype is noted in the proband reported in this study and 26 of the 38 published female cases with loss-of-function variants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Although we have not yet addressed this clinical feature in mice, it would be interesting to investigate it, particularly in view of the observations of reduced mothering skills of the breeding heterozygous females.</p>

<p>Female patients with de novo loss-of-function mutations in <italic>IQSEC2</italic> often have a more severe phenotype than the heterozygous state would traditionally predict, particularly if <italic>IQSEC2</italic> is thought to escape X-inactivation. The capacity of genes on the X-chromosome to be silenced, or to escape to some degree X-inactivation is not fully understood. Escape from X-inactivation for I<italic>QSEC2</italic> in humans has long been the prevailing view, as demonstrated by evidence measuring DNA methylation as a predictor of inactivation status across a panel of 27 tissues from 1,875 females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). In contrast, recent large-scale expression studies from the GTEX consortium demonstrate that the expression of <italic>IQSEC2</italic> is similar in males and females across a broad range of tissues, including regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). This would suggest either dosage compensation in males (up-regulation) or females (down-regulation) or X-chromsome inactivation (XCI) in females. The degree by which incomplete XCI manifests as detectable sex differences in gene expression and phenotypic traits remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). The I<italic>qsec2</italic> KO mouse model studied here shows severe phenotypic presentation in the heterozygous state. This fact would suggest that the severity of the phenotype in heterozygous females with loss-of-function IQSEC2/Iqsec2 allele is generally independent of X-chromosome inactivation. Given that X-inactivation leads to cellular mosaicism in heterozygous females one may speculate that the function and impact of IQSEC2/Iqsec2 is cell nonautonomous, that is, loss of IQSEC2/Iqsec2 impacts wild-type (i.e., where the mutant X is inactivated) as well as mutant (i.e., cells where the wild-type X is inactivated) cells. As such, this genetic KO model will provide an excellent tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms of X-linked inheritance underpinning the male and female phenotypes, providing valuable information not only for <italic>Iqsec2</italic>, but other X-linked genes with an emerging female phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>).</p>
