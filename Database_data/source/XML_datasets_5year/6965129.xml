<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">The retina is the light sensitive tissue located in the posterior eye. Photoreceptor cells within the retina are responsible for converting light signals into electrical signals, and loss of these cells is a leading cause of blindness in humans. In the course of diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP), rod and cone photoreceptor cells are slowly lost, beginning at the peripheral retina and moving centrally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Multiple mutant genes in humans can cause RP, and many of these have counterpart mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In this paper we describe a novel mouse model of retinal degeneration which has early and rapid loss of photoreceptor cells due to loss of function of a largely uncharacterised gene. The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) is a worldwide collaborative effort to generate lines of mice, each with a loss of function mutation in a single gene, and to comprehensively phenotype the lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The ultimate aim is to catalogue the function of every gene in the mouse genome in order to contribute to the understanding of fundamental mammalian biology and to generate models for human disease. Many institutions participate and follow an agreed pipeline for the phenotypic analysis of the mice, known as IMPReSS (International Mouse Phenotyping Resource of Standardised Screen). The analyses include growth, morphological, behavioural, metabolic and sensory phenotypes over a 15 week period, and followed post-mortem by examination of haematology, immunology, clinical chemistry and gross pathology. At 15 weeks of age mutant mice undergo slit lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy to investigate the gross morphology of the eye.</p>
<p id="Par3">As part of this study a novel gene, <italic>Fam151b</italic>, was mutated and the mice analysed through the IMPC pipeline. <italic>Fam151b</italic> knockout mice were found to have abnormal retina morphology and no other observed phenotype. Here we follow up these findings with a detailed histological and functional analysis of this disease model. In addition we have mutated the paralogous gene, <italic>Fam151a</italic>. No retinal phenotype was observed in <italic>Fam151a</italic> mutant mice, nor was the <italic>Fam151b</italic> phenotype enhanced in double mutant animals.</p>
<p id="Par4"><italic>Fam151a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are mammalian homologues of the <italic>C.elegans</italic> gene <italic>menorin</italic> (<italic>mnr-1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This gene was identified as affected in mutant worms with disrupted dendritic branching in somatosensory neurons; the 90° menorah-like branch pattern observed in control worms was lost in mutants. Mutations in other genes that result in a similar phenotypes, and subsequent biochemistry, identified SAX7 (the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue of L1CAM) and the leucine rich repeat transmembrane receptor, DMA<italic>-1</italic>, as forming a genetic and molecular complex with MNR-1 which is necessary for dendritic branching.</p>

<title>Menorin, FAM151A and B are members of the GDPD/PLCD superfamily</title>
<p id="Par5">We analysed the amino acid sequence of FAM151B to identify similarities with proteins of known function. A search of the UniRef 50 database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> shows the FAM151 family to be widely distributed in animals, including <italic>C.elegans</italic>, as noted above, and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and is annotated in Pfam as containing the domain of unknown function (DUF) 2181. We used the remote homology detection server HHPred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> using a profile from multiple FAM151 alignments to find more divergent homologues. HHPred searches with FAM151 family matched the Phospholipase D domain of a spider (<italic>Sicarius terrosus</italic>) toxin (PDB-ID: 4Q6X) with a highly significant E-value of 1.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, in support of this, the next most statistically significant matches were to additional members of the Phospholipase D and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDPD) families (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). These proteins are all members of the PLC-like phosphodiesterase superfamily of enzymes. PLC-like phosphodiesterases contain a TIM barrel fold, first described in triosephosphate isomerase but found in many proteins, and contain an evolutionarily conserved active site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) crucially also conserved in menorin and FAM151A and B. These different enzymes hydrolyse phosphodiester bonds of a large number of different substrates, ranging from Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) protein anchors (in GDPD family) to sphingolipid and lysolipid (in Phospholipase D spider toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of representative members of FAM151 family and PLC-like phosphodiesterases. This MSA was generated with the program T-Coffee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> using default parameters and slightly refined manually. The final superfamily alignment was generated using a combination of profile-to-profile comparisons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and sequence alignments derived from structural superimpositions using DALI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, for those families whose tertiary structure is known, such us: Phospholipase D toxins (PDB-IDs: 4Q6X, 1XX1, and 3RLG), GDPD enzymes (PDB-IDs: 1YDY, 3QVQ, 2OTD, and 1VD6) and PLC (Phosphoinositide phospholipase C) enzyme (PDB-ID:1DJY). Families are indicated by coloured background to the left of the alignment: FAM151, Phospholipase D toxins, GDPD and PLC enzymes are indicated in red, pink, blue and green, respectively. The limits of the protein sequence conserved regions included in the alignment are indicated by flanking residue positions. Secondary structure predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> were performed for the FAM151 family and these are consistent with X-ray determined secondary structures of the PLC-like phosphodiesterases.

The alignment was presented with the program Belvu using a colouring scheme indicating the average BLOSUM62 scores (which are correlated with amino acid conservation) of each alignment column: red (&gt;3), violet (between 3 and 1.5) and light yellow (between 1.5 and 0.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par6">FAM151B has a single DUF2181 domain, as does menorin. In FAM151A the DUF domain is duplicated, but the critical active site residues in the C-terminal domain are missing suggesting that this second domain lacks enzymatic activity. Most vertebrates have orthologues of both FAM151A and B, but <italic>Medaka</italic> is one exception and appears to have only FAM151B.</p>
<p id="Par7">The expression patterns of the two <italic>Fam151</italic> paralogues are quite different. <italic>Fam151a</italic> expression in the mouse is undetectable in most tissues, but is highly expressed in the intestine, kidney and spleen.

<title><italic>Fam151b</italic> knockout mice exhibit early and rapid photoreceptor loss</title>
<p id="Par8"><italic>Fam151b</italic> mutant mice containing a LacZ reporter inserted into intron 2 and a deletion of exon 3 (<italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>tm1b(EUCOMM)Hmgu</italic></sup> hereafter <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup>) were derived as described in the Methods. The insertion includes a polyadenylation site, and the deletion results in any mRNA from which the insertion has been spliced out having a frameshift and termination of translation 15 codons further. Phenotyping homozygous mutant mice through the IMPReSS pipeline identified a degenerative retinal phenotype at 15 weeks, characterised by patchy pigmentation of the retina, compared to the evenly coloured pink retina of control mice. We examined homozygous mice earlier, at 11 weeks, and also observed a patchwork pattern from fundal imaging indicative of retinal degeneration, not present in wild type litter mates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Histological analysis of the eyes revealed a severe reduction in the length of the outer segments of the photoreceptors, and in the number of the nuclei of the photoreceptor cells, found in the outer nuclear layer, indicating a substantial loss of photoreceptors. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). The other retinal layers appear to be unaffected. To test for retinal function we carried out electroretinogram (ERG) analysis on the mutant mice, which confirmed a loss of photoreceptor function, shown by a greatly reduced scotopic a-wave (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Adult <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice have extensive retinal degeneration.

Histological analysis (<bold>b</bold>) shows that this was due to a loss of the outer nuclei layer, in which the nuclei of photoreceptor cells are located. The outer segments are shortened.

<p id="Par9">We analysed <italic>Fam151b</italic> mutant and control eyes at several ages to determine when the loss of photoreceptor cells occurred. Eyes were taken at postnatal day 11 (P11) and examined by histology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). Mutant mice at this age had comparable numbers of nuclei in the outer nuclei layer to wild type littermates, and the remainder of the retina also appears normal. The mutant eyes appear to develop normally prior to eye opening at P14. We stained the retinal sections to label glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a widely used marker of retinal stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and found no upregulation of this protein at P11.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Histological analysis of disease progression in <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice.

<p id="Par10">We compared <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> and wild type littermates at P15. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>, mutant mice still have comparable numbers of photoreceptor nuclei to wild type littermates. However, at this stage, there is an upregulation of GFAP expression, indicative of retinal stress. By P21 <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice have a dramatically reduced outer nuclei layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>) indicating a loss of photoreceptor cells along with GFAP upregulation.</p>
<p id="Par11">We performed ERG on P15 mice to assess whether the photoreceptors present have any function prior to their degeneration. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>, <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice exhibit a significantly reduced scotopic (dark adapted) a-wave when stimulated with a high intensity light source (10 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>) although at standard light intensity, in both dark adapted and light adapted eyes, (3 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>) whilst the a-wave amplitude appears reduced it does not reach significance at p = 0.0534 and 0.487931 for dark and light adapted eyes respectively. This suggests that some of the photoreceptors are able to respond to a light stimulus, however the majority cannot and thus produces a lower a-wave amplitude. This may mean that the photoreceptor cells develop and can function normally but degenerate very quickly after eye opening. By P21 there is little to no a-wave amplitude when stimulated with both 10 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> and 3 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> flashes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>).

<title>The retinal pigment epithelium of <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice appears healthy</title>
<p id="Par12">The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is important for the survival of photoreceptor cells as it provides support and recycles components of photoreceptor specific pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The early and rapid loss of photoreceptor cells seen in the <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice may be indicative of an RPE defect, so we examined two key RPE markers. Both RPE65 and ZO-1 are typical RPE and epithelial cell markers respectively and are both present and localised as expected. RPE65 is a membrane-associated RPE specific enzyme necessary for the generation of 11-cis-retinol in the retinoid cycle. Antibody staining on sections of 2 month old retinal tissue showed clear expression and localisation to the RPE layer in mutant mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). ZO-1 localises to the tight junctions between cells. ZO-1 antibody staining on 2 month old flattened whole RPE, from which the rest of the retina had been carefully removed, enabled us to view the localization of ZO-1 at the tight junctions in both mutant and control RPE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>RPE health was assessed by examining typical RPE markers.

<title>Photoreceptor loss is not due to light toxicity</title>
<p id="Par14">Mice open their eyes at about P14, just before we observed increased GFAP expression and reduced retinal function, raising the possibility that photoreceptor function may be lost due to light toxicity. To test this we removed pups, along with their mothers, from a 12 hour light/dark cycle and placed them in a constant dark environment for 1 week from P13, about one day prior to eye opening, until P20 and immediately thereafter analysed their ERG. We compared ERGs from <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice kept in a dark environment with wild-type littermates kept in the same environment and with <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice and wild-type littermates kept in a normal 12 hour light/dark cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par20">Loss of photoreceptors is a leading cause of blindness, understanding the genetic causes and pathology of the cell death is essential for developing therapeutics and possibly for developing ways of preventing the disease. Mouse models are an excellent resource in this area of research as they often recapitulate the human disease and therefore can be used to test the effectiveness of treatments and preventative strategies.</p>
<p id="Par21">Here we show that the <italic>Fam151b</italic> gene is essential for photoreceptor survival in the mouse. Retinal function also appears to be compromised with a reduced scotopic ERG response on eye opening in mice deficient for <italic>Fam151b</italic>. With such an early phenotype a diminished production or localisation of light sensitive proteins might be expected. However, rhodopsin and M-opsin staining in photoreceptors is still present and localised to the outer segments. These proteins are still observed at later stages, at week 11 two layers of photoreceptors remain with correct localisation of opsins, indicating that after the initial surge of cell death the surviving cells retain some aspects of normal cellular architecture. To date no patients with mutations in either <italic>FAM151</italic> paralogues have been described. Clear loss of function mutation in <italic>FAM151B</italic> are on the whole rare, and show a pattern similar to other retinal disease-causing genes. Light is well known to cause or further exacerbate retinal degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Photoreceptors must constantly renew essential pathway components and remove toxic products. Because of this and due to the timing of the retinal degeneration, we investigated whether light caused photoreceptor loss in the <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice and found this not to be the case. Mice kept in a dark environment from before their eyes were open showed a similar rate of degeneration. It is assumed that prior to eye opening some light may leak through the eyelids, but as no GFAP staining was observed in P11 retinas this is unlikely to be the cause of degeneration.</p>
<p id="Par22">The molecular function of menorin/FAM151A and B is unknown. The <italic>C.elegans</italic> protein, SAX-7, interacts with menorin to control the dendritic branching of sensory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Mutants of the mammalian homologue of <italic>Sax-7</italic>, <italic>L1CAM</italic>, have been described as having abnormal axon guidance and retinal ganglion cells, as well as other neuronal problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This phenotype has similarities to that seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants, and has implicated L1CAM in the precise guidance of axons. However this differs from the phenotype we have observed in <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice. Furthermore, the branch pattern of nerves located in the skin was analysed and no abnormality was observed in mutant mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>). In addition, loss of dendritic complexity in humans has been linked to behavioural defects, autism and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Analysis of the <italic>Fam151b</italic><sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mutant mice in the ImPress protocols found no abnormal behavioural phenotype.</p>
<p id="Par23">Given the strong statistical significance of profile comparisons (HHpred), and the concordance of known and predicted secondary structures and conserved active site residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), we have shown that the FAM151 proteins are members of the PLC-like phosphodiesterase superfamily of enzymes. However, the remarkable substrate diversity of its phosphodiesterase homologues, means our computational analysis is unable to predict the substrate of the FAM151 family. Ultimately, identification of substrates and products will enhance our understanding of dendritic branching in nematode and retinal maintenance in mammals.</p>

<title>Sequence analysis</title>
<p id="Par24">The computational protein sequence analysis began by performing a JackHMMER iterative search<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> beginning from the human FAM151B protein sequence, against the UniRef50 database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The FAM151 family is widely distributed in animals, including nematodes (<italic>C. elegans</italic>; UniProt: O45879) and hexapods (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>; UniProt: Q9VLU9). This reproduces the family phyletic distribution reported in Pfam (Family: DUF2181/PF10223)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Next, we took advantage of profile-versus-profile (HHpred)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> to search PDB70 database for more divergent FAM151 homologues using as input a profile generated from the multiple protein sequence alignment of FAM151 family. The PDB70 database contains profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) for representative sequences, clustered to 70% maximum pairwise sequence identity to reduce redundancy, drawn from the PDB (Protein Data Bank)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
