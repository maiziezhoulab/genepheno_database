<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The <italic>PCDH19</italic> gene (Xp22.1) encodes the cell-adhesion protein protocadherin-19 (PCDH19) and is responsible for a neurodevelopmental pathology characterized by female-limited epilepsy, cognitive impairment and autistic features, the pathogenic mechanisms of which remain to be elucidated. Here, we identified a new interaction between PCDH19 and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) alpha subunits in the rat brain. PCDH19 shRNA-mediated downregulation reduces GABA<sub>A</sub>R surface expression and affects the frequency and kinetics of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in cultured hippocampal neurons. <italic>In vivo</italic>, PCDH19 downregulation impairs migration, orientation and dendritic arborization of CA1 hippocampal neurons and increases rat seizure susceptibility. In sum, these data indicate a role for PCDH19 in GABAergic transmission as well as migration and morphological maturation of neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mutations in the <italic>PCDH19</italic> gene on chromosome X (Xp22.1) cause a female-limited epilepsy (PCDH19 Female Epilepsy, PCDH19-FE; OMIM # 300088) that is frequently associated with intellectual disability and autistic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B2">2</xref>). Since the discovery of its involvement in PCDH19-FE in 2008, <italic>PCDH19</italic> has rapidly become the second most clinically relevant gene in epilepsy after the Dravet syndrome causative gene SCN1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>PCDH19</italic> encodes protocadherin-19 (PCDH19), a calcium-dependent cell-adhesion molecule belonging to the non-clustered delta2-protocadherin subclass of the cadherin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B5">5</xref>). PCDH19 is composed of six conserved extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, a transmembrane region and an intracellular C-terminal tail with two conserved motifs, (CM)1 and CM2, specific for delta protocadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B6">6</xref>). To date, more than 100 inherited or <italic>de novo</italic> mutations have been reported, including point mutations and partial or whole-gene deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>PCDH19 has been shown to have a role in migration and neural circuit formation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B9">9</xref>) and to control the proliferation of neuronal progenitors in mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B10">10</xref>). Despite these findings, a comprehensive understanding of the biological function of <italic>PCDH19</italic> as well as its role in PCDH19-FE pathogenesis is lagging behind. Here, we report a new interaction between PCDH19 and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) in neurons, suggesting the involvement of PCDH19 in regulating GABAergic transmission.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning of the GABAergic system, and in particular in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R)-mediated transmission, is a common hallmark of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B12">12</xref>). Indeed, defects in GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents predispose the brain to seizures and might leave a permanent mark that will result in cognitive impairment and behavioral problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B13">13</xref>). GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are heteropentameric channels permeated by chloride and bicarbonate ions, composed of a combination of 19 subunits with different kinetics and pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B14">14</xref>). Typically, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are composed of 2 alpha, 2 beta and 1 gamma or delta subunits. Receptors composed of alpha 1–3 or alpha 5 together with beta and gamma subunits are mainly synaptic and mediate phasic inhibition, with the exception of extrasynaptic alpha 5-containing receptors. Conversely, receptors composed of alpha 4 or 6 subunits together with beta and delta subunits are extrasynaptic and mediate tonic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>While in the adult brain GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs mediate fast inhibitory transmission, in the immature brain GABA is depolarizing and mostly excitatory due to the high intracellular chloride concentration, and regulates neuronal proliferation, migration and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we found that PCDH19 binds the alpha subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub>R and regulates its surface availability and currents in cultured hippocampal neurons. <italic>In vivo</italic>, PCDH19 downregulation throughout embryonic development and the first postnatal week affects neuronal migration and morphological maturation and increases seizure susceptibility. Altogether, our findings highlight PCDH19 as a key modulator of GABAergic transmission and suggest new pathogenic mechanisms for PCDH19-FE.</p>

<title>PCDH19 interacts with GABA<sub>A</sub>R in neurons</title>
<p>Our study stems from the finding that PCDH19 is able to bind GABA<sub>A</sub>R both in heterologous cells and in rat neurons. Given the central role of GABA<sub>A</sub>R in epilepsy and comorbidities of neurodevelopmental disorders, we decided to investigate the PCDH19-GABA<sub>A</sub>R association in more detail.</p>
<p>We first observed the interaction in HEK293T cells expressing PCDH19 together with GABA<sub>A</sub>R alpha 1 subunit alone or together with beta 2 and gamma 2 subunits to allow the assembly of a pentameric receptor able to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and reach the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B14">14</xref>). Immunocytochemistry (ICC) experiments revealed PCDH19-alpha 1 colocalization, which was most evident in the perinuclear region, likely the ER, when alpha was the only overexpressed GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit, and in vesicle-like structures when alpha 1 was coexpressed with the other receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).

PCDH19-V5 colocalizes with alpha 1 subunit, especially in the perinuclear region when alpha 1 is expressed alone (middle panel and relative inset magnifications) and mostly in vesicle-like clusters when alpha 1 is expressed together with beta 2 and gamma 2 subunits (lower panel and magnifications).

</fig>
<p>Moreover, alpha 1 expressed alone or with beta 2 and gamma 2 subunits in HEK293T cells, coimmunoprecipitated with PCDH19 but not with delta protocadherin PCDH9, which shares CM1 and CM2 regions with PCDH19, ruling out the contribution of these conserved regions in mediating the GABA<sub>A</sub>R interaction. Consistently, a PCDH19 mutant without the distal portion of the intracellular tail containing CM1 and CM2 (PCDH19Δ879) still coimmunoprecipitated with alpha 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we measured the extent of colocalization of the endogenous proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F1">Fig. 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</xref>). Based on the analysis of ICC images, we estimated that approximately 30% of PCDH19 colocalized with alpha 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F1">Fig. 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</xref>). Finally, an anti-PCDH19 antibody coimmunoprecipitated alpha 1 both in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and in brain homogenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that PCDH19 and the GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit alpha 1 were associated in neurons.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>The PCDH19 C-terminus binds to a conserved region in the TM3–4 loop of GABA<sub>A</sub>R alpha subunits</title>
<p>To define the minimal region of interaction between PCDH19 and alpha 1, we performed a GST pull-down assay using selected protein domains fused to GST.</p>
<p>In particular, we tested the entire PCDH19 intracellular C-terminal tail (CT) and its proximal (CT1), distal (CT2) and central (CT3) region separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found that CT1 and CT3 in addition to CT, but not CT2, were able to pull-down alpha 1 either overexpressed in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) or endogenously expressed in rat brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These data further ruled out the involvement of the protocadherin conserved motifs CM1 and CM2 in mediating the GABA<sub>A</sub>R interaction and suggested the 128 amino acids shared by CT1 and CT3 (amino acids 763–890) as those sufficient to bind alpha 1. Taking into account the coimmunoprecipitation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), the interacting region might be further restricted to amino acids 763–879.

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="ddy019f2"></graphic>
</fig>
<p>Next, we repeated analogous experiments by focusing on the alpha 1 TM3–4 intracellular loop since this region mediates GABA<sub>A</sub>R intracellular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B14">14</xref>). We fused GST to the entire TM3–4 loop (TM) and to its three different fragments (TM-A, TM-B, TM-C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). GST-TM-A was sufficient to pull-down PCDH19-V5 overexpressed in HEK293T cells, so we further divided it in two (TM-A1 and TM-A2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) and identified TM-A1 (amino acids 334–343) as the minimal region mediating the PCDH19 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). The GST pull-down assay using rat brain confirmed these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>The TM-A1 sequence, corresponding to the first ten amino acids of the TM3–4 loop, is highly conserved in alpha subunits, especially in alpha 1–3 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F2">Fig. 2G</xref>, right panel). Therefore, we verified whether PCDH19 could also associate with these alpha subunits in rat brain homogenate from cortex and hippocampus. As expected, PCDH19 GST-CT pulled down alpha 1–3 and 5 and their associated beta (beta 1 and 3) and gamma (gamma 2) subunits. In addition to alpha 5, the delta subunit was also pulled down, suggesting that the PCDH19 association with GABA<sub>A</sub>R might involve both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F2">Fig. 2G</xref>, left panel).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that the PCDH19 CT domain upstream of CM1 was able to bind the first 10 conserved amino acids of alpha subunits TM3–4.</p>

<sec>
<title>The PCDH19 level affects GABA<sub>A</sub>R surface expression and currents</title>
<p>The interaction between PCDH19 and GABA<sub>A</sub>R prompted us to investigate the consequences of altered PCDH19 expression on the composition and functioning of GABAergic synapses.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we designed a short-hairpin (sh)RNA specific for PCDH19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1 A and B; Table S2</xref>). The shRNA and the human PCDH19 cDNA (PCDH19-V5), lentivirally expressed individually or in combination (rescue condition), allowed fine tuning of the PCDH19 expression level in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F3">Fig. 3A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S3</xref>). Hippocampal neurons cultured for one week [from days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) 1 to DIV8] in the presence of reduced or enhanced levels of PCDH19 showed altered expression of synaptic markers. Differences were observed in the inhibitory synaptic markers analysed, namely the GABA<sub>A</sub>R alpha 1 subunit, the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) enzymes GAD65/67 and the scaffolding protein of inhibitory synapses gephyrin. Changes in the expression of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA2/3 were not statistically significant. Neuronal cadherin (NCAD), which has been reported to interact with PCDH19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B16">16</xref>) and is expressed at both inhibitory and excitatory synapses early in synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B17">17</xref>), showed different expression levels only between the shRNA and overexpressed conditions. The effect of PCDH19 downregulation was most strongly observed on the GAD65/67 expression level, which was reduced, while PCDH19 overexpression enhanced the expression of all the inhibitory synaptic markers analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F3">Fig. 3B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Tables S3 and S4</xref>).

<p>The PCDH19 expression level affects inhibitory markers and surface GABA<sub>A</sub>R expression. (<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of cultured neurons infected at DIV1 with lentiviruses expressing PCDH19 control shRNA (Scramble), shRNA, PCDH19-V5 [at two different concentrations: 1X (1) and 2X (2), where the 1X concentration is sufficient to infect approximately 80-100% of cells], or shRNA plus PCDH19-V5 (Rescue1 and 2, according to the PCDH19-V5 virus concentration used, either 1X or 2X) and lysed at DIV8. Anti-PCDH19 detects both endogenous and lentivirally expressed protein, while anti-V5 detects exclusively the lentivirally expressed protein. Scramble and shRNA vectors express GFP protein. (<bold>B</bold>) Quantification of blots in (A) showing that PCDH19 and alpha 1 levels, normalized on GAPDH, vary accordingly (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S3</xref>).

PCDH19 overexpression increases inhibitory markers expression with respect to the control condition, but not NCAD and GluA2/3 expression. GAD65/67 expression was significantly reduced by PCDH19 shRNA (one-way ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey’s test, *<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05, **<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01, ***<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S4</xref>).

<graphic xlink:href="ddy019f3"></graphic>
</fig>
<p>In neurons infected later and for a shorter period (4 days, from DIV8 to DIV12), we detected no significant changes in the total amount of GABA<sub>A</sub>R alpha 1, but PCDH19 down- or upregulation still bidirectionally modulated the surface levels of alpha 1. Consistently with the PCDH19 binding capability evaluated by GST pull-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F2">Fig. 2G</xref>), similar results were obtained for the GABA<sub>A</sub>R alpha 2 subunit. However, while PCDH19 downregulation reduced surface alpha 1 by nearly 70%, it reduced alpha 2 by approximately 45% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F3">Fig. 3D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the functional consequences of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R decrease on the neuronal surface, we measured miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) from neurons transfected with scramble, shRNA and shRNA plus PCDH19-V5 (Rescue). Notably, mIPSCs of shRNA-expressing neurons were less frequent and slower, as inferred from the increased decay time and area. The rescue condition restored mIPSC parameters to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S6</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Although mIPSC frequency changes might be due to both pre- and post-synaptic defects, we could ascribe the observed phenotype to the post-synapse, as we recorded transfected neurons innervated mainly by untransfected PCDH19-positive cells due to the low efficiency of the calcium phosphate method. Furthermore, a reduced frequency of mIPSCs was consistent with less GABA<sub>A</sub>R on the cell surface and at synapses, as suggested by the biotinylation assays. The slowing down of kinetic currents following PCDH19 downregulation suggested an altered composition of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. In particular, mIPSC prolongation occurs in the absence of the alpha 1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, our data indicate that the molecular composition of GABAergic synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons is affected by the PCDH19 expression level and disclose a role for PCDH19 in regulating the surface availability of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and most likely their subunit composition.</p>

<p>To infer how the PCDH19 mutation might impact the functions of the GABAergic system <italic>in vivo</italic> during development, we first investigated the temporal expression of PCDH19 in rat brain. In both cortex and hippocampus, where PCDH19 is highly expressed, PCDH19 protein level was significantly higher at postnatal day (P)10 compared with the adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F5">Fig. 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S7</xref>). In particular, a time course in hippocampus from embryonic day (E)18 to P35 revealed a gradual increase in PCDH19 that peaked around the first postnatal week and successively declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F5">Fig. 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S8</xref>). At P10, PCDH19 protein was detectable in the pyramidal neurons of CA1 and CA3 regions, but at reduced levels in the dentate gyrus (DG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F5">Fig. 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</xref>), consistent with previously reported PCDH19 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B20">20</xref>).

<p>The rising phase of PCDH19 expression temporally overlaps with the migration and morphological maturation of hippocampal neurons, which relay on GABAergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B21">21</xref>). Thus, if PCDH19 is required for GABAergic transmission during hippocampal development <italic>in vivo</italic>, PCDH19 loss of function might impair these processes. To verify this hypothesis, we delivered PCDH19 shRNAs together with GFP into the hippocampus of E17.5 rat embryos via <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (IUE), and analysed transfected pyramidal neurons at P7. Compared with neurons from control rats expressing GFP alone, approximately 7% of shRNA-expressing CA1 neurons displayed ectopic localization, indicating altered migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S9</xref>). Furthermore, PCDH19 downregulation affected neuronal arborization, as inferred from the reduction of total dendritic length and increased proportion of basal dendrites at the expense of apical ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy019-F6">Fig. 6C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S9</xref>).

<sec>
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we disclose a previously unknown role of PCDH19 in regulating GABAergic transmission in an attempt to provide insights into the phenotype of PCDH19-FE, characterized by epilepsy and intellectual disability.</p>
<p>We started by characterizing a newly identified interaction between PCDH19 and the alpha subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub>R. Based on our colocalization analysis, and in accordance with other protocadherins’ expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B24">24–26</xref>), PCDH19 does not appear to be a constitutive component of the GABAergic synapses nor an ubiquitous binding-partner of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. However, GST pull-down assays indicate that PCDH19 associates with different alpha subunits, suggesting that PCDH19 is able to bind heterogeneous GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, located both at synapses and at extrasynaptic sites. Since another protocadherin, Pcdh-γC5, has been previously reported to interact with the GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit gamma 2 and to stabilize some GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B27">27</xref>), it is possible that different protocadherins might interact with specific pools of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and differentially modulate GABAergic transmission.</p>
<p>Despite PCDH19-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs partial colocalization, the modulation of PCDH19 expression levels affected the composition and functioning of GABAergic synapses.</p>
<p>In particular, our data suggest that PCDH19 exerts a pro-wiring effect in neurons during the first week of <italic>in vitro</italic> development, as inferred from the expression of pre- and postsynaptic inhibitory markers. At a later time point (DIV8–12), PCDH19 downregulation or overexpression bidirectionally affected the surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>R alpha subunits, especially alpha 1, possibly by regulating GABA<sub>A</sub>R intracellular trafficking. Consistently, neurons in which PCDH19 has been downregulated, displayed mIPSCs with reduced frequency and slower decay kinetic, which is a hallmark of synapses lacking alpha 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B19">19</xref>). Alpha 1 depletion at synapses is expected to change the pharmacological properties of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs because this subunit is responsible for their enhanced sensitivity to neurosteroids and benzodiazepines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B29">29</xref>). Interestingly, it has been proposed that deficiency of neurosteroids may contribute to PCDH19-FE etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B30">30</xref>) and the treatment with ganaxolone, a synthetic analog of allopregnanolone, was able to reduce seizure in PCDH19-FE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B31">31</xref>). Based on our data, we hypothesize that PCDH19-FE syndrome might be due, not only to a deficiency of positive modulators of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R, i.e. of neurosteroids, but also to a defect of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R itself. Furthermore, the recruitment of the alpha 1 subunit at synapses in early postnatal life promotes a more precise setting of the temporal window for input integration and neuronal network synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B32">32–34</xref>). Hence, the reduction of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, especially those containing alpha 1, might alter neuronal circuit formation during brain development.</p>
<p>The highest expression levels of PCDH19 in rats extend from the perinatal period to approximately puberty (P32–35), with a peak around the first postnatal week. In this period, the GABA neurotransmitter exerts a trophic influence on developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B12">12</xref>). Thus, we verified whether PCDH19 downregulation <italic>in vivo</italic>, from the late embryonic development to the first postnatal week, might compromise neuronal migration and arborization.</p>
<p>PCDH19 has been previously shown to impair cell migration in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B35">35</xref>) and to enhance the migration of neuronal progenitors <italic>in vitro</italic>, even though no gross morphological defects were observed in the PCDH19 knockout (KO) mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B36">36</xref>). In addition, cortical malformations have been recently identified in epileptic patients with <italic>PCDH19</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B23">23</xref>). Concerning neuronal arborization, protocadherins are emerging as key regulators of dendrites development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B37">37</xref>), and PCDH19 harbors a putative binding site for the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) that controls actin cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B38">38</xref>). Even though layer Va cortical neurons of the PCDH19 KO mouse display normal neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B26">26</xref>), neurons of other brain regions were not analysed. Our data from IUE experiments support the involvement of PCDH19 in both the migration and dendritic branching of the CA1 hippocampal neurons. Indeed, a significant proportion of PCDH19 shRNA-expressing neurons displayed an ectopic location and their dendrites exhibited an altered spatial orientation and reduced arborization. Notably, these structural defects were associated with an increased susceptibility to pharmacologically induced seizures, indicating enhanced excitability of the neuronal network.</p>
<p>Altogether, these structural and functional defects might be ascribed to an altered functioning of the GABAergic system, especially with consideration of the ability of PCDH19 to associate with both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, these last being responsible for the trophic action of GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B12">12</xref>). However, it is likely that more than one mechanism contributes to the phenotype observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. In particular, both the homophilic trans adhesive properties of PCDH19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B5">5</xref>) and its interaction with cytoskeleton regulators such as the WRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B38">38</xref>) must be taken into account, since they provide additional mechanisms to drive neuronal migration and development. Hence, the next challenge will be to unravel the impact of PCDH19 loss of function on cellular adhesion, cytoskeleton dynamics and GABAergic signaling, and consequently the relative contribution of these pathways in the development of neuronal circuits and in PCDH19-FE etiology.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the newly reported role of PCDH19 in regulating GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated currents is expected to impact both on the developmental processes that rely on GABAergic transmission and on the inhibitory/excitatory balance of the brain, and provides a new pathogenic mechanism for the PCDH19-FE syndrome.</p>

<p>IUE was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy019-B44">44</xref>). Briefly, E17.5 timed-pregnant Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan Italy SRL) were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction, 3.5%; surgery, 2.5%), and the uterine horns were exposed by laparotomy. DNA [4–6 μg/μl in water; pRNAT-U6.3/Hygro empty vector (Control), PCDH19 shRNA (shRNA), or shRNA plus PCDH19-V5 (Rescue)] together with the dye Fast Green (0.3 mg/ml; Sigma) was injected (5–6 μl) through the uterine wall into the lateral ventricles of each embryo. After injection, the head of the embryo was placed between two tweezer-type circular electrodes and an additional third one. For the electroporation protocol, five electrical pulses (amplitude, 50 V; duration, 50 ms; intervals, 150 ms) were delivered with a square-wave electroporation generator (CUY21EDIT; Nepa Gene). After electroporation, the uterine horns were returned into the dam’s abdominal cavity, and normal embryos development was resumed. For the PTZ seizure test, P7 pups were separated from the mother and placed in experimental boxes after intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 25 mg/kg). The injection was repeated every 10 min until the appearance of the first tonic-clonic seizure.</p>

<title>Acquisition and analysis of confocal and neurolucida images from brain slices</title>
<p>Brains from P7 pups were fixed by transcardial perfusion of 4% PFA in PBS. Fixed samples were cryopreserved in 30% sucrose. Brains were then frozen and sectioned coronally into 80-μm-thick slices using a microtome-refrigerator (Microm HM 450 Sliding Microtome equipped with Freezing Unit, Thermo Scientific, Italy). For migration analysis, images from the coronal sections were counterstained with Hoechst and acquired on a confocal laser-scanning microscope (TCS SP5; Leica Microsystems, Italy) equipped with a 10X immersion objective [numerical aperture (NA) 0.3]. Confocal images (15-µm-thick Z-stacks) were acquired, and Z-series were projected into two-dimensional representations. The contrast of the images was adjusted to enhance the fluorescence of the cell bodies while attenuating the signal from neuronal processes to facilitate cell counting. For high-magnification images of cell morphology, 50-μm-thick Z-stacks from the CA1 region were acquired with a 63X immersion objective (NA 1.4), and Z-series were projected into two-dimensional representations. Cell reconstructions were performed with Adobe Photoshop CS6 software. To quantify the dendrites, two-three confocal images/slice were acquired. To quantify cell processes, high-magnification images of cells were analysed with the NeuronJ plugin of the ImageJ software. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 20-μm-thick brain slices. For details regarding the IHC staining and image acquisition and processing, see supplementary experimental procedures.</p>
