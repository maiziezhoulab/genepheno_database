<p id="Par1">Urine contains extracellular RNA (exRNA) markers of urogenital cancers. However, the capacity of genetic material in urine to identify systemic diseases is unknown. Here we describe exRNA splice products in human urine as a source of biomarkers for the two most common forms of muscular dystrophies, myotonic dystrophy (DM) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Using a training set, RT-PCR, droplet digital PCR, and principal component regression, we identify ten transcripts that are spliced differently in urine exRNA from patients with DM type 1 (DM1) as compared to unaffected or disease controls, form a composite biomarker, and develop a predictive model that is 100% accurate in our independent validation set. Urine also contains mutation-specific <italic>DMD</italic> mRNAs that confirm exon-skipping activity of the antisense oligonucleotide drug eteplirsen. Our results establish that urine mRNA splice variants can be used to monitor systemic diseases with minimal or no clinical effect on the urinary tract.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Pre-mRNA splicing occurs when introns are removed to generate a protein-coding message, while alternative splicing involves inclusion or exclusion of certain exons to code for different protein isoforms from the same gene. These splice variants are a fundamental process of nature that increase biodiversity, mainly in eukaryotes. Mis-regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing is found in a number of neurologic and neuromuscular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. For example, in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), an expanded CUG repeat (CUG<sup>exp</sup>) in the 3′ UTR of the <italic>DM Protein Kinase</italic> (<italic>DMPK</italic>) transcript disrupts splicing regulator proteins in the muscleblind-like (MBNL) family, causing abnormal splicing of a number of pre-mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In DM1 patients, pre-mRNA splicing outcomes in muscle biopsies are used as biomarkers of disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, while in DM1 mice they also have served as sensitive indicators of therapeutic drug activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Less invasive biomarkers to assess disease state and response to therapy in DM1 are currently unavailable, and optimal outcome measures of therapeutic success remain undefined. As a result, a recent clinical trial of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drug for DM1 required participants’ consent to multiple muscle biopsies to monitor splicing outcomes in response to therapy and was restricted to adult patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This experimental drug for DM1 is designed to induce knockdown of <italic>DMPK</italic>-CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts through the RNase H pathway, thereby rescuing muscle cells from the pathogenic effects of splicing mis-regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Extracellular vesicles (EVs) include exosomes, microparticles/microvesicles (MVs), and other membrane-encased particles released and taken up by cells as a form of extracellular communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. EVs in serum and urine contain mRNA and non-coding RNAs, including microRNA (miRNA), collectively termed extracellular RNAs (exRNAs), which are released from different tissues and can serve as genetic biomarkers of cancers and other disease states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Mutations, deletions, translocations, and transcriptome variations also have been shown extensively in EVs, especially for cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Differentiated skeletal muscle cells in culture release EVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and a handful of miRNA biomarkers and several protein signatures have been identified in serum of muscular dystrophy (MD) patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, the capacity of muscle-derived exRNA in urine to serve as biomarkers for MDs seems unlikely given that they would be released into the blood circulation and would be unable to pass through the glomerular filtration system of the kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Here we examine whether RNA splice products in human blood or urine could meet sensitivity and specificity criteria as robust biomarkers of disease activity and/or therapeutic target engagement for MDs.</p>

<title>Characterization of exRNA in biofluids from DM1 and unaffected (UA) control subjects</title>
<p id="Par5">To examine the possibility of detecting biomarkers of MDs in human biofluids, we analyzed exRNA microarray and raw sequencing data from two previous studies and found that more than 30 transcripts previously reported as “splicing biomarkers” in DM1 muscle biopsy tissue could be detected in control human serum and urine (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. To determine whether splice variants of these transcripts also are present in human biofluids, we collected urine, with or without blood, samples from 40 subjects with DM1 and 29 unaffected (UA) controls (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). First, we removed cells from biofluid samples by low-speed centrifugation followed by passage of the supernatant through a 0.8 µm filter. Using particle-tracking analysis to characterize extracellular vesicles in cell-free biofluids, we found that particle content was greater in serum than urine, and showed no difference in number or size between DM1 and controls (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Conversely, mean particle size was greater, and spanned a larger range, in urine than serum in both DM1 and UA controls (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The mean particle size of ~75 nm that we observed in serum is in the range of exosomes (30–100 nm), while the mean urine particle size of 130–140 nm is in the range of microparticles (100–1000 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Optical density curves of exRNA isolated from particles, and the 260/280 nm absorbance ratios, appeared similar in DM1 and UA controls in both urine and serum (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). exRNA quality and size distribution also appeared similar in DM1 and UA controls in both urine and serum by capillary gel electrophoresis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par6">To estimate exRNA concentrations obtained from urine and serum samples, we used two separate methods. Measurements by microvolume spectrophotometry appeared similar in DM1 and UA urine and serum samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). By contrast, using capillary gel electrophoresis, mean exRNA concentrations in DM1 urine samples appeared significantly higher than in UA urine samples, and also significantly higher in DM1 urine than in DM1 or UA serum samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Capillary gel electrophoresis measurements of RNA concentration were lower in urine and serum of both groups than measurements of identical samples using microvolume spectrophotometry, being about 1/3 lower in DM1 urine samples, and an order of magnitude lower in UA urine, and in DM1 and UA serum samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Similarly, microvolume spectrophotometry estimations of the exRNA mass recovered per milliliter of biofluid (exRNA yield) were significantly higher in serum than in urine for both DM1 and UA groups, and showed no difference between DM1 and UA groups in either urine or serum samples, while capillary gel electrophoresis measurements indicated that exRNA recovery tended to be higher in DM1 urine samples than in UA (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par7">Due to the disagreement between measurements using these two methods, we correlated exRNA concentrations determined by microvolume spectrophotometry or capillary gel electrophoresis with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) measurements of a reference gene <italic>General Transcription Factor 2B</italic> (<italic>GTF2B</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, measured by copies of <italic>GTF2B</italic> transcripts per microliter of cDNA that was made using the same exRNA sample measured by each method. Microvolume spectrophotometry estimations of exRNA concentration showed no correlation with <italic>GTF2B</italic> values, while capillary gel electrophoresis estimations showed good correlation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantitative gene expression in biofluids from DM1 and UA controls</title>
<p id="Par8">Urine contains RNA from two broad categories: (1) exRNA released by cells lining the urinary tract, including the kidney, bladder, and urothelial (transitional epithelial) cells that line the inside of the ureters and proximal urethra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and (2) RNA contained inside of cells normally present in the urine, including small numbers of erythrocytes (0–2/high power field [HPF]) and leukocytes (0–2/HPF), exfoliated renal tubular cells, urothelial cells, and squamous epithelial cells, and recently described “urine stem cells”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), we analyzed <italic>DMPK</italic> gene expression in exRNA from urine and serum, and in total RNA from urine cells. <italic>DMPK</italic> content, as measured by copies per microliter of input cDNA, appeared similar between DM1 and UA subjects in both sources of urine RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). However, in urine exRNA, expression of the reference gene <italic>GTF2B</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> tended to be higher in DM1 as compared to UA subjects, and normalization of <italic>DMPK</italic> expression to <italic>GTF2B</italic> in urine exRNA revealed <italic>DMPK</italic> levels in DM1 patients about half that in the UA group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>). By contrast, <italic>GTF2B</italic> levels in urine cell total RNA showed no difference between DM1 and UA groups, and normalized DMPK expression was similar in these groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>). In serum, <italic>DMPK</italic> and <italic>GTF2B</italic> were expressed at similar levels in DM1 and UA subjects, and in both groups were present at levels nearly an order of magnitude lower than in urine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a–c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><italic>DMPK</italic> gene expression in human urine and serum.

<p id="Par9">Normalized <italic>DMPK</italic> expression in urine exRNA of UA subjects appeared most similar to that in total RNA from normal human kidney tissue and urothelial cells, and approximately threefold lower than in bladder, and an order of magnitude lower than in skeletal muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Using a second quantitative PCR method, Taqman qPCR, <italic>DMPK</italic> mRNA expression normalized to <italic>GTF2B</italic>, or to a second reference gene, <italic>Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase</italic> (<italic>GAPDH</italic>), also appeared significantly lower in urine exRNA of DM1 patients than UA subjects, and appeared similar in serum exRNA from both groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).</p>

<title>Alternative mRNA splice variants in biofluid exRNA and total RNA from urine cells</title>
<p id="Par10">Next we analyzed alternative splicing patterns in urine exRNA of DM1, UA controls, and 15 individuals with mutations in the dystrophin (<italic>DMD</italic>, in italics) gene as muscular dystrophy controls (<italic>N</italic> = 12 Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD, no italics], 3 non-ambulatory Becker muscular dystrophy [BMD]; Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), focusing on transcripts previously reported as biomarkers of DM1 disease severity in muscle biopsies (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. We examined 33 alternative splice events and found 10 that are different in urine exRNA of DM1 patients as compared to subjects with <italic>DMD</italic> gene mutations or UA individuals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>), while the remaining 23 splice events appeared similar in DM1 and UA groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).

<title>Composite splicing biomarker and predictive modeling for DM1</title>
<p id="Par12">To increase statistical power, several individual biomarkers can be combined to reach a single interpretive readout known as a composite biomarker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par14">A consideration in the evaluation of a biomarker is the accuracy of the measuring technique.

<title>Splicing outcomes related to symptom onset and clinical measures of severity</title>

Splicing patterns in muscle biopsies of congenital, childhood, or juvenile-onset DM1 patients are poorly characterized, due in large part to the need for general anesthesia to perform biopsies in children, combined with the wide availability of genetic testing in the United States and many other countries, rendering biopsies unnecessary for diagnosis. Of the 39 DM1 urine exRNA samples that we analyzed by ddPCR, <italic>N</italic> = 4 were congenital, <italic>N</italic> = 9 childhood or juvenile-onset, <italic>N</italic> = 23 adult-onset, and <italic>N</italic> = 3 were from asymptomatic individuals that never sought medical care for DM1 until after they were found to have a CTG repeat expansion by genetic testing that was performed as a result of a younger, symptomatic family member having been diagnosed.

<title>Personalized DMD deletion transcripts and confirmation of ASO exon skipping activity in human urine</title>
<p id="Par28">ASOs also are being evaluated therapeutically for DMD, typically for individuals with frame-shifting deletions of the <italic>DMD</italic> gene. The treatment strategy involves direct modification of dystrophin pre-mRNA splicing by inducing removal, or skipping, of a target exon to restore the open reading frame and produce an internally truncated, partially functional dystrophin protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Detection of ASO drug activity in DMD patients involves multiple muscle biopsies to examine whether the target exon has been removed from the mRNA, and quantification of dystrophin protein production by immunofluorescence and western blotting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. To determine whether <italic>DMD</italic> deletion transcripts could be identified in biofluid, we examined urine exRNA from six therapy-naive subjects with DMD and found patient-specific deletion transcripts that correspond to the specific gene deletion in all six (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par29">To examine the possibility that biofluid exRNA may be a viable pharmacodynamic biomarker to monitor therapeutic drug target engagement in DMD patients, we examined urine RNA from an individual with an exon 45–50 deletion in the <italic>DMD</italic> gene who is being treated with eteplirsen, the exon-skipping ASO that was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. This individual is non-ambulatory and began receiving the ASO in December 2014 as a participant in an open-label safety and tolerability clinical trial of eteplirsen in advanced DMD. Due to accelerated approval of eteplirsen, he has continued receiving weekly infusions of the drug after the clinical trial primary completion date of April 2017. He has never had a muscle biopsy, and pharmacological activity of eteplirsen in this individual had never been established. In lieu of a muscle biopsy, we collected a urine “liquid biopsy” to determine whether splice products in urine mRNA could confirm ASO target engagement. Qualitative end point RT-PCR analysis of urine exRNA and total RNA in urine cells using primers spanning exon 51, the therapeutic target of eteplirsen, demonstrated predominance of a small PCR product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10a</xref>). Sequencing of this PCR product identified a transition from DMD exon 44 directly to exon 52, confirming absence of exon 51 in both urine exRNA and total RNA from urine cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10b</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par32">Our results demonstrate that mRNA splicing patterns in urine present a rich source of personalized biomarkers with applications to a number of genetic diseases. For DM1, we find ten alternative splice variants in urine exRNA that combine to serve as a robust composite biomarker of DM1 disease activity that is far more powerful than any single splice event. This is significant because mis-regulated alternative splicing outcomes in muscle tissue also serve as sensitive indicators of disease activity in DM1 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and therapeutic response in DM1 mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Indeed, splice products in muscle biopsies, an invasive procedure, were used in a recent clinical trial as measures of ASO activity in DM1 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We propose that our ddPCR-based splicing biomarkers in urine exRNA have the potential to identify drug target engagement in upcoming clinical trials for DM1, initially as a pre-treatment baseline measurement, followed by monitoring during the course of treatment, with the expectation that pharmacological activity should be detected as a shift in the composite splicing pattern.</p>
<p id="Par33">Because DM1 is primarily a disease of skeletal muscle, heart, and the central nervous system (CNS), and these tissues release EVs, it is counter-intuitive that exRNA reflecting the characteristic mis-regulated splicing events in DM1 would appear in urine rather than in blood, as exRNA has not been shown to pass from the blood through the proximal tubules of the kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This suggests that the source of exRNA in these biofluids is likely to be different, and that the primary source in serum is unlikely to be muscle tissue. The fact that the presence of <italic>DMPK</italic> transcripts is an order of magnitude lower in serum than in urine exRNA suggests that the cells contributing to the serum exRNA pool may be primarily those that are unaffected in DM1 patients due to low expression of <italic>DMPK</italic>, thereby explaining the similarity of serum splicing patterns in DM1 and UA subjects. The ~50% lower expression of <italic>DMPK</italic> in urine exRNA of DM1 vs. UA subjects may be due to retention of mutant CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts in the nucleus, thereby preventing their release into the cytoplasm and incorporation into EVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par34">For biomarker development, an advantage of exRNA over total RNA from urine cells includes greater stability of exRNA due to encasement within membrane-bound vesicles that serve as protection of contents against RNases. In fact, a previous study found that RNA recovery was maintained even after storage of urine for up to 30 days at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, suggesting that urine specimens could be analyzed in a central location for exRNA biomarkers to achieve optimal assay reliability. By contrast, due to limited viability of urine cells in voided urine specimens, efficient recovery of RNA from urine cells would require each site or laboratory that collects urine specimens to isolate RNA immediately, introducing variability into the assay. In this study, we also found an important difference of splice patterns in the urine exRNA pool, as compared to those in total RNA from urine cells, indicating that the source of these two RNA populations is distinct, but also suggesting that urine cells have the potential to serve as a second biomarker source complementary to urine exRNA.</p>
<p id="Par35">For DMD, the urine splice products are more than traditional biomarkers: they also can serve as personalized genetic markers designed specifically for each individual patient and enable the possibility to monitor splice-shifting activity of ASOs. Our finding of ASO-dependent exon-skipping activity in urine exRNA and urine cell total RNA provides the first non-invasive measurement of eteplirsen target engagement, and suggests that our urine biomarkers have the potential to facilitate development of novel ASOs that can outperform eteplirsen or target new exons in DMD. At this point, it is unlikely that an RNA-based assay will eliminate the need for muscle biopsies, as dystrophin protein measurement was used as a surrogate marker of drug effect that led to the accelerated approval of eteplirsen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. However, ddPCR-based monitoring of skipped/unskipped <italic>DMD</italic> splice products in urine during the course of treatment may complement splicing analysis of muscle biopsies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> as newer and better splice-shifting drugs are developed. Long term, it will be important to correlate these early indicators of drug target engagement with imaging, compositional, and functional outcome measures to determine whether a drug that is working on a molecular level also is having a therapeutic benefit.</p>

<p id="Par36">The Partners Health Service/Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) IRB approved all studies involving human subjects described here. For this study, Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) ceded review to the Partners/MGH IRB. We recruited study participants from the MGH Neuromuscular Diagnostic Center and the Neuromuscular Clinic at BCH. Three groups were studied: individuals with DM1 (<italic>N</italic> = 40), a muscular dystrophy due to a mutation in the DMD gene (<italic>N</italic> = 17 total; 14 with Duchenne phenotype, 3 with Becker phenotype), and with no known muscular dystrophy (unaffected [UA]; <italic>N</italic> = 29) that were either a parent, spouse, or cousin of a study participant with muscular dystrophy. Inclusion criteria for DM1 subjects were age 5 years or older, a diagnosis of DM1 based on genetic testing that identified a <italic>DMPK</italic>-CTG repeat expansion of ≥50, or clinical diagnosis of DM1 and a first-degree relative with DM1 due to a <italic>DMPK</italic>-CTG repeat expansion of ≥50, and ability to provide informed consent or assent for participation. Inclusion criteria for subjects with <italic>DMD</italic> mutations included age 5 years or older, known diagnosis of DMD or BMD, and ability to provide informed consent or assent. Inclusion criteria for unaffected individuals were age 18 years or older, no known history of any muscular dystrophy, and ability to provide informed consent. Prior to participation in the study, we obtained informed consent for blood and/or urine collection from all subjects; due to severe autism, informed consent for one individual with BMD was obtained from his mother/legal guardian, according to IRB protocol.

<title>Collection and processing of human urine</title>
<p id="Par37">Subjects donated urine (approximate range from 14 to 120 milliliters) in a standard specimen container. This was a novel study and we had no reference point for the optimal urine volume that would enable accurate measurement of our target splice products. Therefore, to maximize total exRNA recovery from each specimen, we processed the entire volume that was collected. To help minimize potential confounding factors, samples from DM1, DMD/BMD, and UA subjects were collected in parallel, often being collected, processed, and analyzed simultaneously. In all but one case, UA samples were processed on the same day at the same time with one or more DM1 and/or DMD/BMD sample. Collection and processing of all samples was identical, and the same lab performed RNA isolation, gene expression studies, and splicing analyses for all samples. To remove urine cells, we centrifuged the entire volume at 2450 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at room temperature, passed the supernatant through a 0.8-μm filter into sterile 50 ml tubes, examined specimens using urinalysis strips (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), and placed on wet ice within 2 h of collection. We proceeded with exRNA isolation from cell-free specimens either immediately or after storage at 4 °C overnight.

We used the same methods to combine the ddPCR splicing outcomes of the five transcripts in urine exRNA shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref> (<italic>INSR</italic>, <italic>MBNL2</italic>, <italic>MBNL1</italic>, <italic>CLASP1</italic>, and <italic>MAP3K4</italic>), and four transcripts in urine cells shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref> (<italic>INSR</italic>, <italic>MBNL2</italic>, <italic>MBNL1</italic>, and <italic>CLASP1</italic>) to form ddPCR-based composite biomarker scores (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>).</p>

<title>Predictive model</title>
<p id="Par49">We randomly assigned 75% of the first 45 subjects (<italic>N</italic> = 23 DM1, 22 UA) to a training set that consisted of 17 subjects with DM1 and 17 unaffected controls (34/45)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The remaining 25% of these subjects (<italic>N</italic> = 6 DM1, 5 UA) formed an independent validation set. We used principal component regression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> to develop a predictive model of DM1. Only the first principal component was used for prediction. The pls package in R, which uses a singular value decomposition algorithm to compute the principal components, was used to implement the model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. A threshold of 0.5 was chosen for model fitting, such that values above threshold were DM1 and values below threshold UA. A fivefold cross validation test produced zero false positives and false negatives. After development and validation of the model, we then implemented it to examine composite splicing data from each of the next 17 consecutive subjects that were enrolled in the study. Including the 11 subjects in the validation set (<italic>N</italic> = 6 DM1, 5 UA) that were used for model development and the 19 subjects that were tested after model implementation (<italic>N</italic> = 13 DM1, 6 UA), a total of <italic>N</italic> = 30 subjects were evaluated using the model.</p>
