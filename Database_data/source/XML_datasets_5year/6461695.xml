<p id="Par1">Ten-eleven-translocation (TET) proteins catalyze DNA hydroxylation, playing an important role in demethylation of DNA in mammals. Remarkably, although hydroxymethylation levels are high in the mouse brain, the potential role of TET proteins in adult neurogenesis is unknown. We show here that a non-catalytic action of TET3 is essentially required for the maintenance of the neural stem cell (NSC) pool in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) niche by preventing premature differentiation of NSCs into non-neurogenic astrocytes.

The study also identifies BMP2 as an effector of the astrocytic terminal differentiation mediated by SNRPN.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">In the mammalian brain two regions generate new neurons throughout adulthood: the subventricular zone (SVZ) in the walls of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The process of neurogenesis in these adult neurogenic niches is continually sustained by the activity of neural stem cells (NSCs) which are characterized by their ability to balance self-renewal with multipotential differentiation into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. NSCs are lineage-related to radial glial cells, therefore, they exhibit astrocytic characteristics, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+filaments or astrocyte-specific glutamate aspartate transporters (GLAST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. NSCs also express the transcription factor <italic>Sox2</italic> (Sry-related HMG box 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In the SVZ in particular, NSCs also known as type B cells have a long basal process contacting blood vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and extend an apical process ending in a primary cilium that protrudes into the ventricle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The walls of the lateral ventricles thus show a typical organization where the apical process of type B cells are surrounded by a rosette of epithelial ependymal cells forming structures known as pinwheels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Activated and quiescent NSCs appear to coexist in the SVZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Once activated, NSCs give rise to transit-amplifying progenitors or type C-cells, which in turn, generate neuroblasts, or type A-cells. These cells migrate anteriorly forming the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb (OB), where they mature into functional neurons involved in olfactory discrimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Subventricular NSCs are also capable of producing some oligodendroblasts that migrate to the <italic>corpus callosum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Signaling between NSCs and other cells of their microenvironment or niche is critical for adult neurogenesis, through its interaction with NSCs intrinsic programs of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Spatial and temporal gene regulation of gene expression in NSCs is established and maintained by the coordinated interaction between transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. Most mammalian genes are expressed from both maternally and paternally inherited chromosomal homologs. In contrast, imprinted genes are expressed from one parental copy only and the gene copy inherited from the other progenitor remains repressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Their monoallelic expression makes these <italic>loci</italic> very vulnerable as mutation or deregulation of the sole expressed allele can compromise expression and lead to severe developmental defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we have previously shown that selective absence of imprinting can occur in particular lineages to modulate the dosage of imprinted genes for cell-specific functions in physiological contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These context-dependent changes may be important for cell plasticity during normal development and tissue regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Indeed, we have previously described that in the SVZ the paternally expressed gene Delta-like homolog 1 (<italic>Dlk1</italic>), an atypical Notch ligand, plays a relevant function in postnatal neurogenesis. <italic>Dlk1</italic> is canonically imprinted elsewhere in the brain, however, it shows a selective absence of imprinting in subventricular NSCs with biallelic expression being required for stem cell maintenance and, ultimately, neurogenesis to the OB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Another imprinted gene, the Insulin-like growth factor2 (<italic>Igf2</italic>), which is canonically expressed from the paternally inherited allele, is biallelically expressed in the choroid plexus resulting in a higher dose of IG2 secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid to regulate NSC proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, determining how imprinted genes operate in concert with signaling cues, as well as discovering the factors that modify methylation at imprinted regions in adult NSCs of different neurogenic niches, will lead to a better understanding of adult neurogenesis.</p>
<p id="Par5">Genomic imprinting is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, in particular DNA methylation imprints, that establish and maintain parental identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Epigenetic mechanisms are heritable modifications to DNA and chromatin, that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence itself, but which can modulate gene expression and genome function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, epigenetic regulation involves chemical modifications to DNA such as methylation and hydroxymethylation, and to the histone proteins around which the DNA is wrapped, having a relevant role in neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of enzymes have been found to play an important role in passive replication-dependent and active demethylation of DNA in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. These processes can involve the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) intermediates that are produced by the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In mammals, three members of the TET family have been identified: TET1, TET2, and TET3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Loss of TET enzymes revealed promoter hypermethylation and deregulation of genes implicated in embryonic development and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Specifically, elimination of <italic>Tet3</italic> results in defects in neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In line with this, while <italic>Tet3</italic> knockout ESCs can be successfully induced to neural progenitors, they undergo rapid apoptosis and show greatly compromised terminal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">TET proteins have been implicated in maintaining DNA methylation at imprinted regions during the germline resetting of genomic imprints and in embryonic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, whether TET proteins can also be involved in the modulation of DNA imprints in adult NSCs has not been established. In addition to the well-described catalytic activity of TET proteins, the preferential binding of TET proteins at 5mC-free promoters and their interaction with histone deacetylases, acetyltransferases, Polycomb repressive complex 2, and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase to regulate gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, suggest additional potential functions independent of its catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This possibility is supported by the demonstration that non-catalytic forms of TET are able to rescue the proliferative phenotype of <italic>Tet2</italic> knockout cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Moreover, overexpression of TET1 or a catalytically inactive mutant in the mouse hippocampus results in the upregulation of several neuronal memory-associated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, further supporting non-conventional functions of TET proteins.</p>
<p id="Par7">There are many intriguing questions concerning the role of genomic imprinting and gene dosage during the neurogenesis process. Here we demonstrate a function for the non-catalytic form of TET3 in the maintenance of adult NSC state by preventing the differentiation of type B cells into non-neurogenic astrocytes. The mechanism involves direct binding and repression of TET3 to the imprinted gene <italic>Snrpn</italic>. We also show that astrocytic differentiation of adult NSCs in response to <italic>Snrpn</italic> deregulation involves increased production of BMP2. Our study provides important new insights into the role of TET3 in neurogenesis and emphasizes the importance of correct regulation of imprinted genes in the neurogenic niche.</p>

<p id="Par8">TET dioxygenases convert 5mC to 5hmC resulting in the removal of the methylated cytosine in somatic tissues, including the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) assays showed that <italic>Tet2 and Tet3</italic> were the most abundant members of the <italic>Tet</italic> dioxygenases in the adult SVZ, being also highly expressed in NSCs isolated from the early postnatal SVZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). However, only <italic>Tet3</italic> expression was maintained postnatally in the stem cell pool and in differentiated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Immunofluorescent analyses with antibodies to TET3 and to cell-identity antigens in wild-type adult brains revealed nuclear staining for TET3 protein in the GFAP/SOX2+population located close to the lateral ventricles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>), whereas no expression was observed in doublecortin+(DCX+) neuroblasts (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). TET3 staining was also observed in mature neurons of the striatal parenchyma (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). Furthermore, TET3 was present in all proliferating SOX2+cells in neurosphere cultures from the adult SVZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Consistent with the analyses at the mRNA level the TET3 protein was detected in Nestin+progenitors and GFAP+astrocytes at 3 and 7 days of in vitro differentiation, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). Taken together, these data suggested a role for TET3 in adult NSCs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>TET3 is highly expressed in adult NSCs in vivo and in vitro. <bold>a</bold> qPCR for <italic>Tet1</italic>, <italic>Tet2</italic> and <italic>Tet3</italic> genes in different cell types and tissues. <italic>Tet1</italic> is low expressed in adult NSCs and <italic>Tet2</italic> downregulates postnatally. <italic>Tet3</italic> is highly expressed in the NSC population and maintained postnatally.

<p id="Par10">Two-month-old <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> and <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>control</italic></sup> mice were injected with the nucleoside analog BrdU three weeks before sacrifice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). BrdU is specifically retained in some slowly proliferating NSCs (label-retaining cells, LRCs) and in OB newborn neurons that ceased to divide and underwent terminal differentiation soon after the injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The number of GFAP+LRCs was significantly reduced in TET3-deficient mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b-d</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>) and fewer of them were positive for the proliferation antigen Ki67 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>), suggesting a role for TET3 in regulating the number of activated NSCs within the SVZ. Conversely, related to the decrease in activated NSCs in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient mice, we found a higher proportion of GFAP+cells with detectable levels of the calcium-binding protein S100β, a marker of terminally differentiated astrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). Type B cells are elongated and bear an apical process that extends through the cells of the ependymal monolayer, to end in a primary cilium immersed in the cerebrospinal fluid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Monociliated B cells form structures known as pinwheels, and can, therefore, be readily identified in whole-mount preparations of the SVZ, following immunofluorescence for GFAP and the basal body marker γ-tubulin. In line with the previous findings, we observed a decrease in the number of GFAP/γ-tubulin+Type B cells contacting the ventricle in whole-mounts of the <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> SVZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). Interestingly, we also found increased proportions of monociliated GFAP+cells with cell bodies completely intercalated within the ependymal layer, a feature that has been reported to increase with aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). Less densely populated DCX+neuroblast chains in the RMS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>) and fewer BrdU+newly-generated neurons in the granular and periglomerular layers of the OB were found in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h</xref>) likely as a result of the reduced number of NSCs in the TET3 mutant SVZ.

These data together indicate that TET3 is required for the maintenance of the NSC pool in the SVZ of adult mouse brains by preventing their premature differentiation into terminally differentiated astrocytes thus limiting neurogenesis in vivo.</p>

<title>TET3 prevents terminal astrocytic differentiation of NSCs</title>
<p id="Par12">Adult NSCs are multipotent cells that can form neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes ex vivo. Indeed, when neurosphere cultures are induced to differentiate in vitro they undergo an orderly series of intermediate steps of proliferation and cell fate restriction resembling those occurring in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and resulting in the differentiation of derived neural progenitors into different neural cell types (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). Because the in vivo data suggested that <italic>Tet3</italic> deficiency resulted in increased astrocytic differentiation, we monitored the in vitro behavior of neural progenitors derived from <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> and control neurospheres plated under adherent conditions in the absence of mitogens. During the first 2 days (2-DIV) of differentiation, a decrease in the neural progenitor marker Nestin together with an increase in the terminally differentiated astrocytic marker <italic>S100β</italic> was observed in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> compared to control cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3g</xref>), whereas no change in the levels of expression of the neuronal βIII-tubulin gene (<italic>Tubb3)</italic> was found (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4c</xref>). At the protein level, the deficiency in TET3 resulted in reduced proportions of Nestin+cells after 2-DIV of differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h, i</xref>). Higher proportions of cells that were strongly positive for S100β, a protein largely absent from neurogenic GFAP+cells correlating with loss of neurosphere-forming potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, was also observed after 7-DIV of differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h, i</xref>). Conversely, neuronal and oligodendroglial differentiation was normal as no significant differences were found in the percentage of βIII-tubulin+or O4+cells, respectively (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4d,e</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par13">In order to test whether enhanced astrocytic differentiation in the absence of <italic>Tet3</italic> was consistently accompanied by a reduction in the capacity of NSCs to form neurospheres, 7-DIV differentiated NSCs cultures were detached and replated under proliferating conditions with mitogens (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). This led to the reactivation of a small proportion of cells with the capacity to form neurospheres in non-adherent conditions after 12 days in vitro (12 DIV) (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4f</xref>). The number of neurosphere-forming cells in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> NSCs was significantly reduced, indicating that the bias toward a more differentiated astrocytic phenotype in the absence of TET3 correlated with a reduction in stemness (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4f</xref>). This suggests that TET3 can directly promote the neurogenic potential of the multipotential stem cell-like astrocytes by preventing their premature differentiation.</p>

Moreover, the brain expresses high levels of 5hmC, suggesting a potential contribution of TET3 to the epigenetic state at imprinted regions in adult NSCs. Based on the RNA-seq datasets, we next focused on changes in expression of all known imprinted genes (Supplementary Dataset <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">3</xref>). From around 150 imprinted genes analyzed, three showed a significant change in mRNA expression. <italic>Cntn3</italic> (Contactin 3) was downregulated in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> NSCs, whereas <italic>Cobl</italic> (Cordon-bleu WH2 repeat) and <italic>Snrpn</italic> (Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated polypeptide N) showed increased levels of expression in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient neurospheres compared to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). Validation of the RNAseq data by qPCR showed very low levels of expression of <italic>Cntn3</italic> and <italic>Cobl</italic> in NSCs but confirmed the significant upregulation of <italic>Snrpn</italic> in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> neurospheres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>). A more detailed analysis of <italic>Snrpn</italic> expression in NSCs revealed that the gene was significantly expressed both in proliferating and differentiating conditions with a peak of expression at the first steps of the process of differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). Accordingly, although <italic>Snrpn</italic> was increased in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> compared to <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>control</italic></sup> proliferating NSCs, the maximum difference of <italic>Snrpn</italic> mRNA levels in both genotypes was observed after 2-DIV of differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par16">In order to determine whether the augmented levels of <italic>Snrpn</italic> in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient NSCs might be functionally responsible for the loss of stemness and enhanced astrocytic differentiation of NSCs, a lentivirus (Lv)-mediated short hairpin (sh) RNA was used to silence <italic>Snrpn</italic> (shSNRPN) expression in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> neurosphere cultures. Downregulation of <italic>Snrpn</italic> was verified by qPCR and immunocytochemistry in transduced cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d, e</xref>) and resulted in the reversion of the neurosphere-forming capacity of <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient cells to wild-type levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6b</xref>). Accordingly, the growth expansion rate of NSCs was increased to normal in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> neurosphere cultures infected with the shSNRPN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>). To assess whether this rescue in the self-renewal and expansion capacities in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient cultures might be due to an independent effect of <italic>Snrpn</italic> on proliferation, neurospheres size was determined, however no changes were found in mean diameter in any condition (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6b, c</xref>) suggesting a functional role of <italic>Snrpn</italic> in NSCs self-renewal. Consistently, lentiviral delivery of the shSNRPN in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient cells restored S100β levels to normal after 2 and 7-DIV of differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4h</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6d</xref>).

Bisulfite sequencing cannot distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC; therefore, to specifically assess 5hmC levels at the <italic>Snrpn</italic> DMR, a hydroxymethylation immunoprecipitation using antibodies against 5hmC (hydroxyMeDIP) was developed in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>control</italic></sup> and <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> NSCs cultures. Consistent with the bisulfite sequencing analysis, no differences in 5hmC levels were observed at the <italic>Snrpn</italic> promoter (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8c</xref>), suggesting that there was no loss of imprinting of the <italic>Snrpn</italic> gene.</p>
<p id="Par21">The remarkable increase of <italic>Snrpn</italic> expression independently of a change to its DMR methylation and hydroxymethylation in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient NSCs, prompted us to explore the possibility that TET3 might have non-catalytic functions in NSCs. We first used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) to assess direct binding of TET3 to the <italic>Snrpn</italic> promoter in wild-type adult NSCs. Two <italic>Snrpn</italic> promoter regions (R1, −20 to +132 bp, and R2, +271 to +434 bp) and <italic>Clcn6</italic> promoter, as a positive control region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, were chosen for analysis (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8a</xref>). Importantly, TET3 binding was observed at the <italic>Snrpn</italic> promoter regions but not at a more distal upstream region (−135 kb, Region 3, R3) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). To specifically determine whether TET3 was bound to the paternal transcribed (unmethylated), maternal repressed (methylated) allele or to both alleles (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8a</xref>), a ChIP-qPCR for TET3 was performed in NSCs derived from adult F1 mice hybrids offspring from <italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic> (C57BL6/J) females and <italic>Mus musculus castaneus</italic> (CAST/EiJ) males (BxC hybrids NSCs), in which two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified between the two subspecies at the <italic>Snrpn</italic> promoter (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8d</xref>). Direct sequencing of these SNPs after ChIP showed preferential binding for TET3 to the paternal transcribed and unmethylated allele (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>), supporting a methylation-independent function of TET3 on the <italic>Snrpn</italic> gene.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>TET3 binds to <italic>Snrpn</italic> promoter at the paternal allele to regulate its expression independently of methylation. <bold>a</bold> qPCR after chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of wild-type NSCs.

<p id="Par22">To further determine whether TET3 contributes to transcriptional fine-tuning of <italic>Snrpn</italic>, we overexpressed TET3 in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> NSCs and found that this caused a significant decrease in <italic>Snrpn</italic> expression but not in other imprinted genes such as <italic>Mcts2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9a</xref>). Notably, when we overexpressed a catalytically inactive variant of TET3 (<italic>Tet3</italic> CDmut) we observed a comparable decrease in the levels of the <italic>Snrpn</italic> and <italic>Bmp2</italic> genes in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> NSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). In line with this, overexpression of either wild type or catalytically inactive TET3 led to an increase in the number of spheres formed in self-renewal conditions in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> NSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>). Consistently, overexpression of TET3 in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient cells restored the percentage of S100β+cells in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> differentiated cultures to wild-type levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e, f</xref>). Overexpression of TET3 in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>control</italic></sup> NSCs did not modify <italic>Snrpn</italic> and <italic>Bmp2</italic> levels (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9b</xref>). Moreover, <bold>s</bold>elf-renewal and astrocytic differentiation were also normal in control cultures (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9c-e</xref>). However, when we overexpressed TET3 or its catalytically inactive variant in <italic>Tet3-Gfap</italic><sup><italic>cre</italic></sup> cultures, we observed a decrease in the levels of pSMAD1/5 and in the basal activity of the BRE reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6g, h</xref>). These data together demonstrate that TET3 binds to the <italic>Snrpn</italic> promoter preferentially at the paternal allele to contribute to transcriptional repression of the gene in adult NSCs, independently of its catalytic function and that BMP2 signaling is responsible for the astrocytic terminal differentiation mediated by SNRPN (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par23">The formation of new neurons in the adult brain throughout life involves the activation of pools of NSCs while preserving the stem cell number. Emerging evidence indicates that imprinted genes regulate the life-long function of adult NSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. This study demonstrates a role for the dioxygenase TET3 in the self-renewal and hence maintenance of NSCs within the adult SVZ. We show that loss of <italic>Tet3</italic> results in the differentiation of neurogenic progenitors both in vivo and in vitro and compromises the maintenance of the NSC pool in this niche leading to reduced OB neurogenesis. More interestingly, our work indicates that TET3 regulates self-renewal by repressing transcription of the imprinted gene <italic>Snrpn</italic> through mechanisms that are independent of its catalytic function in modulating methylation.</p>
<p id="Par24">TET3 deficiency causes an active apoptosis of neural progenitors derived from ESCs, which results in a reduction of neuronal production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This context differs from ours, as in adult NSCs <italic>Tet3</italic> deficiency does not modify apoptosis or survival rates. Rather, when TET3 is absent in the GFAP+population in vivo, a depletion of the adult NSC pool is observed, and this is due to their terminal differentiation into non-neurogenic astrocytes. As a consequence of the continuous depletion of the NSC pool in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient mice, the process of neurogenesis to the OB is impaired, a finding recapitulated in neurosphere cultures in vitro. Interestingly, no changes in the proportion of the cell cycle phases are observed in mutant cultures indicating that TET3 promotes self-renewal capacity without affecting their overall proliferation rate. Differentiation of both mutant and wild-type NSCs into the three cell lineages of the central nervous system supports premature differentiation of NSC into non-neurogenic astrocytes in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient NSCs.</p>
<p id="Par25">Gene expression analyses have revealed the molecular bases of these phenotypic observations, with a significant upregulation of the <italic>Snrpn</italic> gene in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient NSCs. <italic>Snrpn</italic> belongs to the Prader–Willi imprinted gene cluster and is expressed from the paternally inherited chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Patients with Prader–Willi syndrome lack expression of <italic>Snrpn</italic> and exhibit neurological problems including learning difficulties and hyperphagia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. <italic>Snrpn</italic> encodes the RNA-associated SmN (survival motor neurons) protein implicated in pre-mRNA editing, which contributes to tissue-specific alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. It is well-established that <italic>Snrpn</italic> is highly expressed in brain and its expression increases markedly during postnatal brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Our data indicate that TET3 regulates <italic>Snrpn</italic> dosage in an imprint-independent manner and that this is responsible for the premature differentiation of NSCs that we observe. Our findings suggest that <italic>Snrpn</italic> overexpression influences the NSC pool in adults, a function that has not previously been associated with Prader–Willi Syndrome and which has implications for our understanding of the etiology of this disorder.</p>
<p id="Par26">The effects of BMPs in astroglial differentiation have been reported extensively for both late fetal and postnatal progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, and most frequently, BMP-induced astroglial differentiation is related to deficiencies in the production of other cell lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Moreover, BMP4 overexpression appears to accelerate the differentiation of some radial glia, suggesting that multipotential progenitors terminally differentiate when exposed to BMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Our findings show that <italic>Snrpn</italic> overexpression correlates with elevated levels of this morphogen, suggesting that premature differentiation of <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient NSCs into astrocytes may be partly the consequence of the augmented activity of the BMP signaling. Moreover, the presence of the BMP antagonist Noggin that is produced by ependymal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> could be balancing the <italic>Snrpn</italic> function in the SVZ, preventing the differentiation of the NSC pool. Indeed, we showed that addition of Noggin to <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient cultures, restored the terminal astrocytic differentiation phenotype observed. Further work will be necessary to elucidate whether <italic>Snrpn</italic> has a role on the pre-mRNA editing of BMP genes.</p>
<p id="Par27">TET enzymes regulate the balance of DNA methylation and demethylation by dynamic conversion of 5mC into 5hmC, 5fC, and 5CaC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Several other reports have shown non-catalytic functionalities of the TET proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Concretely, TET3 has been implicated in the stabilization of thyroid hormones nuclear receptors promoting transcriptional activation where TET3 catalytic domain is not implicated and a TET3 catalytic dead mutant can rescue the developmental defects caused by TET3 knockdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Most notably, TET3 interacts with O-linked N-acteylglucosamine transferases (OGT) to influence transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Although our data show significant amounts of 5hmC in GFAP-expressing cells within the SVZ and in proliferating cells in vitro, global levels of 5mC/5hmC are not altered in <italic>Tet3</italic>-deficient NSCs suggesting non-catalytic effects of TET3 in this neurogenic niche. Indeed, we demonstrate that TET3 binds to the <italic>Snrpn</italic> promoter at the paternal transcribed and unmethylated allele acting as a transcriptional repressor of the gene by a catalytic-independent activity mechanism, supporting a multifunctional role for TET3 in adult NSCs.</p>
<p id="Par28">Adult niches preserve the undifferentiated property of their resident stem cells, but contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to this process has remained largely unexplored. Our data have elucidated the action of TET3, preventing terminal differentiation and exhaustion of NSCs by transcriptional repression of the <italic>Snrpn</italic> gene independently of its methylation. We also described how this regulation acts in concert with niche signals such as BMP and Noggin to modulate the proper differentiation of the NSC pool. Further work will be relevant to elucidate the structural, genetic and epigenetic requirements of this regulatory mechanism and its contribution to neurogenic phenotypes.</p>

Three weeks after the injections, animals were deeply anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline pH 7.4 (PBS) and brains were vibratome-sectioned at 40 μm.

<title>Immunoblotting and ELISA</title>
<p id="Par36">Cells were lysed in cold RIPA buffer. Total protein concentration was determined using the BCA system (Pierce). Equal amounts (30 mg) of protein were loaded on polyacrylamide gels for SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and immunoblots were carried out using primary antibodies (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) followed by incubation with appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) and chemoluminiscent detection (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer). All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 5% semi-skimmed milk and 0.1% Tween-20. Proteins were revealed using Lightning® Plus ECL (Perkin Elmer) and the bands were analyzed by densitometry using ImageJ (NIH) software. Uncropped scan of the WB gel is shown in Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">11a</xref>. For global determinations of 5mC and 5hmC contents, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used. Double strand DNA was denatured at 98 °C during 10 min. DNA solutions were immobilized onto a 96-well plastic plate with Reacti-Bind DNA Coating Solution (Thermo Scientific) and incubated overnight at room temperature. Sample solutions were removed and plates were washed three times with washing buffer (0.1 M PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20) and blocked with blocking buffer (0.1 M PBS containing 5% skimmed milk and 0.1% Tween-20) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times with the washing buffer, primary antibodies for 5hmC or 5mC (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) were added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After three more washes, secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 5hmC or anti-mouse for 5mC, 1:2000 each, DAKO) were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes, One-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA (Thermo Scientific) was added to the plate to develop chemiluminescent signals, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min or until the desired color appeared. Immediately, 2 M sulfuric acid solution was added to the plate and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using the 1420 Multilabel Counter VICTOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> (Perkin Elmer). The amounts of hydroxymethylated and methylated DNA were obtained by comparison to a standard curve of hydroxymethylated and methylated DNA standards (5-hmC, 5-mC, &amp; cytosine DNA standard pack; Diagenode), respectively. The amount of total DNA examined was previously measured by the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent and Kits (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The percentage of 5hmC and 5mC was calculated by dividing the amount of hydroxymethylated and methylated DNA by that of total DNA, respectively.</p>

<title>ChIP and 5hmeDIP</title>
<p id="Par37">For ChIP five 100 cm dishes with wild-type NSCs isolated from the adult SVZ were cross-linked and chromatin isolated. Chromatin was sheared to an average size of 200–500 bp using a Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode, UCD-200). Chromatin was pre-cleared with 10 µg of non-immune rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, cat. no. sc-2027) and 20 µl of protein G magnetic beads (Dynabeads®, cat. no. 10003D) for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. A volume of 10 μg of TET3 antibody (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) or rabbit IgG were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotation wheel. Chromatin was precipitated with 10 µl protein G beads for 3 h at 4 °C. An alicuot of chromatin before the immunoprecipitation was used a input. Beads were then washed followed by crosslink reversal and protein digestion. Finally, DNA was purified using MiniElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. To analyze the TET3 interaction with the <italic>Snrpn</italic> promoter, ChIP enriched DNA was analyzed by qPCR using SYBR green primers (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Pull-downs using non-immune rabbit IgG were used as control for non-specific enrichments. The comparative Ct method was used to calculate fold enrichment levels normalizing to input DNA and non-specific IgG. Uncropped scans of the PCR electrophoresis are shown in Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">11b</xref>.</p>
<p id="Par38">To study TET3 binding to the paternal or maternal alleles a ChIP for TET3 was performed in NSCs derived from adult F1 mice hybrids offspring from <italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic> (C57BL6/J) females and <italic>Mus musculus castaneus</italic> (CAST/EiJ) males (BxC hybrids NSCs), in which we identified two SNPs between the two subspecies at the <italic>Snrpn</italic> promoter (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8d</xref>). SNP1 was a “C” nucleotide in BL6 and an “A” nucleotide in Cast mice. SNP2 was a “G” nucleotide in BL6 and an “A” nucleotide in Cast mice. Genomic DNA sequences were obtained after PCR with primers within Region 2 at the <italic>Snrpn</italic> DMR (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par39">To enrich DNA samples in 5hmC modification, an immunoprecipitation for 5hmC was done using 5 µg of sonicated DNA at 150–200 bp. DNA was denatured at 98 °C for 10 min and immediately cooled on ice for 10 min. Milk buffer (5% skimmed milk powder, 2 M NaCl) and 10×-IP buffer (100 mM Na-Phosphate pH 7.0, 0.5% TritonX-100) were added. DNAs were incubated with 0.5 µl of 5hmC primary antibody (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) for 2 h. In parallel, specific DNAbeads® Protein-G (Thermo Fisher) were washed with 0.1 M PBS containing 1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> BSA for 2 h. Beads were then collected with a magnet, added to the DNAs and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The day after, beads were collected using a magnet and the supernatant was kept (Unbound fraction, UB). Beads were washed several times with 1x IP buffer (10 mM Na-Phosphate pH 7.0, 0.05% TritonX-100, 1 M NaCl) and both fractions were treated with 35 µg of Proteinase K (Roche) at 55 °C for 30 min. Finally, samples were purified using MiniElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer´s instructions. To calculate 5hmC enrichment at the Snrpn-DMR, qPCR was done with specific primers (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). A standard curve made up of doubling dilutions of pooled aliquots from unbound fractions was run on each plate. Fold enrichment between bound and unbound fractions was calculated estimating relative concentration with the standard curve. To ensure the specificity of 5mC and 5hmC antibodies, genomic DNAs were spiked with 0.3 ng of synthetic <italic>Arabidopsis sp</italic>. (Diagenode) sequence containing either 5-C or 5hmC and subjected to immunoprecipitation. No cross-binding was detected (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8c</xref>).</p>

Mutations abolishing catalytic activity (HKD catalytic triad to YKA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> were introduced using the QuikChange II mutagenesis system (Agilent) using primers Tet3-mut-F (5′-GGACTTCTGTGCCCACGCCCACAAGGACCAACATAACCTCTACAATG-3′) and Tet3-mut-R (5′-CATTGTAGAGGTTATGTTGGTCCTTGTGGGCGTGGGCACAGAAGTCC-3′). Variants were cloned into PB-DST-BSD (kind gift from Jose Silva) via Gateway cloning (Invitrogen) and are expressed constitutively from a CAG promoter. Adult NSCs lines harboring <italic>Tet3</italic> variants were generated by nucleofection of 2–2.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> freshly disaggregated NSCs with 3 μg of pIG-<italic>Tet3</italic> or pIG-Tet3CDmut plasmids using the Amaxa NSC Nucleofector Kit (Lonza, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer), plasmid integration via the piggyBAC system and selection with blasticidin (10 μg/ml).

The significance of the differences between groups was evaluated in all using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test when appropriate. Treatment experiments were analyzed by paired <italic>t</italic>-test. When comparisons were performed with relative values (normalized values and percentages), data were normalized by using an arc-sen transformation. Values of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
