<sec>
<title>Purpose</title>
<p id="Par1">Exome and genome sequencing (ES/GS) are performed frequently in patients with congenital anomalies, developmental delay, or intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID), but the impact of results from ES/GS on clinical management and patient outcomes is not well characterized. A systematic evidence review (SER) can support future evidence-based guideline development for use of ES/GS in this patient population.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="Par2">We undertook an SER to identify primary literature from January 2007 to March 2019 describing health, clinical, reproductive, and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in patients with CA/DD/ID. A narrative synthesis of results was performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par3">We retrieved 2654 publications for full-text review from 7178 articles. Only 167 articles met our inclusion criteria, and these were primarily case reports or small case series of fewer than 20 patients. The most frequently reported outcomes from ES/GS were changes to clinical management or reproductive decision-making. Two studies reported on the reduction of mortality or morbidity or impact on quality of life following ES/GS.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p id="Par4">There is evidence that ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID informs clinical and reproductive decision-making, which could lead to improved outcomes for patients and their family members. Further research is needed to generate evidence regarding health outcomes to inform robust guidelines regarding ES/GS in the care of patients with CA/DD/ID.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="Par5">Exome and genome sequencing (ES/GS) are relatively new clinical diagnostic genetic testing platforms for identifying a genetic etiology among individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), or intellectual disability (ID). CAs are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, health status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. DD/ID are common features of a wide variety of genetic syndromes, or they could be isolated findings. Due to phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity associated with CA/DD/ID, establishing a syndromic diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms can be challenging, particularly in the newborn period. Furthermore, some CAs may not be easily diagnosed in the newborn period but could contribute to a lifelong burden to affected children and families. Clinical genetic testing can assist clinicians in confirming or establishing a clinical diagnosis that may lead to changes in clinical management, obviate the need for further testing, or end the diagnostic odyssey, which may improve outcomes for the patient and family.</p>
<p id="Par6">Current standard practice, based on recommendations from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), is to perform chromosomal microarray (CMA) as the first-tier genetic test for individuals with CA/DD/ID.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Diagnostic yield for CMA has typically focused on cohorts of mixed phenotypes of CA/DD/ID, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yields averaged 12.2% in the early literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> More recent studies on cohorts of patients with CA/DD/ID have documented diagnostic yields ranging from 16% to 28%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> As a result, CMA is a well-established tool in clinical practice, yet this testing will not capture single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) or small insertion/deletions (indels), smaller structural variants, and other pathogenic variant types contributing to CA/DD/ID.</p>
<p id="Par7">The recommendations to perform CMA as a first-line test for CA/DD/ID occurred prior to the widespread availability of clinical ES/GS. Studies of ES/GS for these patients have shown there is an even larger diagnostic yield ranging from 28% to 68%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Notably, most studies included patients who had negative findings with CMA, demonstrating a higher yield for ES/GS compared with CMA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Higher yields have been observed when ES/GS is used as a first-line test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p id="Par8">Establishing a diagnosis for patients with CA/DD/ID through genetic testing generally, and ES/GS specifically, can impact clinical management and patient-related outcomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). For example, early infantile epilepsy is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous disorder that may result from structural brain anomalies or functional abnormalities. Patients may be treated with diet, antiepileptics, or other systemic medications depending on their specific diagnosis; patients with West syndrome may be treated with adrenocorticotrophin, vigabatrin, or pyridoxine and biotin, while patients with Otahara syndrome who fail to respond adequately to antiepileptics may be treated with ketogenic diet or neurosurgery in the case of structural brain malformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Analytic framework for evaluating outcomes of exome/genome sequencing (ES/GS) for patients with congenital anomalies (CA) or developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID).</title><p><italic>KQ</italic> key question.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e520" xlink:href="41436_2020_771_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par9">The specific nature and frequency of outcomes describing clinical and personal utility resulting from ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID have not been well characterized; therefore, we initiated a systematic evidence review of the existing literature to document these. We focused our attention on the reported and demonstrated impact of ES/GS on clinical management, including anticipatory guidance, physical and social well-being, and the ability to influence reproductive decision-making for the patient or their family members. We summarize the extent and limitations of evidence for these outcomes in this patient population and include suggestions for prospective evidence generation to inform both clinical and personal utility resulting from ES/GS.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<p id="Par10">In 2017, this ACMG working group was established to assess patient and clinical outcomes of ES/GS in patients with CA/DD/ID. Workgroup participants were members of ACMG and included board-certified medical geneticists specializing in adult and pediatric clinical genetics (L.D., J.G., S.E.H., D.T.M., E.M.P., A.C.-H.T., M.T.S.) and laboratory genetics (J.S., M.C.S.), and a methodologist (J.M.). None of the working group members had any conflicts of interest, according to ACMG policy. To address the overarching research question, “What is the utility of exome/genome sequencing of patients with CA/DD/ID?” the authors developed a description of the targeted population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing, and setting (PICOTS) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). In response to the PICOTS, key questions (KQs) were developed to structure and inform the overall goals of the project (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). The KQs corresponded to the health outcomes, clinical management, reproductive planning/issues, and health-care utilization from the patient, family, and provider perspectives.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>PICOTS and key questions.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><bold>PICOTS</bold></th><th><bold>Key questions</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>•<bold>Population</bold>: patients with one or more (1+) CA (functional and/or structural) evident/documented prior to 1 year of age, or DD/ID evident/documented at or before 18 years of age</p><p>•<bold>Intervention</bold>: ES or GS</p><p>•<bold>Comparator</bold>: no ES/GS performed</p><p>•<bold>Outcomes</bold>: <bold>patient-centered</bold> (health-related, behavioral/psychosocial, reproductive), <bold>provider-centered</bold> (change of patient management, change in length of time to diagnosis/treatment), <bold>family-centered</bold> (health-related, behavioral/psychosocial, reproductive)</p><p>•<bold>Timeframe</bold>: any, as long as patient met inclusion criteria</p><p>•<bold>Setting</bold>: any clinical setting in community and/or academic institutions</p></td><td><p>•<bold>KQ1:</bold> Does ES/GS of patients with CA, DD/ID impact health-related outcomes of morbidity, health status, functional status, or mortality, for the patient or their at-risk family members, compared with not having ES/GS?</p><p>•<bold>KQ2</bold>: Does ES/GS of patients with CA, DD/ID impact secondary health outcomes, such as quality of life, length of hospitalization, or health-care utilization, for the patient or their at-risk family members, compared with not having ES/GS?</p><p>•<bold>KQ3</bold>: Does ES/GS of patients with CA, DD/ID impact reproductive decision-making for the patient or their at-risk family members, such as deciding not to become pregnant, use assisted reproductive technologies with/without preimplantation genetic testing and/or additional fetal genetic testing, terminate a pregnancy, adopt, or use donor sperm/eggs, compared with not having ES/GS?</p><p>•<bold>KQ4</bold>: Does ES/GS of patients with CA, DD/ID impact behavioral and/or psychosocial outcomes for the patient or their family/caregivers, such as stress, anxiety, depression, communication of test results to family and/or support network, compared with not having ES/GS?</p><p>•<bold>KQ5:</bold> Does ES/GS of patients with CA, DD/ID impact clinical management for the patient or their at-risk family members through a change in medication and/or nutritional supplementation, a change in diagnostic test/procedure ordering, or referral to specialists, compared with not having ES/GS?</p><p>•<bold>KQ6:</bold> Does genome-level sequencing of patients with congenital anomalies reduce the time to diagnosis, compared with not having genome-level sequencing?</p><p>•<bold>KQ7</bold>: Does ES/GS of patients with CA, DD/ID impact identification of additional disorders (e.g., ACMG59) for the patient or the patient’s immediate family (i.e., parent[s], sibling[s]) or other at-risk family members, compared with not having ES/GS?</p><p>•<bold>K</bold><bold>Q8:</bold> Are there additional or separate harms from ES/GS compared with other forms of genetic testing?</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>ACMG</italic> American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, <italic>CA</italic> congenital anomalies, <italic>DD/ID</italic> developmental delay/intellectual disability, <italic>ES</italic> exome sequencing, <italic>GS</italic> genome sequencing, <italic>PICOTS</italic> population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing, and setting.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
<sec id="Sec3">
<title>Search strategy</title>
<p id="Par11">The following search strategy was used to query the PubMed database from 1 January 2007 to 26 April 2018 and was updated on 1 March 2019, with English and Human filters:</p>
<p id="Par12">(((“whole exome” OR “whole genome”) AND sequencing) OR (WES) OR (WGS)) AND (clinical OR utility OR outcome OR treatment OR care OR medication OR intervention OR counseling OR stress OR relief OR depression OR anxiety OR psychological OR communication OR “quality of life” OR quality OR pregnancy OR prenatal OR carrier OR testing OR test OR reproductive OR anxiety OR decision OR referral OR surgery OR procedure OR management OR outcome)) NOT (bacterial OR microbial OR isolate OR isolates OR virulence OR infection)</p>
<p id="Par13">Each publication identified by the search strategy underwent dual review for eligibility by a team of nine reviewers in a two-step process: title/abstract screening followed by full-text review using the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>. Although CA may manifest postinfancy, we limited inclusion of studies to those where CA had onset prior to age 1 year and DD/ID had onset prior to age 18 years. Studies that failed to meet inclusion criteria were excluded in title/abstract review or in full-text review. Discordance between reviewers at each step was resolved through discussion, with adjudication by the methodologist or other group members, if needed. We identified additional publications through review of the references cited by included studies. We specifically sought to identify gray literature; that is, relevant data captured in laboratory and/or hospital registries of patients with CA/DD/ID, presented at conferences, and/or published as conference abstracts. Studies presenting only hypothetical impacts to patient or family management stemming from ES/GS, or studies that presented only the diagnostic yield of ES/GS were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Systematic Review Data Repository</title>
<p id="Par14">The Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://srdr.ahrq.gov/">https://srdr.ahrq.gov/</ext-link>), a freely available web-based platform for data extraction and management of systematic evidence reviews was used to facilitate the evidence review. Individual SRDR projects were created for the title and abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction of studies. Studies were uploaded in duplicate to SRDR and randomly assigned to reviewers for each stage of the evidence review. Extraction forms were developed separately. Specifically, the extracted data included study design details, sequencing method, patient population information (i.e., CA/DD/ID, age), and outcomes related to ES/GS, including harms associated with their use. Diagnostic yield was not extracted nor evaluated for this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Patient and clinical outcomes</title>
<p id="Par15">We assessed the extent to which studies reported a measurable impact on health, reproductive, psychological, and behavioral outcomes for the patient or the patient’s family, including:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par16">Morbidity, mortality, change in health status or function, quality of life, or duration of hospitalization</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">Reproductive decision-making for the patient or their immediate family</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">Change in clinical management such as recommending medication/nutritional supplementation, ordering diagnostic tests or procedures, and referring to specialists</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">Psychosocial and behavioral outcomes such as distress, anxiety or depression, or change in communication patterns among the patient and their family/caregivers</p></list-item></list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p id="Par20">Extracted data were summarized in several ways. Counts were calculated for study characteristics (e.g., country, year of publication) for publications with 20 or more patients. We extracted evidence of outcomes of interest from each study and calculated the proportion of unique patients (or the family of a patient) with a reported change in management or reproductive planning. A narrative synthesis was performed due to substantial heterogeneity between studies and because available data precluded quantitative analysis.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<p id="Par21">The database searches identified 7178 publications. During title and abstract screening, 5405 studies were excluded based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>).

<title>Outcomes of ES/GS for CA or DD/ID</title>
<p id="Par23">We assessed changes in clinical management and patient outcomes resulting from ES or GS in recognition of the potential impact(s) a genetic diagnosis may have on the patient and their family. Of the 167 included studies, 95% reported a change to patient or family clinical management and most (79%) were case reports or case series with a small number of patients. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref> presents an overview of the 36 studies with <italic>N</italic> ≥ 20 patients and the reported health and clinical outcomes.

<title>Health outcomes</title>
<p id="Par24">Mortality and morbidity were reported in three studies. In a case series of patients with CA, a patient in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with suspected biliary atresia was scheduled for interoperative cholangiogram with reflex to Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> A provisional diagnosis of Alagille syndrome obtained with GS (later confirmed by CMA) was conveyed to doctors urgently, as the patient was in the operating room for induction of general anesthesia for the planned procedure. In patients with Alagille syndrome, the Kasai procedure is associated with increased risk for liver transplant and higher mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> The consensus of an international expert panel was that cancellation of the surgery led to the reduction in mortality risk by 83–94%, compared with the clinical course of a (nonstudy) patient who presented similarly and underwent the surgery the following month. In the same case series, morbidity was avoided in 61% (11/18) of patients who received a diagnosis with rapid GS (results returned in less than 2 weeks), compared with none of the patients who received standard of care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> suggesting that obtaining a timely diagnosis may result in appropriate management and improved clinical outcomes. In a series of acutely ill infants in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (NICU and PICU), Willig et al. reported a higher 120-day mortality rate in 57% (12/21) of patients who received a genetic diagnosis with rapid GS compared with 14% (2/14) of patients who did not, suggesting this population is more medically fragile and may benefit from obtaining results quickly to guide care. However, this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.46).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> A case series of patients undergoing rapid ES in Australia reported a mortality rate of 23% (9/40).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Generally, however, reported health outcomes were often subjective in nature.</p>

In a prospective case series of 80 infants with multiple CA and dysmorphic features from Australia, ES resulted in a decision to change surveillance for three patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> In one case, echocardiography surveillance for suspected infantile Marfan syndrome was discontinued since the diagnosis was excluded due to the finding of a pathogenic variant in <italic>CHRDL1</italic> causing X-linked megalocornea (OMIM 309300). The need for diagnostic tissue biopsy was eliminated for two patients diagnosed with mitochondrial disorders through ES, including combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 11 (OMIM 614922) and mitochondrial short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 deficiency (OMIM 616277)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and for an additional three patients with CA/DD/ID in the Illumina iHope program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and for three patients with CA who received rapid ES results in a case series from Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> In a case series of patients with CA/DD/ID, additional invasive testing/procedures were halted in 2% (2/115) of patients after ES.

The patient remained euglycemic more than one year later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Overall, many studies reported a change in planned procedures or surveillance strategies, mainly due to a change in the patient’s diagnosis; however, rarely did the authors present data or a description of any resultant reduction in mortality or morbidity.</p>

<p id="Par38">ES/GS are increasingly employed in the clinical evaluation of patients with a variety of conditions, including CA/DD/ID, as evidenced by the increasing publication rates over the past several years. Our findings demonstrate that ES/GS can influence outcomes for individuals with CA/DD/ID and their family members. Overall, included studies documented a change in clinical management as a result of ES/GS, including change in medications, procedures, or referral to specialists. When considering the types of medical management decisions, more than half of patients experienced a reported clinical impact related to the ES/GS diagnosis. Likewise, more than half of larger included studies reported an impact of ES/GS relating to the reproductive planning or decisions of patients’ families, further expanding the usefulness of ES/GS beyond the patient. However, few studies describe beneficial health outcomes or improved quality of life resulting from ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID. Nonetheless, despite little direct evidence that ES/GS improved mortality or ameliorated morbidity, the studies included in this review provide indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members.</p>
<p id="Par39">Though there are many publications describing ES/GS diagnostic yield, we identified relatively few studies documenting outcomes resulting from ES/GS for CA/DD/ID patients or their families. There are several possible reasons for this. First, we explicitly excluded studies that reported only diagnostic yield, as diagnostic yield is already well documented in the literature. Our goal was to assess outcomes resulting from a genetic diagnosis, such as improvement in morbidity or mortality, changes in surveillance or prevention, decisions about medical or surgical interventions, subspecialty referrals, better prognostication, and reproductive counseling. Furthermore, our search did not necessarily encompass all possible measures of utility and thus, this review does not preclude other forms of utility that were not included in the scope of the search strategy. Second, we excluded studies of patients with CA in which the reported age of onset was unstated or diagnosed when greater than 1 year of age. We focused our analysis on studies of patients who present with CA early in life, at a time when a diagnosis made by ES/GS may have the greatest impact for the patient by ending the diagnostic odyssey and for family by providing opportunities for reproductive options in subsequent pregnancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> However, patients who present after 1 year of age may also derive benefit from a diagnosis made through ES/GS.</p>
<p id="Par40">We also found substantial inherent limitations to the included studies. First, most were case reports or small case series where the goal was to make a genetic diagnosis for CA/DD/ID and the reported outcomes of interest were secondary. These study designs are problematic, as they introduce risk of bias and lack of generalizability. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are considered to generate the highest levels of evidence, are unlikely to be performed in this patient population. There was only one RCT (NSIGHT1) that assessed the use of rapid GS, and that study assessed only the rate of diagnosis, and was terminated prematurely due to loss of equipoise and difficulty adhering to randomization to the control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> Therefore, observational studies, including case reports and small case series, are important, and often the only form of evidence for patients with rare diseases. Second, among the included studies, there was substantial heterogeneity of patient phenotypes and indications for ES/GS. This translated to very small numbers of patients eligible for similar interventions, hindering robust measurement of the outcomes of interest. Moreover, aside from halting medical management or entering palliative care, outcome measures of morbidity, mortality, or family planning have long time horizons that are difficult to measure. Consequently, the body of evidence supporting or refuting the usefulness of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID is significantly heterogeneous in terms of quality, methods, and reporting, similar to the case for CMA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p id="Par41">We found that reporting of outcomes we assume are of value to key stakeholders using ES/GS was not uniform or complete.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> For example, we found only two studies demonstrating a reduction in mortality or morbidity resulting from ES/GS. Few studies reported whether the clinical course was improved by medication or diet, or by enrolling in a clinical trial. When a change in diagnostic thinking or clinical management of the patient follows ES/GS, to demonstrate the usefulness and value of the testing, investigators should study the corresponding impact on primary health outcomes where possible, either through comparisons to historical cases or matched controls. Moreover, with the near ubiquity of electronic medical records, this information may be readily available to provide further evidence of the utility of ES/GS. Further, impacts of ES/GS on reproductive-related decisions were generally not well described; many studies only reported vague descriptions or general statements about genetic counseling. We suspect use of ES/GS results informs important family planning decisions more commonly than was reflected in the evidence reviewed. Reproductive decision-making is a valued outcome of genetic testing, and as such, should be systematically measured as an outcome of ES/GS intervention studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup></p>
<p id="Par42">Future studies of ES/GS should document the impact of test results more routinely and uniformly, and in so doing, make available a more robust body of evidence to support utilization of this critically important technology. To accomplish this, a uniform framework is needed to allow prospective data collection to be standardized and thus, more easily aggregated and compared in meta-analyses. The genetics community should develop a standard set of outcomes for ES/GS, along with corresponding metrics to assess those outcomes to facilitate evidence development. The issue of “what to measure” is somewhat unique for the heterogeneous groups of patients with rare disorders. Defining the outcome measures will allow use of well-established reporting frameworks for studies of ES/GS in rare disease populations, like the PRISMA framework for systematic evidence reviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and the CHEERS framework used for economic evaluations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> Use of frameworks informing data collection and reporting could simultaneously improve the quality of the literature, as most studies we identified were of case reports or small case series with limited assessments when considered specifically in the context of health and clinical outcomes reporting. A recently published scoping review on the use of ES/GS for pediatric patients with phenotypes very similar to the articles we reviewed identified similar limitations within the current body of evidence and appealed for the development of a standard framework for clinical impact data reporting in sequencing studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p id="Par43">In summary, we performed a systematic evidence review to characterize the impact of ES/GS in patients with CA/DD/ID on clinical management and health outcomes. We identified one RCT and numerous case series and case reports describing clinical and patient outcomes, for which the overall evidence was limited. However, a change in patient management was observed in nearly all included studies (including case reports), and a substantial number of publications reported a clinical impact on the patient’s family members or an impact on reproductive outcomes. Future studies of ES/GS results for patients with CA/DD/ID should explicitly measure patient and family outcomes resulting from testing to better assess the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS.</p>
