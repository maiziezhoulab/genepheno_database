<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a human kidney disease affecting the urine-concentrating ability of the kidney. This stems from an inability to respond to the antidiuretic hormone, arginine vasopressin, resulting in a massive excretion of diluted urine. NDI patient manifest polyuria and polydipsia.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</sup> The symptoms of NDI range in their severity between individuals, owing to the heterogeneity of the mutations responsible for the disorder.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]</sup> Approximately 90% of patients with an X-linked form of NDI (OMIM 304800), which affect male patients, are unable to concentrate their urine in response to the antidiuretic hormone, arginine-vasopressin (AVP). This is caused by mutations in the AVP receptor 2 gene (<italic>AVPR2</italic>), while the remaining 10% of patients have an autosomal form of NDI (OMIM 125800), caused by mutations in the aquaporin 2 gene (<italic>AQP2</italic>).<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>According to other scientific findings, over 200 disease-causing <italic>AVPR2</italic> mutations had been published, comprising missense, nonsense, small insertions and deletions, large deletions, and complex rearrangements.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]</sup> Those mutations have been identified in more than 300 congenital NDI families, about 56% of which were missense mutations.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]</sup> Molecular diagnosis is the best method for the diagnosis of NDI and studying its genetic mechanisms. Due to the heterogeneity of NDI, we performed exon capture sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS), to identify the genetic features of 2 brothers with NDI clinical characteristics. We discovered a novel mutation in <italic>AVPR2</italic>, and performed the Sanger sequencing for verification. Identification of the patient's clinical characteristics combined with the pedigree verification leads us to believe that we have found 2 patients who conform to X-linked NDI. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first report of the mutation, both nationally and internationally, presenting great significance for the epidemiological study of NDI in China. Owing to the progressive development of techniques for molecular diagnosis, the disease is now diagnosed in most patients at an early age, which is beneficial to the treatment of congenital NDI.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]</sup> Meanwhile, our findings will further supplement the databases of genetic diseases in China, contribute to the diagnosis of diseases, and promote the development of precision medicine, such as preimplantation genetic screening, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal screening, as well as prenatal diagnosis.</p>

<title>Collection of medical history and related auxiliary examination</title>
<p>This study enrolled 2 patients; an 18-year-old male (Patient 1) and his 9-year-old brother (Patient 2), whose were suspected to be afflicted with NDI, from the 7th Pediatric Department and Outpatient Department of Pediatrics of Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, in February 2017. The medical history, physical examination data, as well as related auxiliary inspection data, were collected after obtaining informed consent from the parents and approval from the Ethics Committee of the hospital and Hunan Normal University. Written informed consent for molecular analysis was obtained from the patient or in the case of children, from their parent or legal guardian. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee, People's Hospital of Hunan province and Hunan Normal University (NM: 2017–16).</p>

<title>Clinical data</title>
<p>Two patients were admitted to hospital due to their manifest polyuria and polydipsia. Patient 1 had an input water quantity of 4770 mL/d, and an output urine volume of 5200 mL/d, which is within diabetes insipidus diagnostic criteria. At the same time, Patient 2 had an input water quantity of 5850 mL/d, and an output urine volume of 6750 mL/d, which also met the diagnostic criteria of diabetes insipidus. They were born without asphyxia at birth and their mother had no special medical history of pregnancy.</p>

<title>Water deprivation-vasopressin test</title>
<p>In order to confirm whether the patients possessed psychogenic polydipsia or diabetes insipidus, both patients underwent a water deprivation-vasopressin test. The results of Patient 1 are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The results indicated that after water deprivation, the patient displayed a decrease in weight and blood pressure, while serum Na<sup>+</sup> levels and blood osmotic pressure showed an increase. The patient showed little change in urine output, and urine osmolality was still maintained at a very low level. Based on these characteristics, we concluded that the patient could be distinguished from psychogenic polydipsia and the normal population. Furthermore, Patient 1 showed a stable level of urine output, urine gravity, urine osmotic pressure, and blood osmolality after injected pituitrin. It was, therefore, demonstrated that the patient had no response to pituitary vasopressin, so was considered to possess renal-origin diabetes insipidus. The results for Patient 2 were found to be similar to those of Patient 1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In conclusion, both patients presented with diabetes insipidus, rather than psychogenic polydipsia. Furthermore, the results of both patients’ vasopressin tests, showed that the patients may possess renal-origin diabetes insipidus.</p>

<title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title>
<p>In order to confirm whether the patients were suffering from a central nervous-origin diabetes insipidus, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results showed that Patient 1 displayed a microadenoma at the pituitary body (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A and B), but that his pituitary signal was normal. The results for Patient 2 showed a large quantity of fluid stored within the sinus cavity, confirming the presence of a nasosinusitis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C and D), while his pituitary signal was also normal. As the MRI results showed that both patients displayed a normal pituitary signal, it provided powerful evidence that their clinical features do not originate from a central nervous problem. However, it is difficult to confirm whether pituitary adenoma (Patient 1) and nasosinusitis (Patient 2), have no effect on the posterior pituitary or vasopressin storage and secretion.</p>

<title>Pituitary hormone detection</title>
<p>In order to confirm whether both patients’ posterior pituitary glands display normal levels of secretion, we tested their pituitary hormone levels. The results showed that the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulation hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, and growth hormone in both patients were all normal (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). This confirms that both patients possess a nephropathy-type diabetes insipidus.</p>

<title>B-mode ultrasonography and urinalysis test</title>
<p>In order to identify whether the patients’ diabetes insipidus originated from a renal disease or a genetic defect, both patients were subjected to a urinary B-mode ultrasonography and urinalysis test. The B-mode ultrasonography results showed that there were no obvious abnormalities in the kidneys of either patient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), while the urinalysis test results showed that their kidney function was normal (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). This demonstrated that the patient's diabetes insipidus is unlikely to originate from renal organic disease.</p>

<title>Conclusion of examination upon admission</title>
<p>It was noted from the clinical data that both patients suffered from polyuria and polydipsia, in line with the clinical diagnostic criteria of NDI. In addition, the patients presented with the clinical characteristics of hypophyseal adenoma and normal pituitary hormone levels. It is therefore difficult to confirm the patients’ phenotype, according to classical clinical knowledge, and the differential diagnosis of this case required further molecular genetic analysis.</p>

<title>Genetic detection</title>
<p>Suspicious mutant sites were found to be present in <italic>AVPR2</italic> in the pediatric patient, by using high-throughput, exon-capture sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, and clinical database analysis. Validation using first-generation sequencing and pedigree verification were also performed. The results were as follows; A novel mutation c.414_418del was found in <italic>AVPR2</italic> in Patient 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). His younger brother possessed the same genotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), while his mother possessed a hemizygous mutation at this locus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), and his father was wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This novel mutation is a type of 5-bp deletion within <italic>AVPR2</italic>, located in the coding region for the second cytoplasmically localized domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The deletion results in a frameshift mutation, and may contribute to nonfunctional protein being expressed, leading to abnormal cell function. Genetic detection and pedigree validation revealing that Patient 1, Patient 2, and their mother were mutant types, while their father was wild-type, was consistent with the X-linked inheritance pattern of NDI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The distribution frequency of this mutation was not found in the dbSNP database, Hapmap, 1000 Genomes database, or ExAC. This mutation was, therefore, a novel mutation that had not been previously reported in the relevant literature.</p>

<p>In summary, Patient 1 and Patient 2 may suffer from NDI, combined with some of the clinical characteristics of hypophyseal adenoma and nasosinusitis, respectively. Molecular genetic analysis found the presence of a mutation in <italic>AVPR2</italic>, but the mechanism of additional clinical characteristics needs to be studied further in more cases.

<p>A number of families of patients suffering from the X-linked form of NDI, have been studied genetically. The gene responsible for congenital NDI has been mapped to the long arm of the X chromosome, near the Xq28 marker, where it colocalizes with <italic>AVPR2</italic> (chrX: 153,170,428-153,172,620).<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]</sup> The whole genomic locus of <italic>AVPR2</italic> is 2,193 bp in length, consisting of 3 exons, within which mutations have been found to be responsible for congenital NDI.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>The gene encoding the vasopressin type-2 receptor, also known as the V2 receptor, belongs to the 7-transmembrane-domain G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, and couples to G proteins to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]</sup> The subfamily that includes the V2 receptor as well as the V1a and V1b vasopressin receptors, the oxytocin receptor, and isotocin and mesotocin receptors in nonmammals, is well conserved, though several members carry out signaling via other G proteins. The V2 receptor is expressed in the kidney tubule, mainly in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, where its primary function is to respond to the pituitary hormone, arginine vasopressin, by stimulating mechanisms that concentrate urine and maintain water homeostasis in the organism. Loss-of-function of this gene results in NDI disease. X-linked congenital NDI is caused by the loss of, or decreased function of, <italic>AVPR2</italic>, and large deletions that lead to the complete loss of <italic>AVPR2</italic> have been reported comprehensively. Furthermore, mutations to <italic>AQP2</italic>, <italic>ARHGAP4</italic>, and <italic>L1CAM</italic> have also been reported to result in NDI.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]</sup> However, previous studies have indicated that variations in different genes lead to distinct clinical phenotypes.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]</sup> Therefore, clinical differential diagnosis and the detection of variation are very necessary for the diagnosis of NDI.</p>
<p>In this study, we have identified a novel type of 5-bp deletion in <italic>AVPR2</italic> in 2 Chinese patients with NDI from the same family who display similar clinical characterization and symptoms. The parents of the patients were healthy and there was no known history of special genetic diseases in this family. The patients manifested polyuria and polydipsia, and met the criteria for a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. The results of a water deprivation – vasopressin test excluded the possibility of psychogenic polydipsia. The MRI results showed that both patients displayed a normal pituitary signal, and provided powerful evidence to demonstrate that their clinical features did not originate from central nervous problems. The water deprivation – vasopressin test results and the normal pituitary hormone levels of 2 patients verified these conclusions. The novel mutation of the patients is a 5-bp deletion in <italic>AVPR2</italic>, located in the second-transmembrane-domain. The deletion results in a frameshift mutation, and may contribute to the loss of protein function, leading to abnormal cell function. Finally, we affirmed that the children suffered from X-linked NDI, through performing NGS and family lineage verification.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that a mutation in <italic>AVPR2</italic> is the cause of NDI in the great majority of congenital NDI families.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]</sup> In families in which an <italic>AVPR2</italic> mutation has been identified, NDI is caused by the mutation in about 90% of cases. There remain a few NDI families for which a mutation has not been identified. Based on recent improvements in NGS techniques, mass DNA sequencing (including full exon sequencing or whole genome sequencing) is progressively being used in the antidiastole of NDI. Currently, genetic testing is used for precise diagnosis, such as; Sanger sequencing, amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction, and Droplet Digital PCR are all used to identify the sequences of certain genes. However, the number of genes is very high, and the above methods are costly, with lengthy run times. This makes them very difficult to use in clinical practice, especially for diagnosing diseases with similar characteristics. NGS could provide high-throughput sequencing of multiple genes, including all genes associated with a given disease, thus reducing costs and run times. Therefore, NGS is suitable for screening genes associated with hereditary diseases showing similar clinical characteristics.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>In the present study, we used a chip capturing high-throughput sequencing method for whole-exome sequencing of monogenic pulmonary disease-related genes, and successfully identified a virulence gene site in 1 pedigree. To our knowledge, this novel mutation is the first report about <italic>AVPR2</italic>, which has a certain value for the epidemiological investigation of NDI in China. In addition, the identification of this gene site could further complement the Hereditary Disease Library of China. Currently, dozens of monogenic diseases could be screened in China, which would effectively reduce the risk of birth defects. In addition, precise classification and diagnosis provides the foundation for disease assessment, and a basis for prenatal screening, prenatal diagnosis, and genetic counseling. We believe that with the accumulation of cases and genetic data in China, birth defects, including NDI, could be effectively avoided in the future.</p>
