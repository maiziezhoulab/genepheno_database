<abstract>
<p>The development of the human brain involves multiple cellular processes including cell division, migration, and dendritic growth. These processes are triggered by developmental cues and lead to interactions of neurons and glial cells to derive the final complex organization of the brain. Developmental cues are transduced into cellular processes through the action of multiple intracellular second messengers including calcium. Calcium signals in cells are shaped by large number of proteins and mutations in several of these have been reported in human patients with brain disorders.  However, the manner in which such mutations impact human brain development
<italic>in vivo</italic> remains poorly understood. A key limitation in this regard is the need for a model system in which calcium signaling can be studied in neurons of patients with specific brain disorders. Here we describe a protocol to differentiate human neural stem cells into cortical neuronal networks that can be maintained as live cultures up to 120 days in a dish. Our protocol generates a 2D
<italic>in vitro</italic> culture that exhibits molecular features of several layers of the human cerebral cortex. Using fluorescence imaging of intracellular calcium levels, we describe the development of neuronal activity as measured by intracellular calcium transients during development
<italic>in vitro</italic>. These transients were dependent on the activity of voltage gated calcium channels and were abolished by blocking sodium channel activity. Using transcriptome analysis, we describe the full molecular composition of such cultures following differentiation
<italic>in vitro</italic> thus offering an insight into the molecular basis of activity. Our approach will facilitate the understanding of calcium signaling defects during cortical neuron development in patients with specific brain disorders and a mechanistic analysis of these defects using genetic manipulations coupled with cell biological and physiological analysis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In metazoan development, extracellular cues or signals are sensed and transduced into gene expression programs that lead to cell specification and tissue/organ development. During development, these signals are sensed and transduced into cellular responses through the generation of intracellular second messengers. Changes in intracellular calcium ions [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub> are an important mechanism that transduces a large number of signals into cellular behaviors
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">1</xref></sup> including cell division, migration, shape changes and these are mediated by multiple Ca
<sup>2+</sup> dependent molecular events within cells. Disruption in several elements of these Ca
<sup>2+</sup> dependent processes has been linked to a number of human diseases
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The development of the brain is a complex process wherein epithelial cells that delaminate from the ectoderm form the neural tube, undergo a series of cell divisions, specifications, and movements to give rise to the cell types and organization of the adult brain. Many of these cellular processes are controlled by Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signals which in addition are a key mechanism of neuronal excitability
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">3</xref></sup>. As a result, several human brain disorders have been linked to changes in Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signaling in either neurons or glial cells. For example, changes in Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signaling have been linked to a number of human neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington disease, and related ataxias and Parkinson’s disease
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4">4</xref></sup>. Aberrant Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signaling has also been implicated in the cellular mechanism of severe mental illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-5">5</xref></sup> and disorders of neuronal excitability such as epilepsy
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">6</xref></sup>. Additionally, spurred by the development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, human genetic analyses have described mutations or variants in genes encoding components of the Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signaling toolkit in human patients with brain disorders
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To date, many findings linking human brain diseases to Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signaling have been inferred through the use of immortalized, stable cell lines or cellular models of rodent origin. While these have been hugely influential in driving forward the understanding of human brain disorders, there have been limited studies that have allowed such findings to be corroborated in human brain cells from patients with brain disorders. Conversely, it has been a challenge to test if variations in the DNA sequence of genes encoding components of the Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signaling tool kit in human patients with brain disorders are reflected in Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signaling defects in their brain cells. A principal limitation in obtaining such data is the inability to obtain brain biopsy samples from human patients and subsequently study Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signaling mechanisms using live cell physiology experiments. However, the recent development of methods that allow the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from somatic tissues of humans and the ability to subsequently differentiate them into neural cell types offers a solution for the need to perform live-cell physiology experiments
<italic>in vitro</italic> from neural cells of specific genotypes or specific brain disorders
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">8</xref></sup>. In this study, we describe protocols to differentiate human neural stem cells into cortical neurons, characterize their molecular properties and perform live cell Ca
<sup>2+</sup> imaging both during neuronal development as well as in mature cultures. The use of this approach will facilitate the analysis of Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signaling in human cortical neurons
<italic>in vitro</italic> and the dissections of Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signaling mechanisms that may underlie the cellular pathogenesis of human brain diseases.</p>

<title>Characterization of NSC</title>
<p>We characterized the starting culture of NSC using a number of approaches. The cell line that we used, XCL-1 was originally derived from CD34+ cord blood cells of a normal newborn male subject. Although purchased commercially, we karyotyped them during this study and found them to have normal karyotype (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>); karyotyping was repeated every 10 passages. XCL-1 NSCs were cultured on a plastic surface coated with a commercially available extracellular matrix (Matrigel-Corning). They attached readily to this substratum and had a doubling time of ca. 24 hrs (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Ki-67, a proliferative marker, was also used to validate the proliferation of NSCs (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C vii, ix</xref>) and we observed 32.15% of cells positive for Ki-67 (91 out of 283 cells were positive for Ki-67). Immunocytochemistry analysis showed that these NSCs expressed the widely used NSC markers, Nestin, SOX1, and SOX2 (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1 C i-vi</xref>). For example, in the case of Nestin, 98% of the cells in the culture showed expression of this protein marker.</p>

<p>We obtained human neuronal cultures

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>. Initiation of cortical neuronal patterning is achieved by gradually withdrawing bFGF and heparin and addition of neurotrophic factors BDNF, GDNF, IGF-1 and the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT that inhibits Notch signaling. Over 7 days
<italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV), the NSCs began to exhibit reduced proliferation and also show cell death (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2Bi-vi</xref>). They also form small aggregates and established elongated spindle processes. Such cultures were maintained for upto a maximum of 120 DIV and characterized for the expression of transcripts and proteins to establish the molecular process of neuronal differentiation and the identity of the cells in culture.</p>

<p>The differentiation of NSC into cortical neurons follows a number of stages including early neuronal differentiation, the formation of neurons typical of each of the six layers of the human cerebral cortex and the development of synaptic connections. We monitored these events by measuring the expression of transcripts for genes known to be expressed at each of these stages of development. Gene expression analysis was done using qRT-PCR on neuronal cultures at 7, 14, 21, 30, 45 and 60 DIV. This analysis revealed a gene expression pattern consistent with the known steps of cortical neuronal differentiation. We found that the expression of the immature neuronal marker β3-tubulin (TUBB3) starts increasing from 7 DIV onwards (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule binding protein required for migration of neural progenitors and associated with X-linked lissencephaly in humans
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">14</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-15">15</xref></sup> increased over the first 21 DIV after which its transcripts declined (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). The decline in DCX expression at DIV21 was associated with a continued increase in the expression of the mature neuronal marker NeuN (

<italic>RBFOX3</italic>, a member of the Foxo family of transcription factors; this is consistent with the previously reported expression pattern of NeuN

<title>Development of human cortical layer cell types</title>
<p>The development of the human cerebral cortex is choreographed through the expression of unique transcription factors typical of and necessary for specific layers of the developing cortex. To test the extent to which our
<italic>in vitro</italic> cultures recapitulate the cell types in these cortical layers, we measured the expression of these transcription factors during
<italic>in vitro</italic> development. Cut like homeobox 1 (CUX 1) is a transcription factor expressed in and required for dendritic morphogenesis in Layer II-III cortical neurons
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-17">17</xref></sup>. We found that the expression of
<italic>CUX1</italic> progressively rose from 7 DIV to 21 DIV after which it remained elevated (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Likewise, the expression of
<italic>CTIP2</italic> a transcription factor typical of layers V-VI was upregulated at 21 DIV and remained elevated thereafter (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). Immunolabelling with a CTIP2 antibody revealed the expression of CTIP2 protein in the nucleus of a subset of neurons in our 21 DIV and 60 DIV cultures (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4 D,E</xref>). We also quantified the expression of

<sub>i</sub>
<italic>. In vitro</italic> neuronal cultures at specified ages were loaded with fluorescent Ca
<sup>2+</sup> indicators and examined for evidence of spontaneous elevations of [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub>. Based on visual examination, two types of transients were noted: (i) those that were observed in neurites and (ii) those seen in the soma (Video 1, see extended data
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-23">23</xref></sup>). In this study, we quantified [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub> transients that arose in the soma. We found that in 7 DIV neurons a minimal number of such transients were seen (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). The number of such transients progressively increased as a function of the age of the culture, i.e older cultures showed more transients/unit time (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B-E, G</xref>). The resting membrane potentials (RMPs) of neurons during early stages of differentiation is reported to be depolarized and as neurons mature, their RMPs become hyperpolarized. This is validated by blocking the voltage-gated Na
<sup>+</sup> channel using tetradotoxin (TTX). In our cultures, we observe that the activity displayed in the baseline measurement was abolished by addition of TTX starting 14 DIV onwards specifically in neurons that fired trains of spontaneous transients, indicating a mixed culture with some neurons maturing faster than rest. TTX did not completely abolish these transients in the early days of neuronal differentiation. In contrast, TTX abolished the calcium oscillations virtually in all 30 DIV and 45 DIV neurons. (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A v 6D, E</xref>). A primary source of the spontaneous [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6 F i, ii</xref>). Overall, we were able to maintain these cultures up to 120 DIV and observe [Ca

<title>Store operated calcium influx in developing neurons</title>
<p>Many neuronal responses are modulated by the activation of cell surface receptors that couple to the G-protein subunit Gq, activating phospholipase C (PLC) and culminating in the influx of extracellular Ca
<sup>2+</sup> through a process of SOCE. To test the presence of SOCE in our
<italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, we performed experiments where we depleted internal Ca
<sup>2+</sup> stores using the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin and observed both intracellular release and the influx of Ca
<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol from the extracellular space. In our experiments we observed that the average resting [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub> was ca 26 nM; this rose to 48.5 nM in 14 DIV and was subsequently only slightly elevated thereafter up to 45 DIV (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>). In the initial part of the experiment, we applied thapsigargin to cultures loaded with Ca
<sup>2+</sup> indicator but bathed in zero extracellualr Ca
<sup>2+</sup>. The rise in fluorescence represents the release of Ca
<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores and could be readily observed at all stages of differentiation (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>). We quantified this release which approximates the size of the ER Ca

<title>Molecular basis of spontaneous Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signals in developing neurons</title>
<p>A likely value of this experimental model is the ability to test for changes in Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signalling in human patients with specific diseases of the brain using patient derived iPSC differentiated into neurons. In addition to the activity of VGCC, [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub> transients can also arise from the activity of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDAR), Ca
<sup>2+</sup> permeable AMPAR, nAChR and the shape, size and frequency of the transients can be modulated by expression of other components of the Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signalling toolkit
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">1</xref></sup>. Once changes in Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signalling are detected in neurons differentiated from patient cells, a natural next step is to probe the molecular basis of such changes. Towards this end, it is necessary to have a description of the Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signalling toolkit operating in neurons differentiated using this protocol so that observed changes may be mapped to specific molecular processes. To establish the likely molecular components that shape Ca
<sup>2+</sup> transients in the developing
<italic>in vitro</italic> neuronal cultures, we performed an RNA-seq analysis of transcripts from NSC, 45 DIV and 60 DIV neurons.</p>
<p>We found ca. 6000 upregulated and ca. 3700 downregulated transcripts in 45 DIV (See underlying data) and 60 DIV neurons (See underlying data) compared to NSC. The vast majority of these altered transcripts were common to both 45 and 60 DIV neurons (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8A, B</xref>) although a few were specifically changed in either 45 DIV or 60 DIV only. We curated a list of genes encoding molecules likely to directly regulate Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signalling. These are indicated in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8C</xref> (upregulated genes) and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8D</xref> (downregulated genes). We found that of the many possible genes in the human genome that could encode a specific component, transcripts for only a subset were expressed in 45 DIV or 60 DIV neurons; for example, of the 10 genes that encode different subunits of VGCC in the human genome, only six genes were expressed in differentiated neurons at 45 DIV and 60 DIV. Two of them were expressed only in 60 DIV and one of them was highly upregulated in 60 DIV as compared to 45 DIV (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, analysis of VGCC activity and its role in mediating any Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signalling phenotype can now be focused to these genes, for example by RNAi mediated depletion or CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Brain structure and function can be investigated at multiple scales of analysis including behavioural output, structural and functional imaging (e.g MRI) and clinical electrophysiology and these have been extensively used in the analysis of brain disease biology. However, a long-standing challenge in studying human brain disease is the ability to study mechanisms at the level of cellular and molecular processes in living human brain cells that typically require neural cells in a dish. The advent of modern stem cell technology that allows the generation of iPSC from the somatic cells of humans and their subsequent differentiation into neural cell types
<italic>in vitro</italic> offers a solution to this problem
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">8</xref></sup>. The human brain consists of multiple cell types including neurons, glial cells and vasculature. In additions, for a single cell type such as neurons, each region of the brain contains neurons of distinct molecular identities and physiological properties. To faciliate this, we have developed a protocol that allows human cortical neurons to be differentiated starting with NSC, a stem cell population observed during brain development
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-25">25</xref></sup>. Our protocol described here allows developing neurons to be maintained in culture for almost 120 DIV. This corresponds to 15—16 post-conception weeks of the human brain development
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-26">26</xref></sup>. These cultures can be studied using live imaging methods to observe and quantify cell biological and physiological processes upto this age
<italic>in vitro</italic> and thus allow the reconstruction of physiological development of these neurons.This strategy will allow the comparison of neuronal development between NSC derived from normal human subjects as well as those derived from patients with specific brain disorders. Given the proposed developmental origins of many human brain diseases
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-27">27</xref></sup>, our approach will allow the analysis of defects in cell physiology in developing neurons.</p>
<p>The human cerebral cortex is a complex cellular structure composed of six layers each of which contains specilized neuronal types with distinct functional properties and projections. In using
<italic>in vitro</italic> cultures to study the properties of human brain cells differentiated from NSCs, it is necessary to establish the extent to which these cultures differentiate to form the cell types typical of the human cerebral cortex. The cell types of the cerebral cortex are specified by trancription factors that are typical for particular cell types or layers. Using qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, we found that our cultures show progressively increasing expression of Cut like homeobox 1 (CUX) [required for dendritic morphogenesis in layer II-III cortical neurons], CTIP2 a transcription factor typical of layers V-VI and
<italic>SATB2</italic> of cortical layer II-IV. These findings suggest that our protocol generates
<italic>in vitro</italic> cultures with cell types representative of several key layers of the human cerebral cortex. Thus, the physiological properties of the neurons generated by this method are likely to reflect at least some of the properties of neurons in the human cerebral cortex. In this respect, these culture will likely be useful for the analysis of physiological changes in human brain disorders where the cerebral cortex is primarily affected. These include several key examples of severe mental illness including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, neurodevelopmental disorders that affect cortical development and function as well as neurological disorders such as epilepsy.</p>
<p>In this study, we have imaged and quantified the frequency and amplitude of [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub> transient development. We found that in our culture conditions, the frequency of [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub> transients increased as a function of the age of the culture (DIV) (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6 G,H</xref>). The [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub> transients were blocked by the addition of nimodipine, a blocker of VGCC suggesting that the activity of VGCC underlies their generation. In addition, the [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub> were also abolished by the application of TTX, a blocker of Na
<sup>+</sup> channels suggesting that voltage changes presumably through the depolarization of neurons likely activates VGCC resulting in the [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub> observed by imaging. Overall these findings imply the progressive development of neuronal activity in the
<italic>in vitro</italic> cultures as a function of age that can be monitored using Ca
<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Thus our culture system and the use of [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub> transient imaging is likely to be of value in observing altered development of neuronal activity in cell lines derived from patients with specific brain disorders. In addition, through DNA sequencing, a number of mutations have been described in genes encoding components of the Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signalling machinery in human patients. For example, numerous mutations have been described in CACNA1B (calcium channel, voltage-dependent, N-type, alpha 1B subunit) among patients with bipolar disorder, autism spectrum and Timothy syndrome
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">7</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a recent study has described a role for VGCC in the development of mouse cortical neurons through the control of cellular processes such as neurite outgrowth and radial migration
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-28">28</xref></sup>. The methods described in this paper will allow the impact of human mutations in calcium signalling genes (such as CACNA1B) to be studied in the context of neuronal development and physiology.</p>
<p>In addition to VGCC, many other mechanisms mediate changes in [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]
<sub>i</sub>. SOCE is one of these processes and is triggered by G-protein coupled PLC activation, a signalling mechanism used by several cell surface receptors that are expressed in the human cerebral cortex and reported to be important for brain function [e.g metabotropic glutamate receptor] and PLC signalling has also been linked to several brain disorders
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-29">29</xref></sup>. Studies in murine neural precursor cells (NPCs) have shown robust SOCE and depletion of STIM1 or ORAI1, key elements of SOCE results in defective NPC proliferation
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-30">30</xref></sup>; a recent study has also suggested a conserved role for SOCE in human NPC proliferation
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-31">31</xref></sup>. In this study we developed protocols to monitor SOCE during
<italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation and found a dynamic pattern of SOCE activity. Thus, our culture system and imaging protocols can be used to study the role of SOCE in cells derived from patients with specific human brain diseases. In addition, PLC signalling also triggers phosphoinositide turnover and the mechanism of action of lithium, used in the management of bipolar disorder, is thought to occur via the modulation of inositol recycling in this setting [reviewed in
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-32">32</xref>]. This question can therefore be analysed using the protocols described here coupled with the analysis of phosphoinositide turnover using biochemical approaches.</p>
<p>Human brain diseases may arise from multiple mechanisms including both cell-autonomous processes in neurons and also as an outcome of neuronal dysfunction arising through cell-cell interaction mechanisms between neurons and other cell types. Regardless of these different mechanisms, studying any given cell-biological process in human neurons requires the generation of
<italic>in vitro</italic> neuronal live cultures in which physiological processes can be studied in the context of neuronal development. In our protocol, we found that there was minimal presence of non-neuronal cells until ca. 21 DIV but from 30 DIV transcripts for GFAP increased and GFAP immunoreactivity was seen from 45 DIV onwards. This time course of gliogenesis observed in our culture system is consistent with previous studies that have reported a substantial increase in GFAP+ cells over time following the initial appearance of neuronal cells during brain development both
<italic>in vivo</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-33">33</xref></sup> and
<italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">34</xref></sup>. Thus upto ca. 30 DIV our cultures will be suitable for the analysis of cell-autonomous phenotypes arising from neurons but thereafter, phenotypes observed may reflect contributions from both neurons and glial cells present in the cultures. Interestingly, an increasing number of brain diseases are linked to neuron-glia interactions
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-35">35</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36">36</xref></sup> and could be studied in older cultures of the type we observed post 30 DIV.</p>
<p>In summary, we have developed a protocol that allows the quantitative analysis of Ca
<sup>2+</sup> signalling defects in neural cells in the context of human diseases that affect the brain. The use of this approach should provide mechanistic insights into the cell biology and physiology of human neurodevelopmental disorders and may further lead to the development of therapeutic approaches for these conditions.</p>

<p>This is a nice review of procedures for differentiating neural progenitor lines into neurons and a careful description of the molecular and physiological properties of the differentiated neurons as they go through the differentiation process. It is well-written, very detailed, and will be useful for several investigators interested in the field as well as also providing a general list of tools, reagents, and procedures that could be applied more generally to workers in other related areas. I only have a few minor comments and suggestions.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Sharma
<italic> et al.</italic> “
<bold>In vitro human stem cell derived cultures to monitor calcium</bold>
</p>
<p>
<bold>signaling in neuronal development and function</bold>” provides a methodological resource to assess calcium dynamics in human iPSC-derived cultured neurons. This approach might enable the modelling of human neurological diseases, specifically neurodevelopmental disorders, given that these cultures can be maintain for up to 120 days, which corresponds to 15-16 weeks of gestation.   </p>
<p> This is a useful resource that may be of interest to diverse fields including, developmental biology and neuroscience, stem cell research and neurophysiology.</p>
<p> There are some specific issues that should be addressed:</p>
<p>  
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>In Methods, section “
<italic>E) Calculation of cell proliferation rate</italic>”, “the authors proposed to count cells to determine proliferation rate. This is inadequate, number of cells can change by differences in proliferation rate and differences in cell survival. The authors will not be able to distinguish between these two cellular events from counting cells. More specialized approaches are required to sort these two cellular processes out.</p></list-item><list-item><p>GFAP and OLIG2 are not exclusive markers for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively. The authors should acknowledge the limitations of using these markers for identifying these cell types. </p></list-item><list-item><p>Page 13, 1
<sup>st</sup> column, last sentence should be revised: “
<italic>Finally, expression of the transporter vGLUT1 that mediates the uptake of glutamate from the synaptic cleft steadily increased from 21 DIV (Figure 5 H)</italic>”. This is wrong, VGLUT1 uptakes glutamate into vesicles inside the presynaptic glutamatergic neuron to enable release upon stimulation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Figure 6H should be removed. A non-ratiometric dye like Fluo4-AM does not really allow for analysis of calcium transient amplitudes in different samples/culture dishes because of the variability in the loading of the dye in different cultures. The differences observed might not reflect the actual magnitude of changes in [Ca
<sup>2+</sup>]

<italic>Thus upto ca. 30 DIV our cultures will be suitable for the analysis of cell-autonomous phenotypes arising from neurons but thereafter, phenotypes observed may reflect contributions from both neurons and glial cells present in the cultures</italic>”. The authors should revise the “cell-autonomous” term by replacing it with neuronal-specific or cell-type specific. It could be non-cell autonomous even if glia cells are not participating, if, for instance is through neuronal connections or neuronal release of some factors that affect phenotypes in a non-cell-autonomous manner.</p></list-item></list>

<p>The paper describes an in vitro human neuronal culture system for the study of calcium signaling in normal and patients with any brain disorders. These cultures can be extended up to 120 days in a culture dish - which is a huge advantage to researchers.</p>
<p> The description of the method for others to follow and repeat is well laid.</p>
<p> Methodology of neural differentiation, characterization with specific NSC and NPC and non-neural cell markers and transcriptome analysis to pin point the cluster of genes that are likely impacted is done in an exceptionally nice and convincing way.</p>
<p> Few questions:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Should Sox1 staining not be generally nuclear? I see it looks more cytoplasmic.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study is conducted with only XCL1 neural stem cells from commercial sources. Although its nice and good, it would have been better to include a disease based NSC (commercial or developed institutionally) and validate these methods for disease paradigms.</p></list-item></list> Authors - please do not consider this comment of mine as negative.</p>
<p> I really commend the authors and investigators to develop this robust method that will be useful for all global researchers.</p>
<p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p>
