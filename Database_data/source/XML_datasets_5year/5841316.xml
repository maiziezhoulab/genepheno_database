<p id="Par1">Nuclear envelope (NE) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-storing organelle controlling neuronal differentiation through nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>n</sub>). However, how [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>n</sub> regulates this important function remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the nuclear form of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger 1(nuNCX1) during the different stages of neuronal differentiation and the involvement of PTEN/PI3’K/Akt pathway. In neuronal cells, nuNCX1 was detected on the inner membrane of the NE where protein expression and activity of the exchanger increased during NGF-induced differentiation. nuNCX1 activation by Na<sup>+</sup>-free perfusion induced a time-dependent activation of nuclear-resident PI3K/Akt pathway in isolated nuclei. To discriminate the contribution of nuNCX1 from those of plasma membrane NCX, we generated a chimeric protein composed of the fluorophore EYFP, the exchanger inhibitory peptide, and the nuclear localization signal, named XIP-NLS. Fura-2 measurements on single nuclei and patch-clamp experiments in whole-cell configuration showed that XIP-NLS selectively inhibited nuNCX1. Once it reached the nuclear compartment, XIP-NLS increased the nucleoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak elicited by ATP and reduced Akt phosphorylation, GAP-43 and MAP-2 expression through nuclear-resident PTEN induction. Furthermore, in accordance with the prevention of the neuronal phenotype, XIP-NLS significantly reduced TTX-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> currents and membrane potential during neuronal differentiation. The selective inhibition of nuNCX1 by XIP-NLS increased the percentage of β III tubulin-positive immature neurons in mature cultures of MAP-2-positive cortical neurons, thus unraveling a new function for nuNCX1 in regulating neuronal differentiation through [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>n</sub>-dependent PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>n</sub>) regulate many cellular functions by modulating specific proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. For instance, the nuclear-targeted Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer protein parvalbumin, but not the cytosolic isoform, reduces hepatocyte proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Moreover, the activation of the transcription factors Elk1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, NFAT, DREAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and CREB depends on nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. On the other hand, intranuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation may affect cell survival, as it occurs under  hypoxic conditions where it triggers the expression of pro-apoptotic genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>n</sub> is influenced by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and is regulated by the activation of specific receptors, pumps, and exchangers localized on the nuclear envelope (NE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. For instance, the stimulation of nuclear inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate receptors (InsP<sub>3</sub>R) leads to nucleoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in isolated nuclei from Xenopus oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, Aplysia neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and pancreatic acinar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the activation of G-protein coupled receptors localized on the NE modulates—via [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>n</sub>—gene transcription, import and export pathways of proteins, and cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, outer and inner membranes of NE are provided with K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, and R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase pump<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and NCX1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Despite the existent knowledge on the role of plasma membrane NCX in the regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, nuNCX1 function remains unexplored. Interestingly, global silencing of NCX1 prevents neurite outgrowth through the inhibition of Akt pathway thus reducing NeuN-positive neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. On the other hand, it has been reported that miR-29a targeting the phosphatase and tensin homologs on chromosome ten (PTEN), increase phosphorylation of Akt, thus promoting neurite outgrowth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Indeed, deregulation of PTEN affects neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, the purpose of the present study has been to investigate the contribution of nuNCX1 in the modulation of nuclear-resident PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway via [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>n</sub> during neuronal differentiation.</p>

<title>Characterization of nuNCX1 expression in neuronal cells</title>
<p id="Par3">Immunolocalization of the NCX1 isoform in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells revealed diffused DAB immune-staining of this isoform. Together with its plasmamembrane expression, NCX1 was also present at the nuclear level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1Aa, b, c</xref>). Furthermore, in specific NE areas, NCX1 co-localized with Lamin B1/B2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1Ba</xref>), a component of nuclear lamina connected with the nucleoplasmic face of the inner membrane (INM). However, when NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were transfected with siRNA against NCX1 (siNCX1), Lamin B1/B2-NCX1 co-localization disappeared (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1Ba, c</xref>). Moreover, in whole neuronal cells, NCX1 immunosignal was also found outside the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1Ba</xref>) and disappeared in cells treated with siNCX1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1Bb</xref>). Confocal analysis showed a significant immunosignal of NCX1 on the NE of isolated nuclei derived from differentiated PC12 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1Ca, b</xref>). Nissl staining showed the lack of ER contamination and the integrity of isolated nuclei while ethidium bromide staining confirmed the high purity of these preparations and the lack of dispersed DNA (data not shown). In addition, any possible contamination by specific markers of the plasmamembrane, mitochondria, Golgi complex, and ER such as the plasma membrane calcium ATPase, Na<sup>+</sup> channels, dynamin-related protein 1, GM130, and stromal interaction molecule 1 were detected in the preparation of isolated nuclei, except for the two nuclear markers H3 and Akt (data not shown).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Localization of neuronal Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger 1 at the inner membrane of the NE.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Immunolocalization of NCX1 in whole cell obtained by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in differentiated PC12 cells treated with NGF for 7 days.

<p id="Par4">To further confirm the specific localization of NCX1 at INM level, we performed a separation between outer and inner membranes of NE with cold Na-citrate in isolated nuclei obtained from NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Once the outer membrane was removed, NCX1 was detected by Western blot only on the inner membrane attached to the nuclei and in total lysate of both whole cells and total nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1D</xref>). Efficient isolation of INM was confirmed by the expression of Lamin B1/B2 and CRM1, a member of nuclear transport factor family (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1D</xref>). Furthermore, only the preparation of outer NE membrane expressed calreticulin, an ER/SR protein that is contiguous with the outer NE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression and function of NCX isoforms in NE</title>
<p id="Par5">In an attempt to study the involvement of nuNCX1 in the different stages of neuronal differentiation, immunolocalization of this isoform was performed also in PC12 cells exposed to NGF for 3 days before complete differentiation. At 3 days, DAB immunostaining of NCX1 was almost totally detected in nuclear compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>, black arrow) and slightly localized in some part of plasma membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>, gray arrow). qRT-PCR experiments showed that, during differentiation with NGF, NCX1 transcripts increased in PC12 cells with a significant peak at 3 days of exposure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref>). On the other hand, the transcripts of the third isoform of the exchanger, NCX3, significantly reduced at 3 and 7 days of exposure (in A.U. ± SEM: control = 1.02 ± 0.03; 3 days NGF = 0.52 ± 0.05 *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. control; 7 days NGF = 0.55 ± 0.08, *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. control). Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed that nuNCX1 expression in PC12 cells peaked after 3 days exposure to NGF in nuclear preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2C</xref>), thus suggesting a specific role played by nuclear NCX1 in triggering differentiation at that time. By contrast, NCX3 protein expression dropped dramatically in the same preparation (data not shown).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>nuNCX1 expression and activity in nuclei from PC12 cells during differentiation with NGF.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Immunolocalization of NCX1 in whole cell obtained by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in PC12 cells treated with NGF for 3 days.

<p id="Par6">Then, NCX1 activity was studied by exposing to a Na<sup>+</sup>-free solution single nuclei loaded with Fura-2AM, a fluorescent dye exclusively concentrated in NE lumen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Na<sup>+</sup>-free perfusion forced the exchanger to operate in the forward mode, moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the nucleoplasm to the NE lumen. This elicited an increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in the NE lumen. In particular, this [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase induced by Na<sup>+</sup>-free exposure was much higher in nuclei obtained from PC12 cells exposed to NGF for 3 days than those exposed for 7 days or undifferentiated controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2D</xref>). In the same nuclear preparation, a pharmacological characterization of NCX1 activity in the forward mode was performed by the Na<sup>+</sup> ionophore monensin, or blocking NCX by the amiloride analog 3-amino-6-chloro-5-[(4-chloro-benzyl)amino]-n-[[(2,4-dimethylbenzyl)-amino]iminomethyl]-pyrazinecarboxamide (CB-DMB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Whereas monensin was able to enhance the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent activity of the exchanger, possibly by increasing intra-nuclear Na<sup>+</sup> levels, CB-DMB prevented the increase in NE Ca<sup>2+</sup> level associated with NCX activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2E</xref>). Furthermore, NE Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase was completely prevented in isolated nuclei from PC12 cells previously treated with siNCX1(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2E</xref>).</p>

<sec id="Sec5">
<title>nuNCX1 silencing prevents nuclear-resident Akt phosphorylation induced by Na<sup>+</sup>-free perfusion</title>
<p id="Par7">To verify whether nuNCX1 activation could modulate the phosphorylation of nuclear-resident Akt, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent kinase mainly involved in neurite outgrowth, we exposed isolated nuclei to a Na<sup>+</sup>-free solution under controlled conditions of temperature. Isolated nuclei were obtained from PC12 cells treated with NGF for 3 days, a time of the highest expression of nuNCX1 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Na<sup>+</sup>-free induced phosphorylation of nuclear-resident Akt in isolated nuclei from PC12 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). Moreover, Na<sup>+</sup>-free-induced Akt phosphorylation was evident already after 5 min of exposure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). The same activation of Akt was induced by exposing intact nuclei to bradykinin (BK) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>), whose Gq-coupled receptors are located on the NE inner membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This effect was prevented by pre-treating nuclei for 10 min with the PI3′-K inhibitor LY294002 (25 µM) before Na<sup>+</sup>-free exposure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). Interestingly, in nuclear preparations obtained from neuronal cells previously exposed to siNCX1, Na<sup>+</sup>-free perfusion (5 min) failed to induce Akt phosphorylation compared to siControl cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Nuclear-resident Akt activation by Na<sup>+</sup>-free exposure in nuclear preparations from neuronal cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Representative Western blot and quantification of phosphorylated Akt in isolated nuclei from NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (3 days) after perfusion with Na<sup>+</sup>-free or bradykinin (BK). <bold>b</bold> Representative Western blot and quantification of phosphorylated Akt in isolated nuclei from NGF-differentiated PC12 cells previously treated with the PI3’K inhibitor LY294002 <bold>c</bold> Representative Western blot and quantification of the effect of Na<sup>+</sup>-free (5 min) in isolated nuclei obtained from NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (3 days) previously treated with siControl or siNCX1.

<title>Selective inhibition of nuNCX1 by the chimeric protein XIP-NLS increases nucleoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level thus limiting neuronal differentiation</title>
<p id="Par8">Forty-eight hours after the transfection of XIP-NLS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>), confocal microscopy and immunoblot analysis revealed that XIP-NLS was selectively localized in the nuclei of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b, c</xref>). Indeed, EYFP signal co-localized with nuclear DNA staining Hoechst 33258 in nuclei efficiently transfected with XIP-NLS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). Furthermore, the specificity of the nuclear localization of XIP-NLS was revealed by the co-detection, after 48 h, with the nuclear markers CREB and pCREB in the same fraction. Further evidence for the nuclear localization of XIP-NLS and for the purity of our cellular fractions was the absence of the cytosolic protein SOD1 in the nuclear fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Subcellular localization of the chimeric protein XIP-NLS.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Scheme of XIP-NLS structure. <bold>b</bold> Immunolocalization of XIP-NLS (green, 400 ng/ml) detected 48 h after transfection.

On the other hand, the preparation of outer NE membrane expressed karyopherin β2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). Interestingly, once transfected at higher concentrations in cortical neurons, XIP-NLS carrying EYFP co-immunoprecipitated with nuNCX1 as detected with anti-NCX1 in isolated nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par12">The present study demonstrates that the nuclear Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger isoform 1 (nuNCX1), located at the level of the inner membrane of NE (INM) in neurons, plays a relevant role in neuronal differentiation through the modulation of nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. However, we found NCX1 immunosignal also outside the INM, possibly at the level of other intracellular organelles, whereas no detectable traces of the other two NCX isoforms, NCX2 and NCX3 were detected on INM. Compelling evidence for NCX1 specific localization to the INM is that, in nuclear preparations obtained from cortical neurons in which outer membrane was removed, nuNCX1 was co-expressed with specific markers of the INM, namely laminB1/B2 and CRM1. Furthermore, this specific localization was paralleled by its specific activation. In particular, working in the forward mode of operation, nuNCX1 moved Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the nucleoplasm to the NE lumen of neuronal cells. Indeed, NCX1 silencing, as well as the pharmacological inhibition of its activity by the amiloride derivative CB-DMB, abrogated Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in the lumen of NE due to the forward mode of the nuclear exchanger, thus demonstrating that nuNCX1 has the same pharmacological sensitivity of its plasmamembrane form. Therefore, nuNCX1 contributes to the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent removal of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] from nucleoplasm of neuronal cells. In this regard, we speculated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion from the total nuclear compartment of a whole cell might entail two consecutive steps: the first step, operated by NCX1 located on the inner membrane of the NE, might mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport from the nucleoplasm to the lumen of the NE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, and the second step, whose transporter mechanism is still unknown, might promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> movement from the lumen of the nuclear envelope into the ER. Such new function might be supported by the presence of a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient existing between the lumen of the nuclear envelope and the nucleoplasm. Consistently, previous evidence indicates the presence of a Na<sup>+</sup> concentration gradient between the lumen (80 mM) and the nucleoplasm (5–20 mM), that is maintained by the nuclear form of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Indeed, this pump is present in the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope and is oriented with the ATP hydrolysis site in the nucleoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par13">Indeed, the present finding is in line with our previous results demonstrating that NCX1 participates in NGF-induced neuronal differentiation via nuclear Akt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, the present data seems to suggest that, among the different exchangers, nuNCX1 plays a major role in inducing neuronal differentiation working in the early phase of the process. Consistently, nuNCX1 expression and activity progressively increased during differentiation, thus peaking at 3 days of NGF exposure. At this time, nuNCX1 mainly controls nuclear-resident PTEN/Akt pathway via [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>n</sub> modulation. Indeed, when we inhibited nuNCX1 with the chimeric fluorescent protein XIP-NLS, nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance decreased, whereas the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>n</sub> peak, elicited by ATP, increased. This effect on nucleoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was due to the selective localization of XIP-NLS in the nucleus where it binded to the f-loop of nuNCX1, as also demonstrated by the coimmunoprecipitation between the peptide and nuNCX1 in isolated nuclei. Accordingly, the same interaction occurs at plasma membrane NCX level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Interestingly, XIP-NLS inhibited nuNCX1 Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>n</sub>-extruding function without affecting the activity of plasma membrane NCX1, as demonstrated by patch-clamp experiments in whole neuronal cells. These data suggest that nuclear NCX1 plays a crucial role in regulating nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis upon [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase and works to remove nucleoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in whole cell under physiological conditions.</p>
<p id="Par14">Furthermore, the activity of nuNCX1 was involved in the regulation of PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway, a transduction signal regulating neuronal differentiation. Moreover, during neuronal differentiation, the expression of PTEN, a phosphatase that converts phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, was found to be inversely correlated to that of activated Akt. Specifically, the inhibition of nuNCX1 by XIP-NLS leaded to an increase in nuclear-resident PTEN expression and a decrease in Akt phosphorylation. Since nuNCX1, working in the forward mode, moves Ca<sup>2+</sup> from nucleoplasm to NE lumen, it is conceivable that the blockade of this flux may promote, at nuclear level, a nucleoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of nuclear-resident PTEN. Indeed, a part the well-established role in antagonizing PI3’K signaling at the plasma membrane level, PTEN has been localized in the nucleus where it modulates transcriptional activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, PTEN appears during elongation of growing neurites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and increases progressively at the early stage of differentiation, possibly to prevent aberrant neurite extension. In our study, once upregulated, PTEN was able to reduce Akt phosphorylation, MAP-2 and GAP-43 expression, thus avoiding neuronal differentiation in cortical neurons. Another interesting finding of this study is that XIP-NLS increased the percentage of βIII-tubulin-positive immature neurons -after 7 DIV- in mature cultures of MAP-2-positive cortical neurons, thus suggesting that the selective inhibition of nuNCX1 hampered neuronal differentiation of cortical neurons. This is in line with a very recent paper showing that the chronic treatment with NCX inhibitors produce marked reduction of the Purkinje cell dendritic arbor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par15">Collectively, this study unravels a new function for nuclear NCX1 within the complex regulatory machinery of nuclear calcium homeostasis, suggesting that this exchanger form may control neuronal differentiation through the fine regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent transduction mechanisms.</p>

The nuclear lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. At the end, 1 mg of nuclear lysate was immunoprecipitated with the mouse monoclonal anti-EGFP antibody (1:200) or the rabbit polyclonal anti-NCX1 antibody (1:200). Then, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by Western Blotting and immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-NCX1 or anti-GFP antibodies, respectively.</p>

<title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p id="Par28">Isoform-specific antibodies for NCX1 and Lamin B1/B2, alone or in combination, were used for immunocytochemistry. The rabbit polyclonal anti-NCX1 antibody was purchased from Swant (Bellinzona, Switzerland). Cells or isolated nuclei were rinsed twice in cold 0.01 M saline phosphate buffer (PBS) at pH 7.4 and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Sigma, Milan, Italy) for 20 min at RT. Following three washes in PBS, cells were blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA and 0.05% Triton-X (Biorad, Milan, Italy) for 1 h at RT. The coverslips were then incubated overnight with the primary antibody anti-NCX1 (1:1000 dilution), or anti-Lamin B1/B2 (1:50, Abcam, UK). After three washes in PBS, the coverslips were incubated in the dark for 1 h at RT with two secondary antibodies: Cy2 anti-mouse IgG and Cy3 anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc. PA, USA). The immunosignal of NCX1 shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref> panel A and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref> panel A was detected by using a biotinylated secondary antibody. After this latter incubation, the peroxidase reaction was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine/4-HCl as a chromogen. Then, after the final wash, coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence intensity of MAP2 and βIII-tubunin in cortical neurons was quantified in terms of pixel intensity value by using the NIH image software. Briefly, digital images were taken with 63x objective and identical laser power settings and exposure times were applied to all the photographs from each experimental set. The quantification of colocalization between MAP2 and βIII-tubun was assessed by using the ‘co-localization highlighter’ plug-in for ImageJ Software (NIH, Bethesda, MA, USA). Before colocalization analysis, threshold settings for each image were determined, and quantification was achieved by counting the number colocalized points per microscope field. Results were expressed as a percentage of colocalization. All images were observed using a Zeiss LSM510 META/laser-scanning confocal microscope.</p>

<title>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements</title>
<p id="Par29">[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was measured by single-cell computer-assisted video-imaging in isolated nuclei from NGF-differentiated PC12 loaded with Fura-2/AM (Calbiochem)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Under these conditions, Fura-2 is trapped within the NE lumen. However, nucleoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was measured in whole cells by loading NGF-differentiated PC12 with Fura-1dextran (10 μM/1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.05% Pluronic), a conjugated form of the fluorescent probe that is trapped in the nucleoplasmic space.</p>
<p id="Par30">To perform functional analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in the lumen of NE on isolated nuclei, we modified the methods used by Gerasimenko et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and Xie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Fresh nuclear preparations from NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were placed on glass coverslips previously treated with 30 µg/ml poly-L-lysine. After 1 h, the preparation was loaded with 10 µM Fura-2/AM at 4 °C in a standard solution containing 0.04% Pluronic. At the end of the Fura-2/AM loading period, isolated nuclei were allowed to settle for 15 min in a TM solution composed of: 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl with a pH of 7.4 and then subjected to an uptake buffer named Na<sup>+</sup>-free consisting of: 250 mM sucrose, 50 mM Tris–HCl, 4 mM K2HPO4, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, and 147 mM NMDG<sup>+</sup> together with 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. To measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, both in whole cells and isolated nuclei, coverslips were placed into a perfusion chamber (Medical System, Co. Greenvale, NY, USA) mounted onto a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a FLUAR 40X oil objective lens. The experiments were carried out with a digital imaging system composed of MicroMax 512BFT cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ, USA), LAMBDA 10-2 filter wheel (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA), and Meta-Morph/MetaFluor Imaging System software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA, USA). After loading, nuclei were alternatively illuminated at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm by a Xenon lamp. The emitted light was passed through a 512 nm barrier filter. Fura-2 fluorescence intensity was measured every 3 s and reported as F340/F380 ratios.</p>
<p id="Par31">For the experiments of Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>, NGF-differentiated PC12 cells and cortical neurons at 7 DIV were illuminated at wavelengths of 480 nm to identify EYFP-positive cells and then at 340 and 380 nm to measure, in the EYFP-positive cells, Fura-dextran-detected nucleoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels have been reported as 340/380 ratio.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recording of NCX and voltage-gated sodium channel activity by patch clamp</title>
<p id="Par32">The membrane voltage and current were acquired using pClamp10 software.</p>
<p id="Par33">Plasma membrane NCX currents (I<sub>NCX</sub>) in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were recorded by the patch-clamp technique in whole-cell configuration using the commercially available amplifier Axopatch200B and Digidata1322A interface (Molecular Devices), as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. I<sub>NCX</sub> were recorded starting from a holding potential of −60 mV up to a short-step depolarization at +60 mV (60 ms). A descending voltage ramp from +60 mV to −120 mV was applied. I<sub>NCX</sub> recorded in the descending portion of the ramp (from +60 mV to −120 mV) were used to plot the current–voltage (I–V) relation curve. The I<sub>NCX</sub> magnitude was measured at the end of +60 mV (reverse mode) and at the end of −120 mV (forward mode), respectively. The Ni<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive component was subtracted from total currents to isolate I<sub>NCX</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Neuronal cells were perfused with external Ringer’s solution containing the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 1.2 NaHPO4, 2.4 KCl, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 18 NaHCO3, pH 7.4. Twenty millimolar tetraethylammonium (TEA), 50 nM TTX, and 10 μM nimodipine were added to Ringer’s solution to abolish potassium, sodium, and calcium currents. The dialyzing pipette solution contained the following (in mM): 100 K-gluconate, 10 TEA, 20 NaCl, 1 Mg-ATP, 0.1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 0.75 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH.</p>
<p id="Par34">For tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> channel recordings, NGF –differentiated PC12 cells and untreated PC12 cells were perfused with an extracellular Ringer’s solution containing 20 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 5 μM nimodipine. The pipettes were filled with 110 mM CsCl, 10 mM TEA, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, 8 mM glucose, 2 mM Mg-ATP, 0.25 mM cAMP, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3). TTX-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> currents were recorded as previously described by Secondo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The mean resting membrane potential (holding potential at 0 current) was measured using the above-mentioned bath solution in absence of TTX and TEA. Capacitive currents were estimated from the decay of the capacitive transient induced by 5 mV depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of −80 mV and acquired at a sampling rate of 50 kHz. The capacitance of the membrane was calculated according to the following equation: Cm- = τc •Io/ΔEm (1−I∞/Io), where Cm is membrane capacitance, τc is the time constant of the membrane capacitance, Io is the maximum capacitance current value, ΔEm is the amplitude of the voltage step, and I∞ is the amplitude of the steady state current.</p>
