<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Studies of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from schizophrenia patients and control individuals revealed that the disorder is programmed at the preneuronal stage, involves a common dysregulated mRNA transcriptome, and identified Integrative Nuclear FGFR1 Signaling a common dysregulated mechanism. We used human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and iPSC-derived cerebral organoids from four controls and three schizophrenia patients to model the first trimester of in utero brain development. The schizophrenia organoids revealed an abnormal scattering of proliferating Ki67+ neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from the ventricular zone (VZ), throughout the intermediate (IZ) and cortical (CZ) zones. TBR1 pioneer neurons and reelin, which guides cortico-petal migration, were restricted from the schizophrenia cortex. The maturing neurons were abundantly developed in the subcortical regions, but were depleted from the schizophrenia cortex. The decreased intracortical connectivity was denoted by changes in the orientation and morphology of calretinin interneurons. In schizophrenia organoids, nuclear (n)FGFR1 was abundantly expressed by developing subcortical cells, but was depleted from the neuronal committed cells (NCCs) of the CZ. Transfection of dominant negative and constitutively active nFGFR1 caused widespread disruption of the neuro-ontogenic gene networks in hESC-derived NPCs and NCCs. The <italic>fgfr1</italic> gene was the most prominent FGFR gene expressed in NPCs and NCCs, and blocking with PD173074 reproduced both the loss of nFGFR1 and cortical neuronal maturation in hESC cerebral organoids. We report for the first time, progression of the cortical malformation in schizophrenia and link it to altered FGFR1 signaling. Targeting INFS may offer a preventive treatment of schizophrenia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Although the primary onset of schizophrenia is during adolescence to young adulthood, an early developmental origin of schizophrenia has been implied by improperly clustered immature neurons in cortical layers II, III, and V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, changes in the hippocampal nonpyramidal CA2 neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, as well as hypoplastic midbrain dopamine neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Such changes in brain structure most likely develop in utero during the late first and early second trimester<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, disorganization of the white matter tract has been observed in schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, suggesting that the disease affects not only the development and function of neurons, but also their projections. The variability in brain malformations are thought to underlie the variety of clinical findings: positive symptoms (delusions and hallucinations), negative symptoms (affective flattening, amotivation, and anhedonia)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and cognitive symptoms (disorganized speech and cognitive deficits) (DSM 4th edition). Abnormal development during the first trimester is also consistent with minor physical anomalies associated with schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">According to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis, both genetic and environmental factors broadly affect brain development and thus, contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The ontogenic construction of the human cortex is thought to proceed through a series of irreversible cycles of neural stem and progenitor cell proliferation, differentiation to neuroblasts, migration to the brain surface where early neuronal-like cells are formed, and develop into mature neurons with intercellular connections and communicative pathways. Normal human brain development begins with proliferation of neurogenic neuroepithelial precursors, which act as neural stem cells and give rise to the primary progenitor cells, radial glia, that are capable of generating neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In the developing vertebrate brain, the elongated bipolar radial glia are located at the apical surface of the ventricular zone (VZ) and span the width of the cortex. These cells generate translocating radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, and neuroblasts that migrate through the intermediate zone (IZ) to the outer cortical zone (CZ), and populate cortical layers. Via this inside-out process, the early born neurons occupy inner layers while the late born neurons migrate out toward the edge and occupy the superficial cortical layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Disruption of these processes has been hypothesized to underlie the misconstruction of the cortex and subcortical circuits observed in autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and schizophrenia (review-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>).</p>
<p id="Par4">Coordinated transition of cells from one neurodevelopmental stage to another are needed to produce synchronized development of the cortical layers. The navigation through distinct developmental stages involves concerted regulation of thousands of genes and is likely overseen by some central guiding mechanism(s). Our recent studies have revealed one such pan-ontogenic mechanism, Integrative Nuclear FGFR1 Signaling (INFS) that controls general body and the brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The <italic>fgfr1</italic> gene resides at the top of the gene hierarchy that governs gastrulation, as well as the subsequent development of the major body axes, nervous system, muscles, and bones, by affecting downstream genes that control the cell cycle, pluripotency, and differentiation, as well as microRNAs (miRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Studies show that this regulation is executed by nuclear FGFR1 (nFGFR1), which integrates signals from diverse development-initiating factors, cooperates with a multitude of transcription factors (TFs), and targets thousands of genes encoding for mRNAs, as well as miRNAs in top ontogenic networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. nFGFR1 binds to the promoters of genes that control the transition from proliferation to cell differentiation, as well as to the morphogens that delineate the body and CNS axes, and construct the nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">RNA-sequencing of differentiating neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) developed from the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of four different schizophrenia patients and four control subjects revealed a common dysregulation of 1384 mRNAs and 18 miRNA genes, deconstruction of coordinated mRNA, and miRNA–mRNA networks, and the formation of aberrant networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The downregulated genes reside within pathways that block neurogenesis, e.g. Notch1 and Rest, while the upregulated genes were found in pathways that initiate neural development, including master genes, such as Ascl1, Nur77, and RXR, or genes of the Wnt signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. ChIPseq revealed that nFGFR1 targets more than 80% of the dysregulated mRNA genes and 31% of dysregulated miRNA genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. These results indicated an early (preneuronal) genomic etiology of schizophrenia and designated INFS as a common dysregulated mechanism in the Cannon and Keller water-shed model of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Analyses of the differentiated neurons of the same schizophrenia and control iPSC lines revealed impaired migration in 2D cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, decreased neurite numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, reduced synaptic maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and decreased activity in the schizophrenia neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. These changes forecasted a potential disruption of early brain development in schizophrenia. Therefore, in the present study we followed the neuro-ontogenic potency of these characterized iPSC lines, from the stem cell/progenitor stage through the formation of cortical layers using the 3D cerebral organoid model.</p>
<p id="Par6">Pluripotent stem cells have the potential to differentiate into various cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and to self-organize and develop organ-like structures termed “organoids.” Recently, 3D cerebral organoids have been generated, which recapitulate key aspects of human brain development during the first and early second trimesters of embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The pluripotent hESCs or iPSCs aggregate to form embryoid bodies (EBs) capable of generating all three germ layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. EBs placed in neuroectodermal media form the neuroectoderm germ layer, the foundation for the development of cerebral organoids. Neuroectoderm cultured in matrigel scaffolds develop a 3D cerebral organoid tissue with distinct germinal centers (rosettes) and cortical layers corresponding to the human brain structure at the end of the first trimester<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. This new technology applied to iPSCs from microcephaly patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and patients with autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> revealed disruptions in early brain development and shed light on underlying cellular mechanisms involved.</p>
<p id="Par7">In the present investigation, the cerebral organoid technology applied to control and schizophrenia iPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> provided for the first time, an insight into the early stages of the telencephalic development and the role of FGFR1 in schizophrenia.</p>
<p id="Par8">These results showed an abnormal dispersion of the proliferating stem-like cells outside the VZ into the IZ and CZ, and a curtailed neuronal cortical development in the CZ of the schizophrenia cerebral organoids accompanied by turning off the expression of nFGFR1. The arrest of cortical development was reproduced in control cerebral organoids derived from hESCs, by blocking and depleting FGFR1 with its specific antagonist, PD173074. This study suggests that a reconstitution of nFGFR1 in developing cortical neurons can modify the developmental malformations.</p>

The iPSC lines used in the present study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>) were derived from different control individuals and from individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia at different ages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

Recent RNAseq investigation showed common dysregulation of a global transcriptome in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiated from all schizophrenia lines and ChIPseq showed similar changes in nFGFR1 genomic interactions in two investigated schizophrenia iPSC lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In the present study, we found no discernable differences between the organoids generated from control female and control male iPSC lines and between schizophrenia female and control male iPSC lines.

<title>Generation of cerebral organoids</title>
<p id="Par11">Cerebral organoids were generated from hESCs (H9 and HUES8) and from human iPSCs using a modified protocol of Lancaster et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, described in the Supplementary Methods and in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. Eight-day hESC (H9) cerebral organoids were treated with the FGFR1 inhibitor, PD173074 (Abcam), by adding fresh media with 100 nM PD173074 or drug-free media every 2 days for 10 days. On day 18, the cerebral organoids were harvested, fixed, and processed for immunocytochemistry.</p>

<title>Organoid sectioning and immunocytochemical staining</title>
<p id="Par13">For all experimental conditions (four controls and three schizophrenia iPSC lines, hESC H9 and HUES8) 4–5 organoids for each line were cryosectioned at 30 μm thickness and processed as described in the Supplementary Methods. The antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>.

<title>Quantitative analyses of histological sections and images</title>
<p id="Par14">Cell were counted using Visiopharm stereological software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Fluorescence intensity measurements (FIM) were performed using Zen 2.0 Blue Imaging software in randomly selected Regions of Interest (ROIs) within organoid regions listed in the figure legends. All images acquired were in the linear range of the camera. Images of sections from control and schizophrenia organoids were acquired under identical illumination conditions and identical camera gain, offset, and exposure times. Background images (outside the tissue sections) were taken and subtracted from the images of stained sections. The total area of each ROI image was recorded, as well as the number of thresholded pixels and their integrated intensity. Each channel was converted into the eight-bit grayscale and the mean intensity was calculated.

<p id="Par24">Cerebral organoids from hESCs were developed using a combination of two protocols (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>, Supplementary Methods). At day 8 the organoids formed stable cortical rosettes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1,</xref> a<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1, a2</xref>) with proliferative Ki67 positive cells in the inner layer and a mixture of doublecortin positive (DCX+) neuroblasts and immature βIII-tubulin positive neurons in the outer layers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>, a<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3, a4</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Representative hESC (H9) cerebral organoids at (a) 8 and (b) 18 days of development</title><p>(a1, b1) tile scanning of DAPI; yellow arrows point to cortical rosettes, enlarged in a2 and b2; at day 18, zones are outlined—ventricular zone (VZ), intermediate zone (IZ), and cortical zone (CZ).

<p id="Par25">During the subsequent 10 days, the organoids increased in size and the number of developed rosettes increased two to three fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1,</xref>b<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), as compared to 8-day old organoids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>, a<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). The 18-day organoids formed polarized structures with a distinguishable border that separated a forebrain-like region containing multiple rosettes from a hindbrain-like structure, which typically lacked rosettes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>, b<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

The VZ contained a large ventricle-like lumen surrounded by compact layers of vertically aligned elongated cells. The area outside the VZ, the IZ, contained uniform, predominantly round cells.

<title>Organoids derived from schizophrenia iPSCs—dispersion of proliferating cells in the cortex and blockade of cortical neuronal development</title>
<p id="Par28">After establishing the protocol for the generation of hESC cerebral organoids, we applied this procedure to human iPSCs. To analyze whether early brain development may be altered in schizophrenia, we used iPSC lines reprogrammed from three schizophrenia and four control individuals, in which common dysregulated transcriptomes have been recently identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Our qualitative observations were verified by computational and statistical analyses of three schizophrenia and four control patients and are described below. In general, the iPSC cerebral organoids followed the developmental pattern and displayed cortical rosettes that were similar to the hESC organoids. At 5 weeks, the rosettes of both control and schizophrenia iPSC organoids had only narrow residual lumens (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). No gross size differences were observed between control and schizophrenia iPSC organoids. However, a detailed cellular analysis revealed marked differences between control and schizophrenia organoids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). The control iPSC organoids, similar to hESC organoids, contained 2–3 layers of proliferating Ki67+ NPCs in the VZ, few Ki67+ cells in the IZ, and none or only single proliferating cells in the CZ. These layers were already observed at week 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>) and were further developed at week 5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). In contrast, in the 2-week schizophrenia organoids, only one layer of Ki67+ cells was typically present and there were no distinct palisades of proliferating cells surrounding the VZ lumens observed. Instead, the Ki67+ cells were strikingly dispersed in the IZ, as well as in the CZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Disorganized migration of proliferating cells and depletion of cortical neurons in schizophrenia iPSC cerebral organoids</title><p>Organoids were coimmunostained for Ki67 (red) and Pan-Neu (green).

<p id="Par29">Staining with a monoclonal Pan-Neu antibody, which reacts with key somatic, nuclear, dendritic, and axonal proteins of the pan-neuronal architecture, revealed differentiated Pan-Neu+ neurons concentrated in the CZ of the control iPSC organoids, forming a distinct cortical layer at 2 weeks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>) and more pronounced at 5 weeks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). These mature neurons formed a dense network of long processes parallel, as well as perpendicular to the cortical surface. At 2 weeks, the schizophrenia iPSC organoids had noticeably fewer Pan-Neu neurons and Pan-Neu positive dendrites in the CZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>). Instead, the schizophrenia organoids displayed differentiated Pan-Neu+ neurons deep within the IZ and VZ regions. These mature subcortical neurons were found already at 2 weeks in the schizophrenia organoids, at the time when no such neurons were observed in the control organoids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>). At 5 weeks, the basal cortical Pan-Neu positive neurons in schizophrenia organoids displayed dense short processes, different from the network of the long processes formed in the cortex of the control organoids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). Overall, density of the Pan-Neu fibers in schizophrenia appeared reduced. This decrease was verified by measuring the Pan-Neu fluorescence intensity in the basal CZ, as compared to the IZ. In three patients (compared to three control individuals), we found a significant reduction in Pan-Neu fluorescence in the basal CZ and no significant change in the IZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c, d</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par30">The impaired development of the schizophrenia cortical neurons was accompanied by a visible dispersion of the proliferating NPCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a, b</xref>). To quantitatively asses these changes, we analyzed images of the organoids form three controls and three patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). Computer-based cell identification and automated counting showed a significant increase in the density of Ki67+ cells/area of the schizophrenia ROIs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). For each ROI (example in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>, c<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), we generated Minimum Spanning Tree graphs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>, c<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>) (Supplementary Methods). This analysis revealed significant increases in the distances between cells, i.e., NPC dispersion, in the schizophrenia organoids.

<title>Changes in NPCs in schizophrenia iPSC organoids</title>
<p id="Par33">The antibody against autism-linked transcription factor T-Box Brain 1 (TBR1), identifies developing neuroblasts of the subplate (SP) and cortical plate (CP), which provide the first pioneer neurons of the developing cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. TBR1 is necessary for neuronal differentiation of NPCs and is a potential master regulator in autism spectrum disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.

In contrast, in schizophrenia organoids, TBR1+ cells were absent from the upper cortical region, while cells expressing high levels of TBR1 were found concentrated predominantly in the cortical plate and IZ. The loss of TBR1 expression from the upper cortical layers was documented in all the three schizophrenia organoids, as compared to three controls. Quantitative stereological counting showed 32.2 + 2.0% of DAPI-stained nuclei were positive for TBR1 in organoids from control subjects.

Three hundred and thirty-two genes were differentially expressed between NPCs and NPCs+ FGFR1(SP-/NLS(TK-) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). Expression of 861 genes differed significantly in NCCs pre-transfected with FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-), as compared to β-galactosidase (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). In NCCs, 440 genes were affected by transfection of active nFGFR1(SP-/NLS).</p>
<p id="Par43">Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed many developmental categories overrepresented by the genes that were differentially expressed in nondifferentiated NPCs and NCCs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>). The overrepresented categories included development of the nervous system, of the brain and its parts, cell pluripotency, proliferation, neuronal differentiation, axonal guidance and growth, synapse formation, glial development, and neuronal apoptosis. The same categories, with the exception of glial development, were overrepresented by genes affected by FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-) in NPCs and/or NCCs. Thus, nFGFR1 appears to specifically control neuronal NPC development. Overexpression of active nFGFR1(SP-/NLS), along with the cAMP/BDNF/GDNF stimulation, affected genes of brain development, cell proliferation, neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and apoptosis. Thus, both insufficient and excessive nFGFR1 signaling disrupt neuro-ontogenic gene programs.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Gene ontology analysis shows genes regulated between NPCs vs. NCCs, and genes affected by dominant negative nuclear FGFR1(SP-/NLS)TK-) or constitutively active nuclear FGFR1(SP-/NLS) (RNAseq)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>NPC vs. NCC</th><th>NPC vs. NPC+ FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-)</th><th>NCC+ vs. NCC+ FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-)</th><th>NCC vs. NCC+ FGFR1(SP-/NLS)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Neural development</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Synapse development, assembly</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Synaptic plasticity</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> NS/CNS development</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Brain parts development</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td> Forebrain development</td><td></td><td></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td> Cell proliferation, mitotic cycle</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td> Cell migration</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Neurogenesis</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td> Cell adhesion</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Extracellular matrix, proteases</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Cell, neuronal differentiation</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td> Axon development</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Axonal guidance</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Oligodendrocyte development</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Glial development</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Neurotransmission</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Neuronal projection</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Learning and Memory</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Response to retinoic acid</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>2nd messenger signaling</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Regulation of signal transduction</td><td>Regulation of signal transduction</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Cell–cell signaling</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Apoptosis, neuron apoptosis</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Development general</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Organ and developmental morphogenesis</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td> Angiogenesis</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Cardiovascular development</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Multicellular organism development</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td> Cellular response to TGFβ</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Limb, organ morphogenesis</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Eye development</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Developmental induction</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gene expression</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Transcription RNA PolII</td><td></td><td>Transcription RNA PolII</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Categories affected only in FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-) or FGFR1(SP-/NLS) transfected cells are listed by names</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>

<p id="Par45">The ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (a proprietary curation of pathways by Qiagen that estimates gene overrepresentation within specific pathways), revealed FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-) dysregulation of many genes in NPCs and/or NCCs involved in pathways controlling neuronal and brain development, which were regulated during the cAMP/BDNF/GDNF-induced NCC differentiation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>). These pathways included Wnt/β catenin signaling, axonal growth and guidance, ephrin, G-protein signaling, cAMP signaling, PKA signaling, CREB signaling, ERB tyrosine kinase signaling, growth hormone receptor signaling, interleukin signaling, prolactin, etc. (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>). In addition, inhibition with FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-) revealed nFGFR1 regulation of additional developmental pathways, which were not affected by cAMP/BDNF/GDNF: Notch, Wnt/Ca++, neurotrophins/TRK, ERK/MAPK, reelin, ephrin, glucocorticoid receptors, GDNF and PDGF, as well as cell cycle and p53 controlling pathways. Overexpression of constitutively active nFGFR1(SP-/NLS) in NCCs affected genes in Notch, Ca++, GH, EGFR, CXCR4, pluripotency, and glucocorticoid signaling, neurotrophin/Trk receptors, NGF, Erk/MAPK signaling, ephrin signaling, FGF signaling, p53, and RAR signaling. Blocking nFGFR1 signaling with FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-) and/or activation with FGFR1(SP-/NLS) affected genes in pathways involved in neuronal functions, such as GABA receptor signaling, calcium, melatonin, LTP, and LTD (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>).

<title>Deconstruction of mRNA networks by loss of nFGFR1 signaling</title>
<p id="Par47">Genome function is organized into highly coordinated and dynamically changing networks of genes. To detect such networks among the FGFR1-controlled genes, we performed a pairwise correlation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> of all differentially regulated genes. Among 4704 genes that were regulated during NPC differentiation to NCCs, we detected groups of genes that displayed high-positive correlation (+0.9 to +1.0; changing activities in the same direction) and genes which showed high-negative correlation (−0.9 to −1.0; changing activities in opposite direction) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>). In each category, the 200 most connected genes from the differentiated NCCs were analyzed using circular network graphs. A common feature of both positive and negative networks was that their top 200 coordinate genes were highly interconnected in NCCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7b, c</xref>). These networks formed during NCC differentiation as they showed little or no connectivity in NPCs.</p>
<p id="Par48">We then analyzed network formation by 861 NCC genes, which were affected by FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>).

<title>FGFR inhibitor, PD173074, models loss of nFGFR1 and cortical maldevelopment in hESC cerebral organoids</title>
<p id="Par49">Given the broad neuro-ontogenic functions of nFGFR1 in NPCs and NCCs, we next asked if the loss of nFGFR1 function could arrest the ongoing cortical development in control hESC organoids, similar to as observed in cortical cells of the schizophrenia organoids. We used PD173074, which specifically inhibits FGFRs (R1 &gt; R2 &gt; R3 &gt; R4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Since <italic>fgfr1</italic> was the highest expressed <italic>fgfr</italic> gene in NPCs and NCCs (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>; 1.0<sub>FGFR1</sub> &gt; 0.16<sub>FGFR2</sub> &gt; 0.26<sub>FGFR3</sub> &gt; 0.008<sub>FGFR4</sub>), the effects of PD173074 would likely reflect the FGFR1 blockade. After the initial 8 days of cortical development, structurally stable hESC cerebral organoids were incubated with 100 nM PD173074 or in drug-free medium for an additional 10 days, during the ongoing CZ expansion.</p>
<p id="Par50">In general, many changes induced by PD173074 treated hESC H9 organoids were similar as in the schizophrenia iPSC organoids. Expression of the cortical TBR1 marker of early pioneer neuroblasts, was abolished by PD173074 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8a, b</xref>). Consistent with these findings, the highly abundant doublecortin+ neuroblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>) and the calretinin+ interneurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>) in the IZ and CZ of day 18 control organoids were markedly depleted by the PD173074 treatment.</p>
<p id="Par51">To determine if FGFR1 inhibition affected the ongoing cortical neuronogenesis, we pulse labeled dividing cells with BrdU in 14-day organoids (6th day of PD173074 treatment). After an additional 4 days, BrdU-labeled control or PD173074-treated organoids were sectioned and co-immunostained with rat anti-BrdU and with mouse anti-Pan-Neu. In control organoids, the BrdU-labeled cells were found in the VZ, as well as migrated into the IZ and CZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>). Counting cells in multiple rosettes showed BrdU+ cells abundantly present in all zones of the control organoids in the following order: VZ &gt; IZ &gt; CZ.

<p id="Par52">In control organoids, BrdU and Pan-Neu colocalized predominantly in the same cells of the marginal CZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9a</xref>), indicating that the dividing VZ cells had migrated out to cortical layers and differentiated into neurons. Treatment with PD173074 markedly altered this process (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9b</xref>). The BrdU+ cells remained largely arrested in the IZ. Relatively few BrdU+ cells that were found in the CZ differentiated to Pan-Neu positive neurons (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab4">4</xref>). Thus, blocking FGFR1-inhibited cortical migration of the newborn cells and formation of mature neurons.</p>
<p id="Par53">PD173074 was shown previously to reduce nuclear nFGFR1 accumulation observed in pancreatic tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Hence, we examined the PD173074 effect on FGFR1 subcellular distribution in the CZ of hESC H9 cerebral organoids. In several independent experiments, the expression of FGFR1 in control hESC H9 organoids showed similar patterns (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>) as in the control iPSC organoids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). FGFR1 was highly expressed in the VZ cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>). The FGFR1 staining was less intense in the IZ and stronger again in the CZ. In many CZ cells, FGFR1 localized within the cell nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>) and in prominent nuclear speckles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>, b<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). To quantify the changes in FGFR1 subcellular distribution, we imaged DAPI and FGFR1 co-stained sections using confocal microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b</xref>). In the CZ of control organoids, 52% of cells had nFGFR1 colocalized with DAPI. In PD173074-treated organoids there was over a three-fold reduction in the number of cells with nFGFR1 in the CZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8c</xref>), likely reflecting loss of the positive <italic>fgfr1</italic> gene activation by its protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>

The premature development of NPCs into subcortical neurons may reflect excessive nFGFR1 (+)* signaling in differentiating schizophrenia NPCs (as found in earlier genomic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>). On the other hand, stunted cortical development likely reflects the loss of cortical nFGFR1 signaling. Modeling this loss in hESC organoids, by blocking FGFR1 signaling and depleting nFGFR1 with PD173074, replicates the impaired cortical development observed in schizophrenia iPSC organoids.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par54">In this study, we have expanded cerebral organoids as an experimental platform to analyze the early human cortical development in healthy and disease states and to investigate disease mechanisms. Using the protocol of Lancaster et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> in which the first step, an efficient generation of EBs, was modified as in Brennand et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> we successfully generated cerebral organoids from hESCs (H9 and HUES8 lines) and from seven human iPSC lines. We observed time-dependent generation and development of organoids, recapitulating the inside-out pattern of human cortical development. The VZ in the center of the rosettes contained proliferating GFAP+ radial glia, the IZ contained migrating doublecortin+ neuroblasts and immature βIII-tubulin+ neurons, and the CZ incorporated pioneer neurons (TBR1+), and built cortical-like layers of the βIII-tubulin+ and Pan-Neu+ neurons, and calretinin+ interneurons. We employed quantitative cell counting, image intensity measurements, and computational tools to quantify and analyze normal and pathological tissue samples.</p>
<p id="Par55">An important observation made repeatedly during this study was that the cellular structures and zones of the organoid rosettes and their development were consistently reproducible among hESC H9, HUES8, and the four control iPSC line organoids, but were noticeably disturbed in all schizophrenia iPSC organoids and after pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1. In the organoids developed from either hESCs or control iPSCs, the proliferating cells were restricted to 2–3 layers surrounding the lumen of the VZ rosettes. Relatively few cells that migrated to the IZ remained in a proliferative state, but essentially, no such cells were found in the CZ. One of the most striking features of the schizophrenia iPSC organoids was the disruption of the developmental strata. Specifically, we observed significantly increased proliferation and movement of Ki67+ NPCs into the IZ, and development of atypically placed deep subcortical neurons. These changes were accompanied by significant loss of the TBR1 pioneer neurons from the top cortical layers, while they remained abundant deep in the IZ. Together, these findings illuminated an abnormal subcortical neuronogenesis in schizophrenia tissue and were consistent with the increased, premature neuronal generation, predicted from the transcriptome studies of the NPCs derived from schizophrenia iPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par56">The expanded subcortical neurogenesis was accompanied by opposite changes in the CZ, where fewer mature neurons developed in schizophrenia organoids. This was shown by a significant reduction in cortical Pan-Neu intensity and was corroborated by visibly diminished Pan-Neu fibers in the schizophrenia organoids. The specific depletion of the neurons in the cortex, but not in the IZ, may reflect the loss of cortical signals that guide the cortico-petal migration, i.e. reduced cortical deposition of reelin and pioneer TBR1 neurons. The altered intracortical connectivity in schizophrenia organoids was further denoted by the changes in the orientation of the calretinin+ interneurons. Unlike the horizontal organization of calretinin+ neurites in the control cortex, the schizophrenia interneurons displayed a random directionality of neurites, indicating perturbed intercortical connectivity. The relationship between glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons (of which calretinin-positive neurons are a subtype of GABAergic interneurons), has been suggested in relation to the development of schizophrenia in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. So far, attempts to count calretinin neurons in the schizophrenia brain showed lack of significant numerical changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Our study suggests that changes in interneuron directionality may disrupt cortical connections and communication in schizophrenia.</p>
<p id="Par57">In summary (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>), the impaired development of cortical neurons, interneurons, and cortical connections in schizophrenia may be instigated by reduced cortico-petal migration of the neuroblasts and immature neurons. In addition, the disruption of cortical neuronal programing in schizophrenia organoids coincided with the presence of the Ki67+ proliferating cells in the CZ, suggesting that these cells have failed to exit the cell cycle and differentiate.</p>
<sec id="Sec20">
<title>Role of FGFR1</title>
<p id="Par58">The impaired cortical development of schizophrenia organoids correlated with a striking loss of nFGFR1 from the CZ cells observed already at 2 weeks and was verified by a statistically significant loss in 5-week organoids of all investigated patients. The loss of nFGFR1 was limited to cortical cells, as FGFR1 remained highly expressed in the VZ and IZ of schizophrenia organoids throughout the 5 weeks of development. Given the well-established role of nFGFR1 in cell differentiation and neuronal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (-reviews), the loss of nFGFR1 from the nuclei of differentiating cortical neuronal cells in schizophrenia organoids likely underlies the impaired neuronal differentiation and cortical maldevelopment observed in schizophrenia. Furthermore, blocking of nFGFR1 in NPCs and NCCs impacted a number of the key ontogenic and neuro-ontogenic gene categories involved in neuronal development, forebrain development, cell adhesion and migration, axon formation, and guidance and in the established neuro-ontogenic pathways. Our genomic analyses also revealed that the loss of nFGFR1 function in NPCs affected several of the reelin signaling genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6c</xref>), which together with the loss of reelin, denotes the malfunctioning reelin mechanism in the schizophrenia cortex.</p>
<p id="Par59">The importance of these genomic findings transcends the current investigation centered on schizophrenia. Demonstration that the developmental gene programs known to be targeted directly by nFGFR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> are indeed regulated by the nuclear receptor, and further substantiates the panontogenic-INFS theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par60">In addition to investigating the loss of nFGFR1 function, our experiments showed that overactive nFGFR1 also affects the neuro-ontogenic programs. Excessive nFGFR1 gene targeting was shown in schizophrenia NPCs during their differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, an over-activation by nFGFR1 of neurodevelopment gene programs in subcortical NPCs could lead to their premature migration and differentiation observed in the subcortical regions of the schizophrenia organoids.</p>
<p id="Par61">Within the list of the nFGFR1-regulated genes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>), ∼75% were previously shown to bind to nFGFR1 in control and/or schizophrenia iPSC-derived differentiating NCCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, the effects of transfected dominant negative and constitutively active nuclear forms of FGFR1 predominantly reflect direct gene control by the nuclear receptor.</p>
<p id="Par62">As nFGFR1 has been designated as a central neuro-ontogenic factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, we propose that the depletion of cortical nFGFR1 in schizophrenia organoids leads to dysregulation of the key neuro-ontogenic programs and, consequently, arrests cortical neuronal development. Indeed, the inhibition of FGFR1 signaling (the predominant FGFR expressed) with PD173074, depleted nFGFR1 in the CZ of control hESC organoids, and inhibited cortical development, similar to as observed in the schizophrenia organoids. The BrdU pulse-chase experiment showed that blocking FGFR1 reduced cortical migration of new born cells and their differentiation to neurons. Furthermore, PD173074 exposes the role of FGFR1 in the formation of doublecortin expressing neuroblasts and TBR1 expressing neuroblasts/pioneer neurons. It also demonstrated the importance of FGFR1 signaling in the development of calretinin interneurons.</p>
<p id="Par63">The early cortical malformations revealed by this organoid study could underlie the disruption of cortical layers, cell paucity, hypoplasia, abnormal connections, and white matter tracks observed in adult schizophrenia brains by pathological examination and/or in vivo imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par64">Why do schizophrenia symptoms appear in adolescence or young adulthood if they are a consequence of early prenatal brain maldevelopment? In schizophrenia patients, the malformations are often found in the prefrontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, in which myelination and maturation occur at the time when the first severe symptoms emerge. As the prefrontal cortex becomes increasingly incorporated into the human brain circuitry, its developmental malformations may reveal itself in a complex clinical syndrome. Perhaps, the most severe forms of childhood schizophrenia, with abundant hallucinations and motor dysfunctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, arise also in the cortical regions, which mature earlier and are home to the sensory and motor functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. These and other compelling questions await further investigation.</p>
<p id="Par65">In the present study, we observed similar anatomical changes in the organoids of all three patients that have distinct genetic backgrounds and DNA sequences, which could be linked to schizophrenia. However, the iPSC-derived NPCs all showed a common disruption of 1376 genes in the developmental transcriptome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, our studies reinforce the watershed model of schizophrenia, whereby different mutations lead to the common dysregulation of the neuro-ontogenic genome and to the common cortical maldevelopment. Our findings designate INFS as a common important mechanism in the disease. According to the model shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>, nFGFR1 hyperactivity leads initially to the excessive migration of proliferating NPCs and then their premature differentiation within subcortical regions. Later, during corticogenesis, turning off nFGFR1 in the schizophrenia cortical cells disrupts their further development. Future investigation, including restoration of INFS in the developing schizophrenia cortex, will test this hypothesis and potentially be used in preventive therapies.</p>
