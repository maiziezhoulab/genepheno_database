<abstract>
<p>The Glymphatic System (GS) has been proposed as a mechanism to clear brain tissue from waste. Its dysfunction might lead to several brain pathologies, including the Alzheimer’s disease. A key component of the GS and brain tissue water circulation is the astrocyte which is regulated by acquaporin-4 (AQP4), a membrane-bound water channel on the astrocytic end-feet. Here we investigated the potential of diffusion MRI to monitor astrocyte activity in a mouse brain model through the inhibition of AQP4 channels with TGN-020. Upon TGN-020 injection, we observed a significant decrease in the Sindex, a diffusion marker of tissue microstructure, and a significant increase of the water diffusion coefficient (sADC) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus compared to saline injection. These results indicate the suitability of diffusion MRI to monitor astrocytic activity in vivo and non-invasively.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proper neuronal function necessitates a highly regulated extracellular environment in the brain. Accumulation of interstitial solutes, such as amyloid β and toxic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref001">1</xref>] may lead to degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref003">3</xref>] or even autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref004">4</xref>]. Although the Blood Brain Barrier is thought to be the primary mechanism involved in controlling the brain blood-exchange, the existence of a fluid driven transport system (so-called glymphatic system) via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or interstitial fluid (ISF) has been proposed recently as a waste clearance system through the perivascular and interstitial spaces in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref005">5</xref>]. Hypothetically, CSF crosses the astrocyte end-feet bound to arteries in the perivascular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref007">7</xref>]. After washing the interstitial space, the resulting ISF is flushed back outside the brain via veins in the perivascular space. Several factors play a crucial role in the modulation of this clearance system activity, notably sleep and anesthesia, perhaps via a modulation of brain blood volume and pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref011">11</xref>]. This scheme gives astrocytes a crucial role in controlling water movements between the blood and the brain, through a mechanism dependent on Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a membrane-bound water channel expressed at their end-feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref013">13</xref>]. AQP4 is involved in the rapid volume regulation of astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref014">14</xref>] and deletion of the AQP4 gene suppresses the clearance of soluble amyloid β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Although most studies have been performed <italic>in vitro</italic>, some studies have shown astrocyte volume changes <italic>in vivo</italic> using 2-photon microscopy. Acute osmotic and ischemic stress induce astrocyte volume changes <italic>in vivo</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref015">15</xref>], and Thrane et al showed that the astrocyte volume change induced by osmotic stimulation was inhibited in AQP4 KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref016">16</xref>]. Overall, such studies suggest that dynamic volume change of astrocytes, through water flux mediated by AQO-4 channels may be associated with CSF flow regulation. Actually, astrocytes end-feet are involved in the CSF/ISF exchanges in perivascular space during sleep/awake cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently MRI has been proposed as a more versatile approach to investigate the glymphatic system in vivo, using intrathecal or intravenous injections of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) as tracers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref018">18</xref>]. However, this approach remains invasive and, paradoxically, gadolinium has been shown to deposit in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref020">20</xref>] possibly in relation to a lack of brain drainage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref010">10</xref>]. Therefore, alternative methods are needed to investigate the glymphatic system non-invasively, especially in the human brain. Fluid-dynamics driven and BOLD fast MRI have the potential to evaluate CSF pulsations in the ventricles and hemodynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref022">22</xref>], while IVIM and diffusion MRI have been shown as promising methods for the evaluation of the ISF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Those considerations led us to investigate whether diffusion MRI was sensitive to astrocyte activity and, in turn, could become a marker of the overall glymphatic system. Diffusion MRI is exquisitely sensitive to changes in tissue microstructure, notably cell swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref028">28</xref>]. Diffusion MRI is, for instance, sensitive to astrocyte swelling induced in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref029">29</xref>]. Hence, we hypothesized that dynamic changes in astrocytes activity and related volume changes could be monitored directly and non-invasively with diffusion MRI. To test this hypothesis we monitored variations of new diffusion MRI markers, namely the Sindex and the sADC, which have been tailored to increase sensitivity to tissue microstructure through water diffusion hindrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref031">31</xref>] upon acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 channels in a mouse brain model using 2-(nicotinamide)-1,3,4-thia-diazole (TGN-020), a compound that blocks AQP4 channels <italic>in vivo</italic> in the mouse brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

<p>Thirty-two male C57BL6 mice (16–28 g, 4–10 weeks, Charles River, France) were allocated to two groups. The choice of a mouse brain model was motivated by prospect of using our protocol later to AQP-4 knock-out mice. First, for the TGN-020 group, 16 mice received an intra-peritoneal injection of 250mg/kg TGN-020 diluted in a gamma-cyclodextrine solution (10 mM) in order to increase its solubility. Second, for the control group, sixteen mice received an intra-peritoneal injection of the vehicle solution only (10 mM gamma-cyclodextrine in saline). The mice were housed on a 12-hour light-dark cycle and fed standard food ad libitum. Anesthesia was induced using 3% isoflurane in a mix of air and oxygen (air: 2 L/min, O2: 0.5 L/min). Then, 0.015 mg/kg of dexmedetomidine was administered intraperitoneally and followed by a continuous infusion of 0.015 mg/kg/h via subcutaneous catheter and maintained isoflurane at 0.8%.</p>
<p>Throughout the acquisition, the animals’ body temperature was maintained between 36.5 and 37.0 °C using heated water (Grant TC120, Grant Instruments, Shepreth, UK). To avoid motion-related artifacts the head was immobilized using a bite bar and ear pins. The respiration rate was monitored and stable (60–90 /min) throughout the experiment.</p>
<p>All animal procedures used in the present study were approved by an institutional Ethic Committee (Comité d’Ethique en Expérimentation Animale, Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives, Direction des Sciences du Vivant (Fontenay-aux-Roses, France)) and by Ministère de l’Education Nationale, de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche (France) (reference APAFIS#8462-2017010915542122v2) and were conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations and guidelines of the European Union (Directive 2010/63/EU).

<title>MRI experiments</title>
<p>The MRI experiments were conducted on a Bruker 11.7T scanner (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a gradient system allowing a maximum gradient strength of 760 mT/m. A cryo-cooled mouse brain coil was used. Animal positioning was performed using multi-slice fast low angle shot imaging (FLASH, TE/TR  =  2.3/120 ms). A global first and second order shim was achieved followed by a local second order shim over the brain parenchyma. Structural (anatomical) images were acquired with the following parameters: T2 TurboRARE sequence, TE/TR = 11.15/2500 ms. Diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DW-EPI) data sets were acquired with the following parameters: 150x150x250 μm<sup>3</sup> resolution, 3 b-values (0, 250, 1750) s/mm<sup>2</sup> along 6 directions, NA = 4, TE/TR = 36.3/2300 ms, 18 slices, diffusion time = 24 ms, total scan time = 5 min. The area covered by the 18 slices of the scans encompassed 5 mm in the axial plane with the center of the slab positioned at the middle of the brain. Six DW-EPI sets were first acquired (baseline) before TGN-020 or vehicle was injected. Then, after the injection, 12 additional DW-EPI data sets were acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229702.g001">Fig 1</xref>) every 5 minutes.</p>

<title>Preprocessing</title>
<p>Regions of interest (ROIs) were originally created using the Allen Brain Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref033">33</xref>] and registered to a mouse brain MRI template to create a labeled atlas. We referred to previous studies based on microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref034">34</xref>] to assess the vascular distribution within the selected brain structures. The atlas was then co-registered with the b = 0 images of the first scans for each subject, and not the other way around to avoid changing raw voxel signals. Those preprocessing steps, also including radiofrequency bias field correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref035">35</xref>] and denoising were performed using ANTs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://stnava.github.io/ANTs/">https://stnava.github.io/ANTs/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229702.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We assumed geometric distortion to be negligible; this condition was qualitatively checked on several mice for all b values. Furthermore, the standard-deviation of the signal intensity across scans was evaluated for each b value and each voxel (after Gaussian smoothing) was estimated as a marker of motion or instability. A threshold of 4% was used to flag unstable voxels. Data sets were at least one of the ROIs contained flagged voxels were discarded.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref037">37</xref>].</p>

<p>First, a shifted ADC (sADC) was computed using signal acquired at two key b values (instead of the standard values of 0 and 1000s/mm<sup>2</sup>), chosen to optimize signal sensitivity to both Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion which is more sensitive to tissue microstructure through hindrance effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref031">31</xref>].

S<sub>N</sub> is taken as an intermediate signal between S<sub>A</sub> and S<sub>B</sub>. SI was then linearly scaled as <italic>Sindex</italic> = (SI+1)*25+25 to be centered at 50. A tissue with status similar to condition A has <italic>Sindex</italic> = 75, while for a status similar to condition B one has <italic>Sindex</italic> = 25. The library of the 2 reference diffusion MRI signals was built in advance from previously acquired data, one representing a generic mouse brain tissue (B) and another derived by simulating a moderate increase in diffusion hindrance (A) using the Kurtosis diffusion model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref031">31</xref>]. For this study, S<sub>A</sub>(Lb) = 0.858; S<sub>A</sub>(Hb) = 0.370; S<sub>B</sub>(Lb) = 0.855; S<sub>B</sub>(Hb) = 0.317. Obviously the Sindex is expected to vary widely across brain regions according to their degree of diffusion hindrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229702.g003">Fig 3</xref>), for instance white matter regions have higher Sindex values than gray matter regions. However, our focus was on the local changes in Sindex values induced by the injection of TGN-020, reflecting local changes in the degree of diffusion hindrance (a decrease in Sindex reflecting a decrease in hindrance). Sindex and sADC were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis to generate parametric maps. Calculation was also performed on a ROI level, averaging signals from all voxels within the ROI. ROIs were placed over the cerebral cortex, the striatum and the hippocampus (whole hippocampus, CA3 region and dentate gyrus, DG). The hippocampus is known to be reached in AQP4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref039">39</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several studies have underlined the potential of Diffusion MRI to investigate the glymphatic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref025">25</xref>]. Astrocytes are considered to play a key role in brain waste clearance through membrane AQP4 channels expressed at their end-feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref012">12</xref>]. The ADC has been proposed as a biomarker of AQP gene expression, as earlier studies have demonstrated that the ADC obtained with high b values was correlated with the amount of increasing expression of AQP1 in glioblastoma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref040">40</xref>]. In this study, we have investigated whether two diffusion MRI markers more sensitive to tissue microstructure than the ADC, namely the Sindex and sADC, could reveal changes in astrocyte activity induced by TGN-020.</p>
<p>Following AQP4 channel inhibition with a TGN-020 solution a decrease in Sindex and increase in sADC were readily observed in the cortex, more in the hippocampus, but not in the striatum, reflecting local differences in astrocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref041">41</xref>] and vascular density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref034">34</xref>]. In the hippocampus changes in Sindex and sADC were larger in DG than in CA3 layer, presumably in line with differences in AQP4 channels expression on astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref039">39</xref>]. However, further validation is required as the baseline Sindex and sADC values were not stable due to the small count in the DG ROI (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Result</xref>). Histological studies would also confirm differences in astrocyte density and volume. Nonetheless, those results suggest that diffusion MRI is sensitive to astrocyte activity and, indirectly, to the status of the glymphatic system. Those diffusion MRI markers provide a higher sensitivity to small changes in tissue features by encompassing in a single marker Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion effects. Furthermore they are easy to calculate and are not diffusion signal model dependent, such as the kurtosis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref031">31</xref>]. The low key b value used in this study was high enough (250 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) to make perfusion-related IVIM effects negligible. Hence the observed changes in the diffusion markers reflect genuine tissue microstructure related diffusion effects and not perfusion effects (cerebral blood flow) which have already been reported observed with TGN-020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref042">42</xref>]. Indeed, acquisition of perfusion-driven IVIM data could be valuable to get information on the vascular distribution which is known to vary across brain structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref034">34</xref>], but this was not possible within our protocol timeframe to guaranty animal stability.</p>
<p>The Sindex decrease and the sADC increase jointly point out to a decrease in the amount of hindrance for water diffusion in astrocyte rich areas (cortex and hippocampus) under acute AQP4 channel inhibition induced by TGN-20. Based on established diffusion MRI mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref028">28</xref>] this hindrance decrease suggests an astrocyte volume reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref044">44</xref>] associated with an increase of the ISF (were diffusion is tortuous) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref045">45</xref>] or an increase in astrocyte membrane permeability and water exchange. Indeed, astrocytes rapidly regulate their volume throughout AQP4 channels. Those results obtained by acute AQP4 inhibition contrast earlier reports using chronic models, such as an ADC decrease observed during AQP4 inhibition with interfering RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref046">46</xref>] or change in ADC in AQP4 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref047">47</xref>]. Beside the higher sensitivity to tissue microstructure of the sADC over the ADC, such discrepancy could possibly result from the modified astrocyte phenotype associated with a long-term inhibition of AQP4 expression found in those previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref048">48</xref>]. The sub-acute or chronic inhibition of AQP4 activity by AQP4-antibodies or small interfering RNA duplexes alter astrocyte morphology and decrease water permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref050">50</xref>] which could result in an ADC decrease. Also, the effects we observed in baseline conditions should be distinguished from those obtained in conditions of neuronal activation for which AQP4 inhibition by extracellular acidification results in astrocyte swelling, capillary lumen expansion and Virchow-Robin space reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref051">51</xref>]. Further studies should aim at precising the mechanisms involved in the observed effects, however histology would require the brain to be fixed, preventing astrocyte volume changes to be monitored before and after TGN-020/saline injection within the same animal. In vivo fluorescent imaging could be used, but only in the cortex. Clearly, the detailed mechanisms underlying acute AQP4 channel inhibition by TGN-20 and chronic AQP4 knockout mice models are lacking. Diffusion MRI has the potential to clarify those mechanisms, notably through non-Gaussian diffusion markers, such as the Sindex and the sADC. Fractional anisotropy (FA) measurements results were not reported as they are relevant only to areas exhibiting diffusion anisotropy, ie, white matter given the spatial resolution of our images. Beside, due to noise FA values are highly corrupted and often reflect mainly variations in underlying ADC (here sADC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Another issue to consider is that our studies were obviously performed under anesthesia. Anesthetic drugs are known to impact intracranial pressure, which could interfere with CSF-ISF exchanges. For instance, dexmedetomidine and ketamine enhance CSF influx alongside perivascular spaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref053">53</xref>]. Moreover, similar to what happens during sleep, anesthesia is associated with a substantial increase in both perivascular and extracellular space volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref054">54</xref>]. Thus, it would be interesting to check whether the effects we have observed with TGN-20 persist in awake animals. A recent study has shown that, while the baseline ADC did not change between anesthetic and awake conditions, DOTA-Gd accumulation was significantly suppressed during anesthesia in contrast enhanced MRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref055">55</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Work remains to better understand the mechanisms involved in brain waste clearance through a so-called glymphatic system and the contribution of astrocytes to this system. The reference method to investigate the glymphatic system in preclinical settings relies on the intracisternal injection of gadolinium in the cisterna magna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref056">56</xref>]. Our results show that changes in astrocyte activity thought to regulate CSF-ISF exchanges, an important component of glymphatic system functionality, could be monitored non-invasively with diffusion MRI, especially through its Sindex metric. Further studies will be required to more directly establish the potential of diffusion MRI to monitor the glymphatic system. Due to its complete non-invasiveness, this new approach could be used for clinical studies to confirm or infirm the existence of such a glymphatic system in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0229702.ref024">24</xref>].</p>

<p>Boxplot and time course of Sindex in the DG (a: boxplot, b: time course) and in the CA3 (c: boxplot, d: time course). Boxplot and time course of sADC in the DG (e: boxplot, f: time course) and in the CA3 (g: boxplot, h: time course). Left, Vehicle group; right TGN-020 group in each figure. Pre, pre-injection (light blue); post, post-injection (dark blue) of vehicle or TGN-020 group in boxplot. *: p&lt;0.05, **: p&lt;0.01, ***: p&lt;0.001 are the result for the paired t-test between pre and post-injection for each group. +: p&lt;0.05, ++: p&lt;0.01, +++: p&lt;0.001 are the result for a t-test with posthoc correction for multiple comparison between post-injection of the two groups. Diamonds represent outliers, a point is defined as an outlier if its value is below Q1–1.5×IQR or above Q3 + 1.5×IQR, where Q1 is the first quartile, Q3 the third quartile and IQR the interquartile range. Blue line is vehicle group and orange line is TGN-020 group. Error bar shows standard deviation. The dashed line represents the injection time. +: p&lt;0.05, ++: p&lt;0.01, +++: p&lt;0.001 by two sample t-test between the two groups for each time point. Note: The voxel count in DG was very small (85 versus 181 in CA3) resulting in very noisy data. The apparent significant difference in sADC and Sindex values between the TGN-020 and saline groups one point before baseline (b, f) might result from an underestimation of the standard-deviation. The difference becomes largely more significant after injections, overcoming any uncertainty in standard-deviation estimates.</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Authors presented a very interesting study, evaluating the utility of diffusion MRI to map glymphatic function, through the modification of the AQP4 expression. This is of high scientific and clinical value, very timely and of high impact.</p>
<p>The experiment is well designed, and the execution is sound. This reviewer has below comments regarding the validity and conclusions. Figures quality/dpi are low!</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>1. The main limitation is interpreting diffusion measures as glymphatic system function. AQP4 is also involved in brain inflammation and regulation of extracellular space volume. How do you know that the observed diffusion changes are related to the glymphatic system?</p>
<p>Even though authors were cautious about the interpretation of their results, they should probably discuss other potential explanations for their findings and adjust their main conclusion accordingly.</p>
<p>2. Authors reported significant differences in both CA3 and DG of the TGN-020 group. How do you explain the DG change, given the mentioned AQP4 abundant?</p>
<p>3. Regarding above comment: Do you have the data (for example SWI or high resolution T2) to identify regions with high vascular presence to look at the S_i and sADC changes on those area? That could potentially help identify the underlying AQP4 involvement.</p>
<p>4. Based on ref [36]: “AQP4 protein levels were highest in the cerebellum with lower expression in the cortex and hippocampus.” This suggests that the cerebellum should have been a major ROI in this study. Why cerebellum is not included?</p>
<p>5. Figures have extremely low quality (for example Figures 4 and 5). I could only guess the labels and axes.</p>
<p>6. It seems rather strange to have (significant) differences prior to injection (e.g. Fig 5.h)? This needs to be addressed. One would expect to see no difference whatsoever.</p>
<p>7. In favor with reported findings, below paper showed that diffusion MRI is affected by perivascular space fluid presence, which should be cited:</p>
<p>Sepehrband, F., Cabeen, R. P., Choupan, J., Barisano, G., Law, M., Toga, A. W., &amp; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. (2019). Perivascular space fluid contributes to diffusion tensor imaging changes in white matter. NeuroImage, 197, 243-254.</p>
<p>8. Not in favor of reported finding, below study reported “we failed to detect a significant change in the brain extracellular water volume using diffusion weighted imaging in awake and anesthetized mice.” This paper also should be cited/discussed:</p>
<p>Gakuba, C., Gaberel, T., Goursaud, S., Bourges, J., Di Palma, C., Quenault, A., ... &amp; Gauberti, M. (2018). General anesthesia inhibits the activity of the “glymphatic system”. Theranostics, 8(3), 710.</p>
<p>9. Another paper that links diffusion changes to glymphatic system is below, which also could be cited:</p>
<p>Thomas, C., Sadeghi, N., Nayak, A., Trefler, A., Sarlls, J., Baker, C. I., &amp; Pierpaoli, C. (2018). Impact of time-of-day on diffusivity measures of brain tissue derived from diffusion tensor imaging. Neuroimage, 173, 25-34.</p>
<p>A minor comment:</p>
<p>1. Page 11, line 251: “peculiar to this this brain” -&gt; “peculiar to this brain”</p>
<p>2. Please report the age of the mice, in each group (maybe it is reported somewhere, but I couldn’t find it).</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this paper the dynamic changes of astrocyte activity were investigated using DWI in 32 mice by inhibiting AQP4 channels with a TGN-020 solution. Two novel DWI measures were used to study the results which show a significant decrease in the Sindex, a diffusion marker of tissue microstructure, and a significant increase of the water diffusion coefficient (sADC) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus compared to saline injection.</p>
<p>Developing reliable non-invasive biomarkers for the glymphatic system is important for translational studies. This study has done a great job to introduce such biomarkers. However, it may need some more work to improve the study.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>1- In addition to sindex, the authors could use FA for comparison or at least confirming (in a few sentences) that FA is not showing the trend seen in sindex.</p>
<p>2- Why mice were chosen? Rats have bigger brain and therefore the imaging could be easier.</p>
<p>3- Histology analyses of the mice after imaging could be so helpful in confirming the study outcomes.</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>Line 16: “We assumed no change of position among the different scans during acquisitions for each mouse and geometric distortion with b values to be negligible; this condition was qualitatively checked on several mice.” Why not using motion correction to compensate for animal movement during the imaging?</p>
<p>Line 119: “Furthermore, signal instabilities were quantitatively evaluated for each subject and subjects exhibiting instabilities above 4% for most voxels were eliminated.” Could you please explain more?</p>
<p>Line 156: Please mention in Fig3 caption the time point of the displayed maps? I assume the maps correspond to the averaged 6 time points of the pre injection and the last 6 time points after the injection.</p>
<p>Line 251: There is an extra “this”.</p>

<p>Editor comment</p>
<p>1. How do you know that the observed diffusion changes are related to the glymphatic system?</p>
<p>The existence of the glymphatic system is controversial. Our results do not aim at demonstrating the existence or not of a glymphatic system. However, if we admit that such a system exists it has been strongly suggested in the literature (REF XXX) that astrocytes must play a major role, and, in turn, AQP4 channels expressed by astrocytes. The aim of our work is to show that the modulation of astrocyte activity by TGN-020 which is known as a AQP4 channel blocker can be monitored with diffusion MRI and in particular the Sindex, that’s all. The Discussion and Conclusion have been revised to make this point clear. </p>
<p>2. How do you explain the DG change, given the mentioned AQP4 abundant?</p>
<p>The density of AQP4 receptors in DG is higher than in the other regions we have investigated. Indeed, the larger sADC and Sindex change observed in DG under TGN-020 administration is an indirect proof that TGN-020 acted on astrocyte AQP4 channels. The Discussion has been revised accordingly.</p>
<p>3. Do you have the data to identify regions with high vascular presence to look at the Si and sADC changes on those area?</p>
<p>A relevant parameter could be, indeed, the density of small vessels. Such vessels are not visible even within the high resolution T2-weighted images we acquired using Turbo RARE (see Methods and Figure 2). Such vessels would require the additional acquisition of perfusion MRI data, such as IVIM MRI, which could not be done during the acquisition time window our anesthetic protocol permitted. Hence, we relied on previous studies reporting the vascular distribution across brain structures using microscopy (ref 40).</p>
<p>4. In addition to sindex, the authors could use FA for comparison.</p>
<p>FA is relevant to assess diffusion anisotropy which is present only in whiter matter at the resolution of our images (not in the cortex). The Sindex (and the sADC) is a much more relevant parameter. Furthermore, as explained in a recent article (Iima at al. European Radiology, 2020), FA values are highly sensitive to noise and, in turn, to ADC (or sADC) values. Variations in FA would thus reflect the changes we have observed in sADC values more than genuine changes in diffusion anisotropy.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Authors presented a very interesting study, evaluating the utility of diffusion MRI to map glymphatic function, through the modification of the AQP4 expression. This is of high scientific and clinical value, very timely and of high impact.</p>
<p>The experiment is well designed, and the execution is sound. This reviewer has below comments regarding the validity and conclusions. Figures quality/dpi are low!</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>1. The main limitation is interpreting diffusion measures as glymphatic system function. AQP4 is also involved in brain inflammation and regulation of extracellular space volume. How do you know that the observed diffusion changes are related to the glymphatic system?</p>
<p>Even though authors were cautious about the interpretation of their results, they should probably discuss other potential explanations for their findings and adjust their main conclusion accordingly.</p>
<p>The existence of the glymphatic system is controversial. Our results do not aim at demonstrating the existence or not of a glymphatic system. However, if we admit that such a system exists it has been strongly suggested in the literature (Illif et al, Sci Transl Med, 2012,) that astrocytes must play a major role system (Mestre et al, eLife, 2018), and, in turn, AQP4 channels expressed by astrocytes (Ikeshima-Kataoka et al, Int J Mol Sci, 2016). The aim of our work is to show that the modulation of astrocyte activity by TGN-020 which is known as a AQP4 channel blocker can be monitored with diffusion MRI and in particular the Sindex, that’s all. Further studies will be required to establish the potential of diffusion MRI to monitor the glymphatic system. The Discussion and Conclusion have been revised to make this point clear. </p>
<p>2. Authors reported significant differences in both CA3 and DG of the TGN-020 group. How do you explain the DG change, given the mentioned AQP4 abundant?</p>
<p>The density of AQP4 receptors in DG is higher than in the other regions we have investigated (Hsu et al, Neuroscience, 2011; Hubbard et al, ASN Neuro, 2015). Indeed, the larger sADC and Sindex change observed in DG under TGN-020 administration is an indirect proof that TGN-020 acted on astrocyte AQP4 channels. However, as we explain in the response to comment#6, the baseline of DG was not stable due to the smaller voxel size. We need higher resolution image for the validation of Sindex changes in DG. The Discussion has been revised accordingly.</p>
<p>3. Regarding above comment: Do you have the data (for example SWI or high resolution T2) to identify regions with high vascular presence to look at the S_i and sADC changes on those area? That could potentially help identify the underlying AQP4 involvement.</p>
<p>We agree that a relevant parameter could be, indeed, the density of small vessels. Such vessels are not visible even within the high resolution T2-weighted images we acquired using Turbo RARE (see Methods and Figure 2). Such vessels would require the additional acquisition of perfusion MRI data, such as IVIM MRI, which could not be done during the acquisition time window our anesthetic protocol permitted. Hence, we relied on previous studies reporting the vascular distribution across brain structures using microscopy (Xiong et al, Front Neuroanat, 2017).</p>
<p>4. Based on ref [36]: “AQP4 protein levels were highest in the cerebellum with lower expression in the cortex and hippocampus.” This suggests that the cerebellum should have been a major ROI in this study. Why cerebellum is not included?</p>
<p>We did not have a full brain coverage including the cerebellum due to the limitation of the scanning time (scanning time is determined by number of slices). Instead, we investigated the hippocampus because AQP4 expresses abundantly in this region (Hsu et al, Neuroscience, 2011; Hubbard et al, ASN Neuro, 2015).</p>
<p>5. Figures have extremely low quality (for example Figures 4 and 5). I could only guess the labels and axes.</p>
<p>We are sorry for the very low quality of Figure 4 and 5 which probably resulted from the PDF conversion. Revised figures were uploaded after checking quality with the digital diagnostic tool of PLOS: , <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/</ext-link>.</p>
<p>6. It seems rather strange to have (significant) differences prior to injection (e.g. Fig 5.h)? This needs to be addressed. One would expect to see no difference whatsoever.</p>
<p>Because the volume of DG is smaller than cerebral cortex and striatum, the Sindex and sADC in DG were noisier rather than these regions. (The number of voxel size in DG, CA3, hippocampus, striatum, cortex is respectively: 85, 181, 763, 2069 and 8270) This is the reason why baseline of Sindex and sADC in DG was not stable. We decided to move DG and CA3 from the manuscript to supplementary data, instead we have used whole hippocampal region for the main figure. We described the instability in DG and CA3 in the Results section. </p>
<p>7. In favor with reported findings, below paper showed that diffusion MRI is affected by perivascular space fluid presence, which should be cited:</p>
<p>Sepehrband, F., Cabeen, R. P., Choupan, J., Barisano, G., Law, M., Toga, A. W., &amp; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. (2019). Perivascular space fluid contributes to diffusion tensor imaging changes in white matter. NeuroImage, 197, 243-254.</p>
<p>We have added this reference in Introduction (Reference 26).</p>
<p>8. Not in favor of reported finding, below study reported “we failed to detect a significant change in the brain extracellular water volume using diffusion weighted imaging in awake and anesthetized mice.” This paper also should be cited/discussed:</p>
<p>Gakuba, C., Gaberel, T., Goursaud, S., Bourges, J., Di Palma, C., Quenault, A., ... &amp; Gauberti, M. (2018). General anesthesia inhibits the activity of the “glymphatic system”. Theranostics, 8(3), 710.</p>
<p>This article compared the ADC and intracerebral accumulation of DOTA-Gd injected in intracisternal site in awaked and anesthetized state. The suppressed accumulation of DOTA-Gd was observed in anesthetized state compared with awaked state, while ADC was not changed between awaked and anesthetized sate. The DOTA-Gd increased the SNR when they accumulated for long time (30-60 min for accumulation in the study) and acquisition has been done under anesthesia. In contrast, diffusion MRI has been performed in awaked and anesthetized condition. The diffusion MRI could be influenced by the head motion and respiration, which could be more significant in awaked state. This potentially interferes ADC measurement to reduce the sensitivity. Further study to improve the sensitivity is required to assess the potential of diffusion MRI to detect the awaked and anesthetized state. We have described this article in Discussion.</p>
<p>9. Another paper that links diffusion changes to glymphatic system is below, which also could be cited:</p>
<p>Thomas, C., Sadeghi, N., Nayak, A., Trefler, A., Sarlls, J., Baker, C. I., &amp; Pierpaoli, C. (2018). Impact of time-of-day on diffusivity measures of brain tissue derived from diffusion tensor imaging. Neuroimage, 173, 25-34.</p>
<p>We thank for these valuable references. We agree that those references would be helpful for the readers to better understand and appreciate our results. This has been cited as reference 27.</p>
<p>A minor comment:</p>
<p>1. Page 11, line 251: “peculiar to this this brain” -&gt; “peculiar to this brain”</p>
<p>We have corrected this typo.</p>
<p>2. Please report the age of the mice, in each group (maybe it is reported somewhere, but I couldn’t find it).</p>
<p>We used the mice aged 4-10 weeks in each group. The age of mice has been added into the Material and Methods part of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this paper the dynamic changes of astrocyte activity were investigated using DWI in 32 mice by inhibiting AQP4 channels with a TGN-020 solution. Two novel DWI measures were used to study the results which show a significant decrease in the Sindex, a diffusion marker of tissue microstructure, and a significant increase of the water diffusion coefficient (sADC) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus compared to saline injection.</p>
<p>Developing reliable non-invasive biomarkers for the glymphatic system is important for translational studies. This study has done a great job to introduce such biomarkers. However, it may need some more work to improve the study.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>1- In addition to sindex, the authors could use FA for comparison or at least confirming (in a few sentences) that FA is not showing the trend seen in sindex.</p>
<p>FA is relevant to assess diffusion anisotropy which is present only in whiter matter at the resolution of our images. The Sindex (and the sADC) is a much more relevant parameter. Furthermore, as explained in a recent article (Iima at al. European Radiology, 2020), FA values are highly sensitive to noise and, in turn, to ADC (or sADC) values. Variations in FA would thus reflect the changes we have observed in sADC values more than genuine changes in diffusion anisotropy.</p>
<p>2- Why mice were chosen? Rats have bigger brain and therefore the imaging could be easier.</p>
<p>We chose mice instead of rats because our diffusion MRI protocol could be applicable in the future to investigate AQP-4 KO mice. There is no such transgenic model for rats. Also, our MRI setup includes a cryoprobe dedicated to mouse head imaging, which increases the SNR and contrast. This specific coil is too small for rat heads. </p>
<p>3- Histology analyses of the mice after imaging could be so helpful in confirming the study outcomes.</p>
<p>We agree that histology would have been a nice addition to confirm volume changes of astrocytes in the different groups (TGN-020 group and vehicle group). However, such tests require the brain to be fixed, hence they cannot be performed to check volume changes before and after TGN-020 (or saline) injection within the same animal. Another method to monitor astrocyte volume could be in vivo fluorescent imaging, but this method can be applied only in the cortex. Those issues have been added to the Discussion.</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>Line 16: “We assumed no change of position among the different scans during acquisitions for each mouse and geometric distortion with b values to be negligible; this condition was qualitatively checked on several mice.” Why not using motion correction to compensate for animal movement during the imaging?</p>
<p>Motion correction is tricky when considering quantitative diffusion MRI as motion algorithms work on the reconstructed images. Especially, as acquisitions are performed with specific orientations of the diffusion-probing gradient pulses in space any rotation in the reconstructed images would not reflect genuine signal changes which would have occurred if the diffusion-probing gradient pulses had rotated in the same way. Instead, we decided to simply reject data sets were motion was too large (&gt;4%) using a semi-quantitative index based on signal stability across successive scans. We agree that the text was not clear and we have revised it.</p>
<p>Line 119: “Furthermore, signal instabilities were quantitatively evaluated for each subject and subjects exhibiting instabilities above 4% for most voxels were eliminated.” Could you please explain more?</p>
<p>The standard-deviation of the signal intensity across scans was evaluated for each b value and each voxel (after Gaussian smoothing) was estimated. A threshold of 4% was used flag unstable voxels. . Data sets were one of the ROIs have only flagged voxels were discarded. </p>
<p>Line 156: Please mention in Fig3 caption the time point of the displayed maps? I assume the maps correspond to the averaged 6 time points of the pre injection and the last 6 time points after the injection.</p>
<p>We have added in the legend of the figure 3 that the maps correspond to the mean of the 6 last time points.</p>
<p>Line 251: There is an extra “this”.</p>
<p>We have corrected this typo.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Authors responded to the raised issues and addressed reviewer’s concern.</p>
<p>One point that remained unaddressed is the general assumption. The author states that “The aim of our work is to show that the modulation of astrocyte activity by TGN-020 which is known as a AQP4 channel blocker can be monitored with diffusion MRI and in particular the Sindex, that’s all.”</p>
<p>But throughout the paper the text suggests that that’s not all. For example, the abstract says</p>
<p>“The Glymphatic System (GS) has been proposed as a mechanism to clear brain tissue from waste. Its dysfunction might lead to several brain pathologies, including the Alzheimer’disease. A key component of the GS and brain tissue water circulation is the astrocyte which is regulated by acquaporin-4 (AQP4), a membrane-bound water channel on the astrocytic end-feet.”</p>
<p>Well, clearly the author is relating this to glymphatic system. Yet, relating this to glymphatic system is not the main concern. If one can measure astrocyte activity, it’s not unreasonable to relate it to glymphatic system. The main concern is that AQP-4 is not only involved in modulation of astrocyte activity. It is also involved in the brain inflammatory response and also in the regulation of the extracellular volume. Both of these could affect diffusion signal. Blocking AQP-4 could lead to inflammation or changes in the extracellular fluid which affect the diffusion signal. Therefore, what you observe here may have nothing to do with the astrocyte activity. This limitation should be addressed.</p>
<p>PS. Regarding DG, if the data is noisy, it should lead to higher standard deviation not a systematic group mean difference.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The authors resolved well my concerns about their work and made the manuscript more clear. I have no other question to add.</p>

This limitation should be addressed.</p>
<p>PS. Regarding DG, if the data is noisy, it should lead to higher standard deviation not a systematic group mean difference</p>
<p>� The statement about the Glymphatic System in the abstract and the introduction is only to explain our general motivation to conduct our study of the potential of diffusion MRI to monitor astrocyte activity. It is not a claim that the GS exists (we believe we have been careful in the manuscript about this fact). We only briefly review the literature to shade light on the context of the study and indicate why investigating astrocyte activity might be important. We are aware that TGN-020 effects are not specific to astrocytes, as stated in the manuscript. Effects on the brain inflammatory response can be discarded given the time course of the effects we have observed. Regarding the extracellular space (ISF) effects on the diffusion MRI would result only from changes in diffusion hindrance/tortuosity (fluid flow is well too slow to result in IVIM effects, this has been shown by other groups, furthermore the Sindex was purposely calculated using the lowest key b value 250s/mm² to make residual IVIM effects completely negligible). Hence, variations in extracellular space shape and volume only reflect changes in the local cellular background (a kind of negative imprint). The decrease in Sindex (and sADC increase) points out to decrease in the amount of diffusion hindrance from astrocytes (which is by far the dominant cell type in the regions where we observed the largest response). As stated in the discussion “Based on established diffusion MRI mechanisms [28] this hindrance decrease suggests an astrocyte volume reduction [43,44] associated with an increase of the ISF (were diffusion is tortuous) [45] or an increase in astrocyte membrane permeability and water exchange”. We believe that this statement about the mechanism leading to our observation is correct and broad enough, and the manuscript was not changed.</p>
<p>� Regarding the DG, the data are, indeed, very noisy given the very small voxel count. The apparent group difference may just be coincidental as the standard-deviation cannot be accurately estimated precisely given the small voxel count. We realize that this might be puzzling, but, for scientific integrity, we decided not to “hide” those results but to show them. A note has been added to the caption of SuppL Fig.1.</p>
