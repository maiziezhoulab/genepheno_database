<abstract>
<p>Variants implicated in childhood epilepsy have been identified in all four voltage-gated sodium channels that initiate action potentials in the central nervous system. Previous research has focused on the functional effects of particular variants within the most studied of these channels (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6); however, there have been few comparative studies across channels to infer the impact of mutations in patients with epilepsy. Here we compare patterns of variation in patient and public databases to test the hypothesis that regions of known functional significance within voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channels have an increased burden of deleterious variants. We assessed mutational burden in different regions of the Na<sub>v</sub> channels by (1) performing Fisher exact tests on odds ratios to infer excess variants in domains, segments, and loops of each channel in patient databases <italic>versus</italic> public “control” databases, and (2) comparing the cumulative distribution of variant sites along DNA sequences of each gene in patient and public databases (i.e., independent of protein structure). Patient variant density was concordant among channels in regions known to play a role in channel function, with statistically significant higher patient variant density in S4-S6 and DIII-DIV and an excess of public variants in SI-S3, DI-DII, DII-DIII. On the other hand, channel-specific patterns of patient burden were found in the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 inactivation gate and Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 S5-S6 linkers, while Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 S4-S5 linkers and S5 segments shared patient variant patterns that contrasted with those in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1. These different patterns may reflect different roles played by the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 inactivation gate in action potential propagation, and by Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 S5-S6 linkers in loss of function and haploinsufficiency. Interestingly, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 both lack amino acid substitutions over significantly long stretches in both the patient and public databases suggesting that new mutations in these regions may cause embryonic lethality or a non-epileptic disease phenotype.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Variants in all four brain-expressed voltage-gated sodium channels, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, have been associated with epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref003">3</xref>]. While these genes are widely expressed in the cerebral cortex, deep brain nuclei, hippocampus, and cerebellum, their expression patterns differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref004">4</xref>]. Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is predominantly localized to the proximal dendrites and soma of excitatory neurons, and the axon-initiating segment (AIS) of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons. This channel is believed to play a major role in controlling network excitability through the activation of inhibitory circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref001">1</xref>]. Also localized in dendrites and soma, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 is expressed in the proximal AIS and in axons of unmyelinated neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref001">1</xref>]. This channel is predominantly expressed in the neocortex and hippocampus in excitatory neurons, yet has also been reported in somatostatin-positive inhibitory interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref003">3</xref>]. Shortly after birth, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is expressed at nodes of Ranvier in multiple neuronal classes and glia across the cortex, hippocampus, brain stem and cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref004">4</xref>]. Highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is concentrated at the AIS in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and at nodes of Ranvier in myelinated neurons, where it mediates the initiation and propagation of action potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref001">1</xref>]. Mutations in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 have been associated with epilepsy exhibiting a wide spectrum of severity, including Dravet syndrome and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref003">3</xref>]. Mutations in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 have also been associated with GEFS+ and benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures (BFNIS), as well as autism and a more severe form of epileptic encephalopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref003">3</xref>]. Also having a broad range of severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref005">5</xref>], variants in Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 were initially found to be associated with an epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE13) characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Knowledge of the roles that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels play in epilepsy has increased greatly in the past decade, yet the ability to predict the clinical outcome of a variant in any of these channels remains an unmet and important challenge. To aid in the interpretation of the pathological significance of Na<sub>V</sub> variants, we sought to investigate associations across the protein between functionality and the distribution of variants using both public and patient databases. Previous literature has focused on the variant distribution within a single channel to evaluate channel specific properties, we however, are among the first to analyze the variant distribution of three Na<sub>V</sub> channels to find both common and unique patterns among these three sodium channels.</p>

<title>Variant database</title>
<p>We made use of a database of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 missense variants from 758 patients with SCN1A-related epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref007">7</xref>] including 661 with Dravet Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref008">8</xref>]. Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 missense variants from Wolff et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref009">9</xref>] were included in our analysis, as were additional variants found in a PubMed literature search between June 2016 and October 2018 utilizing the term ‘scn2a’. For Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 mutations, we included 54 variants from the SCN8A registry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref010">10</xref>], as well as 70 additional published variants. For sequence comparisons, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, 1.2, and 1.6 sequences were aligned with Uniprot. The Institutional Review Board at the University of Arizona approved the SCN8A registry. The human subjects committee approved an online informed consenting process. Informed consent for minors was obtained from parents. This study also used data generated by DECIPHER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://decipher.sanger.ac.uk">http://decipher.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>). To compare distributions of variants in the above-mentioned databases with those from individuals not known to be affected with pediatric disease, we utilized the Genome Aggregation database (gnomAD), which includes 123,136 exomes and 15,496 genomes from a total of 138,632 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref011">11</xref>].

<title>Definition of low and high functionality regions in channels</title>
<p>A summary of the functionality of specific Na<sub>V</sub> regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref012">12</xref>] is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238121.s007">S3 Table</xref>. Ishii et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref013">13</xref>] noted a relatively sharp boundary between the first and second halves of both the N- and C- termini of <italic>SCN1A</italic> Dravet syndrome missense variants, which provided motivation to separately investigate each region of the Na<sub>V</sub> channel termini in this study. The S3-S4 linker has been shown to contain binding sites for channel modulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref014">14</xref>] and therefore was not placed in either functionality group. The remaining regions were placed into the high functionality category if disruption of their function could cause a foreseeable impact on the rate at which sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions move into the cell.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Fisher tests were calculated for each Na<sub>V</sub> channel region comparing the proportion of patient <italic>versus</italic> public variants included in the gnomAD database in that particular region. To avoid issues with multiple comparisons we focused our discussion of significant results for those cases where the p-value was below 0.0001. The Fisher test provided p-values for odds ratios, which were calculated for each Na<sub>V</sub> channel region. The Anderson-Darling test was used to provide a measure of agreement among the variant cumulative distribution functions. The empirical cumulative distribution of variant sites along the DNA sequence of each sodium channel provides insights into common properties of a segment that may not necessarily adhere to the protein structure of segments, linkers, loops and termini. Moreover, all of the Fisher tests and the Anderson-Darling tests can be computed from the cumulative distributions. Under an assumption of uniformly distributed variants, if a contiguous sequence of cDNA had a lower than 1% probability of containing no variants, then the section was designated “flat”. Under the same assumptions we constructed a “lethality test” to test against a null hypothesis of non-lethality. Those with an excess of variants were denoted as “steep”. This results in four possible labels for a given contiguous sequence of amino acids for comparisons between patient and public databases; lethal = flat/flat, pathogenic = steep/flat, complex = steep/steep, and benign = flat/steep.</p>
<p>For those sections that had no variants in either the public or patient databases (flat/flat), the absence of variants leads to the presumption that variants in this section are lethal or are associated with a phenotype that precludes inclusion in either the patient or public databases. If we encounter a section that has only patient variants (steep/flat), we call the segment pathogenic. Sections that have only mutations in public individuals (flat/steep) are likely tolerant to variants. Finally, if a section has variants from both groups (steep/steep), then a more complex explanation is necessary to describe the pattern of variant distribution (e.g., mingling of pathogenic and benign variants).</p>

<title>Variant density in low and high functionality regions</title>
<p>We counted the number of variants in each segment, loop, and linker in all three sodium channels relative to the total number of variants in the patient and public databases (data not shown). The majority of variants in the public databases were located in the loops (DI-DII and DII-DIII), followed by the C-terminus and the N-terminus. We rejected the null hypothesis of a uniform distribution for each of the Na<sub>V</sub> channels in both the patient and public databases (Anderson-Darling: Na<sub>V</sub>1.1: patient p = 1.12 x 10<sup>−6</sup>, public p = 9.69 x 10<sup>−7</sup>; Na<sub>V</sub>1.2: patient p = 3.03 x 10<sup>−6</sup>, public p = 1.23 x 10<sup>−6</sup>; and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6: patient p = 4.84 x 10<sup>−6</sup>, public p = 1.54 x 10<sup>−6</sup>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g001">Fig 1</xref> depicts the cumulative distribution of both patient and public data for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 as an example (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238121.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238121.s002">S2</xref> Figs for the cumulative distributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 variants). Additionally, as a measure of similarity of the distributions, we conducted pairwise tests between patient databases (Anderson-Darling: Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 <italic>versus</italic> Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 p = 0.40; Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 <italic>versus</italic> Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 p = 0.21; Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 <italic>versus</italic> Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 p = 0.30 and public databases (Anderson-Darling: Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 <italic>versus</italic> Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 p = 2.02 x 10<sup>−2</sup>; Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 <italic>versus</italic> Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 p = 0.11; Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 <italic>versus</italic> 1.6 p = 0.33). Thus, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 show greater overall similarity in the distribution of variants in the public databases.</p>

<p>In testing for the relative excess of patient or public variants in different channel regions when simultaneously comparing all three channels, we find that the variant distributions between low and high functionality regions are strongly significantly different (Mantel-Haenszel test p = 2.2 x 10<sup>−16</sup>). For pairwise comparisons, we performed a series of Fisher tests on odds ratios (OR). In considering the entire gene, this ratio was higher (OR = 19.07; Fisher test p = 2.2 x 10<sup>−16</sup>) for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 patient variants in high functionality regions. The high functionality pattern also exists in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 (OR = 10.56; Fisher test p = 2.90 x 10<sup>−7</sup>) and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (OR = 26.01; Fisher test p = 1.37 x 10<sup>−6</sup>). Correspondingly, it follows that public variants had a higher OR in low functionality regions.</p>
<p>We then conducted a similar analysis on low functionality loops, segments, and linkers. We found a higher OR for public variants within the DI-DII loop of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (OR = 15.14, 6.01, 6.69 respectively; Fisher tests p = 2.2 x 10<sup>−16</sup> in all cases). Public variants also had a higher OR in the DII-DIII loop for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (OR = 9.46, 4.67, 7.91 respectively; Fisher tests, p = 2.2 x 10<sup>−16</sup>, 6.03 x 10<sup>−8</sup>, and 8.35 x 10<sup>−7</sup> respectively). Interestingly, patient variants had 3.53 higher OR within S3 segments for Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (Fisher test, p = 7.4 x 10<sup>−3</sup>). The remaining segments and linkers in the low functionality group had OR that were not found to be statistically significant.</p>
<p>The high functionality regions showed higher concordance among the channels, with patient variants having a higher OR in S4, S5, and S6 segments and the S4-S5 linker. Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 variants in the S5-S6 linker had an OR that was 11.82-fold higher for patient variants (Fisher test, p = 2.2 x 10<sup>−16</sup>) and only Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 had a higher OR of patient variants within the inactivation gate (OR = 18.05; Fisher test, p = 8.19 x 10<sup>−6</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0238121.t001">Table 1</xref>

<title>Distributional patterns of variants in loops and termini</title>
<p>We used cumulative distribution analyses to examine patterns of variant distribution within the intracellular loops and the N- and C-termini for all three channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238121.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238121.s002">S2</xref> Figs). The biphasic pattern previously reported for the N-terminus of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref013">13</xref>] was also apparent for Dravet patients in the current analysis; i.e., the patient/public slopes exhibited a benign (i.e., flat/steep) pattern in the 5`end and a complex (steep/steep) pattern at the 3`end of the N-terminus. In contrast, there was a complex (i.e., steep/steep) pattern in the 5’ end of the C-terminus and a benign pattern in the 3’ end of the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g003">Fig 3</xref>). For Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, there was not a simple biphasic pattern in either the N- or C- terminus; however, in general the N-terminus was mostly benign while in the C-terminus there was an ‘island’ of sequence with a complex pattern in the midst of sequence characterized by the benign pattern for most of the remaining C-terminus. The Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 N- and C-termini had a very similar pattern as Na<sub>V</sub>1.2.</p>

<p>The first two intracellular loops for all three channels were dominated by a benign pattern; albeit with varying numbers of short stretches of complex patterns dotting the loop sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Unlike the patterns in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 or Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, the 5’ two-thirds of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 inactivation gate was characterized by a pathogenic (i.e., steep/flat) pattern that began in S6<sub>DIII</sub>. This region was flanked by sequence exhibiting the lethal (i.e, flat/flat) pattern in S6<sub>DIII</sub> and in the last third of the inactivation gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the suggestion in Ishii et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref013">13</xref>], we divide the Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 N- and C-termini into sections according to the boundaries of high and low variant density observed in the cumulative distribution analysis and re-confirm several strongly significant results; the first 57aa contained a larger number of public <italic>versus</italic> patient variants (2 patient and 30 public) (OR = 0.08, Fisher test p = 4.56 x 10<sup>−6</sup>), while the remaining 66aa had a larger number of patient <italic>versus</italic> public variants (42 patient and 16 public) (OR = 9.52, Fisher test p = 4.86 x 10<sup>−16</sup>. The C-terminus displayed the opposite pattern with the initial 100 aa containing a larger number of patient variants (23 patient and 36 public) (OR = 2.78, Fisher test p = 7.77 x 10<sup>−6</sup>) and the remaining 123 aa with a higher number of public variants (3 patient and 68 public) (OR = 0.05, Fisher test p = 1.83 x 10<sup>−14</sup>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, this pattern is less strong at the extreme parts of the termini upon the addition of the 97 mild Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 variants. For the first 57aa (2 patient and 29 public) the OR increases to 0.19 (p = 0.012). The distinction in variant density remains very strong for the remaining 66aa variants (46 patient and 16 public) (OR = 9.07, Fisher test p = 3.13 x 10<sup>−16</sup>. Similarly, for the C terminus, we have for the initial 100 aa (29 patient and 36 public variants) we have OR = 2.84 (p = 6.47 x 10<sup>−5</sup>). For the remaining 123 aa, six mild variants give a total of 9 patient variants and 68 public variants (OR 2.24, p = 1.89 x 10<sup>−3</sup>). The comparative enrichment of mild variants in the termini can be seen in the comparison of cumulative distribution function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238121.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar but much weaker pattern emerged when we divided the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 N- and C- termini sequences. The most significant result in this region was the 3`end of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 C-terminus, which had a 102aa stretch of mainly public variants (1 patient and 32 public) (OR = 0.091; Fisher test p = 1.37 x 10<sup>−3</sup>).</p>
<p>For the inactivation gate, the only strongly significant finding across all three channels was an excess of patient variants in the first 26 aa in Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (8 patient and 0 public) (OR = Infinite; Fisher test p = 1.31 x 10<sup>−5</sup>). Interestingly, we did not observe a similar signal in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2.</p>

<title>Distributional patterns of variants within domains</title>
<p>Regions of lethality were present in all three channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These represent regions that would not become apparent when conducting Fisher tests because they contain no patient or public variants. In Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, statistically significant lethal regions were present in S1<sub>DI</sub> to S2<sub>DI</sub> (aa length = 16; lethality test p = 5.54 x 10<sup>−4</sup>), S1<sub>DII</sub> (aa length = 14; lethality test p = 1.42 x 10<sup>−3</sup>), S5-S6<sub>DII</sub> (aa length = 13; lethality test p = 2.27 x 10<sup>−3</sup>), and the 3’ stretch of the C-terminus (aa length = 15; lethality test p = 8.87 x 10<sup>−4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The longest lethal pattern in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 occurred in the S1<sub>DI</sub> to S2<sub>DI</sub> region (16 aa) and was 87.5% (14/16) conserved between all three channels. In Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, the statistically significant lethal regions occurred in S5<sub>DI</sub> to S5-S6<sub>DI</sub> (aa length = 19; lethality test p = 6.84 x 10<sup>−4</sup>), S6<sub>DI</sub> (aa length = 18; lethality test p = 1.00 x 10<sup>−3</sup>), and the inactivation gate (aa length = 40; lethality test p = 2.17 x 10<sup>−7</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The longest stretch of lethality for Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 occurred in the S5-S6<sub>DIV</sub> region which is highly conserved among all three channels (92.5%–37/40). For Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, statistically significant lethal regions were on average longer and were present in S2-S3<sub>DII</sub> to S3<sub>DII</sub> (aa length = 25; lethality test p = 8.24 x 10<sup>−4</sup>), S5-S6<sub>DII</sub> to S6<sub>DII</sub> (aa length = 50; lethality test p = 6.79 x 10<sup>−7</sup>), S3-S4<sub>DIII</sub> to S4<sub>DIII</sub> (aa length = 27; lethality test p = 4.67 x 10<sup>−4</sup>), and S5-S6<sub>DIV</sub> (aa length = 37; lethality test p = 2.73 x 10<sup>−5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The longest stretch of lethality for Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 occurred from the S5-S6 linker to S6 segment in domain DII. This 50 aa stretch is highly conserved among all three channels (90%–45/50).</p>
<p>Additionally, there were two instances in which the lethal regions between channels overlapped. The first occurred in the S5-S6<sub>DIV</sub> linker between Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6, which were both statistically significant lethal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The second instance occurred in the C-terminus where Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 individually overlapped with Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 lethality; however, the stretch of lethality was only found to be significant for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The lethal region of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 overlapped with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 on the seventh aa into the C-terminus and spanned 4 aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The overlap for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 occurred at the 13<sup>th</sup> aa position and spanned 8 aa. The 2 aa between the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 lethal regions were partially conserved between the three channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Overall, lethal areas that did not overlap between channels were still found to be highly conserved, and only 13% (47/352) of amino acids had reported patient variants among the three channels.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials and are specialized for electrical signaling. Humans have nine distinct Na<sub>V</sub> channel genes, each of which encodes of a single pore-forming α-subunit composed of four repeat domains (I–IV), which in turn each contain six transmembrane α-helical segments. The four transmembrane domain structure of all Na<sub>V</sub> channels is highly conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref014">14</xref>]. The six sequentially linked transmembrane segments (S1 through S6) of each domain consist of a voltage-sensing domain (VSD: S1 through S4) and a pore-forming domain (PFD: S5 through S6). The VSD is highly flexible and shifts during membrane depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref015">15</xref>]. The outward movement of S4 is coupled to the PFD via the S4-S5 linker, and results in the PFD opening in an iris-like manner to allow sodium ions to flow into the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref015">15</xref>]. The S5-S6 linker contains the selectivity filter (with the four amino acid abbreviation DEKA), which is highly conserved for each Na<sub>V</sub> channel and forms the narrowest portion of the pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref014">14</xref>]. The DIII-DIV loop, also known as the inactivation gate, is often depicted as a hinged lid to close the intracellular portion of the pore.</p>
<p>Four voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) isoforms are highly expressed in the CNS and are implicated in epilepsy. We investigated patterns of variation among three of these channels with the aim of gleaning new insights into mechanisms of channel pathology. To accomplish this task, we analyzed cohorts of patient and public variants from three well-studied sodium channel systems (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6). All three channels had excess patient variant burden for S4 to S6, with 77% (302/391), 71% (104/146), and 69% (57/83) of patient variants located in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238121.s009">S5</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238121.s011">S7</xref> Tables). In particular, S4 and S6 showed similar higher patient variant burden as measured by the OR across all three channels, consistent with known functionality of these regions in sodium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref018">18</xref>]. However, we also discovered Na<sub>V</sub> channel specific hot spots in the inactivation gate, the S5-S6 linker, the S4-S5 linker, and S5. In the following sections, we discuss the features that distinguish each channel based on its position within the neuron and the type of neuron in which it functions (excitatory and inhibitory).</p>
<sec id="sec013">
<title>Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-specific burden in inactivation gate may be related to action potential propagation</title>
<p>Proper fast inactivation is necessary for the repetitive firing of action potentials in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref018">18</xref>]. The inactivation gate is responsible for the fast inactivation of VGSCs, and performs rapid inactivation by acting as a hinged lid on the intracellular side of the pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref012">12</xref>]. The first half of the inactivation gate contains the previously identified hydrophobic cluster (isoleucine, phenylalanine, and methionine—IFM) that maintains the closed state of the channel via docking sites on S6<sub>DIV</sub> and S4-S5<sub>DIV</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref021">21</xref>]. Gain-of-function (GoF) mutations in the inactivation gate lead to increased persistent current [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref022">22</xref>], which is known to facilitate repetitive firing. Therefore, an inability to perform fast inactivation would cause increased persistent current leading to increases in hyperexcitability by lowering the activation threshold for subsequent action potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref023">23</xref>]. Indeed, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 was the only channel to display statistically significant patient variant burden for the entire length of the inactivation gate. A closer examination of the region in Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 revealed that the first half of the gate contains an especially higher patient variant burden.</p>
<p>This requirement for proper fast inactivation to occur may not produce an epileptic manifestation for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 due to their location within the neuron. Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is hypothesized to play a role in controlling network excitability through activation of inhibitory circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref001">1</xref>] and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 is thought to control back propagation of action potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref024">24</xref>]. Therefore, improper fast inactivation in these circumstances would not directly lead to an overall hyperexcitability. Experiments that test the effect of amino acid substitutions in the inactivation gate for both Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 will help to better understand the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitivity in this region.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Excess of patient variants in S5-S6 linkers of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 may be associated with loss of function</title>
<p>The ability of the Na<sub>V</sub> channel to initiate action potentials is due to selective transport of sodium ions across the membrane, which occurs through a pore-forming module (S5-S6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref025">25</xref>]. Each of the S5-S6 linkers forms a P-loop which consists of an extracellular linker to S5, a descending P-helix, an ascending limb, and an extracellular linker to S6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref026">26</xref>]. The ascending portion of the P-loop contains the selectivity filter, which is made up of a single amino acid from each domain, and forms the narrowest portion of the channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref028">28</xref>]. Residues within these linkers have been shown to contribute to proper permeation of Na<sub>V</sub> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref025">25</xref>]. In our study, only Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 displayed higher patient variant burden in the S5-S6 linker. We hypothesize that patient variants in this region for all VGSCs lead to impaired sodium selectivity, which in turn may produce a loss of channel function. Sodium channels achieve their balance of selectivity and high Na<sup>+</sup> flux by precisely aligning the carbonyl oxygens from the peptide backbone in a four-fold symmetry that replaces the water molecules that would normally hydrate a Na<sup>+</sup> ion in solution. Any structural change that disrupts the alignment or spacing of the carbonyl groups will reduce the ability of the channel to strip the shell of water from the Na<sup>+</sup> and allow the ion to pass through the channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref027">27</xref>]. Depending on the variant, this could also cause a reduction in current without loss of selectivity. Selectivity mutations can cause diverse impacts on function. Many of them will lead to poor/slow calcium or potassium ion permeation and hence reduce sodium ion flux and appear as a loss of function. If the variant allows robust calcium permeation it may actually appear as a GoF since calcium influx is normally downstream of Na<sub>V</sub> activation.</p>

<title>Region-specific variant deserts in patient and public databases: Evidence of lethality or alternate phenotypes?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238121.g003">Fig 3</xref> illustrates the position of 16 lethal regions (i.e., statistically significant long stretches with no amino acid substitutions in either the patient or public databases): 5 in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, 4 in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and 7 in Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. Four of these stretches are shared within the same segment, linker, loop or terminus across two channels. All but one of these shared lethal stretches was present in the S5-S6 segment (i.e., in DI, DII and DIV); and all three involved Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and two of the three involved Na<sub>V</sub>1.2. While we refer to these regions as ‘lethal’ (i.e., implying that variants cause embryonic lethality), it is also possible that variants in these regions are associated with a non-epilepsy disease phenotype—hence, excluding them from both the epilepsy and public databases. Scrutiny of other patient databases is needed to test the latter possibility.</p>
<p>Given the prevalence of the longer stretches (i.e., p&lt;0.001) in S5-S6 segments of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, we hypothesize that variants in these parts of the channel cause a total loss of function. We know that total loss of function is not generally lethal in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 (e.g., Dravet Syndrome patients survive). On the other hand, total loss of function variants are quite rare within Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and these variants are often associated with non-epilepsy phenotypes, such as movement disorders, ataxia, intellectual disability and/or autism and may not lead to epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref030">30</xref>]. Indeed, all three channels demonstrate intolerance to loss of function (LoF) variants as reflected by a paucity of nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants in the gnomAD database. We computed z-scores for tolerance to LoF variants in all VGSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238121.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) and found that brain-expressed channels (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) were orders of magnitude more intolerant when compared with those that are primarily expressed in peripheral nervous system and muscle (e.g., Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9).</p>
<p>Another possibility is that variants in the lethal stretches have dominant negative effects, which may well be lethal. For example, Berecki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref031">31</xref>] suggested that a variant in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 (T226M) that is associated with a more severe phenotype than Dravet syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref032">32</xref>] leads to a reduction of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 current through both the mutant and the wildtype allele so that the sum current is &gt;0 but &lt;50%. Prenatal lethal mutations could be more extreme versions of this phenotype. If this were the case for GoF variants in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 the loss of any wildtype expression could cause embryonic lethality.</p>

<title>Variant burden associated with inhibitory versus excitatory neuron pathways</title>
<p>Patterns of variation in the S4-S5 linkers and S5 segments was concordant with the expression of these channels on excitatory <italic>versus</italic> inhibitory neurons. These regions have been previously implicated in causing both hyperexcitability and loss of channel function in a domain-dependent manner. We hypothesize that these patterns are due to the channel effect on each of these differing neuron types. For example, the S4-S5 linker in both domains III and IV make up the portion of the channel necessary for fast inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref033">33</xref>]. Mutations in this region have been shown to effect channel function in the muscle-expressed channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref033">33</xref>]. In DIII the S4-S5 linker is hypothesized to interact with amino acids in S6<sub>DIV</sub> that transmit movement of S4<sub>DIII</sub> to S6<sub>DIV</sub> and plays a role in fast inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref034">34</xref>]. While the S4-S5<sub>DIV</sub> linker was found to interact with the inactivation gate during fast inactivation and mutations in this region were found to disrupt fast inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref035">35</xref>]. Our results are consistent with these findings because Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 showed higher patient variant burden in the S4-S5 linker in DIII and DIV. Interestingly, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 only shows higher patient variant burden in S4-S5<sub>DIV</sub>, while Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 shows increased patient variant burden in the S4-S5 linker in DI and DII. The relative paucity of patient variants in the inactivation machinery may imply that GoF Nav1.1 variants are relatively well tolerated. In fact, very few patients with GoF variants have been identified (with the exception hemiplegic migraine). If true, this would suggest that therapies that induce GoF in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 could be well tolerated even if they disrupt inactivation as a means of increasing interneuron Na<sub>V</sub> current. This population-based variant study shows the need for further investigation into structure-function relationships in sodium channels especially in DI and DII.</p>
<p>Previously, a point mutation in S5<sub>DII</sub>, within Na<sub>V</sub>1.4, was found to shift the activation curve in the hyperpolarizing direction. This mutation had minor effects on fast inactivation while greatly impairing slow inactivation and allowing for a more rapid activation of the channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref036">36</xref>]. Whereas, a point mutation in Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 in the S5<sub>DIV</sub> segment led to this channel becoming activated and inactivated at more negative potentials, ultimately causing slowed recovery from fast inactivation with no effect on channel deactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref036">36</xref>]. Additionally, S5<sub>DIV</sub> has been shown to be part of a hydrophobic cavity that interacts with the inactivation gate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref037">37</xref>]. Both Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 had a higher patient variant burden in S5<sub>DI</sub> and S5<sub>DII</sub>, while Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 had a higher patient variant burden in S5<sub>DIII</sub> and S5<sub>DIV</sub>. The results of Bendahhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref036">36</xref>] imply that S5<sub>DII</sub> variants in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 would lead to a hyperactive sodium channel, while such variants in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 would cause excess firing on inhibitory interneurons. On the other hand, a higher patient variant burden in Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 S5<sub>DIV</sub> should slow recovery from inactivation and lead to a subsequent loss of channel function. Future studies should be conducted to fully determine the channel specificity in higher patient variant burden in S5 among all three channels to better understand the potential gating mechanism that is affecting activation and inactivation within these segments.</p>

<title>Do variants in the C-terminus and DI-DII intracellular loop reflect channel function?</title>
<p>The C-terminus is made up of a globular domain containing a well-structured EF-hand (helix-loop-helix structure) followed by an unstructured extended helix containing the IQ (isoleucine–glutamine) motif, which is known to interact with calmodulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref039">39</xref>]. In Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, the proximal half of the C-terminus has been shown to interact and stabilize the inactivation gate and mutations within this region have been identified in multiple cardiac rhythm disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref039">39</xref>]. The proximal C-terminus contains the interaction site for fibroblast growth factors as well as the binding sites of β1 to β4 sodium channel subunits. Fibroblast growth factor 14 has been suggested to play a key role in the organization of VGSC alpha subunits in the AIS, while the β subunits are essential for the modulation of current and proper expression of VGSCs on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref039">39</xref>]. Given the established role of the proximal C-terminus in channel inactivation, it is surprising that only Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 displayed a statistically significantly higher patient variant burden. This suggests that these variants have more impact on trafficking (i.e., resulting in normal protein level in neurons) than on inactivation. The lack of a high patient variant burden in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in this region may highlight a higher tolerance of variation within these channels for this region.</p>
<p>Additionally, the distal C-terminus, which is known to house the IQ-motif, is consistent among the three channels as having an excess of public variants. Similarly, the DI-DII loop was also shown to have an excess of public variants. This loop has previously been shown to contain five phosphorylation sites, which are involved in neuromodulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0238121.ref016">16</xref>]. The statistically significantly low OR for both the distal C-terminus and the DI-DII intracellular loop may indicate that pathogenic variants are limited to the particular sites of interaction (i.e. IQ-motif in the C-terminus and sites of phosphorylation in DI-DII) and not the regions surrounding them. Therefore, even if a region contains more public variants, this does not exclude the possibility that there are intolerant sites.</p>

<title>Limitations and conclusions</title>
<p>In this study we investigated the distribution of patient and public variants from three sodium channel databases (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) with the intent to link patterns of variation with known physiological functions of these channels. One challenge was the unequal sample sizes in the three patient databases. While the Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 patient mutations made up roughly 43% of the total Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 mutations analyzed and was adequate for our analyses, the patient mutations only accounted for 28% and 24% total mutations in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 databases respectively. While often giving similar OR, these smaller samples sizes did not allow us to assess statistical significance for some segments (i.e. S4 and S6).</p>
<p>We also point out that the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 databases included cases of varying severity (e.g., from benign cases to those with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy), For the Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 database, we were able to separate missense variants Dravet Syndrome patients from patients with milder forms of epilepsy (n = 83). While the trends are similar across segments, linkers, and loops; the enrichment of mild variants in termini contributed to a marginally significant difference in the cumulative distribution as measured by the Anderson-Darling test (p = 0.055) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0238121.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Larger databases are needed to distinguish between mild and severe cases of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and to distinguish differences in patient variant burden in these channels, notably at the termini. An important implication is that this type of analysis can help to infer the pathogenicity of variants of unknown significance.</p>
<p>In summary, we have found associations that confirm and extend understanding of the function of these three channels. We highlight channel-specific sensitivities within the inactivation gate and S5-S6 linker as well as neuron-specific sensitivities that directly relate to the gain or loss of function within these channels. This study highlights the importance of genotype-phenotype associations at the level of channel function and points to the need to perform more informative studies analyzing epilepsy severity in patients with these channelopathies.</p>

<p>Variable patterns of mutation density among NaV1.1, NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 point to channel-specific functional differences associated with childhood epilepsy</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Hammer,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>The manuscript needs an expanded discussion along the lines of reviewer 1's notes, with particular emphasis on how this potentially translates into clinical practice and particularly the emerging field of precision medicine.</p>
<p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Aug 03 2020 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
<p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Randall Lee Rasmusson</p>

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This paper compared patterns of variation in patients’ and public databases to test the hypothesis that regions of known functional significance within the main voltage-gated sodium channels show an increased burden of deleterious variants. The authors demonstrated that patient variant density was higher in regions known to play a role in channel function, e.g. the pore region, which is quite intuitive. On the other hand, they did also found that channel-specific patterns of patient burden may reflect different roles played by the NaV 1.6 inactivation gate in action potential propagation, and by NaV 1.1 S5-S6 linkers in loss of function and haploinsufficiency.</p>
<p>Main comments</p>
<p>This is an original study that could potentially impact the interpretation of the variants in the genes involved in different epilepsy types, in particular, to infer the pathogenicity of variants of unknown significance. The manuscript is well written and it is technically a quite sound piece of scientific research with data that partially supports the conclusions. Experiments have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate sample sizes. The statistical analysis has been performed rigorously.</p>
<p>This reviewer has the following comments:</p>
<p>1) The authors assessed the mutational burden in different regions of the NaV channels considering (1) the excess variants in the public databases and (2) the cumulative distribution of variants throughout the different genes. However, this approach is quite arbitrary. Moreover, there was a clear discrepancy in the choice of the different patients’ database used for this study (i.e., Japanese patients with Dravet syndrome (DS); the literature data for the NaV1.2 missense variants, the patient’s registry for SCN8A mutations. This choice must be discussed as it did potentially affect the results, at least in part. For instance, Nav 1.1 mutations are associated with a spectrum of severity, ranging from autosomal dominant GEFS+ to de novo mutations causing DS. Thus, as honestly discussed by the authors, the adoption of the Japanese register did exclude a priori all the milder form of epilepsy associated with mutations in SCN1A.</p>
<p>2) Overall, pathogenic variants in these genes have been associated with a wide spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes, ranging from benign epilepsies to epileptic encephalopathies with variable severity. Furthermore, a few patients with intellectual disability (ID) or movement disorders without epilepsy have been reported (see, for instance, Johannesen KM, The spectrum of intermediate SCN8A-related epilepsy. Epilepsia. 2019;60(5):830-844).</p>
<p>3) The case of NaV 1.1 variants is even more complicated if we consider that some variants can promote inclusion of a "poison" exon that leads to reduced amounts of full-length SCN1A protein, a mechanism is likely to be broadly relevant to human disease (Carvill GL, Aberrant Inclusion of a Poison Exon Causes Dravet Syndrome and Related SCN1A-Associated Genetic Epilepsies. Am J Hum Genet. 2018;103(6):1022-1029).</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: There are no overall issues with the data or conclusions. The authors clearly describe the data bases used in the statistical analysis and point out the potential shortcomings. It is an interesting approach to identifying differences between the various sodium channels with respect to the relationships between the function/role of the sodium channel in neuronal firing and the region/effects of a given mutation. This approach would allow researchers to study more clinically-relevant mutations in ion channels and give greater insight into the relationship between ion channel structure/function and consequences on neuronal activity.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: </p>
<p>1a) The authors assessed the mutational burden in different regions of the NaV channels considering (1) the excess variants in the public databases and (2) the cumulative distribution of variants throughout the different genes. However, this approach is quite arbitrary. </p>
<p>Response: We not sure what the reviewer means by “arbitrary”; however, the cumulative function distribution contains all the information necessary for the statistical tests (i.e., sufficient for all the statistical tests performed in these analyses). </p>
<p>1b) Moreover, there was a clear discrepancy in the choice of the different patients’ database used for this study (i.e., Japanese patients with Dravet syndrome (DS); the literature data for the NaV1.2 missense variants, the patient’s registry for SCN8A mutations. This choice must be discussed as it did potentially affect the results, at least in part. For instance, Nav 1.1 mutations are associated with a spectrum of severity, ranging from autosomal dominant GEFS+ to de novo mutations causing DS. Thus, as honestly discussed by the authors, the adoption of the Japanese register did exclude a priori all the milder form of epilepsy associated with mutations in SCN1A.</p>
<p>Response: We completely agree and thank the reviewer for noting the discrepancy. We have now performed an analysis of ALL SCN1A variants—including an additional 94 patients with milder symptoms in addition to the the Dravet Syndrome patients. While including the milder patients did not alter our main results in a significant way (i.e., variants in the milder group tended to be found in similar segments, domains, linkers and loops as variants with Dravet Syndrome), we did discover that variants associated with these patients tended to accumulate more in the N- and C- terminus. This raises new questions about the functionality of these regions of the gene, which we now discuss in the last section of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Future analyses that include greater numbers of variants will have additional statistical power to identify sites in the channel with patient burden. These studies will need to include associations with patient phenotype (i.e., along the spectrum of disease outcome). </p>
<p>2) Overall, pathogenic variants in these genes have been associated with a wide spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes, ranging from benign epilepsies to epileptic encephalopathies with variable severity. Furthermore, a few patients with intellectual disability (ID) or movement disorders without epilepsy have been reported (see, for instance, Johannesen KM, The spectrum of intermediate SCN8A-related epilepsy. Epilepsia. 2019;60(5):830-844).</p>
<p>Response: We now refer to this broader spectrum and cite the Johannessen et al. reference. And restate the last sentence of the first paragraph of the introduction to clarify this point.</p>
<p>3) The case of NaV 1.1 variants is even more complicated if we consider that some variants can promote inclusion of a "poison" exon that leads to reduced amounts of full-length SCN1A protein, a mechanism is likely to be broadly relevant to human disease (Carvill GL, Aberrant Inclusion of a Poison Exon Causes Dravet Syndrome and Related SCN1A-Associated Genetic Epilepsies. Am J Hum Genet. 2018;103(6):1022-1029).</p>
<p>Response: We agree that this is an interesting finding. However, we feel it is beyond the scope of this study our focus on variants across the entire gene in patient and public databases while variants in the abovementioned exon occur outside the annotated coding regions.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: </p>
<p>There are no overall issues with the data or conclusions. The authors clearly describe the data bases used in the statistical analysis and point out the potential shortcomings. It is an interesting approach to identifying differences between the various sodium channels with respect to the relationships between the function/role of the sodium channel in neuronal firing and the region/effects of a given mutation. This approach would allow researchers to study more clinically-relevant mutations in ion channels and give greater insight into the relationship between ion channel structure/function and consequences on neuronal activity.</p>
