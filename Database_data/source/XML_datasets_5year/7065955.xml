<p id="P4">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is genetically heterogeneous with convergent symptomatology, suggesting common dysregulated pathways. We analyzed brain transcriptional changes in five mouse models of Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS), a syndromic form of ASD caused by mutations in <italic>TCF4</italic> (transcription factor 4, not <italic>TCF7L2</italic> / T-Cell Factor 4). Analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) highlighted oligodendrocyte (OL) dysregulation, which we confirmed in two additional mouse models of syndromic ASD (<italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>m3m4/m3m4</italic></sup> and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup><italic>tm1.1Bird</italic></sup>). The PTHS mouse models showed cell-autonomous reductions in OL numbers and myelination, functionally confirming OL transcriptional signatures. Next, we integrated PTHS mouse model DEGs with human idiopathic ASD postmortem brain RNA-seq data, and found significant enrichment of overlapping DEGs and common myelination-associated pathways. Importantly, DEGs from syndromic ASD mouse models, and reduced deconvoluted OL numbers, distinguished human idiopathic ASD cases from controls across three postmortem brain datasets. These results implicate disruptions in OL biology as a cellular mechanism in ASD pathology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P5">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1:68 individuals and has uncountable burdens on affected individuals, their families, and health care systems. While the genetic contributions to idiopathic ASD are heterogeneous and largely unknown, the causal mutations for syndromic forms of ASD, including truncations and copy number variants, provide a genetic footing with which to gain mechanistic insights <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Models of these syndromic disorders have been used to characterize the downstream molecular and physiological processes disrupted by these mutations with the expectation these phenotypes will translate to idiopathic forms of ASD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">One form of syndromic ASD is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the transcription factor 4 (<italic>TCF4;</italic> not <italic>TCF7L2 /</italic> T-Cell Factor 4) gene and results in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, failure to acquire language, deficits in motor learning, hyperventilation, gastrointestinal abnormalities, and autistic behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. TCF4 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that is highly expressed during cortical development, is regulated by neuronal activity, and regulates many aspects of neuronal development including neuronal excitability, pyramidal cell positioning, and neurite outgrowth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, animal models of PTHS have behavioral deficits related to ASD including deficits in learning and memory, reduced ultrasonic vocalizations, and social isolation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">Two leading hypotheses for the underlying pathophysiology in ASD are abnormal neuronal connectivity and imbalances in excitation and inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and these broad hypotheses likely overlap. In support of these hypotheses, several neuroimaging studies have identified defects in white matter (WM) tracts, with a reduction in corpus callosum (CC) volume being the most consistent finding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, resolution restraints of these imaging techniques, preclude their ability to define the exact cellular structure responsible <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, a deeper understanding of whether axons and/or myelin, the two major components of WM tracts, are altered in ASD is critical to our understanding of disease etiology and for the development of targeted treatments.</p>
<p id="P8">Here, we attempt to address several fundamental questions about the relevance of animal models for the study of human ASD and endeavor to identify a common pathophysiology that bridges across the ASD spectrum. To address these questions, we performed integrative transcriptomic analyses of seven independent mouse models covering three syndromic forms of ASD generated across five laboratories, and assessed dysregulated genes and their pathways in human postmortem brain from patients with ASD and neurotypical controls. These cross-species analyses converged on shared disruptions in myelination across both syndromic and idiopathic ASD, and we biologically validate OL and myelination defects in our PTHS mouse model. Together, these results highlight both the face validity of mouse models, while also identifying novel convergent molecular phenotypes amenable to potential rescue with therapeutics.</p>

<title><italic>Tcf4</italic> expression is developmentally regulated across the lifespan</title>
<p id="P9">We first assessed molecular convergence across five independent mouse models of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS), which model TCF4 protein haploinsufficiency and/or translation of dominant-negative TCF4 proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. We first generated RNA-seq data from prefrontal cortex (PFC) of a PTHS mouse line that shows heterozygous expression of a truncated TCF4 protein with dominant-negative properties (<italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/tr</sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/tr</sup> mouse showed significant blunted expression of full-length <italic>Tcf4</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">b</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">d</xref>) in the brain between embryonic day 16 and postnatal day 4 (E16, P4) and smaller difference in expression in adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">d</xref>). This mirrored a similar expression pattern across the human lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, suggesting there may be a critical period for the genesis of PTHS that coincides with early cortical development, which is consistent with other syndromic and idiopathic forms of human ASD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In addition to the <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/tr</sup> PFC RNA-seq and published <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/tr</sup> hippocampal dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, we further created and processed RNA-seq data from four additional mouse lines harboring heterozygous <italic>Tcf4</italic> mutations or deletions: <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/D574−579</sup>, <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/R579W</sup>, <italic>Actin-Cre</italic>::<italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/floxed</sup> and <italic>Nestin</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic>::<italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/floxed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Given that <italic>Tcf4</italic> is developmentally regulated and plays a role in gene regulation, we assessed the effects of heterozygous <italic>Tcf4</italic> mutations (<italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup>) on the mouse transcriptome from the prefrontal cortex, CA1 region of hippocampus, and hemi-brain at P1 and in adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>RNA-seq of multiple <italic>Tcf4</italic> mutations reveals age-specific differential gene expression.</title>
<p id="P10">Differential expression analysis of each <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mouse model by age showed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in both the P1 and adult brain, with overall high concordance and replication rates across these varied models and tissue sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Combined analysis across the RNA-seq data from these multiple models of PTHS revealed widespread transcriptional dysregulation in the adult mouse brain in <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> versus wild-type (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the DEGs identified from <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mice showed age-specific processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Genes upregulated in adult brains were enriched for processes associated with forebrain development, neuron projection, axon development, excitatory synapses, and postsynaptic density, while downregulated genes were enriched in processes associated with axon ensheathment, and myelination. Together, these bioinformatic analyses suggest that TCF4 mutation leads to upregulation of genes associated with neuronal function while downregulated genes are associated with oligodendrocytes and myelination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Cell-type specific expression analysis identifies DEGs are enriched in oligodendrocytes</title>
<p id="P11">Cell type-specific analysis (CSEA) using expression levels from microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>) and RNA-seq of purified mouse cell types further implicated OLs as the candidate cell type implicated in <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). For example, adult mouse lines across all <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> models showed OL enrichment at all developmental stages with the most significant enrichment found in myelinating OLs, where more than 55% of cell type-specific genes were differentially expressed in our mega-analysis. These results confirm our gene set enrichment analyses, where enrichment was primarily observed in adult samples and from biological and cellular processes associated with neurons and OLs. We further applied RNA deconvolution using RNA-seq of purified mouse cell types to obtain the estimated proportion of RNA signal attributed to each cell type, and identified a significant increase in the proportions of RNA coming from neurons and astrocytes and a significant decrease in the proportion of RNA coming from myelinating OLs in adult <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mice. Moreover, cell type deconvolution analyses showed new OL proportions were decreased in P1 brains and myelinating OL proportions were decreased in adult brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), matching the expected developmental trajectory of the OLs. These findings together suggest <italic>Tcf4</italic> mutation leads to deficits in myelination due to fewer mature OLs and/or less active expression of OL-specific genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Shared myelination gene regulation between mouse models of syndromic ASD</title>
<p id="P12">Syndromic forms of ASD are caused by varying mutations yet share significant overlap in their symptomatology, suggesting that dysregulation of convergent biological processes may underlie syndromic ASD. We therefore compared DEGs in adult <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mouse brains to genes dysregulated in mouse models of PTEN-associated autism (<italic>Pten</italic><sup>m3m4/m3m4</sup>; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>) and Rett syndrome (<italic>Mecp2</italic><sup><italic>tm1.1Bird</italic></sup>; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>) to characterize shared gene regulation between these three mouse models of syndromic ASD. Remarkably, we found significant overlap of DEGs in <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> vs. <italic>Pten</italic><sup>m3m4/m3m4</sup>and <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> vs. <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup><italic>tm1.1Bird</italic></sup> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), with <italic>Tcf4</italic> mutations inversely regulating DEGs in <italic>Pten</italic> and <italic>Mecp2</italic> models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">c</xref>). Overall, 34 DEGs were common to all three mouse models, herein referred to as “convergent ASD genes” (CAGs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The CAGs were strongly enriched for several myelination-related GO terms, representing up to 15% of the genes involved in processes related to myelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The CAGs are generally down-regulated in the <italic>Tcf4</italic> mice while being up-regulated in mice harboring <italic>Pten</italic> and <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">c</xref>). The inverse directionalities of the CAGs between <italic>Tcf4</italic> and both <italic>Mecp2</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic> are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that decreased PTEN and MeCP2 protein expression promoted OL expansion, maturation and myelination in animal and cell models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The mixed directionalities of the CAGs across these three models of syndromic ASD suggests that either hypo- or hyper-myelination have potentially negative consequences on brain function. More generally, we found strong enrichment between the genes dysregulated by TCF4 and other genes implicated in syndromic forms of ASD. Of the 234 ASD risk genes listed in the SFARI Animal Model Module, 28.2% (72/255) were differentially expressed in our mega-analysis (odds ratio [OR]=3.14, hypergeometric p-value=1.23e-12). The significant overlap of differential expression between these mouse models of syndromic ASD and their apparent correlational effects on myelination suggests deficits in OL development and function is potentially a common molecular pathway disrupted in syndromic ASD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Functional validation of myelination deficits in the PTHS mouse model.</title>
<p id="P13">To confirm the presence of myelination deficits in our PTHS mouse model and validate our RNA-seq signatures, we performed <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to quantify OLs and myelination. First, we performed Western blots from adult mouse brain lysates and measured expression of the myelinating OL proteins CNP and MOG, and OL precursor cell (OPC) marker NG2. CNP and MOG were significantly decreased in <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> mice compared to <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates, while NG2 protein expression was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Next, to determine if decreased RNA and protein levels of OLs markers were due to decreased numbers of mature OLs, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) cell counts on brain sections from <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> and <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice. We quantified the population of OPCs and mature OLs using antibodies against PDGFRα and CC1 (anti-APC), respectively. To control for heterogeneity in OL density in the gray matter, we performed blinded cell counts on anatomically equivalent brain sections and normalized our counts using the pan-OL marker, OLIG2. At P24, we observed a significant decrease in the proportion of CC1-positive OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">d</xref>) and a significant increase in the proportion of PDGFRα-positive OPCs in the cortex of <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> mice compared to <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates. A similar result was observed in brain sections from adult mice (P42; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">f</xref>), suggesting TCF4-dependent myelination defects are present by P24 and are preserved through adulthood.</p>
<p id="P15">Next, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize myelination in the CC of <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> and <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates. Blinded to genotype, TEM images were taken of the CC directly above the dorsal hippocampus from anatomically equivalent tissue sections between littermates. Using blinded quantification, we did not observe a genotype difference in the gRatio, axonal area, or myelin area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). However, we did observe a significant decrease in the proportion of myelinated axons in the CC of <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> mice compared to <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">b</xref>), which is consistent with our Western blot and IHC results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">We next determined if the reduction of myelinated axons in the CC of the <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> mice is physiologically relevant to the propagation of compound action potentials (CAPs) in the CC by performing electrophysiological recordings. Acute coronal brain slices were obtained from P29–32 <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> and <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates. CAPs were evoked by a bipolar stimulating electrode and recorded by a field electrode placed at varying distances across the CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The N1 nad N2 peaks represents CAPs traveling down myelinated unmyelinated axons, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> brain slices showed a significant reduction in the N1/N2 proportion suggesting more CAPs are traveling down unmyelinated axons in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). We also calculated conduction velocity of CAPs, and observed no difference between <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> and <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that when axons are myelinated in <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> mice, the process appears to occur normally. In summary, our TEM and electrophysiology results indicate that the PTHS mouse has a pathological reduction in the proportion of myelinated axons that leads to a greater proportion of neuronal activity being transmitted down unmyelinated axons.</p>
<p id="P17">To further investigate the role of TCF4 in regulating the differentiation and/or maturation of OLs, we performed several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to monitor the growth and differentiation of primary OPCs and OLs that were dissociated from the brains of <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> and <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice. First, we generated primary neuronal cultures from P0 cortices and performed immunocytochemistry (ICC) to quantify the population of OLs in our cultures. After arresting mitosis with Ara-C treatment, we observed a significant reduction in the number of CNP-positive OLs in primary cultures derived from <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> mice compared to <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">b</xref>). Moreover, cultures derived from <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>tr/tr</italic></sup> mice, which typically die hours after birth, but can produce viable primary neuronal cultures, failed to produce any CNP-positive OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). This further confirms <italic>Tcf4</italic> plays a role in producing/maintaining the number of mature OLs in our cortical cultures. However, because of the diverse cell populations in these cortical cultures, it is unclear whether the reduction of OLs is due directly to Tcf4 mutation within OL lineage or arises from a non-cell autonomous mechanism.</p>
<p id="P18">To determine if TCF4 protein directly regulates differentiation and/or survival of OLs we first confirmed <italic>Tcf4</italic> transcript is expressed in the OL lineage. Fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments in mouse cortical brain sections showed <italic>Tcf4</italic> transcripts are present in both OPCs and OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>), and this result matches previously published single-cell sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We next asked if <italic>Tcf4</italic> mutation affects OL development in a cell-autonomous manner by dissociating OPCs from neonatal <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> and <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice using a protocol that generates a 98% pure population of cell-types within the OL lineage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We confirmed the purity of these cultures using ICC for the neuronal markers Tuj1 and NeuN, and the astrocyte marker GFAP. We observed only rare Tuj1+, NeuN+ or GFAP+ cells within our cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). After a period of OPC expansion, primary OPC cultures were differentiated for two days, and ICC was performed using antibodies against PDGFRα, MOG, and OLIG2 to measure the proportions of OPCs and OLs present in the culture. Similar to <italic>ex vivo</italic> IHC results, blinded quantification of cultures derived from <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> mice cortices showed a significant increase in the proportion of OPCs compared to <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">d</xref>). Although <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/tr</italic></sup> mice produced more OPCs in culture, we observed a significant decrease in the proportion of MOG-positive OLs compared to <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">d</xref>). This result was replicated using antibodies against MBP and CNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">b</xref>). In addition, protein lysates from these cultures were positive for both full-length and truncated TCF4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). These results indicate this phenotype appears to result directly from <italic>Tcf4</italic> mutation within the OL population because there are no other cell types present within these cultures that could provide a non-cell autonomous signal. As an additional confirmation of a cell autonomous role for Tcf4 in regulating OL differentiation and/or survival, we genetically deleted a single <italic>Tcf4</italic> allele in the OL lineage by crossing the Olig2-Cre<sup>+/−</sup> mouse with the Tcf4<sup>+/flox</sup> mouse. We performed blinded quantification of OPCs and OLs in the cortex of P24 mice, and observed a significant reduction in the proportion of CC1-positive OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">b</xref>) and a significant increase in the proportion of PDGFRα-positive OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">c</xref>) in the cortex of Olig2-Cre<sup>+/−</sup>; Tcf4<sup>+/flox</sup> mice compared to Olig2-Cre<sup>+/−</sup>; Tcf4<sup>+/+</sup> littermates. These results not only indicate that OL lineage-specific deletion of <italic>Tcf4</italic> successfully phenocopied OL defects observed in animals with <italic>Tcf4</italic> germline mutations, but also confirm that TCF4 regulates OPC differentiation and/or OL survival in a cell autonomous manner.</p>

<title>Human-mouse convergence of gene expression in idiopathic and syndromic ASD</title>
<p id="P19">Lastly, we examined the role of OL disruption in idiopathic ASD, which are more prevalent in the human population, but due to their polygenic nature are more difficult to model in animals. First, we found significant enrichment of adult <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mice DEGs in the SFARI Human Gene Module of ASD candidate risk genes. Approximately one fifth of the homologous SFARI Human Gene module genes were DEGs in the <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mice (N=190/992) and 46 of these are causal for syndromic ASD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>, Fisher’s exact test, OR = 2.12, p=2.2 e-16), suggesting TCF4 may be an upstream regulator of a variety of previously identified ASD risk genes. Sensitivity enrichment analyses of overlapping adult <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mice DEGs with SFARI Human Genes with higher scientific evidence to contribute to ASD (i.e. scores 1–3 or Syndromic) demonstrated significant enrichment (Fisher’s exact test, OR = 2.96, p=2.2 e-16). We next tested our adult <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mice DEGs with human homologs implicated in ASD by two large, unbiased <italic>de novo</italic> variant analyses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> to replicate the enrichment signal with human ASD (Sanders <italic>et al</italic>. N= 25/61, Fisher’s exact test OR = 5.92, p=7.33 e −10; Satterstrom <italic>et al</italic>. N = 35/97, Fisher’s exact test OR = 4.83, p= 2.33 e-16). Of note, <italic>TCF4</italic> is one of the 102 ASD risk genes identified by Satterstrom <italic>et al</italic>. that contributes more to the neurodevelopmental delay ascertained cohort. We further identified significant enrichment of DEGs in the <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mice among published WGCNA co-expression modules from microarray of human ASD postmortem brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, BrainSpan RNA-seq of developing human neocortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and RNA-seq from human postmortem prefrontal and temporal cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Specifically, we found the strongest enrichment of <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> DEGs among human genes involved in myelination, axon ensheathment, and gliogenesis (asdM14, adjusted hypergeometric p-value=5.6e-20). In addition, we observed <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> DEGs showed enrichment in other previously identified co-expression modules involved in synaptic transmission and mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Enrichment in these gene co-expression modules supports the idea that gene networks disrupted in <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mice are similar to gene networks disrupted in human ASD, and further identifies myelination as an additional pathway disrupted in ASD.</p>
<p id="P20">To better characterize phenotypes identified in mouse models with human illness, we directly integrated RNA-seq data from<italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> mice with postmortem human brain tissue from ASD and 15q duplication postmortem brain from frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and cerebellar vermis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). Differential expression between PTHS mouse and human ASD or 15q duplication was significantly concordant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>). <italic>Tcf4</italic><sup>+/mut</sup> DEGs strongly overlapped with human ASD and 15q duplication at replication, displaying slightly more overlap with the 15q duplication diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>). Comparing replication of DEGs with a more stringent cutoff (p&lt;0.01), gene regulation became more correlated with higher concordance rates, suggesting these groups of genes better represent the shared pathways affected in both PTHS and human ASD. GO analysis of DEGs in frontal and temporal cortex overlapping with PTHS mouse DEGs enriched for processes related to axon and dendrite projection development and postsynaptic regulation and signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig. 9e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P21">Next, we evaluated the ability of our mouse-derived CAG gene set to distinguish patients with ASD and 15q duplication from unaffected individuals. We found significant differences in patients with ASD from controls among the 34 human homologs of the CAGs via its eigengene using linear mixed effects modeling that incorporated observed and latent confounders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>, linear mixed effects regression p-value =8.35e-4). This association was relatively robust, as sensitivity analyses only adjusting for brain region (linear mixed effects regression, two-sided p=0.044) and then the larger set of observed confounders (linear mixed effects regression, two-sided p=0.021) remained significant. The gene rotations that created this CAG eigengene were directionally consistent between the human and mouse samples, as OL marker genes (e.g. <italic>MBP</italic> and <italic>CNP</italic>) had positive loadings for an eigengene that was decreased in ASD samples. We subsequently replicated this CAG eigengene discrimination of 13 ASD patients from 39 unaffected controls in the frontal cortex from independent data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>). This discrimination of patients from controls appeared unique to ASD, as similar analyses in patients with schizophrenia and neurotypical controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> showed no differences in the expression of these CAG genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>). Similarly, while myelination has previously been implicated in Down syndrome (DS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, the CAG eigengene in microarray data did not show separation between a small number of patients with DS and unaffected controls across a large number of brain regions and ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data Fig. 10b</xref>), suggesting the dysregulation of these specific 34 genes may be unique to ASD.</p>
<p id="P22">We lastly sought to confirm differences in the relative proportion of OLs in human ASD. We tested for differences in cellular composition between patients with ASD and 15q duplication estimated using cell type-specific single cell RNA-seq data from adult samples as reference profiles. We found significant decreases in the fraction of RNAs from OLs across samples from all three brain regions in ASD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>), which was robust to the linear mixed effects regression model employed (region-adjusted: p=0.011, observed covariate-adjusted: p=0.005). We again replicated these RNA fraction shifts using data from Wright et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, with decreased expression signal from OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>). We further found suggestive evidence for increased OPC fractions in both the Parikshak (region-adjusted: p=0.041, observed covariate-adjusted: p=0.086, observed and latent-adjusted: p=0.056) and Wright datasets (observed and latent-adjusted: p=0.045) even though this cell population is rarer and thus more difficult to deconvolute from bulk tissue. This deconvolution approach further showed suggestive evidence for the previously-reported increase in astrocyte (region-adjusted: p=0.007, observed covariate-adjusted: p=0.0013, observed and latent-adjusted: p=0.019) fractions in ASD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and suggestive evidence for increased microglia when not adjusting for latent variables (region-adjusted: p=0.098, observed covariate-adjusted: p=0.055, observed and latent-adjusted: p=0.42) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. As these RNA deconvolution calculate the RNA fraction and not necessarily the fraction of each cell type, we used a third dataset consisting of single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) from 15 patients with ASD and 16 neurotypical controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, and identified a significant decrease in the fraction of nuclei that were OLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>) and increase in the fraction that were protoplasmic astrocytes, in line with our RNA deconvolutions from bulk data above.</p>
<p id="P23">These analyses together provide further evidence that implicate inefficient maturation from OPCs to OLs and/or altered survival of OLs in the etiology of ASD. Together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that defects in myelination are a prevalent pathophysiology in syndromic and idiopathic ASD.</p>

<title>Discussion:</title>
<p id="P24">Starting with RNA-seq generated from five independent mouse models of PTHS as well as two additional mouse models of PTEN-related disorders and Rett’s syndrome, we identified a consistent transcriptional signature indicating syndromic ASD is associated with altered gene expression related to OL maturation and myelination. CSEA demonstrated DEGs are significantly enriched in OPCs and OLs, and these signatures were biologically validated in our PTHS mouse model. Lastly, we demonstrated that DEGs in our PTHS mouse models represents ~20% of the genes in the SFARI Human Gene Module for ASD, and that these myelin-associated DEGs can be used to distinguish human idiopathic ASD cases from neurotypic controls. Together, these results provide strong support that oligodendrocyte defects are prevalent in both syndromic and idiopathic ASD.</p>

<title>Myelination defects in monogenic ASD mouse models</title>
<p id="P25">Myelin pathologies are previously reported in several animal models of syndromic ASD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. We combined the transcriptomes of three models of syndromic ASD that harbor mutations in <italic>Tcf4</italic>, <italic>Pten</italic>, or <italic>Mecp2,</italic> and showed a significant convergence of differential gene expression. We identified 34 DEGs (termed CAGs) that are common to all three models which were significantly enriched in biological functions associated with myelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, these CAGs showed anti-correlated gene expression between the <italic>Tcf4</italic> model and <italic>Pten</italic> and <italic>Mecp2</italic> models. This expression directionality predicts that both hypo- and hyper-myelination respectively, which we hypothesize may partially relate to the heterogeneity of causal mutations and symptoms between individuals with ASD. Here, in two independent postmortem human datasets, we showed decreased RNA fractions attributed to OLs. The dichotomy between myelination defects in mice with <italic>Tcf4</italic> compared to <italic>Pten</italic> and <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutations was biologically validated. We observed hypomyelination in our PTHS mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), while hypermyelination was previously reported in a <italic>Pten</italic> mouse model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockdown was shown to upregulate myelin-associated genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P26">We show<italic>Tcf4</italic> mutation alters the population of OLs by increasing the proportion of OPCs while reducing the population of mature OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This reduction in mature OLs was confirmed by TEM imaging of the CC, where the percentage of myelinated axons was significantly reduced in PTHS mice. These structural phenotypes led to functional consequences, as a greater proportion of CAPs propagated down unmyelinated axons within the CC of PTHS mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Furthermore, reduced myelination in the PTHS mouse model is due directly to <italic>Tcf4</italic> mutation within the OL lineage, as TCF4-dependent reduction in OL numbers was observed in pure OL-lineage cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) and after OL-lineage specific deletion of <italic>Tcf4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). However, further experiments are required to fully understand how TCF4 mechanistically regulates the OL lineage.</p>
<p id="P27">Numerous other ASD mouse models have reported myelination defects. <italic>Tsc2</italic> mutant mice that model Turberous Sclerosis display hypomyelination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

<title>Myelination defects in idiopathic ASD</title>
<p id="P28">In humans, the process of CNS myelination begins early in the first year of life and continues throughout development which immediately precedes the first appearances of ASD clinical abnormalities and temporally coincides with the progression of the disorder <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.

<title>Hypo- and hypermyelination in ASD</title>
<p id="P30">To gain insight into more genetically complex forms of ASD in humans, we compared transcriptional profiles from mouse models of monogenic forms of ASD to RNA-seq from the cortex and cerebellum of human postmortem ASD patients and controls. Using an RNA deconvolution strategy, we show hypomyelination is present in two independent sets of human ASD cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). However, given that hypo- and hyper-myelination is observed and predicted in various monogenic mouse models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and by our RNA-seq analysis, we predict some human cases of ASD would present with hyper-myelination, and several lines of evidence support this prediction. First, EEG studies measuring event-related potentials in ASD patients have observed heterogeneity in response latency due to auditory stimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and this result could be due to varying levels of myelination across ASD cases. In addition, there may be region specific myelination defects in ASD, with single individuals showing both hypo- and hyper-myelination within a single individual depending on the brain region examined <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Evidence of region specificity of myelination defects is supported by neuroimaging studies, which show highly specific WM tract deficiencies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Furthermore, macrocephaly is a common endophenotype observed in many individuals diagnosed with ASD, and specifically in individuals with <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and some atypical forms of Rett syndrome caused by <italic>MECP2</italic> mutation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Therefore, we speculate that macrocephaly and hypermyelination may coincide in a proportion of ASD individuals.</p>

<title>Primary or secondary pathophysiology</title>
<p id="P31">Our results indicate that mutations in <underline><italic>Tcf4</italic></underline> lead to a cell autonomous effect on the OL lineage. We show in pure OPC cultures, that TCF4 protein is expressed and when mutated it leads to an increase in the proportion of OPCs and a decrease in the proportion of OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). In addition, we replicated this phenotype by genetically deleting a single <italic>Tcf4</italic> allele within the OL-lineage using Cre recombination driven by the <italic>Olig2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). We show cell autonomous defects in myelination are a primary pathophysiology in PTHS, and we identify transcriptional signatures that suggest myelination defects are a common pathophysiology in ASD. However, we do not claim myelination defects are strictly cell autonomous across ASD. Similar to neurons, OLs are responsive to their environment, and it is known that neuronal activity and experience regulates myelination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Instead, we suggest ASD mutations affecting neuronal function may lead to non-cell autonomous defects in myelination that varies between individual cases. The proximity and communication between OLs and neurons predicts that dysfunction in one cell type will have negative consequences on the other cell type.</p>
<p id="P32">We have provided a concise framework to more fully characterize the biological consequences of individual cell populations within bulk tissue RNA-seq expression data and subsequently validate this framework with robust, convergent experimental evidence. In several syndromic mouse models of ASD and human postmortem ASD brain samples, we identify a transcriptional signature implicating OL biology and myelination as being a common pathophysiology across the ASD spectrum. These findings offer an alternative to the neurocentric view of developmental disorders and suggests myelination may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of ASD.</p>

<p id="P53">We calculated CAG eigengenes within the Parikshak <italic>et al</italic> and Wright <italic>et al</italic> datasets to test for association with ASD. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) on the log2(RPKM+1) of the 34 CAG genes homologous between mouse and human. This is analogous to treating the CAG gene set as a WGCNA module and calculating the corresponding eigengene. In the Parikshak <italic>et al</italic> data, we then associated this eigengene with ASD or 15q duplications diagnoses relative to controls in three different linear mixed effects models, 1) adjusting for brain region, 2) adjusting for brain region, gene assignment rate, sequencing batch, brain bank, RIN, age, sex, which we term the “covariate-adjusted” model, and 3) further adjusting for the top 5 quality surrogate variables (qSVs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> All three models treated donor as a random intercept (since some donors contributed multiple brain regions). We display the “adjusted” eigengene in each plot to account for this statistical adjustment, which preserves the effects of diagnosis in the eigengene while regressing out the effects of the observed and latent confounders (as described in Jaffe et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> and as implemented in the cleaningY function in the jaffelab R package.</p>

We specifically scaled the expression values of these 146 genes within the reference set prior to estimating the weights for each gene, and then within the postmortem ASD data to make values more comparable across datasets prior to deconvolution. Using data from Parikshak et al, we tested for composition differences between diagnostic groups across all samples using linear mixed effects modeling, using the same three models as above, and plotted the effects of cell types on diagnosis using values adjusting for the full observed and latent confounder model (which better visually reflects the multiple regression p-value).</p>
<p id="P55">In the data from Wright et al, we tested for ASD effects on RNA composition and the CAG eigengene effects using linear regression, adjusting for RIN, exonic mapping rate, sex, and the first 9 principal components (PCs) of the overall expression data, in line with the original publication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
