<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par1">RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) function as master regulators of gene expression. Alterations in RBP expression and function are often observed in cancer and influence critical pathways implicated in tumor initiation and growth. Identification and characterization of oncogenic RBPs and their regulatory networks provide new opportunities for targeted therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par2">We identify the RNA-binding protein SERBP1 as a novel regulator of glioblastoma (GBM) development. High SERBP1 expression is prevalent in GBMs and correlates with poor patient survival and poor response to chemo- and radiotherapy. SERBP1 knockdown causes delay in tumor growth and impacts cancer-relevant phenotypes in GBM and glioma stem cell lines. RNAcompete identifies a GC-rich region as SERBP1-binding motif; subsequent genomic and functional analyses establish SERBP1 regulation role in metabolic routes preferentially used by cancer cells. An important consequence of these functions is SERBP1 impact on methionine production. SERBP1 knockdown decreases methionine levels causing a subsequent reduction in histone methylation as shown for H3K27me3 and upregulation of genes associated with neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and function. Further analysis demonstrates that several of these genes are downregulated in GBM, potentially through epigenetic silencing as indicated by the presence of H3K27me3 sites.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par3">SERBP1 is the first example of an RNA-binding protein functioning as a central regulator of cancer metabolism and indirect modulator of epigenetic regulation in GBM. By bridging these two processes, SERBP1 enhances glioma stem cell phenotypes and contributes to GBM poorly differentiated state.</p>

<sec id="Sec1">
<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par4">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common type of brain tumor with 13,000 new cases each year in the USA alone. Unfortunately, relapse occurs in almost every case with an average survival of 14 months after diagnosis. The data generated by large cancer genomics consortia have become a critical tool to develop new therapeutic approaches against very aggressive tumors like GBM. In this respect, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has produced an extensive transcriptomic map, identified prevalent chromosomal alterations, and defined important GBM driver mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This knowledge has improved molecular classification, but thus far, therapeutic strategies based on these findings have not yielded a major breakthrough. Post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, poly adenylation, decay, and translation are often linked to tumorigenesis while many of their regulators have been shown to display tumor suppressive or oncogenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, studies on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that regulate these processes have the potential to expand our knowledge of GBM signaling and open up new avenues for therapy.</p>
<p id="Par5">Over 1500 RBPs have been cataloged in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Changes in their levels or functional activity lead to multiple alterations in RNA processing and/or expression that eventually contribute to acquisition of cancer-relevant phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite their relevance and the fact that RBPs are largely altered in tumor tissue, the number of well-characterized RBPs in the context of tumorigenesis is still very small. RBPs are particularly relevant in the nervous system where splicing and translation regulate critical aspects of neurogenesis, neuronal function, and nervous system development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Not surprisingly, RBPs are important oncogenic factors in medulloblastoma and gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par6">We have identified SERBP1 (Serpine1 mRNA-binding protein 1) as a new oncogenic factor in GBM. SERBP1 is a member of the RG/RGG family of RNA-binding proteins, known for their involvement in neurological and neuromuscular diseases and cancer. SERBP1 regulates the expression of Serpine1 (PAI-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], a member of the serine protease inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. SERBP1 may contribute to development of numerous tumor types. It has been identified as a target of the tumor suppressor miRNA miR-218 in hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC) and linked to cell migration/invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. SERBP1 is markedly upregulated in prostate cancer and significantly associated with tissue metastasis and Gleason score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It was also recently identified in a screening for driver genes mediating progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) using a xenotransplant mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In ovarian cancer, SERBP1 expression is higher in advanced disease, suggesting it plays a role in invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Finally, a Bayesian network study identified SERBP1 as part of the most influential gene signature in GBM development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par7">SERBP1 regulates mRNA translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but known protein patterns suggest additional regulatory functions. Vig and vig2, SERBP1 Drosophila homologs, encode RNAi complex components that are involved in heterochromatin formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and were recently identified in a CRISPR screening for histone gene regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. SERBP1 also was identified as a partner of Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) in a two-hybrid screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and interacts with arginine-methylated and stress granule-associated proteins like heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMR1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. SERBP1 also interacts with ribosomal proteins, congruent with its role in regulating translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par8">In the present study, we investigated the role of SERBP1 in GBM development. High SERBP1 expression levels were linked to poor patient outcome and response to therapy. SERBP1 knockdown produced strong effects on cancer-related phenotypes and tumor growth. Genomic analysis indicated that SERBP1 is a critical player in cancer metabolism. An important consequence of this regulation is that SERBP1 modulates methionine production, affecting histone methylation and subsequently expression of neuronal differentiation genes. Overall, our results established SERBP1 as a novel oncogenic factor and a potential therapeutic target.</p>

<title>SERBP1 is a novel prognostic marker in GBM</title>
<p id="Par9">We evaluated the role of SERBP1 as an oncogenic factor in glioma/GBM and its potential impact on patient survival and response to therapy. In a multi-tissue transcriptomic analysis performed with the GTEx dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], brain tissues show reduced SERBP1 mRNA expression while two transformed cell lines (LCL and FIBRBLS) showed the highest levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>a). Notably, SERBP1 shows higher expression in GBM (TCGA samples) compared to normal brain and LGG (low-grade glioma, grade II) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>b, c, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Table S1). High SERBP1 expression was associated with poor survival in glioma patients in the TCGA and CGGA cohorts (Fig. S1A, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Table S2). Moreover, we observed that SERBP1 displays increased levels of expression in 25 tumor types when compared to normal tissue (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S1B) and data in the R2 database indicated that high SERBP1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in the cases of neuroblastoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and sarcomas (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S1C).

<p id="Par10">To corroborate and expand these results, we conducted a study using a glioma cohort from the Shanghai Changzheng Hospital. Samples were analyzed via immunostaining; SERBP1 was not detected in 21.5% of the samples, was mildly positive in 18.1%, was moderately positive in 37.3%, and was strongly positive in 23.2% of patients. We further examined whether SERBP1 expression was associated with glioma grades. SERBP1 was positive in 28.6% of those with grade I gliomas, 55.6% of those with grade II gliomas, 83.3% of those with grade III gliomas, and 89.0% of those with grade IV gliomas (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, 71.2% of patients with grade IV (GBM) had high positive staining for SERBP1, significantly more than grade I (7.1%), grade II (40.7%), and grade III (61.1%) gliomas (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>c, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Table S3). SERBP1 expression was closely correlated with WHO grade of glioma (low grade vs. high grade, chi-square test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Table S3). Despite variable expression of SERBP1 in gliomas, GBM samples had noticeably higher expression of SERBP1 compared to LGG samples. The median survival was 13.12 ± 1.12 months (95% confidence intervals [CI] 10.91–15.33) for patients with high SERBP1 expression and 23.73 ± 1.76 (95% CI 20.23–27.23) months for patients with low SERBP1 expression (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>d). GBM patients with low SERBP1 expression had markedly longer survival (17.41 ± 1.93 months, 95% CI 13.48–21.35) than those with high SERBP1 expression (10.52 ± 0.97 months, 95% CI 8.59–12.46) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0006) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>e).</p>
<p id="Par11">We also examined whether survival time was influenced by postoperative adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy and chemotherapy). As shown in (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>f), among GBM patients who received chemotherapy (temozolomide), those with low SERBP1 levels had significantly longer survival (20.91 ± 2.52 months, 95% CI 15.67–26.15) than those with high SERBP1 levels (11.11 ± 1.22 months, 95% CI 8.68–13.55) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0002). Similarly, patients with low SERBP1 levels gained more benefit from radiotherapy in terms of survival (18.81 ± 2.69 months, 95% CI 13.09–24.54) than those with high SERBP1 levels (9.24 ± 1.15 months, 95% CI 6.90–11.57) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>g).

<title>SERBP1 influences cancer-relevant phenotypes</title>
<p id="Par12">We conducted several assays to determine if high expression of SERBP1 is required to maintain cancer-relevant phenotypes. All experiments were performed with siRNA knockdown since attempts to produce SERBP1 knockout lines using the CRISPR-Cas9 approach were not successful, suggesting that at least the GBM lines we tested are unable to survive without SERBP1 function.</p>
<p id="Par13">SERBP1 knockdown caused a dramatic impact on U251 and U343 cell viability as detected via MTS assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>a, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S2A, S3A) We also conducted a cell colony formation assay and observed in both lines that a decrease in SERBP1 expression dramatically reduced GBM cell ability to form colonies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>b, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S3B). Similarly, using the Boyden chamber assay, we determined that cell invasion was compromised when SERBP1 was silenced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>c, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S3C). Next, we investigated if SERBP1 knockdown affects apoptosis. We examined PARP1 cleavage by Western blot as well as annexin-V staining using flow cytometry; in both scenarios, we observed an increase in product in cells transfected with siSERBP1 compared to control siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>d, e). Similarly, we observed a higher caspase 3/7 activity in SERBP1 knockdown cells compared to control, corroborating the role of SERBP1 in apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>f). Finally, we evaluated the impact of SERBP1 on glioma stem cell (GSC) survival and proliferation. Geltrex was used to allow GSC cultures to grow as monolayers. Survival was evaluated using the MTS assay while cell proliferation was followed over time using the Incucyte system. SERBP1 knockdown decreased survival and the proliferation of both proneural and mesenchymal GSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>g, h; Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S2B).

<p id="Par14">Next, we evaluated the impact of SERBP1 on tumor growth using intracranial xenografts. We selected the highly aggressive GSC line 3565 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and prepared a stable line containing a tet-inducible SERBP1 shRNA via lentiviral infection. Evaluation of this line in vitro showed that 80% knockdown can be achieved upon treatment with doxycycline. Reduction in neurosphere formation and survival were observed upon treatment with doxycycline and results correlated with the amount of drug used (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig.S2C-F). Both control group and experimental groups (5 males and 5 females/group) were implanted with 3565 SERBP1 shRNA-tet cells. In the experimental group, cells were treated with doxycycline prior to implantation and mice were allowed to drink water containing doxycycline ad libitum. By reducing SERBP1 expression in the experimental group, we extended the median survival by 11 days versus controls group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0026) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>i). Tumors also showed very different morphology. As reflected by the immunostaining with anti-Ki67, there is a marked difference in the number of highly proliferating cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>j). SERBP1 expression profile, its impact on GBM patient survival, response to therapy, cancer phenotypes and tumor growth establish SERBP1 as a new oncogenic RBP in GBM.</p>

<title>Characterization of SERBP1-binding motif and regulatory impact</title>
<p id="Par15">To define SERBP1 RNA-binding preferences, we used RNAcompete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Full-length recombinant SERBP1 protein was incubated with a pool of ~ 240,000 designed (non-random) RNA oligos. RNAs selected by SERBP1 were identified via microarray hybridization and subsequent computational analysis identified a GC-rich RNA-binding motif for SERBP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>a). We also expressed and purified SERBP1 as a N-terminus His<sub>6</sub> fusion protein and used fluorescence polarization (FP) to quantitatively measure its binding affinity to an RNA 7-mer (5′- GCGCGGG - 3′), identified by RNAcompete. The measured equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of SERBP1-RNA interaction (K<sub>D</sub> ~ 47 nM) corroborates its strong affinity to the sequence identified by RNA Compete (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>b). To determine if SERBP1 binds to this motif in cells, we conducted a RIP-Seq experiment. We observed that ~ 40% of the mRNAs species determined to be bound by SERBP1 display the identified GC-rich motif in their 3′ UTR, a number that is much higher than expected by chance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>c). Complete results of the RIP-Seq analysis are shown in (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Table S5). Finally, we selected genes with multiple “SERBP1-binding motifs” in their 3′ UTR that also were affected by SERBP1 knockdown (see RNA-Seq analysis below) to perform luciferase assays. Luc-reporters containing the 3′ UTR of these genes were co-transfected with a SERBP1 expression vector or control. In all cases, SERBP1 transgenic expression increased the expression of the luciferase reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>d), indicating promotes mRNA stability and/or translation of these transcripts.

<title>SERBP1 is a regulator of “cancer metabolism”</title>
<p id="Par16">To understand how SERBP1 contributes to cancer-relevant phenotypes, we performed an RNA-Seq analysis in control vs. SERBP1 knockdown U251 cells. SERBP1 knockdown decreased expression of a large set of genes associated with metabolism and metabolism regulation as illustrated by the top enriched Gene Ontology terms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>a, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Table S6). Network analysis showed that this set of genes associated with metabolism is highly interconnected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>b). Similarly, RIP-Seq analysis determined that multiple transcripts (genes) bound by SERBP1 are implicated in metabolism (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Table S6). In particular, two interconnected metabolic routes, serine biosynthesis and one-carbon (1C) cycle, are highly affected by SERBP1 knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>c). Altered expression of genes linked to these pathways was validated by qRT-PCR and Western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>d, e). Immunostaining of xenografts also showed that SERBP1 knockdown also produced a dramatic decrease in PHGDH expression in tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>f).

<p id="Par17">One-carbon (1C) metabolism is a universal folate-dependent pathway that produces 1C units used for de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis, interconversion of several amino acids, production of universal methyl donors, and regeneration of redox cofactors, all of which benefit cancer survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Targeting of some 1C enzymes has already been explored as a therapeutic strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Relevant 1C genes include PHGDH (3-phospho-glycerate dehydrogenase), SHMT2 (serine hydroxylmethyl-transferase 2), MTHFD2 (methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2), and PSAT1 (phosphoserine aminotransferase 1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>b). In cancer cells, 3-phosphoglycerate is used as part of a growth-promoting mechanism to synthesize serine and glycine and to generate NADPH. Half of glucose-derived carbon is used in serine biosynthesis and PHGDH functions as the limiting enzyme in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. PHGDH is overexpressed in glioma and affects invasion and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. SHMT2 is a critical enzyme in the 1C cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and controls a critical point in cancer metabolism—direction of serine/glycine conversion. Depletion of serine inhibits cancer cell proliferation and reduces purine levels, a similar effect is observed after SHMT2 knockdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. MTHFD2 is a NAD+-dependent enzyme with dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activity implicated in mitochondrial 1C folate metabolism and it is one the most frequently metabolic enzymes overexpressed in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. PSAT1 is a critical enzyme in the sub-pathway that synthesizes L-serine from 3-phospho-D-glycerate. High PSAT1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in many tumors including breast cancer, colorectal, nasopharyngeal, and esophageal carcinomas and is linked to drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par18">We conducted a metabolic study to corroborate the results of our RNA-Seq analysis. Since SERBP1 siRNA knockdown markedly affected viability and apoptosis, we opted to use a U251 stable line with a tet-inducible shRNA. Principal component analysis (PCA) performed on the metabolomics data shows a distinct separation between the control and the SERBP1 knockdown groups (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S4A-B). Volcano plot data shows a significant depletion of methyl cycle intermediates (S-adenosylhomocysteine and methionine) and accumulation of the 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) cycle intermediates (putrescine and N-acetylputrescine) (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S4C). Metabolic analyses corroborated that SERPB1 modulates serine metabolism and interferes with the transfer of one-carbon unit (C1) from the folate cycle to the methyl cycle. This change could alter DNA/histone methylation, regeneration of redox cofactors, and nucleotides biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The effect is evident from the significant depletion of methionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the byproduct of methylation that recycles methionine through the contribution of a methyl group from 1C cycle intermediate methyl-tetrahydrofolate (methyl-THF) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>a, c and Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S4). High levels of methionine in the cell, as well as diets rich in methionine, have been associated with tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. On the other hand, significant upregulation of the polyamine precursors, putrescine, and N-acetyl putrescine suggests the unavailability of methionine and its metabolite S-adenosylmethionine (SAM); SAM provides the amino-propyl group to putrescine for polyamine synthesis through the MTA cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, depletion of cysteine is linked to the downregulation of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) which catalyzes biosynthesis of cysteine from SAH, having homocysteine and cystathionine as intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

<p id="Par19">A decrease in the total levels of glutathione was determined by a luminescent-based assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>b). Since cysteine is a precursor of glutathione (GSH), a redox-regulating metabolite, its depletion might affect the redox balance in SERPB1 knockdown cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>c). Similarly, significant depletion of coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) or a high CoQ<sub>10</sub>/CoQ<sub>10</sub>H<sub>2</sub> ratio in the knockdown group suggests dysregulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (mETC), inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that ultimately trigger apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. CoQ10 is a lipophilic redox cofactor that functions as an electron carrier in the mETC and generates the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>a, c). In summary, the results of the metabolic analysis support the changes observed in the genomic study, establishing SERBP1 as a novel regulator of metabolic pathways.

<title>SERBP1 impact on neuronal differentiation, “stemness,” and epigenetic regulation</title>
<p id="Par20">Genes upregulated after SERBP1 knockdown are preferentially associated with nervous system development, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis according to GO analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>a, b; Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S5, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Table S6). This data suggests that SERBP1 could function as a “repressor” of neuronal differentiation. In fact, according to our previous analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], most of these genes show an increase in expression during neurogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>c). SERBP1 shows the opposite pattern; NSCs and GSCs display high levels of SERBP1 while decreased expression occurs when cells are induced to differentiate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>d, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S6A-B). Next, we performed gene expression correlation analyses with R2 using TCGA GBM and brain samples. Genes showing strong negative correlation with SERBP1 are found in many GO-enriched categories previously identified in analyses of genes upregulated upon SERBP1 knockdown (e.g., synapse organization, nervous system development, and neurogenesis) (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>: Table S8, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">10</xref>: Table S9). Overall, these results suggest that SERBP1 represses neuronal differentiation. We then evaluated whether increased SERBP1 expression can disrupt neuronal differentiation using the neuroblastoma BE-(2)-C cell line. Cells were infected with either SERBP1 expressing or control lentivirus and treated with or without retinoic acid (RA) to induce differentiation. After 4 days, we used an Incucyte system to measure neurite outgrowth as an indicator of differentiation. RA treatment effectively induced neurite formation but SERBP1 overexpression diminished the effect (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S6C-E).

<p id="Par21">The effect of SERBP1 on methionine production could ultimately influence histone and/or DNA methylation. Therefore, SERBP1 could function as an epigenetic modulator, indirectly repressing the expression of genes implicated in neuronal differentiation. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified strong similarities between the list of upregulated genes in SERBP1 knockdown cells and binding profiles of H3K27me3 and EZH2 and SUZ12, two members of PRC2 which trimethylate histone H3 on lysine 27 (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM11">11</xref>: Table S10). Analysis of H3K27me3 profiles in GBM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] confirmed that several genes “repressed” by SERBP1 show H3K27me3 sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>e, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">12</xref>: Table S11). Consistent with these results, levels of expression for most of these genes are decreased in GBM samples in comparison to brain (cortex) and LGG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>e, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">13</xref>: Table S12. Corroborating the association between SERBP1 and H3K27me3, we determined by Western analysis that SERBP1 knockdown in GBM cells reduced H3K27me3 levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>f).</p>
<p id="Par22">We then tested if a reduction in SERBP1 levels could increase GBM cell sensitivity to PRC2 inhibition. EED226 is a potent and selective PRC2 inhibitor that directly binds to the H3K27me3 binding pocket of EED. Control and SERBP1 knockdown cells were treated with 20 or 40 μM of EED226 and cell proliferation was followed over time with an Incucyte. Since the impact of SERBP1 on cell proliferation is very strong, we decided to use a partial SERBP1 knockdown (40–50% reduction in proliferation) to appreciate the effect of combined treatment. While control cells showed almost no response to EED226 treatment, SERBP1 knockdown cells showed decreased proliferation in response to treatment (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S7A,S7C). To better illustrate the differences between siRNA control and SERBP1 knockdown cells, we show proliferation at the terminal time point, comparing EED226-treated cells to its respective untreated control (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S7B, S7D).</p>
<p id="Par23">In line with these findings, we observed that SERBP1 knockdown decreased expression of several genes associated with PI3K/AKT signaling (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S8A, Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Table S6) which has been shown to modulate the cancer epigenome through methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Corroborating the connection between SERBP1 and the PI3K/AKT pathway, knockdown of SERBP1 reduced levels of AKT and p-AKT in U251 and U343 cells as observed by Western blot (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S8B). Finally, using the glioma cohort from the Shanghai Changzheng, we determined that AKT1 and SERBP1 display good expression correlation based on immunostaining (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S8C).</p>
<p id="Par24">Finally, we examined whether increased expression of SERBP1 could contribute to stem cell features. We generated, via lentiviral infection, a U343 line that overexpresses SERBP1 (SERBP1 OE) (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S2G-H). Control (empty vector) and SERBP1 OE cells were grown as neuro-spheroids in stem cell media. SERBP1 OE cells were more efficient in forming spheres than controls and the difference increased in higher passages (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S9A-B). SERBP1 OE cells also showed increased expression of stem cell markers by qRT-PCR (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S9C). Increased metabolism and radio-resistance are characteristics of “cancer stem cells” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. We observed that SERBP1 OE cells also had increased mitochondrial respiration and ATP production compared to controls (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S9D-E). Consistent with the finding that that high SERBP1 expression influences response to radiation in GBM patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1G</xref>), SERBP1 OE cells were more resistant to radiation than controls as shown in a colony formation assay (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S9F).</p>
<p id="Par25">Overall, our results indicate that SERBP1 contributes to GBM poorly differentiated state and glioma stem cell phenotypes by repressing genes implicated in neuronal differentiation and neuronal function. SERBP1 could influence epigenetic regulation by controlling methionine production via the one-carbon and methyl cycles and the AKT pathway.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="Sec9">
<title>SERBP1 as a new regulator of cancer metabolism</title>
<p id="Par26">Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Cancer cells capture and use nutrients more efficiently and repurpose metabolic pathways, creating alternatives for energy and biomass production. Clinical and preclinical data strongly suggest that targeting metabolism is a realistic strategy to treat aggressive tumors like GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. SERBP1 is perhaps the first example of an RNA-binding protein functioning as a central regulator of metabolic pathways, coordinating expression of related enzymes and associated factors implicated in serine biosynthesis, and MTA cycles. Consistent with this claim, the depletion of key methyl and MTA cycle metabolites (e.g., methionine, SAH, and cysteine) in SERBP1 knockdown cells indicates that SERBP1 controls a variety of processes including methylation of proteins, DNA, RNA, and lipids as well as biosynthesis of nucleotides and polyamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. SERBP1 contributes to glycolysis and TCA cycles through the regulation of methionine, which helps generate redox cofactors necessary to keep dynamic processes such as glycolysis and TCA cycles functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In fact, SERBP1 could have a much broader impact on metabolism, since our RIP-Seq analysis indicated that SERBP1 binds preferentially to transcripts of genes implicated in other metabolic pathways, such as mTOR. All these pathways are critical to cancer cells by regulating their ability to differentiate and quench oxidative stress. Regulation of these mechanisms by SERBP1 may elucidate the pathways by which aggressive cancers thrive.</p>
<p id="Par27">In the set of genes upregulated in SERBP1 knockdown cells, we also identified a list of genes linked to metabolism. Several genes showed reduced expression in GBM versus normal brain and are likely to be epigenetically regulated by PRC2. Among the ones known to have tumor suppressive functions, we have focused on carboxypeptidase C (CPE), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), and phospholipase C-like 1 (PLCL1).</p>
<p id="Par28">CPE is an enzyme that catalyzes the release of C-terminal arginine or lysine residues from polypeptides and is involved in the biosynthesis of neuropeptides and hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In a glioma cohort, loss of CPE predominantly occurred in GBMs and was associated with a worse prognosis. Overexpression of CPE diminished glioma cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. An increase in secreted CPE (sCPE) affected mRNAs levels of genes connected to the motility-associated networks, such as FAK, PAK, Cdc42, integrin, STAT3, and TGF-β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Moreover, sCPE enhanced glucose flux into the tricarboxylic acid cycle at the expense of lactate production; this change reduced aerobic glycolysis, possibly contributing to a less invasive behavior of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par29">PCK1 is a key enzyme in the gluconeogenesis pathway. PCK1 is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma and its reduced expression predicts poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Overexpression of PCK1 decreased viability, induced apoptosis, and inhibited migration of HCC cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The effect was associated with the suppressed glycolysis and induction of gluconeogenesis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Overexpression of PCK1 in glucose-starved HCC cells induced TCA cataplerosis, leading to energy crisis and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. PCK1 overexpression has been used to reprogram tumor-reactive T cells and enhance anti-tumor T cell responses. PCK1-overexpressing T cells restricted tumor growth and increased survival of melanoma-bearing mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par30">PLCL1 is downregulated in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) and predicted a poor prognosis. Restoration of PLCL1 expression in ccRCC cells repressed tumor progression, reduced abnormal lipid accumulation, and caused tumor cell “slimming” through UCP1-mediated lipid browning, which consumes lipids without producing ATP energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par31">In agreement with SERBP1’s positive effect on expression of genes associated with 1C and methyl cycles, SERBP1 knockdown produced marked changes in the levels of several metabolites including methionine. Disruption in methionine production can affect gene expression by interfering with DNA, RNA, and histone methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Methyl groups necessary to fuel methionine regeneration are supplied by methyl donors from the methyl cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], many of which were downregulated in our metabolomic analysis of SERBP1. In GBM, alterations in epigenetic regulation are a critical component of tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. For instance, increased expression of specific histone methyltransferases is often observed in gliomas and causes aberrant methylation of lysine residues such as H3K4 and H3K27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Inhibitors against methyltransferases, in particular PRC2 inhibitors, are being tested in clinical trials of many different tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Although the full impact of SERBP1 on epigenetic regulation remains to be assessed, our data show an important association between SERBP1 and H3K27me3 levels and provides a logical explanation for increased expression of genes implicated in neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis in SERBP1 knockdown cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec10">
<title>SERBP1’s potential impact on neuronal differentiation, synaptogenesis, and nervous system development</title>
<p id="Par32">SERBP1 function in the nervous system is virtually unknown. Its expression is lower in the brain compared to other tissues. Genes implicated in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, nervous system development, and function show strong negative expression correlation with SERBP1 both in brain and GBM samples and increased expression in SERBP1 knockdown cells. In agreement, we observed that SERBP1 expression decreases as NSC and GSC differentiate and that SERBP1 enhanced “stemness.” Altogether, this data suggests that SERBP1 might be critical for neuronal function and its aberrant expression could be linked to neurological disorders. Consistent with this idea, SERBP1 and proteins implicated in synaptic structure and morphogenesis were increased in the brains of a murine model of fragile X mental retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Altered synaptic structure and function are major characteristics of fragile X syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par33">Among genes affected by SERBP1 with critical roles in nervous system development and function, we focus on DCN, NTNG2, and SLC1A2. Decorin (DCN) was the top upregulated gene in SERBP1 knockdown analysis. DCN is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family that has been recently identified as a novel neurogenic factor in the central nervous system and as a critical component of the integrin-Wnt7a-Decorin pathway that promotes proliferation and differentiation of neuroepithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. It has been implicated in tumor development and metastasis and its decreased expression has been observed in various tumor types including gliomas. Importantly, when used as a therapeutic molecule in cancer models, DCN was able to block tumor progression and metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In the case of GBM, DCN expression inhibited cell growth in vitro, promoted cell differentiation, suppressed tumor growth, and increased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par34">NTNG2, a gene that encodes Netrin-G2, is required for proper axonal guidance during early brain development and synaptic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Several mutations in NTNG2 have been described and they cause global developmental delay, hypotonia, secondary microcephaly, Rett-like phenotype, and autistic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Knockdown of murine Ntng2 caused severe impairments of neuronal morphology and cortical migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] while knockout of Ntng2 in a cellular model resulted in short neurites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par35">SLC1A2 is a member of the solute transporter family that clears the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from the extracellular space at synapses, allowing proper synaptic activation and preventing neuronal damage. Dysfunction or reduced expression of SLC1A2 has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. In gliomas, glutamate excitotoxicity induces neurodegeneration and necrosis. In this respect, inhibition of SLC1A2 in rats reduced glutamate uptake by glial cells and caused neuronal cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p>

<title>Targeting RNA-binding proteins in cancer therapy</title>
<p id="Par36">RNA-binding proteins modulate gene expression from RNA processing to translation. Studies using TCGA data showed many mutations in RBPs and alterations in their expression levels across tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. RBPs can be targeted by small-molecule inhibitors as in the case of HuR and Musashi1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] or by RNA aptamers or modified RNA oligos bearing the consensus binding motif of the RBP to be targeted. Targeting RBPs provides an opportunity to disrupt multiple cancer-relevant pathways at once. In the case of SERBP1, its blockage could hit cancer metabolism and epigenetic regulation.</p>

<sec id="Sec12">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par37">Our study defined SERBP1 as a novel oncogenic factor in GBM and as an indicator of prognosis and response to therapy. SERBP1’s role in regulating a gene network implicated in metabolic pathways relevant to cancer cells is likely to be a key contributor to its broad impact on cancer phenotypes and tumor growth. SERBP1 emerges as the first RBP to function as a critical modulator of metabolic pathways.</p>
<p id="Par38">An important downstream effect of SERBP1 function is its impact on epigenetic regulation. SERBP1 ultimately impacts methionine production. Methionine levels influence DNA, RNA, and histone methylation. In particular, we observed that SERBP1 knockdown in GBM cells decreased methionine production causing a subsequent reduction in H3K27me3 levels and upregulation of genes associated with neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and function. We showed next that increased expression of SERBP1 prevents neuronal differentiation, enhances stem cell phenotypes, and resistance to radiation while SERBP1 knockdown increased sensitivity to epigenetic inhibitors. Overall, our results indicate that besides its role in GBM development, SERBP1 might be implicated in brain function and neurological disorders. Due to its broad impact on cancer-relevant processes and pathways, SERBP1 emerges as an important oncogenic factor and potential therapeutic target.</p>

<title>SERBP1 expression analysis in tumors and normal tissue</title>
<p id="Par39">Count reads of glioma (grades II–IV) samples were first obtained from the TCGA data repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Raw sequencing reads were then extracted using SAMtools collate and fastq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] and subsequently processed using Kallisto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] with an index of 31 k-mers and GENCODE as a reference to the human transcriptome. Transcript abundance estimates were then collapsed into gene-level normalized read counts (TPM) using the R package tximport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. In addition, normalized read counts (TPM) data from healthy (frontal) cortex samples were directly obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (release V8; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gtexportal.org/home/">https://www.gtexportal.org/home/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To process SERBP1 expression data in glioma and healthy cortex samples, TPM data was first log-transformed using R. Then, a box plot was built also using R and further edited in Inkscape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://inkscape.org/">https://inkscape.org/</ext-link>).</p>
<p id="Par40">Analyses of SERBP1 expression in normal tissues were conducted using the GTEx platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Normal (GTEx samples) and tumor (TCGA samples) tissues were compared using resources in Gepia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. We performed expression correlation analyses to identify genes with a strong positive or negative correlation with SERBP1 in the TCGA glioblastoma set (RNA-Seq samples) using R2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi">https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi</ext-link>); <italic>R</italic> ≥ 0.3 or <italic>R</italic> ≤ − 0.3, <italic>P</italic> value 0.01 and correlation multiple testing: false discovery rate (FDR).</p>
<p id="Par41">To identify SERBP1-regulated genes with changes in expression during neurogenesis, we used our previously published dataset in which we followed murine neurogenesis in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We selected genes with increased expression after SERBP1 knockdown and compared their expression levels in non-treated neural stem cells (NSCs) vs. differentiated cells (4 days after being transferred to differentiation media). Sequencing reads were processed using Kallisto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] with an index of 31 k-mers and GENCODE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/;">https://www.gencodegenes.org/;</ext-link> vM18) as the reference to the mouse transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Transcript abundance estimates were next collapsed into gene-level counts using the R package tximport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Differential expression analyses were performed between differentiated and undifferentiated NSCs using DESeq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], and genes with an absolute log2FoldChange ≥ 1 and Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) adjusted <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Next, expression levels of genes upregulated after SERBP1 knockdown were compared to those of genes differentially expressed between non-treated NSCs and differentiated cells. Finally, we built a heatmap for normalized expression levels of genes upregulated both upon SERBP1 knockdown and in differentiated NSCs, using the R package gplots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=gplots">https://cran.r-project.org/package=gplots</ext-link>).</p>

<p id="Par53">To evaluate immuno-reactivity, slides were examined in representative visual fields (× 400 magnification) to identify positively stained tumor cells. Intensity of positive staining was scored based on a scale of 0 to 3 (0, no detectable immunostaining; 1 light-brown color; 2, medium-brown color; 3, dark-brown color). The percentage of positivity in staining cells was also scored depending on the following cut points (0, no staining; 1, positive staining in &lt; 25% of the tumor cells; 2, positive staining in 25–75% of the tumor cells; and 3, positive staining in &gt; 75% of the tumor cells). Immuno-reactivity of cells was examined and calculated in five high-powered fields. The two scores were multiplied, and the results were referred to the expression score of the sample. All discrepancies in scoring were reviewed to reach a consensus. The total score representing the ratio of positive cells per specimen plus the intensity was defined as strong (+++ for total score ≥ 6), moderate (++ for total score = 4–5), weak (+ for total score = 1–3), or null (− for total score = 0). Results were further recorded as low or negative expression (+ and −) and high expression (++ and +++).</p>

Briefly, RNAcompete experiments employed defined RNA pools that are generated from 244 K Agilent custom DNA microarrays. Pool design is based on a de Bruijn sequence of order 11 that was subsequently modified to minimize secondary structure in the designed sequences and minimize intramolecular RNA cross-hybridization. After these modifications, not every 11-mer is represented but each 9-mer is represented at least 16 times. To facilitate internal data comparisons, the pool is split computationally into two sets: set A and set B. Each set contains at least 155 copies of all 7-mers except GCTCTTC and CGAGAAG which are removed because they correspond to the SapI/ BspQI restriction site used during DNA template pool generation. A φ2.5 bacteriophage T7 promoter initiating with an AGA or AGG sequence is added at the beginning of each probe sequence in the DNA template pool to enable RNA synthesis. The final RNA pool consists of 241,399 individual sequences up to 41 nucleotides in length (Ray et al. Nature 2013). The microarray design is detailed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>] and can be ordered from Agilent Technologies using AMADID# 02451.

<title>Metabolic assays—Seahorse</title>
<p id="Par87">Mitochondrial respiration was assayed by measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in control or SERBP1 overexpressing U343 glioblastoma cells using a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Cells were plated at a concentration of 15,000–20,000 cells/well into XF96 Seahorse plates 2 days before the experiment. Media was changed the next day to low serum media (containing 2%FBS) and the experiment was run the next day using XF Base Medium Minimal DMEM (Agilent Technologies) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5.5 mM glucose, and 2 mM glutamine. Injections were prepared following the manufacturer’s protocol for the Mito Stress Kit (Agilent Technologies). OCR was normalized to confluence using an IncuCyte® ZOOM phase-only processing module (Essen Bioscience).</p>

<p id="Par93">Acquisition of all tissue specimens was approved by the ethical committee of the Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China, in accordance with procedures and guidelines set by the local ethical committee. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections were acquired from the Department of Pathology, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, between January 2011 and August 2016. The cohort consisted of 177 surgically resected astrocytic tumor specimens, including WHO I grade astrocytoma (<italic>n</italic> = 14), diffuse astrocytoma (<italic>n</italic> = 27), anaplastic astrocytoma (<italic>n</italic> = 18), and glioblastoma (<italic>n</italic> = 118). All cases were re-evaluated to confirm their pathological diagnosis and grading by two independent experienced neuro-pathologists (Dr. Hui-Min Liu and Dr. Wei-Qing Li) using the WHO classification criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. There were 101 males and 76 females in the cohort with a median age of 47 years (range, 11–80 years). None of the patients had received preoperative chemo- or radiotherapy. The mean follow-up period was 18.6 months (range, 1–72 months). Tumor sizes, locations, extent of surgical resection, and post-operative consolidated treatment were recorded. The clinic-pathologic characteristics of the patients are summarized in (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Table S1).</p>
