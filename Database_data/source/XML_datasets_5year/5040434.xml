<abstract>
<p>Adverse effect of alcohol on neural function has been well documented. Especially, the teratogenic effect of alcohol on neurodevelopment during embryogenesis has been demonstrated in various models, which could be a pathologic basis for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). While the developmental defects from alcohol abuse during gestation have been described, the specific mechanisms by which alcohol mediates these injuries have yet to be determined. Recent studies have shown that alcohol has significant effect on molecular and cellular regulatory mechanisms in embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation including genes involved in neural development. To test our hypothesis that alcohol induces molecular alterations during neural differentiation we have derived neural precursor cells from pluripotent human ESCs in the presence or absence of ethanol treatment. Genome-wide transcriptomic profiling identified molecular alterations induced by ethanol exposure during neural differentiation of hESCs into neural rosettes and neural precursor cell populations. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional analysis on significantly altered genes showed potential ethanol’s effect on JAK-STAT signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and regulation of autophagy. We have further quantitatively verified ethanol-induced alterations of selected candidate genes. Among verified genes we further examined the expression of <italic>P2RX3</italic>, which is associated with nociception, a peripheral pain response. We found ethanol significantly reduced the level of <italic>P2RX3</italic> in undifferentiated hESCs, but induced the level of <italic>P2RX3</italic> mRNA and protein in hESC-derived NPCs. Our result suggests ethanol-induced dysregulation of <italic>P2RX3</italic> along with alterations in molecules involved in neural activity such as neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction may be a molecular event associated with alcohol-related peripheral neuropathy of an enhanced nociceptive response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alcohol consumption is recognized as the leading preventable cause of birth defects and mental retardation. High levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), which is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth restriction, craniofacial dysmorphology and structural abnormalities of the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref001">1</xref>]. Depending on conditions and manifestations, these damages are referred as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs), and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). While the developmental defects from alcohol abuse during gestation have been described, it is still unanswered about what are the specific mechanisms by which alcohol mediates these injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref003">3</xref>]. This is important question to address to identify affected children at an early age and intervene to prevent or mitigate the damage.</p>
<p>The effect of alcohol on development has been widely studied in many different animal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref004">4</xref>]. Adverse effect of alcohol on brain function has been well documented. Especially, the teratogenic effect of alcohol on neurodevelopment during embryogenesis has been demonstrated in animal models, which could be a pathologic basis for FASDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref003">3</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that alcohol exposure during preimplantation period has significant effect on embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref005">5</xref>]. Reports have demonstrated genetic, cellular, and biochemical association of alcohol with teratogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref009">9</xref>]. The wide range of physiological and morphological defects associated with in utero alcohol exposure suggest that the etiology of FASDs involve a high degree of cellular and molecular heterogeneity. Gastrulation period is considered to be the most sensitive to teratogenic insult, suggesting that differentiating cells might be especially vulnerable to the teratogenic effects of alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Currently, it is not clearly established what causes FASDs. Recently, epigenetic regulations have emerged as potential mechanisms associated with alcohol teratogenesis. Epigenetic imprinting or genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming has been proposed as a mechanism responsible for alcohol-induced teratogenesis in preimplantation embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref003">3</xref>]. Interestingly, even paternal or maternal alcohol consumption prior to conception has been shown to result in a wide range of birth defects and fetal abnormalities. It is likely that alcohol-induced epigenetic changes in the gametes or within germ line are responsible for pre-conceptional effects of alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref010">10</xref>]. Considering the importance of epigenetic factors in development, especially in central nervous system development and dysfunction, it is quite reasonable to link epigenetic mechanisms as potential regulatory events involved in alcohol teratogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent cells that can be derived into all lineages of cells in the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref014">14</xref>]. Due to this biological competency of ESCs, beneficial utility of ESCs for regenerative medicine has been suggested in many applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref015">15</xref>]. In addition, ESC has been proven to be a useful tool to study mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of genetic disorders, especially disease-associated molecular alterations at the early stage of fetal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref016">16</xref>]. ESCs provide us with an opportunity to establish an experimental model to study the functional effects of genetic alterations on normal embryo development and further to test tools to intervene deleterious effects of genetic alterations on the later stage of life. Stem cell models are beneficial to developmental studies especially where <italic>in vivo</italic> molecular/cellular study models are not available.</p>
<p>Stem cells are especially vulnerable to ethanol (EtOH) toxicity through decreases in pluripotency, survival capacity, and/or altered differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref007">7</xref>]. Studies have shown that alcohol has significant effect on molecular and cellular regulatory mechanisms in ESC differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref017">17</xref>]. More interestingly, it has been demonstrated that alcohol induces alteration in genes involved in neural development in ESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref019">19</xref>]. It is known that gastrulation periods of ESCs including neuronal differentiation process require epigenetic controls, especially DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref002">2</xref>]. Our recent studies have described the molecular signatures of EtOH’s effects on stem cell potency and differentiation in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref020">20</xref>]. Studies also showed that EtOH exposure reduces neuronal stem cell numbers in developing and adult brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>As a surrogate model for adult neural stem cells, pluripotent hESCs can be differentiated into neural progeny and used to elucidate mechanisms underlying early human neurogenesis. An established <italic>in vitro</italic> neural stem cell model will be useful for the evaluation of developmental regulatory mechanisms and also the significance of their alterations in pathological conditions such as developmental disorders or exposure to neuroteratogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref019">19</xref>]. We have derived neural stem cells from human embryonic stem cells as a model to study the effect of teratogen in neural development. We have successfully derived neural precursor cells exhibiting key molecular features of neural stem cells, which will be useful for experimental application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref023">23</xref>]. Our established model has further been used to assess the molecular effect of alcohol treatment on neural stem cell population. It was found that alcohol exposure of neural precursor cells resulted in significant alterations of molecular signatures that may have functional role in neural stem cell maintenance and development and may be further involved in deleterious cellular effect of alcohol exposure.</p>

<title>Human embryonic stem cell culture and derivation of neural stem cells</title>
<p>Human embryonic stem cells (H1 and H9 lines) obtained through license agreement with WiCell Research Institute (Madison, WI) were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layer and were transferred to mTeSR1 serum free human embryonic stem cell (hESC) culture system (STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada). Neural differentiation of hESCs was performed by using STEMdiff Neural System (STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instruction as described in our previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref024">24</xref>]. After 7 day differentiation, morphological assessment and scoring of neural rosettes were done to ensure 50% or more of the area of each aggregate was filled with neural rosettes (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g001">Fig 1</xref>). On day 7, neural rosettes were selected away from contaminating flat cells and collected. The rosettes were resuspended in pre-warmed NIM and cultured on 6-well plates precoated with poly-L-Ornithine and laminin (PLO/L) with daily full medium changes using pre-warmed STEMdiff NIM (without or with 20 mM ethanol) for 5 days with alternating treatment for a day and withdrawal for a day. Cells were EtOH concentration was chosen for its physiological relevance in that 20 mM is equivalent to DUI level and 50 mM falls within levels measured in alcoholics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref025">25</xref>].</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence analysis</title>
<p>To ensure proper neural differentiation of hESCs, the same experimental procedure was applied to a set of cells plated on the coverslips. The level of neural markers (Nestin, Sox2, Musashi and beta-3 tubulin) was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. For IF analysis cells were seeded on a coverslip coated with Matrigel in a 6 well plate. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. IF analysis for neural stem cell markers was done by using Human Neural Stem Cell Characterization Kit (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Samples were incubated with blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in 1X PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times (5 min each) with 1X PBS, samples were incubated with primary antibody [mouse anti-Nestin (1:500), rabbit anti-Sox2 (1:1000), mouse anti-βIII tubulin (1:1000), or rabbit anti-Musashi1 (1:500)] diluted in 1X PBS (or blocking solution) and incubated overnight at 4°C. As a negative control, we have included the same isotype rabbit IgG or mouse IgG at equivalent concentrations. After washing three times for 5 min each with 1X PBS, samples were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody [donkey anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (1:500) or donkey anti-mouse IgG-rhodamine (1:500)] for 2 hrs at RT. After washing, the slips were mounted on the slide with mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and fluorescence imaging was performed with Olympus IX81 imaging microscope.</p>

Briefly, the neural aggregates at D10 for the formation of rosettes and at D15 (5 days after re-plating the rosette clusters for the expansion of neural precursor cells) were used for total RNA isolation by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA purity and concentration was determined by NanoDrop, ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Indianapolis, IN) and microfluidics-based platform 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Samples in biological duplicate were hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome Plus 2.0 (Cat. No. 900469). Standard quality control metrics recommended by Affymetrix including image quality, signal distribution and pair wise scatter plots were used for all arrays.

<title>Derivation of neural precursor cells from human embryonic stem cells</title>
<p>To establish a model system to examine the molecular effects of EtOH on neural differentiation and maintenance of neural stem cells, we used a commercial culture system developed for neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada) as we have previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref024">24</xref>]. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exponentially growing on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder were first adapted to the feeder-free culture system using mTeSR1 medium (STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada) and subjected to embryoid body formation in neural differentiation medium as described in Materials and Methods. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g001">Fig 1A</xref> shows the overall scheme for the derivation of neural precursor cells from hESCs. Neural differentiation was performed in the presence or absence of 20 mM EtOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Cells were collected for RNA purification at day 12 (rosette structure) and day 15 (neural precursor cells). Morphological observation clearly showed the formation or rosette structures and neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However, EtOH’s effect on the process could not be quantitatively assessed by microscopic observation. To examine if hESCs were properly specified into neural cells the expression of neural lineage markers was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Compared to undifferentiated hESCs, rosette and NPC showed induced expression of neural maker Nestin, neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (TBB3 or Tuj1) and Musashi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Expression of stemness factor Sox2 was maintained in undifferentiated, rosette and NPC as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Even though immunofluorescence microscopy analysis was not proper to quantitatively compare the expression level of markers, it seems that EtOH may have inhibitory effect on the expression of Nestin and Musashi, notably in rosette structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>To further quantitatively characterize the neural specification of hESCs into rosette and NPCs, we have performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis on neural markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163812.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We found significant induction of Nestin, Musashi and Tuj1 mRNA in neural rosettes and NPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163812.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Our analysis showed that 20 mM EtOH treatment resulted in significant reduction of Nestin and Musashi mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163812.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). But this reduction seems marginal and may not cause dramatic decrease in the steady state level of mRNA’s considering highly induced levels of these mRNA’s after neural differentiation, which may have marginal effect on the level of corresponding protein as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g002">Fig 2</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that EtOH treatment resulted in significant reduction of pluripotent markers such as Oct4 and Sox2 in undifferentiated hESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref020">20</xref>]. It is known that Sox2 plays a role in the neural specification and proliferation of NPCs while Oct4 and Nanog is involved in mesendoderm differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref026">26</xref>]. We found that neural differentiation resulted in dramatic downregulation of Oct4 mRNA, but the level of Sox2 was comparably maintained and was not greatly affected by EtOH treatment in rosettes and NPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163812.s001">S1C Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Profiling of gene signatures affected by ethanol treatment during differentiation of hESCs to neural precursors</title>
<p>We have used our hESC neural differentiation model to profile gene signatures significantly altered by alcohol exposure, specifically during directed differentiation into neural precursors <italic>in vitro</italic>. H1 and H9 hESCs were independently directed to neuronal differentiation in the presence or absence of 20 mM ethanol in biological duplicates. Mixed population of cells pooled from each replicate was harvested at day 12 for neural rosette cells and at day 15 for neural precursor cells (NPC). Gene expression microarray analysis was done using samples from H1 hESC line. Total RNA was prepared and subjected to gene expression microarray as described in Materials and Methods by using Affymetrix Human U133A 2.0 arrays (data accession number GSE56906). We have analyzed the processed data by Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) and also by simple fold change comparisons against control samples.</p>
<p>We have initially performed WGCNA on datasets from both rosette and NPC samples altogether and found that the effects of differentiation (hESCs to neural rosette and further to NPC) were too overwhelming to see the effect of EtOH treatment on gene signatures (data not shown). Correlation of gene expression to EtOH treatment was not strong enough over the effect of differentiation (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to analyze the dataset for the effect of EtOH on rosette cells separately from on NPC. We performed WGCNA on undifferentiated hESCs (undiff), differentiated without EtOH treatment (EtOH 0 mM) and differentiated with EtOH treatment (EtOH 20 mM). We examined correlations to differentiation and EtOH treatment in neural rosette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) or NPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) from the biological duplicate samples (S1 and S2). We identified modules that are altered by differentiation or altered by EtOH treatment during differentiation. As an example, we have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3</xref> the most significantly associated module with EtOH treatment in rosettes and NPCs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3A</xref> shows the magenta module of genes that were upregulated in rosettes, but downregulated by EtOH treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3B</xref> shows the salmon module of genes that were upregulated in NPCs, but downregulated by EtOH treatment. This analysis allowed us to identify gene signatures that were differentially regulated during differentiation into neural rosette or NPC and affected by EtOH treatment.</p>

Result from rosettes identified the magenta module of genes that were upregulated in rosettes, but downregulated by EtOH treatment. <bold>B</bold>. Analysis for NPCs showed the salmon module of genes that were upregulated in NPCs, but downregulated by EtOH treatment. Heatmaps are shown for modules with most significant association with EtOH treatment identified from the module trait map of the module eigengene (ME) from two biological duplicates (S1 and S2) to each treatment. Rosettes showed less extent of association than NPCs. <bold>C</bold>. In addition, we have performed WGCNA analysis on gene expression microarray data to directly assess EtOH’s effect on transcriptomic alterations in neural rosettes and NPCs with and without EtOH treatment. <bold>D</bold>. Heatmaps are shown for modules with most significant association upon EtOH treatment (biological duplicate of Et1 and Et2) compared to without EtOH (biological duplicate of C1 and C2). The Brown module (upregulated- red) and the blue module (downregulated- green) with EtOH treatment in neural rosettes and the purple module (upregulated- red) and the black module (downregulated- green) upon EtOH exposure in NPCs. <bold>E</bold>. Common genes that demonstrated consistent alterations were identified. For example, genes in the blue module (downregulated &gt;2 fold in EtOH-treated rosettes compared to untreated rosettes) were compared to the magenta module (&gt;2 fold upregulated during differentiation into rosettes and then downregulated &gt;2 fold upon EtOH treatment). Similar analysis was done with the black and salmon modules to identify genes truly downregulated in NPC with EtOH treatment.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="pone.0163812.g003"></graphic>
</fig>
<p>It was noted that correlation to EtOH treatment was not strong and only a very limited number of modules showed EtOH-dependent association. We reasoned that this was due to the strong effect of neural differentiation on the gene regulation in our model. Next we examined correlative gene expression simply associated with EtOH treatment in differentiated cells. We used datasets from differentiated rosette cells or NPCs with or without EtOH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). WGCNA on rosette cells (control vs. EtOH treated) showed that the brown module was most significantly correlated to genes upregulated and the blue module was most significantly correlated to genes downregulated upon EtOH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). A heatmap for each representative module is shown. Similar analysis was done with dataset from NPC cells. The purple module was most significantly correlated to genes upregulated upon EtOH treatment and the black was most significantly correlated to genes downregulated upon EtOH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). To examine concordance between these two different analysis settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3A/3B</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3C/3D</xref>), we examined genes that were coherently altered by EtOH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). The magenta module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and the blue module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) represent genes downregulated in rosette cells upon EtOH exposure. Likewise, the salmon module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) and the black module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) represent genes downregulated in NPCs upon treatment with EtOH. The result showed list of genes that were similarly affected by EtOH treatment in two analysis settings.</p>
<p>To examine potential effects of EtOH on biological process, we have performed DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) on genes from the blue (downregulated in neural rosette), the black (downregulated in NPC), the brown (upregulated in neural rosette) and the purple (upregulated in NPC). EtOH treatment in neural rosettes showed alterations of genes potentially involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cell adhesion molecules and calcium signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The black module of downregulated genes in NPC upon EtOH treatment was associated with several important signaling pathways, such as JAK-STAT, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). On the other hand, the purple module of upregulated genes showed association with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To examine if there is any concordance in molecular networks in NPCs and neural rosettes affected by EtOH treatment, we have identified common genes in rosettes and NPCs that showed greater than 3-fold changes upon exposure to EtOH by using Venny 2.0.2 (Computational Genomics Service) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163812.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). We identified core genes that are similarly regulated by EtOH treatment in rosette cells and NPCs by combining the genes in the blue and the black module for commonly downregulated genes (&gt;3-fold) and by combining the genes in the brown and the purple module for commonly upregulated genes (&gt;3-fold). List of genes are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0163812.t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The effect of EtOH on the expression of one of the candidate genes, <italic>P2RX3</italic>, was validated by both qRT-PCR analysis and western analysis. The <italic>P2RX3</italic> gene encodes a purinergic receptor which functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and mediates peripheral pain responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref027">27</xref>].

We suggest it may also have a functional significance in alcohol-induced neuropathy. qRT-PCR analysis was performed to compare the relative fold changes of <italic>P2RX3</italic> expression in undifferentiated H1 hESC and hESC-derived NPC treated with EtOH. <italic>P2RX3</italic> in undifferentiated hESC was downregulated and conversely upregulated in NPC with increased EtOH concentration.

We included 50 mM EtOH to examine if there is a dose dependency or any potential variations in response to different doses of EtOH. <italic>CNTNAP4</italic> and <italic>P2RX3</italic> genes are among upregulated genes that are upregulated by EtOH treatment. To examine if the alteration is due to EtOH’s effect we have concomitantly treated NPCs with EtOH and dihydromyricetin (DHM), a flavonoid component of herbal medicines that counters acute EtOH intoxication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref028">28</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Various factors, signaling molecules, and other medias have been applied to differentiate ESCs into various neural precursor cells (NPCs). Some of them include: stromal-derived inducing cells, retinoic acid, bone morphogenetic protein, fibroblast growth factor receptors, and neurobasal medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref029">29</xref>]. ESCs can differentiate into the columnar neuroectodermal cells known as neural rosettes and can mimic <italic>in vivo</italic> neuroectodermal development in terms of timing and morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref030">30</xref>]. Neural rosette cells can proliferate by self-renewal over a certain period of time and contain neural progenitor cells, which can further differentiate into more restricted progenitors leading to neuronal and glial cell lines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref032">32</xref>]. NPCs express high levels of neuroepithelial markers such as nestin, Pax6, Sox1, and maintain expression of Sox2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref033">33</xref>]. Differentiation potential of rosette cells diminishes with proliferation, occurring <italic>in vivo</italic> during neural development. Currently, there are many studies that focus on differentiation of ESCs for specific regions of neural cells as the nervous system consists of different regions.</p>
<p>Neural differentiation of ESC and neurogenesis pathway integrates complex epigenetic processes that require strict spatial and temporal cues. Major epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, covalent histone posttranscriptional modifications, chromatin organization, and non-coding regulatory RNA play critical role in pluripotency maintenance and cell fate determination[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref034">34</xref>]. For instance, decreased DNA methylation activates neuronal genes such as Sox2 during ESC differentiation. More importantly, high levels of DNMT1 have been found to be crucial in DNA methylation during neural development. Furthermore, histone acetyl transferases and histone deacetylases are also known to be key players in regulation of ESC differentiation. Yet, the exact role of histone acetylation in embryonic development in terms of NSCs and brain development has not been clearly elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In relation to this study, epigenetic regulation of the neural transcriptome and the alcohol interference has recently studied and discussed widely. Resendiz et al. have elaborated on the alterations in neural stem cell development and on how alcohol leads to neurodevelopment deficits through neuroepigenetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref036">36</xref>]. As alcohol inhibits the differentiation of NSCs, cellular growth, migration, and cell viability are all negatively affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref037">37</xref>]. In specific, NSCs treated with EtOH exhibit cell cycle delays, reduced NSC proliferation and increased DNA fragmentation. In addition, EtOH are found to block the intrinsic hypermethylation of the cell cycle genes such as Adra1a, Tnf, Pik3r1, and Sh3bp2 during differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref038">38</xref>]. Moreover, the pluripotency genes Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog have demonstrated an EtOH-specific delay of down-regulation in NSC models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Additionally, gene expression analysis of hESCs that differentiate into neural cells has facilitated in further defining the molecular mechanisms of neural development. Nestin and βIII-tubulin (TUBB3), which are cytoskeleton proteins, are marker proteins of neural stem cells and neurons respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref039">39</xref>]. Nestin, expressed by neural progenitor cells, is specifically involved in the cytoskeleton remodeling and central/peripheral nervous system development. It has been found that nestin deficiency leads to embryonic lethality through the developmental defect of neural tubes with low NSCs. On the other hand, βIII-tubulin is an identifier for neurons that is also involved in neural development. In fact, mutations in the tubulin-encoding gene TUBB3 are found to yield a set of disease symptoms via microtubule dynamics in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref040">40</xref>]. Interestingly, it has been reported that there is a contrast in expression patterns of the two genes in the NPCs derived from the hESC H9 cell line: Nestin showed high expression while βIII-tubulin showed low expression, as well as random distribution[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref039">39</xref>]. It has also been noted that nestin is highly expressed during early stages of neural development but becomes downregulated in mature neurons whereas βIII-tubulin is expressed robustly in the later stages of the neurogenesis in both the cell soma and the neurite-like structures. Besides nestin and tubulin, there are other classic pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Sox2, ALP, and Nanog, as well as Sox1 and Pax6, which are upregulated during neural induction.</p>
<p>Our study was aimed to assess molecular effect of alcohol on the process of neural differentiation. Potential teratogenic effects of alcohol on fetal development have been documented. Especially studies have demonstrated deleterious effect of ethanol exposure on neuronal development in animal models and on the maintenance and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells derived from stem cells. Molecular and cellular effects of alcohol on neural stem cells and neural progenitors have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref038">38</xref>]. Several studies have shown that alcohol has a significant molecular effect on neural physiology. However, it has not been studied if alcohol exposure <italic>in utero</italic> has any molecular effect on the onset of the lineage specification of hESCs into neural precursors. Our recent study using hESCs demonstrated significant ethanol-induced molecular alterations in hESCs, especially through epigenetic mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we have generated neural stem cells from pluripotent hESCs and examined global transcriptomic signature changes affected by ethanol treatment (Gene Expression Omnibus under GSE56906), which will provide scientific insight on potential molecular effects of fetal alcohol exposure on neural differentiation of early embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref024">24</xref>]. In particular, we have identified and verified several candidate genes that alcohol could interfere in neural stem cell regulation. Major molecular pathways in NPCs affected by EtOH have been demonstrated as associated with alcohol exposure, such as JAK-STAT signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref043">43</xref>], neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref045">45</xref>]and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref047">47</xref>]. Among verified genes, we have further examined EtOH’s effect on <italic>CNTNAP4</italic> and <italic>P2RX3</italic>. <italic>CNTNAP4</italic> is Contactin Associated Protein-Like 4 and belongs to the neurexin family, members of which function in the vertebrate nervous system as cell adhesion molecules and receptors. It is a presynaptic protein involved in both dopaminergic synaptic transmission and GABAergic system, thereby participating in the structural maturation of inhibitory interneuron synapses. Involved in the dopaminergic synaptic transmission by attenuating dopamine release through a presynaptic mechanism. Studies have demonstrated a potential association of <italic>CNTNAP4</italic> autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref050">50</xref>] or alcohol dependence. <italic>P2RX3</italic>, Purinergic Receptor P2X, Ligand Gated Ion Channel 3, belongs to the family of purinoceptors for ATP. It functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and may transduce ATP-evoked nociceptor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0163812.ref052">52</xref>]. It needs to be demonstrated how these genes are dysregulated in NPCs upon EtOH exposure and what are the significance of their dysregulation in mediating EtOH’s effect on NPC development. Further functional assessment using our model will help us delineate molecular mechanisms and understand cellular consequence of alcohol’s effect on neural stem cell regulation.</p>
