<abstract>
<p>Genetic mutations contribute to the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a common, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and repetitive and restricted patterns of behavior. Since <italic>neuroligin3</italic> (<italic>NLGN3</italic>), a cell adhesion molecule at the neuronal synapse, was first identified as a risk gene for ASD, several additional variants in <italic>NLGN3</italic> and <italic>NLGN4</italic> were found in ASD patients. Moreover, synaptopathies are now known to cause several neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. In humans, NLGNs consist of five family members, and <italic>neuroligin1</italic> (<italic>NLGN1</italic>) is a major component forming a complex on excitatory glutamatergic synapses. However, the significance of <italic>NLGN1</italic> in neuropsychiatric disorders remains unknown. Here, we systematically examine five missense variants of <italic>NLGN1</italic> that were detected in ASD patients, and show molecular and cellular alterations caused by these variants. We show that a novel <italic>NLGN1</italic> Pro89Leu (P89L) missense variant found in two ASD siblings leads to changes in cellular localization, protein degradation, and to the impairment of spine formation. Furthermore, we generated the knock-in P89L mice, and we show that the P89L heterozygote mice display abnormal social behavior, a core feature of ASD. These results, for the first time, implicate rare variants in <italic>NLGN1</italic> as functionally significant and support that the NLGN synaptic pathway is of importance in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a childhood disorder manifested by abnormal social behavior, interests, and activities. The genetic contribution to ASD is higher than in other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and mood disorders. Here, we found a novel mutation in <italic>NLGN1</italic>, a gene encoding a synaptic protein, in patients with ASD. We also developed a mouse model with this mutation, and showed that the model mouse exhibits abnormal social behavior. These results suggest that a rare variant in <italic>NLGN1</italic> is functionally significant and support that the NLGN synaptic pathway may be important in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. This humanized mouse model recapitulates some of the symptoms of patients with ASD and will serve as a valuable tool for therapeutic development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and repetitive and restricted patterns of behavior. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently reported that the prevalence of ASD is 1:68 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref001">1</xref>]. ASD is highly-heritable, but the genetic basis is complex, and numerous copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) have been identified in patients with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref008">8</xref>]. Recent large-scale genetic studies have highlighted hundreds of genes as risk factors for ASD pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref007">7</xref>]. Many of these risk-genes have a role in synaptic function and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Neuroligins (NLGNs) are well-characterized as postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules, composed of five family members in humans (<italic>NLGN1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>4X</italic> and <italic>4Y</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref011">11</xref>]. Among NLGN family molecules, <italic>NLGN3</italic> and <italic>NLGN4</italic> were initially associated with non-syndromic ASD, with less support for the relevance of <italic>NLGN1</italic> and <italic>NLGN2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref014">14</xref>]. NLGN family members share the domain structure that comprises a large N-terminal extracellular region containing an esterase homology domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, separated by a single transmembrane region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref015">15</xref>]. NLGN proteins form a trans-synaptic complex with presynaptic Neurexin (NRXN) via the extracellular domain, whereas the cytoplasmic domain interacts with postsynaptic molecules including PSD95, SHANK, EPAC, and MDGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref017">17</xref>]. Genetic variants in <italic>NRXN</italic> and <italic>SHANK</italic> family members have been recurrently identified in patients with ASD as well as other neuropsychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref021">21</xref>]. Moreover, CNVs and SNVs in binding partners of <italic>NLGN1</italic>, <italic>EPAC2</italic>, and <italic>MDGA2</italic> have been reported in ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref023">23</xref>]. Thus, although the specific synaptic pathway for etiology of ASD is not fully understood, the NRXN-NLGN complex and its downstream cascades have been suggested in processes underlying cognition and social behavior.</p>
<p>Several variants in <italic>NLGN3</italic> and <italic>NLGN4</italic> identified in patients with ASD have been well characterized. Variants in these genes result in loss- or gain-of-functions. The reported missense variant in <italic>NLGN4</italic> (R87W) leads to a loss-of-function, whereas a variant in <italic>NLGN3</italic> (R451C) acts in a gain-of-function manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref025">25</xref>]. A variant in <italic>NLGN4</italic> (R704C) is also reported to modulate synaptic response through altering surface AMPA receptor levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref028">28</xref>]. Several types of dysfunction in NLGNs might be involved in ASD pathogenesis. Of note, mouse models with these variants show abnormal behavior relevant to ASD, further supporting the role of these genes in the etiology of ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref028">28</xref>]. Altered expression of <italic>Nlgn1</italic> in the brain has been observed in several mouse models for ASD, such as <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic> and <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref030">30</xref>]. Moreover, normalizing the expression of <italic>Nlgn1</italic> in these mutants ameliorates their ASD-like behavior, indicating that changes in NLGN1 dosage may lead to behavioral abnormalities. However, mouse mutants with <italic>Nlgn1</italic> variants observed in ASD subjects have not been reported, and none of the pathogenic variants have ever been functionally evaluated. Thus the significance of <italic>NLGN1</italic> in neuropsychiatric disorders is still elusive.</p>
<p>In the present study, we systematically examined five rare missense variants in <italic>NLGN1</italic>, including a novel variant found in patients with ASD, to elucidate the molecular and cellular alteration caused by these variants. Furthermore, we developed a model mouse that reflects a novel <italic>NLGN1</italic> variant, Pro89Leu (P89L), identified by exome sequencing of two patients with ASD, and we analyzed behavioral outcomes in this knock-in (KI) mouse line.</p>

To prioritize variants for experimental validation, we defined these criteria as following: a) nonsynonymous or stop-gain; b) absent in ExAC data set (version 3), NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP6500 version 2, European ancestry) and 1000 Genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref034">34</xref>] (2014 Oct, European ancestry); c) Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref035">35</xref>] phred-scale score&gt;10 and d) gene-level Residual Variation Intolerance Score (RVIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref031">31</xref>] &lt; 50<sup>th</sup> percentile. Exome sequencing of the AGRE family (AU0729) identified variants in seven genes (<italic>NLGN1</italic>, <italic>RFX1</italic>, <italic>PPP2R5C</italic>, <italic>C2CD5</italic>, <italic>NCAM2</italic>, <italic>ZBTB1</italic>, and <italic>DISP1</italic>) that were shared by both affected siblings and fulfilled the above listed criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Among the seven variants, two variants in <italic>NLGN1</italic> and <italic>DISP1</italic> were absent in the unaffected sibling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s008">S1 Table</xref>). As <italic>NLGN1</italic> is a synaptic molecule, with paralogs (<italic>NLGN3</italic> and <italic>NLGN4</italic>) implicated in ASD, and based on <italic>in silico</italic> evaluation of other variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s008">S1 Table</xref>), we selected the <italic>NLGN1</italic> variant (P89L) for further <italic>in silico</italic> analysis and experimental validation, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other heterozygous deleterious variants may lead to ASD susceptibility. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the <italic>NLGN1</italic> variant (P89L) was inherited from the mother, who was not diagnosed with ASD but suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>In silico</italic> evaluation of <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants</title>
<p>To evaluate the pathogenic effect of the five detected <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants in ASD patients, we first performed <italic>in silico</italic> prediction. We applied seven tools (CADD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref035">35</xref>], SIFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref037">37</xref>], PolyPhen2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref038">38</xref>], MutationTaster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref039">39</xref>], LRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref040">40</xref>], Mutation Assessor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref041">41</xref>], and FATHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref042">42</xref>]) for the consensus prediction of deleterious effect. Almost all tools predicted three of the five variants (P89L, L269P, and G297E) as deleterious with highest probability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006940.t002">Table 2</xref>). However, only a subset of tools (SIFT, Mutation Taster, and LRT) predicted H795Y and T90I (Mutation Taster and LRT) as deleterious. Based on these results, we grouped these mutants into two types of pathogenic variants: high-risk variants (P89L, L269P, and G297E) and low-risk variants (H795Y and T90I).</p>

Four <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants (P89L, T90I, L269P, and G297E) were located in the extracellular esterase-homology domain (α/β-hydrolase fold domain) and one variant (H795Y) was located in the cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). None of the variants was localized in the known binding interface of <italic>NLGN1</italic>, thus these predicted deleterious variants likely have effects on function that is independent of binding with <italic>NLGN1</italic>-partner molecules (e.g. Neurexins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The amino-acid substitution in the esterase-homology domain can perturb the structure of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref044">44</xref>]. Particularly, P89L and T90I affected the proline-rich loop of the esterase-homology domain, which is structurally rigid and where three pathogenic variants of <italic>NLGN4</italic> observed in ASD subjects (G84R, R87W, and G99S) are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

The <italic>NLGN1</italic> (P89L) site was perfectly conserved in vertebrates and NLGN family members (paralogs), further supporting the damaging effect on protein structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). However, T90I was poorly conserved among NLGN paralogs, and therefore an amino-acid substitution may have a less severe effect. Another <italic>NLGN1</italic>-variant (L269P) located in a helix structure also likely affects the helix formation and structure of the NLGN1 protein. The destabilizing effect for the NLGN1 structure of variants found in ASD (P89L, L269P, and G297E) was further supported by FoldX calculation of free energy change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref045">45</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s001">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression analysis of <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants observed in patients with ASD</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants detected in ASD subjects, we generated five constructs of mutant <italic>NLGN1</italic>, including three high-risk variants (mouse P89L, L269P, and G288E, which corresponds to human P89L, L269P, and G297E, respectively) and two low-risk variants (mouse H786Y and T90I, which corresponds to human H795Y and T90I, respectively). To compare the effect of variants found in ASD patients with that of controls, we also generated a construct of the non-pathogenic variant R707H (corresponding to human R716H, rs118079207 from dbSNP) that had been identified only in healthy control subjects. First, we examined subcellular localization of NLGN1 variants in COS7 cells. Consistent with the role of NLGN1 as a synaptic cell-adhesion molecule, NLGN1 wild-type (WT) was predominantly expressed at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). However, three NLGN1 high-risk variants (P89L, L269P, and G288E) were colocalized with calnexin and were not appropriately delivered to the plasma membrane, indicating that these construct-encoded mutant molecules are exclusively localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) likely due to misfolding of the protein by amino-acid substitution. In particular, P89L and L269P exhibited severe phenotypes. Conversely, two low-risk variants, H786Y and T90I, and the non-pathogenic variant, R707H, were not associated with changes in subcellular localization. The localization of these variants was further confirmed using the antibody against NLGN1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>We next examined the effect of the identified sequence variants on the NLGN1 protein level. In transfected COS7 cells, we observed a significant reduction of NLGN1 expression in four of five NLGN1 variants detected in ASD subjects, including three high-risk variants (P89L, L269P, and G288E) and a low-risk variant (H786Y). The protein level of the T90I variant was comparable with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). Three high-risk variants (P89L, L269P, and G288E) decreased the NLGN1 protein level likely through the ER-associated degradation and protein destabilization as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref047">47</xref>]. However, the H786Y variant showed significantly reduced expression without any abnormal cellular localization, indicating a different process of protein reduction. We assessed another possible mechanism by which the point mutation may induce NLGN1 degradation. Ectodomain shedding, which triggers the rapid degradation of NLGN1 as a mechanism to downregulate excitatory synapse activity, was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref049">49</xref>]. In this process, the extracellular domain of NLGN1 on the plasma membrane is cleaved and secreted to extracellular space. To determine whether this process is affected by H786Y, we quantified the cleaved NLGN1 in conditioned media from COS7 cells expressing NLGN1 variants. Quantification revealed that the amount of cleaved NLGN1 in the H786Y variant was increased at both 18 and 32 hour post-transfection compared to WT, suggesting excessive cleavage and degradation of NLGN1 in this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). However, the three high-risk variants exhibited the decreased amount of cleaved NLGN1, which is consistent with the localization in the ER and lack of plasma membrane expression of these variants. These results suggest that <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants found in ASD subjects (P89L, T90I, L269P, G297E, and H795Y) affected at least two types of degradation processes of NLGN1, ER-associated degradation and ectodomain cleavage, that led to the decreased expression of NLGN1.</p>
<p>To investigate whether decreased expression of pathogenic variants is also observed in neurons, we co-transfected NLGN1 variants with a GFP expression vector in primary hippocampal neurons. In WT as well as the non-pathogenic R707H and pathogenic T90I variants, robust expression of NLGN1 was observed in soma, dendrites, and spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In contrast, four pathogenic variants (P89L, L269P, G288E, and H786Y) showed weak expression of NLGN1 in neurons, which was consistent with the results in COS7 cells. Three high-risk variants tended to express only in soma and proximal dendrites, and weak signals were detected in spines. Overall, these results suggest that majority of <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants (four of five) identified in ASD subjects lead to reduced NLGN1 expression in both cell line and primary neurons.</p>

<title>Functional impairment of <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants observed in patients with ASD</title>
<p>We then tested whether the reduction of NLGN1 affects dendritic spine formation. Quantification of spine numbers in NLGN1 variants transfected in hippocampal neurons revealed that WT, as well as the control R707H variant, had significantly higher spine numbers when compared with GFP transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Similarly, T90I also increased spine numbers compared with GFP transfected cells to a similar extent as WT, suggesting its normal function of spine induction. In contrast, the number of spines in proteins harboring pathogenic variants (P89L, L269P, G288E, and H786Y) was significantly lower than that of WT. Thus, four pathogenic NLGN1 variants impaired spine formation, suggesting that the reduced protein level combined with changes in cellular localization may lead to pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L KI mice</title>
<p>Although the <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants found in ASD subjects displayed significant effects <italic>in vitro</italic>, we sought to investigate the effect of these variants at the organismal level. It remained to be established whether these variants lead to anomalies in ASD traits <italic>in vivo</italic>. We selected the P89L variant in <italic>NLGN1</italic> identified in this study for further analysis for the following reasons: 1) We initially identified this as a novel variant in two ASD siblings and absent in their unaffected sibling; 2) A mother who transmitted the variant to two ASD children exhibited psychiatric disturbances; 3) Significant phenotypes were observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, we generated KI mice with P89L substitution in <italic>Nlgn1</italic> as a possible novel mouse model for ASD. We used CRISPR/Cas9 system to incorporate the P89L substitution, along with a silent mutation at nucleotide 261 to delete a <italic>Bsr</italic>BI restriction enzyme site to facilitate genotyping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref050">50</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>).

<p>Both homozygous and heterozygous <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L mutant mice were fertile and exhibited no gross abnormalities. No decrease of the <italic>Nlgn1</italic> mRNA was observed in mutant mice, but quantification of NLGN1 protein revealed reduced NLGN1 in the KI mouse brain, including cortex, hippocampus, and the cortical synaptosomal fraction, indicating that the P89L substitution destabilized the NLGN1 protein, consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> observations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

<title><italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L mice showed abnormal social behavior and impaired spatial memory</title>
<p>In all ASD patients reported in our study, the NLGN1 variants, including P89L, were in a heterozygous state, suggesting haploinsufficiency and/or a gain-of-function effect underlying pathogenicity. Therefore to assess the behavioral effect of <italic>Nlgn1</italic> variant, we initially performed comprehensive behavioral tests of heterozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s010">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygotes (P/L) show abnormal social behavior, we performed two types of social interaction tests, three-chamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref055">55</xref>] and caged social interaction tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref057">57</xref>]. In the three-chamber social interaction test, mice are given the choice to interact with either the inanimate object (an empty cage) or a cage containing a stranger age-matched male mouse, and the amount of social interaction behavior was measured. The significant effect of chamber was observed in both genotypes (Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, genotype p&gt;0.05, stimulus p&lt;0.01, genotype × stimulus p&lt;0.1). Post-test revealed that WT showed a significant preference for the chamber with the stranger compared to the chamber with the inanimate object, but heterozygote mutant did not show a significant difference from WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Both genotypes spent more time staying around (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s010">S3 Table</xref>) or sniffing the cage with the stranger than the inanimate object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Interaction between genotype and stimulus was significant (Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, genotype p&gt;0.05, stimulus p&lt;0.01, genotype × stimulus p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s010">S3 Table</xref>). We also compared the social preference index to evaluate additional parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref061">61</xref>], and <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygotes were significantly lower than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s010">S3 Table</xref>). These observations indicated not the robust social phenotype in <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygotes but potential impairment in social behavior. In the caged social interaction test, we observed mouse behavior in two sequential test phases. First, a mouse was allowed to explore the field with an empty cage (habituation phase), and then allowed to explore the field with the cage containing an age-matched adult male mouse (test phase). In this test, no difference was observed in the habituation phase between genotypes. However, <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygotes exhibited reduced interaction time with a stranger mouse when compared to WT suggesting the impaired social interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). As an additional test to evaluate social interaction, we performed the tube test for social dominance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref062">62</xref>]. Mouse models of syndromic or non-syndromic ASD show altered behavior in this task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref062">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref063">63</xref>]. In this test, two mice are placed in opposite ends of a clear and narrow tube, and interact with each other in the middle of the tube. A dominant mouse generally forces its opponent out of the tube. When a pair of WT mouse and <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygote was matched, <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygotes more often retreated from WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). These findings imply that <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygote mice have impaired social interaction behavior compared to WT. Additionally, we examined the olfactory habituation/dishabituation and novel object recognition tests of mutant mice, but no difference was observed between genotypes in both tests. Thus odor discrimination and object recognition of mutant mice were not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>We also analyzed ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of mutant mice at both postnatal day 7 (P7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g006">Fig 6F</xref>) and the adult stage (four-month old) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). At both ages, we did not observe a significant difference in call numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s010">S3 Table</xref>). There was also no significant difference in repetitive behavior between genotypes assessed by counting time spent for grooming and the marble burying test, general locomotor activity assessed by the open field test, anxiety-like behavior assessed by the elevated plus maze task, and acoustic startle reactivity by the acoustic startle response test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s010">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies revealed that <italic>NLGN1</italic> is involved in memory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref065">65</xref>]. In fact, several ASD subjects with <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants reported in this study exhibited lower IQ (L269P: IQ = 40; G297E: IQ = 79). To test spatial memory of mutant mice, we performed the Morris water maze test. During the initial training period, <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygotes were slightly delayed to reach the target, but no significant difference was observed between genotypes in latency and distance traveled to reach the platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g006">Fig 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s010">S3 Table</xref>). However, in a probe trial, <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygotes spent significantly less time in the target quadrant compared with WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s010">S3 Table</xref>). Moreover, although WT mice showed a significant preference for the target quadrant, and spent significantly more time in the target quadrant than the other quadrants, heterozygotes did not exhibit a difference between time in target and adjacent quadrants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006940.g006">Fig 6I</xref>). These results suggest that spatial memory, in addition to social interaction, is affected in <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygote mice.</p>
<p>To examine whether additional decrease in <italic>NLGN1</italic> level leads to a more severe phenotype, we performed behavioral tests on <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L homozygotes (L/L) and compared their phenotypes to WT littermates. We did not observe the differences in general locomotor activity, repetitive behavior and anxiety-like behavior, similar to heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s011">S4 Table</xref>). To confirm the abnormal social behavior, we performed a three-chambered social interaction, a caged social interaction and tube test. Similar to <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygote mutants, homozygotes showed a significantly lower winning rate compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s007">S7E Fig</xref>). Contrary to our expectations, we observed the normal social behavior in homozygote mice both in the three-chambered social interaction and the caged social interaction tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s007">S7A–S7D Fig</xref>). The time spent in chambers, time spent around cages, social preference index were comparable to WT. We also examined USV calls at P7, and similar to heterozygous mutants, no difference was observed in call numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s007">S7F Fig</xref>). To investigate the spatial memory of homozygote mice, we performed a Morris water maze test. During training phase, homozygote mutant mice showed a mild but a significant delay of learning both in distance traveled and latency to reach goal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s007">S7G Fig</xref>). In a probe trial, WT mice showed a significant preference for the target quadrant, and spent more time in it compared to all other quadrants. However, homozygote mice exhibited no difference between time in target and opposite, and target and adjacent left quadrant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006940.s007">S7H Fig</xref>). Similar to heterozygous mice, homozygotes also showed a modest deficiency in spatial memory. Although the behavioral phenotypes of <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L homozygotes showed similar abnormalities to heterozygotes, they displayed milder phenotypes in the social interaction assays compared to heterozygous mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Components of the trans-synaptic complex, including neurexins and neuroligins, represent one of the most intensively studied pathways in ASD research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref010">10</xref>]. Nonetheless, to date, none of the <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants detected in patients with ASD have been systematically analyzed. In the present study, we examined the role of pathogenic <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Notably, mutant mice with a novel variant P89L in <italic>Nlgn1</italic> displayed both cellular and behavioral abnormalities that may underlie pathophysiology of ASD.</p>
<p>First, we identified four variants (P89L, T90I, L269P, and G297E) in the extracellular and one (H795Y) in the intracellular domain of <italic>NLGN1</italic> as putative pathogenic variants observed in ASD subjects. Structurally, NLGNs belong to the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily of proteins and have a large extracellular region consisting of the α/β- hydrolase fold domain (esterase-homology domain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref044">44</xref>]. Since it has been shown that variants in the α/β- hydrolase fold domain often influence protein folding and trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref047">47</xref>], three pathogenic <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants localized in this domain (P89L, L269P, and G297E) may impair proper protein folding and trafficking to the plasma membrane. However, the functional consequence of variants in the intracellular domain of NLGNs is still largely unknown. In this study, we also provide evidence for the unique functional effect revealed by the analysis of the H786Y allele (corresponding to H795Y in human). The H786Y variant in the intracellular domain of <italic>NLGN1</italic> leads to excessive cleavage of <italic>NLGN1</italic>, which was concomitant with decreased <italic>NLGN1</italic> expression. This cleavage process may be linked to the activity-dependent degradation of NLGNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref049">49</xref>] implicated in the regulation of synaptic remodeling and transmission. Although the specific biological and functional significance of this process remains unknown, the H786Y variant caused decreased expression of <italic>NLGN1</italic> protein in the cells and impaired induction of dendritic spines. Collectively, our analyses indicate that several cellular mechanisms, combining reduced protein level and abnormal cellular localization may underlie pathogenic effects of <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants, leading to impaired neuronal function.</p>
<p>Second, we asked whether a newly identified variant in <italic>NLGN1</italic> may lead to anomalies in ASD-associated behavior. A previous report showed that <italic>Nlgn1</italic> deletion mice presented relatively mild abnormalities in behavior, especially in social behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref056">56</xref>]. Our human genetic study identified only heterozygous point mutations in the <italic>NLGN1</italic> gene. This is not surprising; the reported <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants are rare and therefore the likelihood of finding these variants in a homozygous or even compound heterozygote state is low. In addition to the rare variants found in ASD subjects (described in this paper), several rare predicted deleterious variants are listed in the ExAC database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref066">66</xref>]. The subjects included in the ExAC collection (n = 60,000) cannot be considered as “healthy controls”. These subjects have been ascertained for biomedically important diseases, and the team excluded severe pediatric conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref066">66</xref>]. We assume that a small number of carriers of deleterious <italic>NLGN1</italic> mutations may have milder behavioral anomalies and therefore would not be excluded from exome analysis. Functional analyses of <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants, such as those reported in our paper, may represent an appropriate justification for the re-contact of rare carriers, including the AGRE family sequenced in our study, and their deep-phenotyping.</p>
<p>To analyze the behavioral consequence of the <italic>Nlgn1</italic> heterozygous point mutation, we generated KI mice of P89L, which recapitulate mutations found in two brothers with ASD. Although the <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygous mice showed only a 30% reduction of <italic>NLGN1</italic> protein in their brain, they displayed aberrant behavior, such as deficits in social interaction, altered social dominance and impaired spatial memory, without affecting basal locomotor activity and anxiety. These findings indicate that even heterozygotes of a point mutation in <italic>NLGN1</italic> contribute to aberrant behavioral traits relevant to ASD.</p>
<p>The impairment of spatial memory and mild deficits in social interaction were previously described in <italic>Nlgn1</italic> KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref056">56</xref>]. Similarly, we observed these deficits in <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L mutants. To evaluate the phenotype of social interaction, we applied the three-chambered social interaction test in addition to the caged social interaction test which was used to test the <italic>Nlgn1</italic> KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref056">56</xref>]. The lower interaction time with the stranger mouse in the caged social interaction test was consistent with the result of <italic>Nlgn1</italic> KO mice. In the three-chambered social interaction test, the analysis of time spent in chamber showed the significant effect of the place of chamber by two-way repeated ANOVA, and the analysis of time spent sniffing revealed that both genotypes spent significantly more time interacting with the stranger mouse than the inanimate. However, another parameter or the further statistical analysis revealed the differences between genotypes. Two-way repeated ANOVA followed by post-test described in Veenstra-VanderWeele <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref055">55</xref>] detected the effect of chamber place only in WT, not in <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L. The preference index calculated by time spent sniffing was significantly lower in <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L mice. These observations suggested a mild deficit in social interaction in <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L.</p>
<p>Electrophysiological studies on <italic>Nlgn1</italic> KO mice reveal that NLGN1 is required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons and modulates striatal glutamatergic neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref069">69</xref>]. Alteration of the synaptic function may result in impaired spatial memory and increased repetitive behavior, respectively. Both <italic>Nlgn1</italic> KO mice and <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L KI mice demonstrate impaired spatial memory, however, <italic>Nlgn1</italic> KO mice display a strong grooming phenotype, whereas <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygotes did not show anomalies in repetitive behavior. Furthermore, unexpectedly, homozygotes show even a milder social behavior deficit and do not indicate more severe phenotypes when compared with heterozygotes. These correlations between gene expression levels and phonotypes are puzzling. Additional <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments will be needed to resolve the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of the NLGN1-P89L allele. Although our study showed a reduced protein level from the mutant and wild-type allele, we cannot exclude a gain-of-function effect of the NLGN1-P89L allele, combined with the dosage effect. Another puzzling finding relates to the effect of the NLGN1-P89L mutation on synaptic structure. While <italic>Nlgn1</italic> KO mice show no reduction in synapse number <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref056">56</xref>], <italic>Nlgn1</italic> P89L heterozygotes display a significant reduction in synapse number <italic>in vitro</italic> but no reduction <italic>in vivo</italic>. This discrepancy might reflect that synapse number is insensitive to absolute NLGN1 levels but depends on transcellular differences in the relative amounts of NLGN1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref070">70</xref>]. The difficulty in comparing our findings on the NLGN1-P89L allele with the published data on behavioral phenotypes of the <italic>Nlgn1</italic> KO represents a limitation of our study. However, future studies that combine a comparison of genetic, biochemical and electrophysiological findings on several <italic>NLGN1</italic> alleles in parallel will resolve complexities of synaptic anomalies and their link to human disease.</p>
<p>Recent genomic studies identified CNVs of <italic>NLGN1</italic> in ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref071">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref074">74</xref>]. With respect to ASD etiology, a common copy number duplication in the non-coding region of <italic>NLGN1</italic> seems to increase the risk of ASD pathogenesis, although the impact of these variants on NLGN1 protein is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref071">71</xref>]. Moreover, altered <italic>NLGN1</italic> levels in brain were observed in multiple lines of ASD model mice such as <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic> knockout and <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref030">30</xref>]. Of note, adjusting the NLGN1 level in these mice rescues ASD phenotypes such as social impairment. Thus, the proper level of <italic>NLGN1</italic> may be indispensable for brain development and maintenance of neuronal network. Similarly, dosage sensitivity has been reported for several genes contributing to the risk for a range of psychiatric disorders, including Rett Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref075">75</xref>]. It is striking that the AGRE database includes information on psychiatric disturbances in the mother and several relatives of two ASD siblings with the P89L variants (mother’s mother with panic attacks, mother’s cousin with mild developmental delay, and mother’s nephew with ADHD). Although we provide strong evidence for the role of <italic>NLGN1</italic> in synaptic spine formation (<italic>in vitro</italic>) and in social behavior in mice, the relevance of these rare variants to ASD will require further genetic evaluation in a larger number of ASD subjects. ASD is a highly polygenic disorder and a cumulative effect of a number of pathogenic variants with a small and intermediate effect leads to the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref036">36</xref>]. Our analysis of exome data for two ASD siblings who share <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants (P89L) can serve as an example for this complexity, because in addition to this variant, each child shared novel deleterious variants in 6 additional genes (<italic>RFX1</italic>, <italic>PPP2R5C</italic>, <italic>C2CD5</italic>, <italic>NCAM2</italic>, <italic>ZBTB1</italic>, and <italic>DISP1</italic>). Interestingly, mouse orthologs of three of these genes (<italic>RFX1</italic>, <italic>PPP2R5C</italic>, and <italic>DISP1</italic>) are essential (lead to embryo-lethality in homozygotes) and therefore likely to add to the cumulative effect on the ASD susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref076">76</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, our comprehensive cellular analyses of <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants and behavioral deficits in a novel <italic>Nlgn1</italic>-P89L mutant mouse provide the first evidence that <italic>NLGN1</italic> variants found in human patients are directly involved in ASD-like phenotypes through multiple mechanisms. Our study reinforces the critical association between genetic variants in <italic>NLGN</italic>s and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Marble burying test</title>
<p>Each mouse was individually placed in a transparent polycarbonate cage containing 5 cm bedding (ALPHA-dri) with 20 clear blue glass marbles. After 30 min, mice were removed from the cage and the number of buried marbles (&gt;50% covered with bedding) was recorded. The light intensity inside the cage was ~55 lux.</p>

<sec id="sec033">
<title>Acoustic startle response test</title>
<p>Each mouse was tested for acoustic startle reactivity. Mice were placed in a Plexiglas cylinder, and acclimated for 5 min. Acoustic stimuli were presented at 0, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 dB in a pseudo-random order. The average inter-trial interval was 15 seconds (range: 10–20 s). The average startle amplitude of six presentations was calculated. The background white noise level in each chamber was 65 dB.</p>

<title>Morris water maze test</title>
<p>The Morris water maze task was conducted as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref053">53</xref>]. A circular maze was filled with the water (20–22°C), rendered opaque by nontoxic white paint. The platform was placed in one of the four quadrants and submerged 1 cm below the surface. The maze was illuminated with 100 lux. Each trial began by placing the mouse into one of the four quadrants facing the pool wall. Training trials lasted up to 60 seconds. A mouse that failed to reach the platform within 60 seconds was subsequently guided to the platform, and placed on it for 10 seconds. Mice were trained to find a platform with a visual cue on days 1–2 (five trials per day) to confirm their visual or motor ability. On days 3–9, hidden platform tests were conducted (four trials per day) to evaluate spatial memory with an inter-trial interval of 25–30 min. A probe test was conducted on day 10. Different order of start positions was applied every day, but the identical order of start positions was used for all subject mice. Data were collected by using a video tracking system, and latency to reach the platform, distance traveled to the platform, and average swim speed were automatically recorded.</p>

<sec id="sec035">
<title>Novel object recognition</title>
<p>The novel object recognition test was conducted as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref084">84</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, one day before the test, mice were habituated to an open field arena for 30 min. The test consists of three phases, a 10-min habituation phase, a 10-min familiarization phase and following a 5-min test phase. In a habituation phase, each mouse was allowed to explore an empty open field arena freely. In a familiarization phase, two identical objects were placed and the subject was allowed to explore it. One hour later, each mouse was placed back in the arena, and allowed to explore one familiar object and one novel object. The arena was illuminated with 20 lux. The behavior was recorded by a video camera, and the amount of time the subject spent sniffing the object was counted by stopwatch.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec036">
<title>Olfactory habituation/dishabituation</title>
<p>The olfactory habituation/dishabituation test was conducted as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref053">53</xref>] with some modifications. One hour before the test, each mouse was placed into an empty cage with a cotton ball for the acclimatizing of the cotton ball itself. The cotton ball was enclosed in a plastic mesh case adhered on the wall of the cage. Nonsocial (water, almond and banana) or social smells were presented sequentially. Each smell was presented for 2 min and then replaced by a new applicator, three times in succession for a total of 15 presentations. The behavior was recorded by a video camera, and the amount of time the subject spent sniffing the cotton ball was counted by stopwatch. The test room was illuminated with 105–115 lux. The light intensity in the test cage was ~80 lux.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed with EZR, which is a graphical user interface in R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006940.ref085">85</xref>]. The R we used was a modified version of R commander designed to add statistical functions frequently used in biostatistics.</p>
