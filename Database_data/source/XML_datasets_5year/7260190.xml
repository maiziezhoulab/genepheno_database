<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">The precise patterning of synapses arises from a series of spatially and temporally regulated developmental events that include axon navigation, contact recognition of pre- and postsynaptic partners and synaptic differentiation. Axonal navigation is guided by multiple extracellular guidance cues that activate signaling receptors on the surface of the growth cone. Similarly, synapse formation relies on tightly regulated structural and molecular changes that are instructed upon interaction of synaptic adhesion molecules. Intriguingly, numerous evidences also point to a role of axon guidance molecules in synaptic differentiation and plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, reviewed in Poon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Yet, it remains unclear for a given receptor what dictates the switch between a role in neurite guidance and a function in synaptogenesis or synaptic plasticity. Here, we identified the molecular mechanisms implementing the role of the netrin receptor DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) in the control of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor content in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Pioneer work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> initially identified three genes, <italic>unc-5</italic>, <italic>unc-6</italic>, and <italic>unc-40</italic>, that control the directionality of circumferential cell migrations and axon guidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (reviewed by Chisholm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>). Subsequently, netrins were identified as diffusible chemotropic factors of the laminin superfamily homologous to UNC-6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The vertebrate netrin receptors DCC and UNC5 were recognized according to their homology to <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-40 and UNC-5, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. DCC is a type I transmembrane receptor that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Netrin binding to the DCC ectodomain causes receptor dimerization, which brings in close proximity the cytosolic regions of the receptors and enables their dimerization. This provides a docking platform to recruit activators of multiple signaling pathways, usually leading to an attractive response towards high netrin concentrations (reviewed by Boyer and Gupton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>). In the presence of UNC5, netrin would trigger the formation of DCC/UNC5 heterodimers that mediate repulsive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This long-range chemotatic gradient model has recently been revisited after analysis of axonal growth in mice where netrin expression was inactivated in specific subregions of the developing nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In these studies, the phenotypes were more consistent with a short-range haptotactic guidance model involving the interaction of growing axons with netrin present in the local environment. Detailed analysis of single axon outgrowth in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, together with in silico modeling, suggest that UNC-6/netrin biases the distribution of UNC-40/DCC at the membrane surface and stimulates an UNC-40-dependent protrusive activity towards growth direction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Scarce reports also demonstrated a role of netrin/DCC signaling at synapses in the mature brain. In cortical pyramidal neurons, DCC is thought to be involved in LTP (long-term potentiation) upon activation of the Src kinase and phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Consistently, deletion of DCC in the adult forebrain results in shorter dendritic spines, behavioral defects, and loss of long-term potentiation. Activity-dependent secretion of netrin was recently involved in DCC-dependent potentiation of excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus via Ca2+-dependent recruitment of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">The dual role of DCC in both development and synaptic homeostasis is evolutionarily conserved. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the UNC-6 netrin is secreted by ventral cells, and is thought to form a ventral-to-dorsal gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. <italic>C. elegans</italic> cells and axons utilize the polarized distribution of UNC-6 to orient circumferential migrations using the UNC-40 and UNC-5 receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A well-documented UNC-40-dependent migration process is the outgrowth of body-wall muscle cell expansions towards motoneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. During post-embryonic development the muscle cells, which are located in four lateral quadrants along the animal’s body, extend projections called “muscle arms” to contact motoneurons at the medial ventral and dorsal cords and form en passant neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). UNC-40 drives muscle arm extension in response to the Punctin/MADD-4 guidance cue that is secreted by developing motoneuron axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. On the ventral side, MADD-4 functions redundantly with UNC-6. UNC-40 activation triggers the remodeling of the actin network and involves multiple actors including the Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Trio-homolog UNC-73, members of the WAVE actin-polymerization complex and UNC-95, a component of focal adhesion complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The role of UNC-40/DCC was also carefully analyzed in the migration of several neurons (reviewed by Chisholm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>).</p>
<p id="Par7">Besides its canonical functions in guidance, UNC-40 plays direct roles in <italic>C. elegans</italic> synaptogenesis. Netrin signaling was shown to control synaptic connectivity between the two interneurons AIY and RIA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In this system, UNC-40 guides the migration of postsynaptic neuron RIA and drives presynaptic differentiation in the AIY neuron in response to local secretion of UNC-6 by a glial cell. Downstream signaling modulates actin assembly and recruits presynaptic components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Recently, UNC-6 was involved in the male-specific maintenance of synapses between the sensory neuron PHB and the AVG interneuron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par8">We recently demonstrated that UNC-40 plays a role in the postsynaptic organization of inhibitory NMJs of <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, each body-wall muscle cell receives excitatory and inhibitory innervation from cholinergic and GABAergic motoneurons. The evolutionarily conserved CePunctin/MADD-4 protein is identified as an anterograde synaptic organizer that specifies the cholinergic versus GABAergic identity of postsynaptic domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. CePunctin belongs to a family of poorly characterized extracellular matrix proteins, the ADAMTS-like proteins that contain multiple thrombospondin type-1 repeat (TSR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domains as well as structurally unsolved domains in common with the ADAMTS family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The functions of its vertebrate orthologs <italic>Punctin1/ADAMTSL1</italic> and <italic>Punctin2/ADAMTSL3</italic> are ill-defined, but <italic>Punctin2</italic> is expressed in the brain and was identified as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. <italic>Ce-punctin</italic> generates long (L) and short (S) isoforms by use of alternative promoters. MADD-4B/Punctin S and MADD-4L/Punctin L are differentially secreted by GABAergic and cholinergic neurons and trigger postsynaptic clustering of type A GABA receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) and acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), respectively. At the inhibitory NMJ, MADD-4B-dependent clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs involves at least two molecular pathways (for review, see Zhou and Bessereau, 2019)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. First, MADD-4B binds and clusters the synaptic adhesion molecule NLG-1/neuroligin in front of GABAergic boutons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Second, it binds, recruits, and likely activates the netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC, which in turn promotes the interaction of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with neuroligin through a non-characterized mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Since UNC-40 also controls the growth of muscle arms, the inhibitory NMJ represents an interesting paradigm to compare the molecular pathways required for the guidance and the synaptic functions of UNC-40.</p>
<p id="Par9">Using a genetic strategy, we identify here two proteins, FRM-3 and LIN-2, that implement the function of UNC-40 for the recruitment of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at inhibitory NMJs. We show that UNC-40 recruits FRM-3, a FERM (p4.1, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) protein orthologous to FARP1/2, by a physical interaction between the intracellular P3 domain of UNC-40 and the FERM-FA tandem of FRM-3. In turn, FRM-3 recruits LIN-2, the ortholog of CASK (Calcium calmodulin dependent Serine/Threonine kinase), which might provide a hub to physically connect the GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, FRM-3/FARP and NLG-1/neuroligin. All these processes are orchestrated by the main synaptic organizer MADD-4B/Punctin S, which both controls the synaptic localization of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs through NLG-1/neuroligin and the synaptic content of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs through an UNC-40-dependent intracellular scaffold.</p>

<title>Mutations of <italic>frm-3/FARP</italic> and <italic>lin-2/CASK</italic> cause a strong decrease of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs</title>
<p id="Par10">To identify synaptic proteins that control GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs clustering, we mutagenized a <italic>C. elegans</italic> knock-in strain expressing fluorescently tagged GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and performed a visual screen for abnormal fluorescence pattern. In this strain, the tagRFP-coding sequence was inserted in the <italic>unc-49</italic> locus, fusing tagRFP to the extracellular N-terminus shared by the three GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits UNC-49A, B and C. Among a wide range of phenotypes, we identified two strains with very strong decrease of synaptic fluorescence. Causative mutations were identified by whole genome sequencing, genetic mapping and rescue experiments.</p>
<p id="Par11">One strain contained a mutation in the <italic>frm-3</italic> gene, which codes for cytosolic proteins orthologous to the mammalian neuronal proteins FARP1 and FARP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). Two FRM-3 isoforms are generated by alternative splicing that share a common N-terminal part containing a FERM (p4.1, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) and FA (FERM-Adjacent) domains. FRM-3A does not contain any recognizable domain in its C-terminal part. The <italic>frm-3B</italic> transcript was more recently annotated in WormBase and not characterized to our knowledge. FRM-3B contains a GEF domain and two PH domains as in mammalian FARPs. The <italic>kr319</italic> mutation isolated in our screen introduces a G to A point mutation that inactivates a splicing donor site. For subsequent characterization of <italic>frm-3</italic>, we used the null allele <italic>frm-3(gk585)</italic>, further referred to as <italic>frm-3(0)</italic>, which deletes most of the FERM coding region and introduces an early STOP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). The second strain that was analyzed contained a mutation in the <italic>lin-2</italic> gene, which encodes a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) orthologous to CASK. The <italic>lin-2</italic> locus generates two isoforms by the use of two different promoters. LIN-2A contains a CaM-kinase domain, two LIN-27 domains, a PDZ domain, a SH3 domain and a guanylate kinase domain. LIN-2B lacks the N-terminal CaM-kinase domain, and one of the LIN-27 domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). The <italic>lin-2(kr357)</italic> retrieved in our screen contained a deletion spanning the 1218-1331 nt, which caused a frameshift from valine 122 with subsequent introduction of an early stop codon. Interestingly, <italic>frm-3</italic> and <italic>lin-2</italic> were formerly shown to impact UNC-49 content at synapses, but the phenotypes that we observed seemed much more dramatic than previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Mutations of <italic>frm</italic>-3 and <italic>lin</italic>-2 cause a strong loss of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Predicted domains of FRM-3A and FRM-3B: FERM (4.1, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin, yellow box), FA (FERM Adjacent, green box), Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (blue), Pleckstrin homology (red), unknown domain (gray).

GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs were barely detectable, forming extremely small puncta at GABAergic boutons (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d–e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1d</xref>). By contrast, the number and size of presynaptic GABA boutons were unaltered based on the quantitative analysis of the synaptic marker SNB-1-GFP specifically expressed in GABAergic motoneurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b–c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par13">In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, muscle cells send projections to the motoneurons, named muscle arms, and establish <italic>en passant</italic> synapses at the dorsal and ventral nerve cords. To exclude that GABA<sub>A</sub>R decrease might be explained by muscle arm development defects, we analyzed muscle morphology in the <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> mutant and found that the number and the morphology of muscle arms were normal (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1e–f</xref>). The <italic>frm-3</italic> mutation could hamper the biosynthesis or stability of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. We therefore measured the protein level of RFP-tagged UNC-49 by western blot and we found that the amount of UNC-49 was normal in <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> mutant (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1g-h</xref>). These results are consistent with previously published electrophysiological recordings showing that bath application of GABA elicits similar currents in wild-type and <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. To evaluate the functional consequence of <italic>frm-3</italic> and <italic>lin-2</italic> inactivation on GABAergic transmission, we recorded GABA-evoked currents in muscle upon optogenetic stimulation of GABA motoneurons. As compared with the WT, we observed a 75% and 90% decrease of GABA-evoked currents in <italic>frm-3</italic> and <italic>lin-2</italic> null mutants, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f–g</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that FRM-3 and LIN-2 are essential for the localization of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at inhibitory NMJs.</p>
<p id="Par14">To further characterize the contribution of <italic>lin-2</italic> to GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering, we analyzed several <italic>lin-2</italic> alleles. In <italic>lin-2(n397)</italic>, where amino acids 137-463 of LIN-2A as well as part of LIN-2B N-terminus were deleted, the synaptic fluorescence level of RFP-UNC-49 was reduced by 75%, similar to <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>lin-2(n105)</italic>, where the last 22 amino acids of the C-terminus common to LIN-2A and LIN-2B were deleted, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs were also decreased by 70% at either 20 °C or 25 °C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>), despite the reported thermosensitive vulva-less phenotype of these mutants. Yet the <italic>lin-2(e1309)</italic> mutant, which has been used as a reference allele in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, only caused a 40% reduction in RFP-UNC-49 fluorescence. Partial information on the <italic>lin-2(e1309)</italic> allele suggests that LIN-2A coding sequence is altered but that LIN-2B might still be expressed, since LIN-2B coding sequence and part of the LIN-2B promoter region might be intact (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

Expressing either LIN-2A or LIN-2B completely rescued the <italic>lin-2(n397)</italic> mutant phenotype, indicating that the domains within the short LIN-2B isoform are sufficient for GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>).

<title>Postsynaptic UNC-40/DCC recruits FRM-3 independently from LIN-2</title>
<p id="Par17">We previously showed that UNC-40/DCC signaling promotes the recruitment of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs onto NLG-1 clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par18">FRM-3 and LIN-2 might be both independently regulated by UNC-40, or one of these two components might be regulated by UNC-40, and in turn recruit the second one. To distinguish these two hypotheses, we investigated how LIN-2 and FRM-3 regulate each other.

These data suggested that UNC-40 primarily localizes at synapses and subsequently recruits FRM-3 at synapses. To strengthen this hypothesis, we overexpressed in muscle cells a myristoylated fusion of the intracellular domain of UNC-40, which acts as constitutively active receptor.

<title>UNC-40 physically interacts with FRM-3 through its P3 domain</title>
<p id="Par22">Our data show that activation of UNC-40 can recruit FRM-3 to the plasma membrane.

Second, we used in vitro GST pulldown assay and detected the direct binding of FERM-FA to the UNC-40 intracellular domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>).

<title>LIN-2/CASK bridges GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with FRM-3 and NLG-1</title>
<p id="Par26">Although UNC-40 and FRM-3 are necessary to recruit LIN-2 and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at the nerve cords, we and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> demonstrated that the PDZ-binding motif of the neuroligin NLG-1 was critical for the synaptic localization of GABA<sub>A</sub>R.

Unlike mammalian neuroligins that end with a type I PDZ motif not predicted to interact with CASK, NLG-1 ends with a type II PDZ-binding domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). Because LIN-2 contains a type II PDZ domain, we asked whether these two proteins could physically interact.

<p id="Par27">How is UNC-49 recruited to the NLG-1-containing complex? Previous work suggested the existence of a direct interaction between FRM-3 and the intracellular TM3-TM4 loop of UNC-49B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Yet, FRM-3 is also required for the recruitment of LIN-2 at synapses. Consistently, we detected strong interaction between the FERM-FA domain of FRM-3 and LIN-2B in a GST pull-down assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>), in agreement with previous yeast-2-hybrid data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, in <italic>lin-2(0)</italic> mutants, FRM-3 is still detected at synapses while UNC-49 is decreased to the same extent as in <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> mutants, suggesting that FRM-3 is not sufficient to recruit UNC-49 receptors. Since LIN-2 is also decreased in <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> mutants, we wondered if LIN-2 and UNC-49 might directly interact. First, we performed a GST pull-down assay and demonstrated that HA-tagged LIN-2B interacts with the TM3-TM4 intracellular loop of UNC-49 fused to GST (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>). This interaction remained after switching the GST and HA epitopes in a complementary pull-down experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>). We then mapped the LIN-2B domains involved in interacting with UNC-49. Deletion of the SH3 domain completely disrupted the interaction with the TM3-TM4 of UNC-49. Deletion of the Guanylate Kinase domain partially impaired the interaction while deletion of the PDZ domain had no effect. Altogether these data indicate that LIN-2 might act as a scaffolding molecule that physically bridges NLG-1 and the GABA<sub>A</sub>R through FRM-3-dependent cytoplasmic interactions.</p>
<p id="Par28">This model has at least three predictions. First, the interaction of NLG-1 and UNC-49 should depend on UNC-40 because UNC-40 recruits FRM-3 and LIN-2 at synapses. We thus compared the efficiency of retrieving RFP-UNC-49 after immuno-precipitation of NLG-1-GFP expressed either in wild-type or <italic>unc-40</italic> mutants. We observed that <italic>unc-40</italic> disruption indeed impaired the interaction between UNC-49 and NLG-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6g, i</xref>). Second, the interaction between NLG-1 and UNC-49 should depend on FRM-3 and LIN-2 if they provide a hub to link NLG-1 and UNC-49. Accordingly, the coIP efficiency between NLG-1 and UNC-49 was reduced in <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> or <italic>lin-2(0)</italic> mutant animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6h, j</xref>). Third, the model predicts that mutations in <italic>lin-2</italic> and <italic>frm-3</italic> should be epistatic to <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutations. Accordingly, we observed a more severe reduction of RFP-UNC-49 in <italic>nlg-1(0); lin-2(0) or frm-3(0)</italic> double mutants than in <italic>nlg-1(0)</italic> single mutants, similar to <italic>lin-2 or frm-3</italic> single mutants (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>lin-2(0); frm-3(0)</italic> double mutant is also comparable to <italic>lin-2</italic> or <italic>frm-3</italic> single mutants, suggesting that they indeed function in the same pathway.</p>

<p id="Par30">To address this question, we analyzed the synaptic localization of FRM-3 and LIN-2 in <italic>madd-4(0)</italic> (null), <italic>madd-4B(0)</italic> (a mutant in which the <italic>madd-4B</italic> isoform is specifically disrupted but <italic>madd-4L</italic> is still expressed) or <italic>madd-4L(0)</italic> (specific mutation of the <italic>madd-4L</italic> isoform) mutant animals.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par31">Here we show that UNC-40/DCC plays a pivotal role at GABA synapses by transducing the effect of the extracellular matrix protein Punctin/MADD-4. Upon activation, UNC-40 triggers the formation of an intracellular scaffold, which in turn promotes the interaction of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with prepositioned Neuroligin/NLG-1 synaptic clusters (graphical model provided in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>). In this system, Punctin plays a dual role: (i) it specifies the positioning of post-synaptic inhibitory domains in register with GABA release sites by interacting with neuroligin and inducing its clustering in the postsynaptic membrane; (ii) it concentrates UNC-40/DCC at the tip of the muscle arms in synaptic regions, which triggers membrane recruitment of the cytosolic adaptor FRM-3/FARP, likely through direct interaction between the P3 domain of UNC-40 and the FERM domain of FRM-3. This in turn recruits the scaffolding molecule LIN-2/CASK, which can interact with the UNC-49 GABA<sub>A</sub>R and the cytoplasmic tail of neuroligin. As a net effect, UNC-40/DCC controls the synaptic content of receptors at GABA synapses in response to Punctin.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>Working model for GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering at GABAergic neuromuscular junctions.</title><p>Activation of UNC-40 triggers the formation of an intracellular scaffold, which in turn promotes the interaction of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with prepositioned Neuroligin/NLG-1 synaptic clusters.

<p id="Par32">Only few studies, so far, have analyzed the role of DCC in synaptic organization. Netrin was shown to have a synaptogenic activity in the mammalian forebrain by stimulating dendrite and axon outgrowth, promoting synaptic adhesion and reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton to foster the clustering of pre-and postsynaptic components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. DCC participates to LTP in cortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, and activity-dependent secretion of netrin potentiates excitatory glutamatergic transmission via the recruitment of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-40/DCC was initially described for its roles in cellular and axonal migration, but it was also shown to regulate presynaptic differentiation in response to local accumulation of UNC-6/netrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In all instances, the main underpinning mechanism was the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par33">Here we propose a novel mechanism for UNC-40 involving the direct recruitment of FRM-3/FARP to synaptic regions. We showed that the P3 domain of UNC-40 binds the FERM domain of FRM-3/FARP in vitro. To validate the role of this interaction in vivo, we deleted the P3-coding region in the <italic>unc-40</italic> locus. Surprisingly, the <italic>∆P3</italic> mutants were much less sick than the null mutants, although P3 was shown to be required for dimerization of DCC intracellular domain, a key-event upon netrin binding to activate downstream signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In <italic>∆P3</italic>, the developmental events involving an interaction between UNC-40 and UNC-5 might be preserved because heterodimerization is thought to require the P1 domain of DCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, actin regulators mostly require the P1 and P2 domains of UNC-40 rather than P3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we observed less severe penetrance of guidance defects in <italic>∆P3</italic> as compared with <italic>unc-40</italic> null mutants. Actin bundles present in muscle arms and along the nerve cords of WT animals were partially maintained in <italic>∆P3</italic>. By contrast, the loss of FRM-3 and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs was indistinguishable between <italic>∆P3</italic> and <italic>unc-40</italic> null mutants. These results do not rule out a role of the actin cytoskeleton for postsynaptic organization, yet these results point to an anchoring role of the UNC-40 protein in the recruitment of scaffolding molecules at the synapse.</p>
<p id="Par34">How Punctin triggers the recruitment of FRM-3 at synapses through UNC-40 remains to be further explored. Punctin was demonstrated to bind and localize UNC-40 at the tip of the muscle arms during development. Together with UNC-6/Netrin, it activates the GEF UNC-73/ trio and actin remodelers including the WAVE complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to direct membrane extension, independently from FRM-3. In the adult, Punctin localizes UNC-40 at synapses. It might induce the formation of high order multimers of UNC-40, as suggested for DCC upon binding of netrin, and create an intracellular platform sufficient for FRM-3 binding. However, this interaction might also be regulated. For example, the FERM domain protein ezrin associates with DCC in a netrin-1–dependent manner, which requires FERM phosphorylation upon DCC-dependent Src and Rho kinase activation and DCC phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Finally, we observed that the synaptic recruitment of FRM-3 is not fully abolished in the <italic>unc-40(0)</italic> mutant, suggesting that other pathways can drive synaptic targeting and stabilization of FRM-3.</p>
<p id="Par35">Our study has identified a critical role of FRM-3 in promoting GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering. FRM-3 was initially related to the band 4.1 (EPB4.1) protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, but the more recently identified isoform FRM-3B is the unambiguous ortholog of the mammalian FARP1 and FARP2. In neurons, the FARP proteins have been mostly implicated in the regulation of actin dynamics through GEF activity in response to guidance cues such as Sem6A/PlexA4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> or Sema3A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. FARP1 directly interacts with the synaptogenic adhesion molecule SynCAM and regulates synapse number and dendritic spine morphology by activating Rac1 and regulating F-actin assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In this study we demonstrated that the FERM-FA domain of FRM-3 is necessary and sufficient to rescue the synaptic defects of <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> mutants. Consistently, actin concentration is still detected in postsynaptic regions of <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> mutant, pointing to a specific function of the FERM-FA domain in the formation of a postsynaptic scaffold. This versatility might reflect an evolutionary diversification of FRM-3 functions, although a similar role of FARP proteins might be relevant at some synapses in mammals.</p>
<p id="Par36">Interestingly, FERM-FA domains can oligomerize and bind protein and lipid partners. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the FERM protein Yurt, an orthologue of mammalian EPB41L5, controls epithelial cell polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Oligomerization of Yurt is crucial for its function in epithelial cell polarity and is supported by the FERM-FA domains. In Yurt, the oligomerization interface relies on a hydrophobic FxW motif which is conserved in FRM-3. In addition, the crystal structure of the zebrafish FARP1 and FARP2 FERM domains identified a positively charged patch that supports phospholipid binding and targeting to the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. This KRKK motif is also present in FRM-3 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). Altogether, our results suggest a model in which FRM-3 might build up an oligomeric platform tethered to the plasma membrane, and recruit the adaptor protein LIN-2/CASK.</p>
<p id="Par37">LIN-2 is the ortholog of CASK, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family. Most studies have focused mainly on presynaptic roles for CASK. Interestingly, CASK interacts with the synaptic adhesion molecule neurexin via its PDZ domain and supports local actin assembly through the FERM protein P4.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. However, CASK is also detected in dendritic spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and few studies report a role of CASK at the postsynaptic side. At <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs, knock-down of CASK in muscles induces smaller glutamate-gated currents and triggers specific loss of GluRIIA subunits of glutamate receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. CASK can also function as a co-activator of TBR1, a T-box transcription factor, and enhance the transcription of genes such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit GluN2B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. In the present study we propose that LIN-2 is recruited to synaptic regions by FRM-3 and interacts with both neuroligin via its PDZ domain and with the TM3-TM4 cytoplasmic loop of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R via its SH3 and guanylate-kinase domains.</p>
<p id="Par38">Our model differs from a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> that proposed the existence of two GABA<sub>A</sub>R pools at the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NMJs, one synaptic pool depending on NLG-1/neuroligin, and a second synaptic pool depending on FRM-3/LIN-2. In this model, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs were proposed to interact with FRM-3 based on a yeast-2-hybrid experiment. Although we could not detect this interaction by in vitro pull-down or yeast-2-hybrid (unpublished data), this interaction might exist. Yet, genetic data point to a central role of LIN-2 because we observe the same dramatic loss of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in <italic>lin-2(0)</italic> and in <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> mutants while FRM-3 remains enriched at synapses in <italic>lin-2(0)</italic>. This is strong contrast with <italic>nlg-1(0)</italic> mutants where receptors are no longer clustered at GABA synapses but remain enriched along the cord, most probably by interacting with the FRM-3/LIN-2 complex. Removing LIN-2 in the presence or absence of NLG-1 causes the same loss of receptors, in contrast with previous studies which suggested that <italic>lin-2</italic> and <italic>nlg-1</italic> were synergistic. Few hypotheses might be proposed to reconcile these data. First, the previously used allele <italic>lin-2(e1309)</italic> might retain some expression of the LIN-2B isoform, which we showed to be sufficient for GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering. Second, GABA<sub>A</sub>R localization and dynamics analysis was performed using transgenic expression of the UNC-49B subunit tagged in its TM3-TM4 loop, while we used CRISPR/Cas9 to modify the <italic>unc-49</italic> locus and fuse RFP at the shared N-terminal part of the UNC-49 subunits. Tagged-UNC-49B will form a homomeric pentamer containing five fluorescent proteins in its cytoplasmic region while in our N-terminally tagged knock-in it will likely form a heteromeric B/C heteropentamer as thought for the endogenous receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Third, since LIN-2 interacts with the cytoplasmic loop of UNC-49, we wondered if the presence of a fluorescent protein could modify the interactions with the FRM-3/LIN-2 scaffold. We therefore introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 the wormScarlet protein into the UNC-49B loop. This receptor localizes at GABA synapses but we observed only a 50% decrease of fluorescence in <italic>lin-2(0)</italic> mutants as compared with more than 80% when using the extracellularly tagged reporter (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8a–b</xref>). Yet the FERM-FA domains and the GABA<sub>A</sub>R interact in both constructs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8c</xref>). These data suggest that the presence of a fluorescent protein in the TM3-TM4 loop of UNC-49B might weaken the contribution of LIN-2 at GABA synapses in vivo and suggest that parallel, yet uncharacterized, mechanisms might additionally support the recruitment of UNC-49 at neuroligin clusters. However, the dramatic loss of synaptic GABA-evoked currents in <italic>frm-3(0)</italic> and <italic>lin-2(0)</italic> mutants unambiguously demonstrates that the FRM-3/LIN-2 scaffold is critical for endogenous GABA<sub>A</sub>R localization at the synapse.</p>
<p id="Par39">The evolutionary strategy for GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering at <italic>C. elegans</italic> NMJs diverged from mammalian GABA synapses. In mammals, the self-oligomerizing protein gephyrin (GPN) is the core component of inhibitory synapses that binds the intracellular region of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to anchor them at the synapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Collybistin (CB), a Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor, binds GPN and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, which promotes the interaction of each protein with the intracellular region of Neuroligin-2. In addition, the transmembrane tetraspanins LHFPL3 and 4, also named GARLH (GABA<sub>A</sub>R regulatory LHFPL), form a tripartite complex with GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and Neuroligin 2 and control synaptic clustering, of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. In addition, GABA<sub>A</sub>R GPN-independent clustering mechanisms exist because GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs still form functional synaptic clusters in some neurons of GPN knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> (for complete discussion, see Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. In extrasynaptic regions, the targeting of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs containing the α4 or α5 subunit is ensured by Radixin, a FERM protein that bridges GABA<sub>A</sub>R to the actin cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. GPN and CB are not present in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, and the single <italic>C. elegans</italic> GARLH ortholog has not been involved in GABAergic transmission so far. However, it is remarkable to see that NLG-1, LIN-2/CASK and the intracellular domain of UNC-49 GABA<sub>A</sub>R form a tripartite complex promoted by FRM-3/FARP upon UNC-40/DCC activation. Despite using different elementary components, this configuration is functionally reminiscent of the arrangement of postsynaptic inhibitory scaffolds. Interestingly, DCC was recently identified in a proteomic analysis of the synaptic cleft components at inhibitory synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Whether DCC might control the content of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at inhibitory synapses in the mammalian brain remains to be investigated.</p>

<p id="Par49">For confocal imaging, young adult hermaphrodites (24 h post L4 larval stage) were used for imaging. Live worms were mounted on 2% agarose dry pads with 1% poly-lysine beads in M9 buffer. Fluorescence images were captured using an Andor spinning disk system (Oxford Instruments) installed on a Nikon-IX86 microscope (Olympus) equipped with a 60/1.2 oil immersion objective and an Evolve EMCCD camera. Images were acquired by IQ 3.4.1 software from Andor. Each animal was imaged as a stack of optical sections (0.2 μm apart) containing 33–36 slices and projected along <italic>Z</italic>-axis.</p>
<p id="Par50">Quantification of images was performed using ImageJ (v1.48 by NIH) with Fiji plugin add-ons. Statistic tests were performed by Prism6 from Graphpad and OriginLab software.

For fluorescence intensity measurement, 30 μm (wide) × 5 μm (high) regions along ventral (between VD6 and VD7 neuron) or dorsal cord near the mid body were cropped and analyzed. Acquisition settings were the same across genotypes for quantitative analysis. For examination of each genetic background, each genotype of animals was imaged on at least 2 different days, and the data were pooled together. Data are presented as a percentage of the average fluorescence relative to that of the wild type. For co-localization quantification, images were captured along 40 μm in dorsal nerve cord anterior to the center of body. The plot file of either GFP-FRM-3/LIN-2/NLG-1 or SNB-1-BFP fluorescence signals were measured and processed by Mander’s overlapping correlation analysis modified from previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. The co-localization between FRM-3, LIN-2, GABAR and NLG-1 were analyzed by Pearson’s coefficient correlation. Data are presented as min to max value for animals of each genotypes. For muscle arms growth quantification, number of arms from two body wall muscle cells in the quadrant connecting ventral nerve cord was counted. Average numbers of muscle arms per cell were compared between the wild type, <italic>unc-40(e1430)</italic>, <italic>unc-40(kr457)</italic> or <italic>frm-3(gk585)</italic> mutants. For AVM neuron guidance quantification, pathfinding of AVM axon was characterized under spinning disk microscopy with a 60× optic lens. Ratio of abnormal/total number of animals counted from three independent days were compared between the wild type, <italic>unc-40(e1430)</italic> or <italic>unc-40(kr457)</italic> mutants. For the analysis of GABAR cluster size, the ROI of images were first thresholded by unique method provided by ImageJ. Then images were converted to 8-bit binary mask.
