<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by the developmental disruption of complex cognitive traits, especially those underlying communication and socialization. These traits are particularly developed in humans, suggesting a disruption of recently evolved cognitive mechanisms in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This notion is supported by the assessment of gene expression patterns during cortical development in healthy humans and ASD individuals in comparison to nonhuman primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">ASD is a heterogeneous condition characterized by a broad spectrum of symptom severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Accordingly, despite the reported high heritability of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, numerous genetic studies indicate that most ASD cases are likely to be caused by a large number of genetic variants, each of which has a small effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">In the absence of clear genetic determinants, investigations looked for potential biochemical landmarks of disease by monitoring concentrations of low weight molecular compounds (metabolites) in urine, blood plasma and the brain. To date, metabolite concentration differences in the urine of ASD individuals have mostly been studied using systematic metabolomics profiling techniques, which yielded results for 20 to 622 metabolites measured in 14 to 48 ASD individuals and comparable control groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The pioneering study conducted by Yap et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, using proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and involving 39 ASD individuals demonstrated alterations of amino acid metabolism and the tryptophan and nicotinic acid metabolic pathways. Similarly, another study by Ming et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> identified differences in amino acid metabolism, as well as metabolic signatures of oxidative stress, in the urine of 48 children with ASD using a combination of liquid chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC–MS and GC–MS). Changes in the purine metabolism pathway, pyrimidine metabolism pathway and changes in several pathways involved in the metabolism of tyrosine, asparagine, tryptophan and arginine were further identified in the urine of 30 ASD individuals using a combination of the NMR and LC–MS approaches were reported by Dim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Most recently, Bitar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, employing a combination of the NMR and LC–MS approaches, reported concentration changes of metabolites related to oxidative stress, including glutathione metabolism, changes in cysteine, methionine, arginine, and proline metabolism pathways, as well as changes in carbohydrate metabolism, including the metabolism of propanoate, citrate, and sugars in the urine of 40 ASD individuals.</p>
<p id="Par6">The first study investigating metabolite concentration differences in blood identified changes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as various metabolic pathway changes, such as a disruption in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the plasma samples of 52 children diagnosed with ASD using five mass spectrometry-based methods were reported by West et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In a more recent study, Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> identified the concentration differences of 17 metabolites in the blood plasma of 73 ASD individuals. Of them, 11 metabolites, including sphingosine 1-phosphate and docosahexaenoic acid, were validated in an independent cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par7">The only study conducted in the brain, by Graham et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, identified concentration differences of 37 metabolites in the cerebellum of 11 ASD individuals and 11 controls using LC–MS. These differences were not enriched in any biological pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par8">In addition to studies assessing the concentration levels of multiple metabolites, others focused on particular compounds, such as markers of mitochondrial dysfunction that are believed to be associated with the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. These studies reported an elevated concentration of glutamate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, as well as glycolysis products, such as lactate and pyruvate, in the serum of ASD individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Other findings included a decreased concentration of carnitine, the fatty acid carrier from the cytosol to the mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and glutathione, the reported key reactive oxygen species neutralizer, in ASD individuals’ blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. By contrast, the concentration of palmitate, one of the key energy sources for mitochondria, was increased in ASD plasma samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par9">Even though the existing studies provided substantial coverage of the metabolite concentration differences detected in ASD individuals in urine and blood, little is known about the relationship between these differences and metabolic alterations taking place in the brain. The only study performed in the brain focused on cerebellum and involved a limited number of individuals. In our study, we were able to compare metabolite intensity differences detected in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain with differences detected in urine and blood by the preceding studies. Specifically, we investigated changes in intensities of 1366 metabolites detected using untargeted LC–MS in the prefrontal cortex gray matter of 40 control and 32 ASD individuals. We further analyzed the metabolite intensities in the PFC of 40 chimpanzees and 40 macaques to investigate the relationship between metabolic alterations in ASD and brain metabolic features unique to humans. This might be informative, as ASD affects an array of cognitive functions particular to the human brain. We identified numerous metabolite intensity changes distinguishing ASD individuals from the controls. Notably, the majority of these differences clustered in metabolic pathways previously identified in the urine and blood of ASD individuals. Furthermore, several of these pathways contained an excess of metabolite intensity changes unique to humans, indicating a disruption of evolutionary novel cortical metabolic features in ASD.</p>

<title>Metabolic data description</title>
<p id="Par10">We searched for metabolic alterations in brains of ASD individuals by measuring intensities of polar low-molecular-weight compounds in the postmortem PFC samples of 40 controls and 32 ASD individuals (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The control and ASD samples were matched for sex and sample quality, which were estimated using RNA integrity levels. Each group covered a broad age range: 2–60 years for ASD individuals and 0–61 years for controls (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). All samples were represented by the cortical gray matter.</p>
<p id="Par11">The measurements, conducted in a random order using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC–MS) in positive and negative ionization modes, yielded 4065 and 1685 distinct MS peaks representing polar compounds (metabolites) with molecular weights below 2000 Da. Among them, 801 and 209 metabolites were putatively annotated using probabilistic matching to the Human Metabolome Database HMDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and the LIPID MAPS Structure Database (LMSD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> within a mass tolerance of 10 ppm. The removal of metabolites with intensities influenced by the measurement order, experimental batch effects, and postmortem delay yielded 1366 confounder-free metabolic peaks detected in both ionization modes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the ASD and control samples using normalized intensities of these 1366 metabolites revealed a separation of very young individuals from the rest (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). Correspondingly, age explained 25% of the total metabolic variation among samples, while ASD accounted for 10%, postmortem delays (PMD) accounted for 8%, and other factors such as sex, sample quality, and ethnicity accounted for &lt;5% each.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Identification of metabolite intensity differences in the prefrontal cortex of ASD individuals. <bold>a</bold> The number of metabolite peaks detected by LC–MS procedure in positive ([+]) and negative ([−]) ionization modes, after the removal of peaks affected by confounding factors.

<title>Metabolic changes in ASD</title>
<p id="Par12">Of the 1366 detected metabolites, 202 (15%) showed significant intensity differences between ASD and control samples (ASD-related metabolites, ANCOVA, BH-corrected <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, nominal <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.009). The unsupervised clustering of the temporal intensity profiles of these 202 metabolites revealed four modules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Genes linked to the ASD-related metabolites using KEGG annotation were significantly overrepresented in a total of 16 pathways (the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>) (hypergeometric test, BH-corrected <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, nominal <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.008, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>). Of the 16 enriched pathways, 10, including glutathione metabolism, were identified at a similar significance level using 42 metabolites from the module 3, characterized by an intensity decrease in ASD, especially during the first 20 years of life. Notably, the glutathione metabolism pathway contained not only significant intensity differences of glutathione and linked metabolites, but also genetic variants reported to be associated with ASD in enzymes catalyzing the corresponding reactions, such as <italic>GPX1</italic>, <italic>GSTM1</italic>, <italic>GGT1</italic>, and <italic>GSS</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>). The concentrations of glutathione and related metabolites display technical variability, for instance after long-term storage of metabolite extracts (Norris et al. 2001)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In our study, however, the intensities of the corresponding metabolites remained stable in brain samples with lengthy postmortem delay (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">1</xref>). Module 4, which contained 52 metabolites, was enriched in four of the 16 pathways, including strong enrichment in purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways. By contrast, modules 1 and 2, characterized by elevated intensities in ASD, were not substantially overrepresented within the 16 pathways, but were enriched in the four additional module-specific pathways, including amino acid and nicotinamide metabolism.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Characterization of metabolite intensity differences identified in the prefrontal cortex of ASD individuals. <bold>a</bold> Summary of top functional pathways enriched in genes linked to metabolites represented in different categories using KEGG annotation.

To test this, we constructed a predictive model based on logistic regression with lasso regularization to assign each sample to the ASD or control group using the metabolite intensities. We then performed stability selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, a procedure based on subsampling, to rank the metabolites’ contribution to the model and to assess the accuracy (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">2</xref>). Remarkably, the model distinguished ASD and control cases with more than 95% accuracy, estimated as the area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC), which corresponds to the area under the curve mapping the true positive rate (sensitivity) to the false positive rate (1-specificity) for different discrimination thresholds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). Thus, the AUC ROC provides a measure of the diagnostic ability of the classifier.</p>
<p id="Par14">The model’s metabolic predictors overlapped significantly with metabolites showing significant intensity differences in ASD in the ANCOVA analysis (Fisher test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Consistently, KEGG pathways enriched in the top 200 metabolic predictors were in good agreement with pathways obtained in the ANCOVA analysis, with glutathione metabolism and purine metabolism occupying the top positions for each of the two methods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>).</p>

<p id="Par15">To test whether the metabolite intensity differences between ASD and control cases might be caused by gene expression differences, we examined data from three brain regions: frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and cerebellum, measured in 19 ASD individuals and 17 controls, including 15 ASD individuals and 5 controls from the present study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

<title>Evolution of metabolic changes in ASD</title>
<p id="Par16">Previous work linked gene expression differences in ASD to developmental gene expression features unique to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To assess this link at the metabolite level, we analyzed metabolite intensities in the PFC of 40 chimpanzees with ages between 0 and 42 years, and 40 rhesus macaques with ages between 14 weeks post-conception and 21 years (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The chimpanzee and macaque samples were measured together with human control and ASD samples in a random order. A computational analysis of nonhuman primates, conducted in parallel with the human samples, yielded intensities in chimpanzee and macaque samples for 1366 metabolites confidently detected in human dataset. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis based on the intensities of these metabolites revealed predominant sample separation according to age and species identity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Evolution of metabolite intensity differences identified in the prefrontal cortex of ASD individuals. <bold>a</bold> The relationship among species and individuals plotted as the first two dimensions of the multidimensional scaling (MDS) procedure based on intensities of 1366 metabolites.

<p id="Par19">While the ratio of human-specific metabolite intensity differences to the chimpanzee-specific ones among 202 ASD-related metabolites coincided with the one for all detected metabolites, their distribution among the four ASD modules was not uniform.

Notably, module 4 was particularly enriched in metabolic pathways overlapping between ASD-related and human-specific differences, including purine and pyrimidine metabolism (Fisher test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1). To assess whether this excess of human-specific differences is due to a smaller number of compounds contained in module 4, we repeated analysis randomly sampling 30 metabolites from each module (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par20">In this study, we show that the metabolite composition of the gray matter of the prefrontal cortex differs substantially between ASD individuals and healthy controls. Despite the moderate statistical power of the study, as many as 15% of metabolites present in the prefrontal cortex alter their intensities significantly in ASD. These metabolites form specific age-dependent intensity patterns and cluster in specific KEGG pathways.</p>
<p id="Par21">It is noteworthy that of the 16 pathways altered in the prefrontal cortex of ASD individuals based on ANCOVA results, 10 were reported in studies analyzing metabolite abundance of urine and blood samples, which is significantly more than expected by chance (Fisher test, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). These pathways include glutathione metabolism, purine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, propanoate metabolism, TCA cycle, galactose metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism. Metabolite intensity differences clustering in these 10 pathways were all reported in the urine of ASD individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Metabolite intensity differences clustering in the TCA cycle, glutathione metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism pathways were further reported in the blood of ASD individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Intensity differences of individual metabolites, such as glutathione and cysteine decrease, as well as a glutathione disulfide and adenosine intensity increase in ASD individuals identified in our study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">4</xref>), were similarly reported in blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the same direction and magnitude of the relative intensity differences between ASD individuals and controls were observed for glutathione and glutathione disulfide in the cerebellum and temporal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Similarly, intensity differences of 3-methoxytyramine and 5,6-dihydrouridine that increased in the cerebellum of ASD individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> are detected and reproduced in our dataset (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">5</xref>). At the gene expression level, the differences reported in the neocortex of ASD individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> are greater for genes linked to ASD-related metabolites found in our study compared with genes linked to the other detected metabolites. Taken together, these observations support the previous results and indicate a general agreement between ASD-related metabolite intensity differences detected in the brain and differences detected in the blood and urine analyses. Purine metabolism is particularly interesting, as purinergic signaling is involved in neurodevelopment processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and neuron-glia cross-talk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Moreover, purinergic signaling was shown to be altered in multiple psychiatric disorders, including ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par22">Currently, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated autism-associated metabolic alterations in brain and blood, neither in patients nor in animal models. More generally, few studies addressing the relationship between metabolic alterations in brain and blood yield different conclusions. The Alzheimer disease study conducted in nearly 1000 individuals revealed parallel alterations in brain and blood for several of the 26 metabolites linked with the diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Similarly, stress-induced changes in the neurotransmitter concentration levels in the mouse brain were also detected in serum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. By contrast, the metabolite analysis in the mouse model of Parkinson disease identified significant alterations in brain in 14 metabolic pathways, only one of which was also altered in blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Our data show the relationship between metabolic alterations in brain and blood at the pathway level, rather than at the level of individual metabolites. It is appealing to suggest that such a relationship might be caused by several key pathway intermediates capable of crossing the blood–brain barrier. Alternatively, the link between metabolic alterations in blood and brain could be caused by mutations in metabolic enzymes present in both tissues. Notably, GWAS studies indeed reported multiple mutations linked to ASD within genes encoding metabolic enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par23">Our analysis further yields a number of novel observations. First, we uncover novel metabolite intensity differences complementary to previously reported ones. For instance, within the glutathione pathway, we show that in addition to a glutathione intensity decrease, two other metabolites, L-cysteinylglycine and L-γ-glutamyl-L-cysteine, display intensity differences in ASD. Notably, enzymes catalyzing reactions involving glutathione, L-cysteinylglycine, and L-γ-glutamyl-L-cysteine were shown to contain genetic variants previously linked to ASD, including polymorphisms in such genes as <italic>GPX1</italic>, <italic>GSTM1</italic>, <italic>GGT1</italic>, and <italic>GSS</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par24">Second, we identify a number of metabolic pathways that were not previously linked to ASD, including pyrimidine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, and three pathways related to drug metabolism by cytochromes. Metabolic processes in these pathways are connected to the reported ones. For instance, changes in pyrimidine metabolism might be linked to purine metabolism alterations, as both pathways involve the essential precursors for RNA and DNA synthesis and are well interconnected. Furthermore, pyrimidine nucleotides are involved in polysaccharide and phospholipid synthesis, detoxification processes, as well as proteins’ and lipids’ glycosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Notably, functional deficiency of pyrimidine pathway genes, such as uridine monophosphate synthase (<italic>UMPS</italic>), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (<italic>DPYD</italic>), Dihydropyrimidinase (<italic>DPYS</italic>), beta-ureidopropionase 1 (<italic>UPB1</italic>), leads to neurological aberrations, including ASD-like features in case of DPD deficiency (<italic>DPYD</italic> gene deficiency)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Metabolic changes in the beta-alanine pathway might be linked to the pyrimidine metabolism pathway, as the main sources of beta-alanine include the catabolism of cytosine and uracil. Moreover, beta-alanine intensity is decreased in DPD (<italic>DPYD</italic> gene deficiency), DHP (<italic>DPYS</italic> gene deficiency), and BUP-1 (<italic>UPB1</italic> gene deficiency) induced pyrimidine pathway deficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In addition, key enzymes participating in cytochrome mediated drug metabolism are also involved in the glutathione metabolism pathway.</p>
<p id="Par25">Third, we show that machine-learning algorithms can accurately identify metabolic features characteristic of ASD individuals represented in our dataset. The metabolites selected by the predictive model cluster in 14 of the 16 pathways discovered using ASD-related metabolites identified by ANCOVA and overlap with eight pathways reported in urine and blood samples. It is important to note that our study does not involve individuals with other cognitive disorders, which share comorbidities with some of ASD individuals, such as schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Therefore, our predictive model might include metabolite abundance alterations shared among disorders.</p>
<p id="Par26">Fourth, by conducting brain metabolome measurements in nonhuman primates, we show that ASD-related metabolites falling within module 4 contain an almost eightfold excess of metabolite intensity differences unique to humans, compared with the chimpanzee-specific differences. Accordingly, a number of pathways enriched in ASD-related metabolite intensity differences, including purine, pyruvate metabolism, TCA cycle, and galactose metabolism, also showed an excess of human-specific metabolite intensity differences. This result is notable, given that ASD tends to affect cognitive abilities particularly pronounced in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Generally, we find almost three times more metabolite intensity differences specific to humans, compared with chimpanzees. These results agree with previously reported excess of human-specific metabolite concentration differences in PFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and align well with the hypothesis postulating disruption of recently evolved cognitive mechanisms underlying communication and socialization in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par27">The main limitations of our study include its relatively small sample size, caused by the limited availability of brain tissue samples from ASD individuals. Accordingly, we can only estimate general traits present in the majority of individuals and cannot assess the presence of discrete molecular endophenotypes of ASD. Yet, the differences we detect correlate with disease severity, specifically with Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) score (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">6</xref>), indicating the possible connection between the metabolic alterations and the disorder manifestations. Importantly, the intensity patterns of modules were not driven by cases with extreme ADI-R scores: modules based only on individuals with moderate ADI-R scores closely reproduced all reported abundance profiles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>). Our results clearly highlight the need for further studies of metabolite intensity differences in autism involving more ASD individuals, as well as individuals affected by other common cognitive disorders to assess the disease-specificity of the alterations.</p>
<p id="Par28">Our study demonstrates that the metabolic changes detected in blood might be informative of the metabolite intensity changes taking place in the brain. This result opens an opportunity for the design of ASD diagnostic tools based on the concentration measurements for a limited set of informative metabolites in blood or urine samples. The creation of reliable and objective ASD diagnostic tests would greatly facilitate the medical treatment of patients and selection of better-customized treatment routines. Furthermore, it would open the door for widespread metabolic biomarker-based clinical practices, providing the collection of standardized metabolic data from a large number of individuals. This, in turn, would create an essential resource for the construction of complex predictive models, leading to improved specificity in disease classification and treatment selection. Finally, better knowledge of the molecular changes taking place in the disease will lead to the more rapid development of better medical treatments. It should be mentioned, however, that design of such diagnostic assays would require extensive validation using independent sets of samples, and preferably include data for the brain, blood, and urine samples collected using the same experimental, analytical, and statistical frameworks.</p>

In brief, 10–15-mg tissue samples were dissected on dry ice from the frozen tissue without thawing. Dissected samples were weighed and transferred to pre-cooled 2 ml round bottom reinforced Precellys tubes containing 2.8 mm. zirconia beads. After the addition of a fixed volume (0.5 ml) of pre-cooled (−20 °C) extraction buffer to each tube, we performed two cycles of homogenization using the following parameters: stirring intensity 5000 rpm, homogenization temperature 7 °C, cycle time 45 s, and 15 s break. Several blank extraction samples were added to the end of each batch (48 samples). The blank samples were represented by the same 2 ml round bottom reinforced Precellys tubes without any sample material subjected to all extraction procedures. After the addition of a fixed volume (0.5 ml) of extraction buffer, the homogenates were vortexed and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C on an orbital shaker followed by a 10-min ultra-sonication in an ice-cooled sonication bath.

For the MS analysis, 40 µl of supernatant was transferred to 350 μl autosampler glass vials (Glastechnik Grafenroda, Germany). A chromatography separation of metabolites prior to MS was performed using Acquity I-Class UPLC system (Waters, UK). Metabolites were separated on a normal phase unbounded silica column RX-SIL (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm, Agilent, USA) coupled to a guard precolumn with the same phase parameters. We used two mobile phases for the chromatographic separation. Buffer A was water containing 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.2 mM ammonium hydroxide in water:acetonitrile (95:5 (vol/vol)) solution (pH value 8.0), and buffer B was 100% acetonitrile. The gradient separation was 0 min 0% A, 0.01–10 min linear gradient from 0 to 100% A, 10–14 min 100% A, 14–17 min linear gradient from 100 to 0% A, and 17–25 min 0% A. After a 3-min wash with 100% buffer A, the column was re-equilibrated with 100% buffer B. The flow rate was set to 500 µl/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C.

<p id="Par37">To eliminate the effects of the measurement order on metabolite intensities, we computed this effect for each metabolite by fitting a support vector regression model with a Gaussian kernel and one set of parameters for all metabolites to the log2 transformed, centered to the mean = 0, and scaled to standard deviation = 1 intensity values. The resulting functions were clustered using a k-means algorithm. After a visual evaluation, the clusters obviously affected by the measurement order were discarded. The intensity values of the remaining metabolites showing measurement order effect were corrected by subtracting the average of the corresponding cluster. The metabolite intensities were then recalculated to the original magnitude scale. After this procedure, a total of 1405 peaks remained. To correct for the variation related to the tissue weight, the metabolite intensities were normalized across samples using upper-quartile normalization separately in each mode.</p>

For each metabolite, we assessed the difference between intensities in samples obtained after prolonged PMD and the ones interpolated at the corresponding age from a spline curve fitted to the intensities measured in samples with a short PMD with four degrees of freedom. Metabolites with intensities in samples with prolonged PMD falling outside the 95% confidence interval of spline curve predictions were excluded from further analysis.

We used complete-linkage method of hierarchical clustering and cut the tree at four clusters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Segregation to a large number of clusters did not reveal novel patterns and yielded clusters with low numbers of metabolites (<italic>n</italic> &lt; 20).</p>
<p id="Par42">To test the overrepresentation of ASD-related metabolites in metabolic pathways, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis using R package clusterProfiler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> based on the enzymes that were directly linked to these metabolites according to the KEGG database annotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Genes directly linked to all the metabolites detected in our study were used as the background. The results were corrected for multiple testing using BH correction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par43">To test whether the disease status can be predicted using metabolite intensities, we implemented logistic regression with l<sub>1</sub> regularization, which is a linear model with an additional penalty on its coefficients that makes it possible to train the model while simultaneously performing feature selection. Because the feature selection showed substantial variability among different training subsets of the data, we performed stability selection as described in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which is a procedure based on multiple subsampling of the data. Briefly, the dataset was divided into the training and test sets and the model was trained using the training set with a fixed parameters (C = 100). For each trained model, we tested the performance of the classifier using a test set. By combining the results of all the data subsampling combinations (<italic>n</italic> = 500), we calculated the mean performance and, for each metabolite, the empirical probability of being incorporated into the model with a non-zero coefficient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). We then ranked the metabolites according to this empirical probability. Based on model performance assessment, we chose a cutoff of the top 200 metabolites to define the set of model predictors.</p>
<p id="Par44">We used two sets of cutoffs (stringent and relaxed) to identify species-specific metabolite intensity differences. To identify differences using the stringent cutoff, we used the ANCOVA approach described in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> for each species pair twice, using either species as a reference. If the test was significant for both human/chimpanzee and human/macaque pairs but not significant for the chimpanzee/macaque pair, then the metabolite was classified as showing human-specific intensity difference. Similarly, if the test was significant for both human/chimpanzee and chimpanzee/macaque pairs, but not significant for the human/macaque pair, then the metabolite was classified as showing chimpanzee-specific intensity difference. To conduct age alignment between species, we used the age scaling procedure described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. To identify differences using the relaxed cutoff, we calculated distances between species using macaque metabolite intensities as a baseline. A metabolite was classified as showing human-specific intensity difference if its human-macaque distance was larger than chimpanzee-macaque distance, and the direction of changes relative to the macaque coincided in humans and chimpanzees. Similarly, a metabolite was classified as showing a chimpanzee-specific intensity difference if its chimpanzee-macaque distance was larger than human-macaque distance, and the direction of changes relative to macaque coincided between humans and chimpanzees. For each metabolite, the distance was calculated as the absolute difference between average z-transformed intensities within species. To assess human-specificity in each module, we performed 1000 subsamplings of the same number of samples (<italic>n</italic> = 30) from each of the three species and calculated the ratio of human-specific to chimpanzee-specific intensity differences for each subsampling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par45">We tested the overrepresentation of human-specific metabolite intensity differences defined using stringent criteria in KEGG pathways using R package clusterProfiler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> as described above. To test the significance of the overlap between ASD-related and human-specific pathways, we performed Fisher’s exact test (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par46">To compare ASD-related metabolites with genes differentially expressed in ASD, we estimated gene expression levels using published dataset deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE28521<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The dataset contains transcriptome data for 19 ASD samples and 17 control samples from three brain regions: the cerebellum, the frontal cortex, and the temporal cortex. To test whether genes linked to ASD-related metabolites tended to show an excess of expression levels particular to ASD, we calculated the proportion of genes with ASD-dependent expression linked to each metabolite. Genes showing absolute log2 fold change between the average expression of ASD samples and control samples &gt;0.2 were defined as genes with ASD-dependent expression in this analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par47">To compare intensities of metabolites detected in our study with a previously published dataset of metabolite concentrations in humans, chimpanzees, and macaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, we matched metabolites between the datasets using putative annotation. We then calculated log2 fold changes between the average metabolite intensities in humans and the average metabolite intensities in macaques (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). To test whether log2 fold change values agreed between datasets, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient and performed Fisher’s exact test.</p>
<p id="Par48">To compare metabolome alterations in ASD detected in our study with published metabolite concentration changes in the urine and blood of ASD individuals, we performed Fisher’s exact test based on the overlap of KEGG metabolic pathways enriched in ASD-related metabolites in our study and in the union of published ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
