<abstract>
<p>Neuroinflammation is a complex process involving both the peripheral circulation
and the Central Nervous System (CNS) and is considered to underlie many CNS
disorders including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and pain. Stressors
including early-life adversity, psychosocial stress, and infection appear to
prime microglia toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Subsequent inflammatory
challenges then drive an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response involving the
upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators that is associated with CNS
dysfunction. Several pharmacologic inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines
including TNF-α and IL-1β show good clinical efficacy in terms of ameliorating
neuroinflammatory processes. Mind/body and plant-based interventions such as
yoga, breathing exercises, meditation, and herbs/spices have also been
demonstrated to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and have a positive impact on
depression, anxiety, cognition, and pain. As the intricate connections between
the immune system and the nervous system continue to be elucidated, successful
therapies for reducing neuroinflammation will likely involve an integrated
approach combining drug therapy with nonpharmacologic interventions.</p>

<title>Overview of Neuroinflammation</title>
<p>Inflammation is increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the disease
process. The loss of immune regulation leading to chronic inflammation results in
increased levels of inflammatory markers in the peripheral circulation that includes
cytokines and the acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP). Elevation of these
markers appear to predict not only disease risk but also the acceleration of the
progression of diseases involving inflammation including cardiovascular disease,
cancer, asthma, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1179069518793639">1</xref></sup> In fact, in a recent review, Fullerton and Gilroy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1179069518793639">2</xref></sup> suggest that inflammation is “a new therapeutic frontier” and it is clear
that inflammation that does not resolve contributes to many chronic diseases. The
inflammatory process can follow many different cellular cascades and its resolution
is likely equally complex and dependent on tissue and stimulus-specific processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1179069518793639">2</xref></sup> Nowhere is this more evident than in the nervous system. Inflammation of the
nervous system (termed neuroinflammation) has been shown to play a pivotal role in
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, traumatic
brain injury, and stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1179069518793639">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1179069518793639"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1179069518793639">5</xref></sup> What has emerged
more recently is that diseases that were largely thought to be based on
dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems such as mood disorders (including
depression and anxiety), schizophrenia, and chronic pain now appear to have
neuroinflammation as a key element (reviewed in Skaper et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1179069518793639">4</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Although recent studies are now focusing on the role of neuroinflammation in what
have typically been considered to be psychiatric disorders, it is important to note
that the concept of the integration of the immune system and the nervous system is
not new. For example, in Ayurveda (the traditional system of medicine of India that
dates back thousands of years), there is a tissue described as “Majja Dhatu” which
is defined as that which fills the empty spaces in bone. Its main function is
communication and it relates to both the bone marrow (source of red and white blood
cells) and the nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1179069518793639">6</xref></sup> Thus, Majja Dhatu represents an integrated immune and nervous system because
the ancient Ayurvedic physicians considered them to be one functional unit.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the evolution of Western medicine, where until very recently,
the immune system was considered to be entirely separate from the nervous system.
Indeed, the Central Nervous System (CNS) was long considered to be immune
privileged, meaning that the introduction of antigens into the CNS did not elicit a
typical inflammatory immune response. Inflammation was originally described as
“calor (heat), dolor (pain), rubor (redness), and tumor (swelling)” by the Roman
scholar Celsus in the first century Alzheimer disease, and these cardinal signs of
inflammation were not thought to be present within the CNS. However, the concept of
inflammation has recently expanded to include diseases that do not display any of
Celsus’ cardinal signs. Within the CNS, this includes the concept of
neuroinflammation where none of the 4 cardinal signs are exhibited: conventional
inflammatory cells are not present and changes to brain tissue resemble degeneration
rather than classical inflammatory pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1179069518793639">7</xref></sup> We now know that neuroinflammation is largely mediated by microglia, and to
some extent astrocytes and mast cells within the brain, and plays an important role
in neurodegenerative diseases as well as mood disorders, pain, and other CNS
disorders. Many excellent reviews on this have been published within the past
5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1179069518793639">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1179069518793639">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1179069518793639">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069518793639"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1179069518793639">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the earliest observations in the 20th century that correlated inflammation,
neurodegeneration, and mood disorders involved the sequela of events that occurred
following the Influenza A (Spanish flu) outbreak of 1918. This illness was
associated with postencephalic Parkinson disease and it has been suggested that the
Spanish flu was a neurovirulent strain that has since been implicated in
manic-depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and Parkinson disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1179069518793639">10</xref></sup> Recent studies have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines including IL-6,
TNF-α, and CRP are elevated in the blood of patients with Parkinson disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1179069518793639">11</xref></sup> The severity of depression and anxiety in these patients has also been
positively correlated with levels of TNF-α and CRP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1179069518793639">12</xref></sup> These findings support the hypothesis that a peripheral inflammatory
challenge, whether it is infection or an immune challenge, can induce a
neuroinflammatory response in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1179069518793639">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the first papers that described the interaction of the immune system with the
nervous system in terms of mood disorders was published in 1991 by Dr RS Smith where
he presented the “Macrophage theory of depression.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1179069518793639">14</xref></sup> He wrote that “excessive secretion of the macrophage monokines IL-1,
interferon alpha (IFN-α) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is proposed as the major
cause of depression.” This theory was based on 7 observations including (a)
volunteers given monokines develop all of the symptoms of major clinical depressive
disorder, (b) diseases where there is high macrophage activation are associated with
high rates of depression, (c) microglia can secrete monokines, and he noted a large
body of epidemiologic studies supported his hypothesis, even in 1991.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1179069518793639">14</xref></sup> Smith believed that the cytokine IL-1 was responsible for the hormonal
abnormalities observed in major depression and proposed that this cytokine could be
a mediator for depression. He also suggested that IFN-α and TNF-α were important
cytokines in the evolution of depression as patients given these cytokines displayed
many symptoms of depression. He noted that patients with RA had a significantly
greater incidence of depression (as did women) and additionally suggested that his
macrophage theory of depression would predict the higher rates of depression found
with coronary heart disease and stroke. Finally, in a fascinating observation, Smith
noted that the “food-gut-allergy axis” may play a role in macrophage activation. He
postulated that food itself could affect behavior and noted that dairy was the most
frequent food that resulted in behavior dysfunction. He also suggested that fish oil
could be prophylactic against depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1179069518793639">14</xref></sup> Smith was particularly prescient when he linked the gut and mood disorders as
we now know the importance of the microbiome in health and disease.</p>
<p>Almost 3 decades after Smith published this seminal paper, the biomedical community
has embraced the concept of inflammation influencing CNS dysfunction from
neurodegeneration to mental health disorders, to pain syndromes and opioid
addiction. Microglia, and to some extent astrocytes, appear to be the key regulators
of neuroinflammation and a diverse range of stimuli can drive these cells into an
inflammatory phenotype.</p>
<p>There is a large body of literature examining the role of neuroinflammation in
neurodegenerative diseases, but this review will focus on the most well-studied
neuroinflammatory mediators (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, CRP) and examine how these proteins
modulate psychiatric diseases and pain. We will then examine nonpharmacologic
interventions, that have been shown to be efficacious in psychiatric dysfunction and
also result in a decrease in these peripherally circulating inflammatory
mediators.</p>
<sec id="section2-1179069518793639">
<title>Microglia are the principle modulators of neuroinflammation in the
CNS</title>
<p>Microglia are the main immune effectors in the brain and perform multiple
functions. They are considered to be resident macrophages, and once activated,
they migrate to the site of injury or disease when pathogens, disease, or other
inflammatory signals affect the CNS. Activated microglia then differentiate to
either a neurotoxic (sometimes called M1) or a neuroprotective phenotype (termed
M2), although it is important to recognize that microglia can differentiate
along a spectrum between neurotoxic and neuroprotective functions. When in a
neurotoxic state, microglia secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
including interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and
interleukin 6 (IL-6) as well as other pro-inflammatory molecules such as nitric
oxide and superoxide anion. The neuroprotective phenotype releases
anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and downregulates the pro-inflammatory
response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1179069518793639">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1179069518793639">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1179069518793639">16</xref></sup> Pro-inflammatory microglia defend against invading
pathogens and clear cellular debris to promote tissue repair, and this response
is ultimately positive for CNS recovery following injury or some other
short-term challenge. Chronic inflammation occurs when microglia remain in the
pro-inflammatory state, leading to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
and ultimately neuronal cell death. It has been suggested that when acute
inflammation is unable to resolve, ie, “frustrated resolution,” then a
maladaptive immunity evolves where there is ongoing acute inflammation that is
accompanied by the inability to develop adaptive immunity, and this may underlie
many of the diseases that are driven by chronic inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1179069518793639">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Microglia have also been shown to contact synaptic elements (synaptic clefts,
axon terminals, dendritic spines) and microglial surveillance has been linked to
synaptic maturation and pruning during development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1179069518793639">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1179069518793639">18</xref></sup> There is evidence that the
engulfment of synapses by microglia can provide neuroprotection during increased
neural activity or excitotoxicity but that chronic stress or other pathologic
conditions can result in microglial-mediated synaptic loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1179069518793639">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1179069518793639">19</xref></sup> Recently,
a subset of microglia called “dark microglia” have been identified in a rodent
model. These microglia are rarely found under normal conditions in the brain but
become abundant with chronic stress, normal aging, Alzheimer pathology, and in
fractalkine-signaling knockout mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1179069518793639">20</xref></sup> The dark microglia are usually found in clusters and are often associated
with the vasculature in brain regions such as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex,
amygdala, and hypothalamus. They appear to be extremely active, more so than
normally activated microglia, and can engulf entire synapses between axon
terminals and synaptic spines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1179069518793639">20</xref></sup> These highly phagocytic cells show signs of oxidative stress that
includes an electron-dense, condensed cytoplasm, hence their name of “dark
microglia.” Interestingly, an electron micrographic study that was published
more than 50 years ago also described microglia that were very electron
dense.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1179069518793639">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1179069518793639">21</xref></sup> It has yet to be determined whether the dark microglia
represent a subset of hyperactive/hyperinflammatory microglia or whether they
are a novel myeloid cell that infiltrates the brain. Either way, they could play
a major role in synaptic remodeling and/or stripping under pathologic conditions
and may contribute to diseases such as depression where synaptic loss has been
documented.</p>
<p>Cellular pathways that lead to activation of microglia are a target for the
development of drugs to combat neuroinflammation. For example, activation of the
nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway has been shown to play a key role in
neuroinflammation, is linked to depression-like symptoms, and is the focus of
studies examining factors that can activate this pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1179069518793639">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1179069518793639">23</xref></sup> This area
of investigation has seen explosive growth in the past few years and there are
many intriguing hypotheses and compounds that are being developed and tested on
this topic but are beyond the scope of the current review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1179069518793639">
<title>Stress can prime neuroinflammatory pathways</title>
<p>There is a growing body of literature documenting that life stressors can
predispose an individual to the development of psychiatric disorders (reviewed
in Frank et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1179069518793639">24</xref></sup>). These stressors appear to prime the neuroinflammatory response,
resulting in an exaggerated response to subsequent pro-inflammatory challenges.
Both acute stressors (eg, meeting a deadline, a “fender bender” auto accident,
or taking an exam) and chronic stressors (such as loss of a spouse, caring for
an ill family member, divorce, or natural disasters) are all associated with
elevated peripheral markers of inflammation. The most common markers that have
been measured in the peripheral circulation include the pro-inflammatory
cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and the acute-phase CRP. A recent meta-analysis
examining alterations in inflammatory cytokines to acute laboratory stress found
that this type of stress-induced significant increases in peripheral IL-1β,
IL-6, and TNF-α but not CRP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1179069518793639">1</xref></sup> Although it is well established that stress has an overall effect on
immune function, there is a great deal of variability in how each individual
responds to stress. Some individuals show a large immune response to stress,
whereas others show little or no response. In addition, early-life experiences
affect the immune system, and these early alterations can result in a heightened
immune response to stressors during young adulthood and adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1179069518793639">25</xref></sup> A recent study in rodents showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
maternal immune activation at E12 (embryonic day 12) significantly upregulated
the fetal brain expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 and this upregulation was
sustained through P40 (40 days postpartum).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1179069518793639">26</xref></sup> Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal or neonatal activation of
the immune system by infection, stress, or malnutrition can predispose an
individual to diseases such as schizophrenia and autism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1179069518793639">27</xref></sup> We will further explore the link between inflammation and schizophrenia
later in this review. It is important to note that a peripheral inflammatory
challenge, whether it is infection or an immune challenge, can induce a
neuroinflammatory response in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1179069518793639">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been suggested that individuals who respond to everyday stresses with a
large increase in inflammatory mediators may be less susceptible to acute
infections but are much more prone to chronic inflammation and diseases related
to inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1179069518793639">1</xref></sup> Frank et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1179069518793639">24</xref></sup> have proposed a model of microglial priming where an initial stress
results in increased levels of glucocorticoids within the CNS, which
subsequently induces the extracellular release of the high mobility group box 1
protein (HMGB1) forming a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in the
brain. The DAMPs are a group of endogenous molecules that are released in
response to conditions such as a broken bone that do not involve the entry of
pathogens into the body. HMGB1 is present in the brain and is thought to signal
innate immune cells such as microglia to a number of different conditions
including stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1179069518793639">28</xref></sup> HMGB1 release then induces the upregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in
microglia, which cleaves IL-1β into its active form, and the microglia are then
considered to be primed. If a subsequent immune challenge occurs, then these
“primed” microglia respond with a potentiated neuroinflammatory response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1179069518793639">24</xref></sup> Microglial priming may occur more readily in some individuals, and these
people could be particularly vulnerable to stress-induced psychiatric
disorders.</p>
<p>In addition, psychosocial stress results in microglia shifting toward a
pro-inflammatory phenotype, presumably through glucocorticoid release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1179069518793639">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1179069518793639">30</xref></sup> A recent
rodent study used a model of repeated social defeat to examine the development
of glial activation under psychosocial stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1179069518793639">31</xref></sup> Male rats were introduced into the cage of the resident, dominant male
who then attacked the intruder for a duration of 10 minutes or shorter,
depending on when the intruder displayed submission. The intruders were then
placed for 60 minutes in a wire mesh cage that prevented further physical
contact but still allowed visual, olfactory, and auditory interactions. This
protocol was repeated for 5 consecutive days, using different residents but the
same intruder. The intruders showed transient increased corticosterone levels
that were correlated with increased expression of the translocator protein
(TSPO; a biomarker for activated microglia and astrocytes) as measured by
positron emission tomography using 11C-PK11195 as the tracer. This increase in
microglial activation was also accompanied by depressive and anxiety-like
behavior. However, in this model of very short term social defeat, all
physiological and psychological parameters induced by the repeated social defeat
resolved within 3 to 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1179069518793639">31</xref></sup> It is not known whether a social defeat paradigm that continued for
months would have a more long-lasting effect.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, one can easily imagine how chronic psychosocial stress
can lead to chronic neuroinflammation and subsequent mood disorders. It is
important to note that women appear to be more susceptible to mood disorders
following both short-term and long-term inflammation. Women respond to stressors
in a more pro-inflammatory way than do men, with increased mobilization of
various types of immune cells and decreased sensitivity to glucocorticoids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1179069518793639">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taken together, these studies demonstrate that stress, including early childhood
adversity and psychosocial stress, can prime the neuroinflammatory response to
subsequent inflammatory challenges, and that chronic stress results in chronic
inflammation that is associated with mood disorders.</p>

<p>Smith’s original macrophage theory of depression has been validated by an
extensive and detailed body of work that has examined the bidirectional
interaction between the immune system and the nervous system in mood disorders.
Chronic inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, RA, inflammatory
bowel disease, obesity, and even spinal cord injury are often comorbid with
depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1179069518793639">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1179069518793639"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1179069518793639"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1179069518793639">36</xref></sup> In fact, patients with RA
suffer depression rates of 9.5% to 41.5% which is significantly higher compared
with the general population (6.7%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1179069518793639">37</xref></sup> These diseases result in increased levels of circulating pro-inflammatory
cytokines and CRP which are thought to contribute to the development of
depression. The reverse situation is also true; a large number of patients with
major depression or bipolar disorder have elevated peripheral inflammatory
mediators including cytokines and acute phase proteins such as CRP in their
blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared with healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1179069518793639">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1179069518793639">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1179069518793639">39</xref></sup> It is
worth noting that in adolescents and young adults, multiple depressive episodes
predicts a an increase in CRP levels later in adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1179069518793639">40</xref></sup> Many of these cytokines return to normal levels following treatment and
recovery from depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1179069518793639">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, artificially inducing an increase in peripheral pro-inflammatory
cytokines by administration of endotoxin or with cytokine therapy for the
treatment of cancer leads to the development of depressive symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1179069518793639">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1179069518793639">42</xref></sup> This acute
systemic inflammation results in what is commonly referred to as sickness
behavior (anhedonia, mood deterioration, fatigue, cognitive deficits).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1179069518793639">43</xref></sup> For example, a low-dose LPS injection in humans results in a significant
increase in serum CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 as well as a significant increase in IL-6
in the CSF within 0 to 4 hours following the injection. This is correlated with
an increase in dysthymia scores (persistent depressive disorder).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1179069518793639">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Human studies have shown that the TNF-α inhibitor infliximab, used to treat many
inflammatory diseases including RA, Crohn disease, and psoriasis, is able to
reduce depression. A randomized controlled trial of infliximab suggested that
although infliximab was not generally effective in reducing treatment-resistant
depression, it did appear to be efficacious in patients with high baseline
markers for inflammation such as CRP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1179069518793639">44</xref></sup> In addition, high levels of CRP in patients were associated with worse
outcomes with SSRIs (serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors such as
Lexapro/escitalopram) that are used to treat depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1179069518793639">45</xref></sup> The SSRI monotherapy appears to be more effective in patients with low
CRP levels, whereas combination therapy (bupropion/SSRI) is more effective in
patients with high CRP levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1179069518793639">45</xref></sup> Serum CRP levels could potentially be used as a biomarker to guide
pharmacologic therapy in the treatment of depression.</p>
<p>Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 appear to predict depression during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1179069518793639">46</xref></sup> and might also be used as a therapeutic guide for treating depression in
the elderly. The incidence of depression increases with age and is often
associated with chronic pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1179069518793639">47</xref></sup> Not only is there an elevation of peripheral pro-inflammatory mediators
during aging but age also appears to prime microglia to a subsequent
neuroinflammatory challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1179069518793639">47</xref></sup> as described earlier in this review. In addition, aging also results in
an increase in very pro-inflammatory dark microglia in rodents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1179069518793639">20</xref></sup> Abnormal activation of microglia and increased microglial cell numbers
are observed in patients with depression and anxiety, independent of age,
although age certainly exacerbates this process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069518793639">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1179069518793639">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>So how do peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines influence the brain? There are
several routes by which these mediators enter the brain and activate
neuroinflammatory processes. They can reach the brain through the vagus nerve
that projects to the nucleus of the solitary tract which then communicates with
the hypothalamus and the amygdala.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1179069518793639">13</xref></sup> The blood-brain barrier (BBB) itself is disrupted by LPS and
pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, and they can cross the BBB via
upregulation of influx carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1179069518793639">49</xref></sup> Pro-inflammatory mediators can also enter the brain in areas that do not
have a BBB such as the circumventricular organs and the choroid plexus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1179069518793639">50</xref></sup> Once these peripheral mediators enter the brain, they drive
neuroinflammatory processes including microglial activation, and this can result
in mood disorders such as depression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1179069518793639">
<title>Anxiety</title>
<p>Depression is often linked to anxiety and increased blood levels of TNF-α induce
anxiety behavior in a rodent model of chronic mild stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1179069518793639">51</xref></sup> Inhibiting TNF-α by administering infliximab reduces anxiety in both the
rodent model of mild stress and a model of persistent pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1179069518793639">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1179069518793639">52</xref></sup> In
addition, mild chronic stress also results in microglia activation as well as
upregulation of cytokines including IL-1β and IL-6 in the hippocampus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1179069518793639">53</xref></sup> Additional data confirming the role of pro-inflammatory mediators in the
development of anxiety come from experiments where mice that are genetically
engineered to overexpress IL-6 or TNF-α show anxiogenic behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1179069518793639">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>People with anxiety that is independent of depression also have higher levels of IL-6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1179069518793639">55</xref></sup> Healthy medical students that take a high-stakes nationwide examination
for promotion have increased anxiety levels and show significantly increased
levels of a number of different pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and
TNF-α. The anxiety states of the students peaked 1 day before the exam, although
the increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines were highest immediately
after the exam, and then significantly decreased 1 week later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1179069518793639">56</xref></sup> Interestingly, a randomized controlled trial found that omega-3
supplementation lowered both inflammation and anxiety in a different cohort of
anxious medical students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1179069518793639">57</xref></sup> Thus, human studies have found a correlation between anxiety and
increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6, and
TNF-α.</p>

<sec id="section7-1179069518793639">
<title>Schizophrenia</title>
<p>Inflammation has also been shown to play an important role in schizophrenia.
Chronic systemic increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6,
IL-8, and TNF-α have been well-documented in people with schizophrenia and first
episode psychosis compared with healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1179069518793639">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1179069518793639">59</xref></sup> Cytokine serum levels are
correlated with exacerbation/remission of symptoms as well as with antipsychotic
treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1179069518793639">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1179069518793639"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1179069518793639">60</xref></sup> In
particular, patients with schizophrenia have elevated levels of IL-6 in both
serum and cerebral spinal fluid and this elevation appears to increase the risk
for cognitive decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1179069518793639">61</xref></sup> Polymorphisms in both the IL-1β and IL-6 genes that increase blood levels
for both of these cytokines are associated with schizophrenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1179069518793639">59</xref></sup> Maternal infection, including influenza, <italic>Toxoplasma
gondii</italic>, and herpes simplex virus type 2 are also well recognized as
risk factors for schizophrenia in the offspring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1179069518793639">27</xref></sup> These infections are associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory
cytokines, and elevated maternal levels of TNF-α at the time of birth are
correlated with offspring who have psychosis compared with control offspsring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1179069518793639">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, there appears to be a lower level of messenger RNA (mRNA) for the
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-2 in the blood of people with schizophrenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1179069518793639">58</xref></sup> It is hypothesized that people having schizophrenia might also have a
blunted ability to dampen the inflammatory response because they produce less
IL-2. Results supporting these findings show levels of soluble TNF-α receptor 1
(sTNFR1) are significantly higher in patients with acute-stage schizophrenia
compared with healthy controls. Significantly, high levels of sTNFR1 are a good
indicator of patients that will not respond well to drug therapy and exhibit
deterioration during the course of in-patient care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1179069518793639">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients with schizophrenia have changes in microglia along with increases in
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Postmortem studies of brain tissue from
schizophrenic patients have found an increase in microglial density and
activation, as well as increased degeneration compared with controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1179069518793639">63</xref></sup> Although dysregulation of the dopaminergic system is thought to underlie
the development of psychosis in schizophrenia, there is also a loss of cortical
synapses that may be mediated by activated microglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1179069518793639">63</xref></sup> Interestingly, many of the maternal risk factors for developing
schizophrenia, including infection, can also prime microglia toward a
pro-inflammatory phenotype following a subsequent challenge.</p>
<p>Taken together, these studies suggest that inflammation plays an important role
in the development of schizophrenia. Pre- or perinatal immunologic challenges
can prime microglia, resulting in structural changes and the release of
pro-inflammatory mediators that accumulate as patients’ age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1179069518793639">60</xref></sup> Current treatments for schizophrenia all involve inhibiting dopamine
neurotransmission. However, there is a wide variability in how patients respond
to these medications. Some patients respond well, some are delayed responders,
and some are resistant to treatment. Elevation in IL-6 is associated with
delayed responders and treatment resistance is associated with increased levels
of IL-6 and IL-6r, and sTNFR1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1179069518793639">59</xref></sup> It may be possible in the future to use these pro-inflammatory mediators
as trait markers to predict treatment effectiveness or to develop
co-therapeutics that target specific cytokines as adjuncts to dopaminergic
therapies.</p>

<title>Pain</title>
<p>Neuroinflammation has recently been identified as playing an important role in
the establishment and maintenance of both neuropathic pain and chronic pain.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and microglial activation have been
shown to contribute to the pain process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1179069518793639">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1179069518793639">65</xref></sup> Neuropathic pain is
complex and results from peripheral nerve damage that includes damage by injury,
infection, diabetes, and other diseases. Chronic pain occurs when individuals
have pain at sites that were previously injured but are now apparently healthy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1179069518793639">65</xref></sup> Patients with neuropathic pain have been shown to have higher IL-2 and
TNF-α mRNA and protein levels compared with patients with a painless neuropathy
or healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1179069518793639">66</xref></sup> Pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α have been
demonstrated to accelerate pain sensitization, whereas inhibitors of these
cytokines reduce neuropathic pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1179069518793639">65</xref></sup> Chronic pain increases the risk for depression by as much 4 times and
neuroinflammation appears to be a common pathway that links pain and depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1179069518793639">47</xref></sup> In addition, chronic inflammation is now thought to be an important
factor in fibromyalgia (FM). Fibromyalgia is a musculoskeletal pain condition
that is characterized by widespread pain, muscle tenderness, and fatigue/sleep
disturbances and is most common in women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1179069518793639">67</xref></sup> A recent study that analyzed pro-inflammatory mediators in the cerebral
spinal fluid and plasma of patients using a multiplex protein panel revealed
that the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-6, and some chemokines are elevated
in patients with FM, highlighting the importance of chronic inflammation in FM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1179069518793639">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>Microglia have also been implicated in pain conditions and it has been suggested
that chronic pain is the result of dysregulated glial activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1179069518793639">68</xref></sup> The pro-inflammatory mediators that are released by activated microglia
are thought to contribute to pain hypersensitivity, and the microglial inhibitor
minocycline has been shown to reduce pain hypersensitivity in a number of
different models including burn injuries, spinal cord injury, and chronic
constriction injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1179069518793639">68</xref></sup> For example, spinal microglia play an important role in the pathogenesis
of neuropathic pain following nerve injury in a rodent model where minocycline
reduced the neuropathic pain. However, only males showed a reduction in pain,
suggesting that the microglia signaling is sex dependent in this context.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1179069518793639">69</xref></sup> Treatment of pain with cytokine inhibitors also shows encouraging results
in patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1179069518793639">70</xref></sup> A single intrathecal treatment of the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept provided
up to 8 weeks of relief for patients having intractable discogenic back pain,
whereas 2 consecutive injections of etanercept provided 26 weeks of relief for
lumbar herniated disc patients. Treatment with rilonacept, an IL-1 inhibitor,
was well tolerated and reduced pain in a small group of patients with chronic
refractory gouty arthritis (reviewed in Ji et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1179069518793639">70</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Finally, neuroinflammation may be an important link between chronic pain and
opioid abuse. Chronic pain patients with comorbid depression are more likely to
develop opioid abuse than pain patients without depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1179069518793639">71</xref></sup> Persistent inflammatory pain results in animals self-administering more
heroin than nonpain animals, suggesting that chronic pain increases
opioid-addictive behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1179069518793639">72</xref></sup> Chronic opioid use itself results in neuroinflammation with increases in
IL-1β and TNF-α.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1179069518793639">71</xref></sup> It is hypothesized that the inflammation induced by opioids renders them
less effective, thus more drug is needed leading to increased dependence. Opioid
drugs activate microglia in brain regions including the limbic system that
regulates reward and emotion, and morphine has also been shown to activate the
inflammasome, leading to increased production of inflammatory
mediators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1179069518793639">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1179069518793639">73</xref></sup> A recent study has demonstrated a key role for TNF-α in
opiate dependence and has identified solTNF-α (soluble TNF-α) as a critical
mediator for the development of opioid tolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1179069518793639">74</xref></sup> In addition, genetic polymorphisms in the IL-1β gene are associated with
an increased risk for opioid dependence, although it is not clear what the
functional consequences of this polymorphism might be.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1179069518793639">75</xref></sup> Thus, opioid use appears to initiate a vicious cycle of neuroinflammation
that is exacerbated by pain and/or depression, leading to reduced efficacy and
tolerance that can result in opioid dependence. It has been suggested that
inhibiting neuroinflammation during opioid use could enhance the analgesic
efficacy of opioids and might decrease the risk for addiction in the chronic
pain population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1179069518793639">71</xref></sup></p>

<title>Nonpharmacologic Interventions that Lower Pro-inflammatory Mediators</title>
<p>Developing novel therapeutics that target neuroinflammatory pathways is a very active
area of research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1179069518793639">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1179069518793639">77</xref></sup> and, as mentioned above, there are already several inhibitors
of TNF-α and IL-1 that are on the market for clinical use. However, these drugs are
not without potentially serious side effects and a more holistic approach combined
with drug therapy might ultimately prove to be the most effective way to lower
neuroinflammation. Traditional systems of medicine, including Ayurveda and
Traditional Chinese Medicine, take a holistic approach to managing health and
disease that includes diet, lifestyle, exercise, rest, diet, herbs, and bodywork.
The emerging field of Integrative Medicine is embracing these holistic principles,
and many allopathic medical centers are now incorporating mind/body practices and
dietary programs into their treatment protocols. Evidence is emerging that
nonpharmacologic interventions including yoga, meditation, acupuncture, and
diet/herbs can successfully lower circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>We will focus on the practices incorporated into Ayurveda, the traditional system of
medicine of India. Ayurveda has been practiced in India for thousands of years. It
uses diet, daily routines, bodywork (including therapeutic massage), herbs, spices,
and exercise to both maintain health and treat disease. Ayurveda has a unique
approach where each individual is classified according to their individual
physiology and psychology (known as Dosha). Each treatment plan is then tailored to
the genetics and individual constitution of the person and also to the unique nature
of a particular disease. This is very similar to the approach now being adopted by
modern Western medicine where “personalized medicine” based on an individual’s
genetic profile is increasingly being used to guide therapeutics. In India,
Ayurvedic physicians receive rigorous training that includes modern biomedical
physiology and pharmacology. Ayurveda is becoming increasingly popular in the West
and is currently undergoing a licensing process in the Unites States. There is a
growing body of work evaluating the reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines in
response to many of the therapies that are used by Ayurveda, including mind/body
interventions (MBIs) and herbal therapies. Although there is variability in this
emerging field, some general observations can be made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179069518793639">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Stress, early-life adversity, psychosocial stress, age, and infection can
prime microglia and activate neuroinflammatory processes that include
increases in pro-inflammatory mediators in both the peripheral circulation
and in the CNS. Neuroinflammation is now thought to underlie many
psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia as
well as pain. Integrated therapies that include drug therapy as well as
mind/body and plant-based therapies will likely be the most successful
approach for reducing neuroinflammation and ameliorating CNS dysfunction.

<title>Yoga</title>
<p>There is a large body of literature documenting that yoga reduces stress,
anxiety, and depression, and studies are now emerging that show that the regular
practice of yoga can also lower inflammatory mediators. For example, a recent
study examined the relationship between inflammatory cytokines and yoga in 218 volunteers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1179069518793639">78</xref></sup> The yoga group practiced yoga daily for 1 hour for a period of 5 years.
The control group did not practice yoga but did exercise. Both groups performed
a session of moderate and strenuous exercise by performing a standardized
shuttle walk. In the shuttle walk, the subjects had to walk between 2 markers in
a given amount of time, and this time was gradually decreased. When subjects had
more time to walk between the markers, they engaged in moderate exercise and
when they had a short amount of time to walk between the markers they engaged in
more strenuous exercise. Blood samples were collected before and after the
shuttle walk test, and TNF-α and IL-6 were measured. At rest, the non-yoga group
had significantly higher levels of TNF-α than the yoga group indicating that the
yoga group had lower baseline inflammation compared with the controls.</p>
<p>There was a significant increase in both IL-6 and TNF-α in the non-yoga group
compared with the yoga group following the shuttle walk, suggesting that yoga
reduces the inflammatory response to moderate exercise. The authors concluded
that the regular practice of yoga reduces inflammatory cytokines in general and
might protect the individual from inflammatory diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1179069518793639">78</xref></sup> This study is particularly important because it examined how yoga
influences the body’s response to a stressor, in this case exercise, and found
that it effectively dampened the pro-inflammatory response. It would be very
interesting to evaluate how yoga effects the inflammatory response to a
short-term nonphysical stressor such as taking a high stakes exam. Note that
“yoga” in this context refers to a relaxing, moderate form of exercise and
breathwork versus the high stress yoga sometimes found in some intense
workouts.</p>
<p>Another group examined the effect of a short-term yoga-based lifestyle
intervention on stress and inflammation in patients with chronic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1179069518793639">79</xref></sup> Eighty-six subjects participated in 10 days of yoga (2 hours per day,
theory and practice) over a 2-week period. A significant decrease in cortisol
(13%), IL-6 (10%), and TNF-α (32%) from baseline to the end of study was
observed, suggesting that yoga can lower pro-inflammatory mediators in people
with chronic diseases. However, it is important to note that there is a great
deal of variability in studies of yoga and inflammatory cytokines, with some
studies finding significant decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas
other studies find little to no effect. This is due, at least in part, to
differences in the type of yoga practiced and the study design. Several recent
meta-analysis examining yoga and pro-inflammatory mediators in both healthy
practitioners and in people with disease have concluded that there is an overall
pattern of downregulation of pro-inflammatory markers with the practice of
yoga.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1179069518793639">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1179069518793639">81</xref></sup> In particular, yoga decreases levels of IL-1β, although the
effect sizes are small to medium. Studies measuring both IL-6 and TNF-α show
mixed results, although overall, yoga appears to have the potential for reducing
both cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1179069518793639">81</xref></sup> A reason for this variability may lie in the duration of the yoga
intervention. Most studies with yoga last only 8 to 12 weeks which is a
relatively short period of time. For populations that have inflammatory diseases
such as chronic heart failure, an 8-week yoga intervention appears to be

<title>Meditation and breathing exercises</title>
<p>Breathing practices alone have been found to be an effective intervention for
many stress-related disorders including anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder,
depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1179069518793639">84</xref></sup> Breathing exercises also appear to be particularly beneficial in
ameliorating pain. Breathing exercises performed for 30 minutes a day, 7 days a
week for 12 weeks resulted in significant improvements of 27% to 63% in pain
thresholds on various tender points for women with FM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1179069518793639">85</xref></sup> In another study of pain in FM, slow breathing rates reduced pain
intensity and feelings of unpleasantness in response to thermal stimuli in women
with FM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1179069518793639">86</xref></sup> Unfortunately, neither of these studies measured cytokine levels, but
they did establish that breathing practices could be used to modulate the
sensation of pain.</p>
<p>A recent study of yogic breathing (YB) found that this practice decreased
inflammatory cytokine levels. The small study randomized 20 volunteers into 2
groups, YB (2 breathing exercises for 10 minutes each) and AC (attention
control; read a text of their choice for 20 minutes).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1179069518793639">87</xref></sup> The YB consisted of 10 minutes of OM chanting and 10 minutes of alternate
nostril breathing. Inflammatory cytokines were then measured in the saliva
following a single session of either YB or AC. No differences between the groups
were observed for IL-6 or TNF-α in the saliva, but there was a significant
decrease in IL-8 and IL-1β.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1179069518793639">87</xref></sup> Peripheral circulating cytokines were not measured so it is not known
whether there was a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood. This
appears to be the only study to date that examined cytokine levels following a
breathing practice that was not coupled with meditation. Although these results
are encouraging, additional studies are needed to confirm that a breathing
practice alone can reduce pro-inflammatory mediators in the peripheral
circulation.</p>
<p>Breathing practices are often part of mindfulness meditation, and there is a
fairly extensive literature that has examined the effect of meditation on
pro-inflammatory mediators. There are many forms of meditation that use various
different techniques, but overall, meditation seems to reduce blood cortisol,
CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and the activity of the transcription factor NF-κB in a number
of different types of meditation practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1179069518793639">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1179069518793639">88</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1179069518793639"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1179069518793639">90</xref></sup> In addition, a recent
meta-analysis found that MBIs that included breathing, meditation, yoga, and Tai
Chi downregulated pro-inflammatory genes and pathways and identified the NF-κB
pathway as being consistently downregulated. The authors concluded that “the
various psychological and physiological benefits of MBIs may be mediated through
the downregulation of proinflammatory genes and pathways.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1179069518793639">91</xref></sup></p>

<title>Therapeutic massage/sesame oil</title>
<p>Body massage with herbalized oils is a cornerstone of Ayurvedic therapies. Most
of the herbalized oils used in treatments have sesame oil as their base, and
sesame oil itself has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in a
number of different in vitro and animal models. Sesame oil has been shown to
inhibit microglial activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
involved in neuroinflammation. For example, sesamin, a bioactive component of
sesame oil, inhibits the production of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in a microglial
cell line activated by MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium), the active metabolite
of the neurotoxin MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1179069518793639">92</xref></sup> In a rodent model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH),
intracerebroventricular administration of sesamin prevented the ICH-induced
increase in microglial cells, and many of these microglia in the sesamin-treated
brains exhibited a resting morphology rather than a pro-inflammatory phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1179069518793639">93</xref></sup> Both sesamol (another bioactive compound in sesame oil) and sesamin given
orally reduced circulating cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and CRP in a
rodent model of inflammation induced by LPS injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1179069518793639">94</xref></sup> Note that sesame oil was also frequently used by pharmacies in the United
States during the 18th century to compound many drugs and tonics, a practice
that was later discontinued.</p>
<p>Although there are no studies to date examining whether massage with sesame oil
reduces peripheral inflammatory mediators, there are several studies
demonstrating that sesame oil massage can reduce pain. A triple-blind randomized
control trial found that massage with topical sesame oil was effective in
significantly reducing pain severity in patients with limb trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1179069518793639">95</xref></sup> In another randomized clinical study of 150 patients with limb trauma,
topical application of sesame oil was shown to lower the severity of perceived
pain and reduce the frequency of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in
these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1179069518793639">96</xref></sup> Clinical studies are needed to evaluate the effect of topical application
of sesame oil on circulating cytokines, but sesame oil offers the potential to
be useful as an adjunct therapy for treating neuroinflammation.</p>

<title>Diet/herbs</title>
<p>Inflammation related to food is currently a very popular topic, and there are
many diets that claim to curb inflammation to improve health and ameliorate
disease. Some studies have shown that diets that are high in saturated fats are
linked to the expression of pro-inflammatory genes of adipose tissue in
individuals at risk for metabolic syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1179069518793639">97</xref></sup> In contrast, the Mediterranean Diet, consisting of fruit, nuts,
vegetables, legumes, whole grains, seafood, red wine, and olive oil, has been
proposed to reduce inflammation, in part by altering the gut microbiome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1179069518793639">98</xref></sup> However, the interactions between diet and inflammation are complex and
difficult to quantify in clinical studies. For example, as dietary intake across
the globe has become more westernized, the rates of obesity and inflammatory
diseases including type 2 diabetes have increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1179069518793639">99</xref></sup> However, in India, although the incidence of type 2 diabetes is
increasing as the diet becomes more westernized in urban centers, the lowest
rates of Alzheimer in the world are found in rural India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1179069518793639">100</xref></sup> Diet certainly plays a role, and the use of a wide variety of spices in
traditional South Asian cuisine could make a positive contribution to health
status. Most spices have been shown to have some type of anti-inflammatory
activity, and black and red pepper, clove, garlic, licorice, ginger, cinnamon,
coriander, and turmeric have all been shown to modulate inflammatory pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1179069518793639">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>Turmeric is a staple of Indian cuisine and is the most well-studied spice. There
are more than 1300 PubMed references to curcumin (the active component of
turmeric) and inflammation. Curcumin supplementation (1 g per day for 8 weeks)
has recently been shown to significantly reduce serum concentrations of IL-6,
TNF-α, and MCP-1 in individuals with metabolic syndrome who were not taking
lipid-lowering drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1179069518793639">102</xref></sup> Supporting these findings, a meta-analysis found that curcumin lowered
circulating IL-6 concentrations in 9 randomized clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1179069518793639">103</xref></sup> Not only has curcumin consumption found to be of benefit in diabetes,
metabolic disease, and obesity but it is also beneficial in diseases involving
neuroinflammation such as depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1179069518793639">104</xref></sup> Based on its ability to lower circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines in
people, supplementation with curcumin or turmeric might be an effective adjunct
therapy for treating neuroinflammatory diseases.</p>
<p>It is important to note that most plants exhibit some type of anti-inflammatory
activity, particularly in vitro but it is difficult to determine whether this
activity has any clinical consequences. Assessing neuroinflammatory properties
of herbs that are traditionally used to treat diseases such as memory loss
(neurodegeneration), depression, and anxiety is an important approach to
determine which plants might have clinical efficacy in a biomedical context. Our
laboratory is studying the medicinal herb <italic>Bacopa monnieri.
Bacopa</italic> (sometimes called Brahmi) is an herb that is used in
Ayurveda to improve memory and cognition. <italic>Bacopa</italic> is an
important ingredient in many herbal formulas that are designed to manage a wide
range of CNS conditions including memory loss, anxiety, lack of concentration,
and poor cognition. Importantly, <italic>Bacopa</italic> is also used to treat
inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, asthma, stress, depression, and
neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1179069518793639">105</xref></sup> This anti-inflammatory activity has been well-documented in animal models
of arthritis where treatment with <italic>Bacopa</italic> inhibited the release
of both TNF-α and IL-6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1179069518793639">105</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1179069518793639">106</xref></sup> In addition, LPS-induced TNF-α release from whole
blood drawn from healthy volunteers was significantly downregulated in a
dose-dependent manner by different fractions of <italic>Bacopa</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1179069518793639">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have created both water and alkaloid fractions from the
<italic>Bacopa</italic> plant and have examined their anti-inflammatory
activity using LPS-activated N9 microglial cells. We have found that several of
these fractions significantly inhibit the release of both TNF-α and IL-6 from
activated microglia. Interestingly, Bacoside A is the most abundant dammarane
saponin triterpenoid in <italic>Bacopa</italic> and is considered to be
primarily responsible for its biological activity. But in our studies, purified
Bacoside A did not inhibit the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1179069518793639">108</xref></sup> Given that our fractions of <italic>Bacopa</italic> contained multiple
phytochemical constituents and were able to inhibit the pro-inflammatory
microglial response, this study highlights the complexity of working with plant
material. There are more than a dozen of less abundant bacosides in
<italic>Bacopa</italic> that alone or in concert with other phytochemical
constituents may be responsible for the ability of <italic>Bacopa</italic> to
inhibit neuroinflammation and positively affect CNS function.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Neuroinflammation is a complicated process involving both the peripheral circulation
and the CNS. Neuroinflammation is now thought to underlie many CNS disorders
including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and pain. In addition, both acute and
chronic stressors such as early-life adversity, psychosocial stress, infection, and
viruses appear to prime microglia toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype in susceptible
individuals. Subsequent inflammatory challenges then drive an exaggerated
neuroinflammatory response. Several pharmacologic inhibitors of pro-inflammatory
cytokines including TNF-α and IL-1β are now on the market and show good clinical
efficacy in terms of ameliorating neuroinflammatory processes. There are also a
number of mind/body and plant-based interventions including yoga, breathwork,
meditation, and herbs/spices that have also been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory
cytokines and have a positive impact on CNS dysfunction including depression,
anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, and pain. As we continue to elucidate the intricate
connections between the immune system and the nervous system, successful therapies
for reducing neuroinflammation will almost certainly involve an integrated approach
combining drug therapy with nonpharmacologic interventions.</p>
