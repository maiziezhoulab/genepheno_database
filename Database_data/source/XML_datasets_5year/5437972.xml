<abstract>
<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is currently defined as glucose intolerance that is of variable severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study, including 25 000 nondiabetic pregnant women in 15 centers across the world, reported that an average of 17.8% of pregnancies are affected by GDM and its frequency can be as high as 25.5% in some countries, based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria. Nevertheless, true global prevalence estimates of GDM are currently lacking due to the high level of heterogeneity in screening approaches, diagnostic criteria, and differences in the characteristics of the populations that were studied. The presence of systemic high blood glucose levels in pregnancy results in an adverse intrauterine environment, which has been shown to have a negative impact on short- and long-term health outcomes for both the mother and her offspring, including increased risks for the infant to develop obesity and for both mother and child to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life. Epigenetic mechanisms that are directly influenced by environmental factors, including nutrition, may play a key role in shaping these future health risks and may be part of this vicious cycle. This article reviews the burden of GDM and the current evidence that supports maternal nutritional interventions as a promising strategy to break the cycle by addressing risk factors associated with GDM.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent noncommunicable diseases worldwide, affecting over 370 million people and resulting in 4.8 million deaths annually.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B1"><sup>1</sup></xref> The current trend indicates that the age of onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is rapidly decreasing, with a growing proportion of young people becoming affected. Among women of reproductive age, an estimated 28 million have T2DM. Of great concern is the fact that the majority of these cases (80%) are concentrated in low- and middle-income countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B1"><sup>1</sup></xref></p>
<p>Pregnancy is associated with a certain degree of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in order to ensure appropriate nutrient supply to the fetus; however, in some women this progresses to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B2"><sup>2</sup></xref> According to the World Health Organization, hyperglycemia that is first detected during pregnancy is classified as GDM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B3"><sup>3</sup></xref> Systematically synthesized data on global prevalence estimates of GDM are lacking, particularly among developing countries. It is also challenging to directly compare the GDM burden across countries or regions, considering the high level of heterogeneity in screening approaches, diagnostic criteria, and differences in the characteristics of the populations that were studied. A recent review reports wide variations in the prevalence estimates of GDM, with prevalence as high as 25.1% in some countries, based on the new International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B4"><sup>4</sup></xref> Although a variety of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to an individual’s propensity for developing GDM, maternal obesity and nutritional deficiencies are key contributors, making GDM one of the most commonly encountered clinical complications of pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B5"><sup>5</sup></xref> It is becoming increasingly clear that GDM, like obesity and other metabolic diseases, is a result of suboptimal lifestyle and nutrition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B6"><sup>6</sup></xref> Not surprisingly, the proportion of GDM in a given population parallels that of T2DM. African women, Hispanic women, and some populations of Asian women are at greater risk of developing GDM compared to Caucasian women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B7"><sup>7–11</sup></xref></p>
<p>GDM not only has a tremendous impact on the health of the mother, it also has long-lasting consequences on the health of the child. Pregnant women with GDM and their unborn children have a higher risk of complications, including pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, miscarriage, macrosomia, and intrauterine growth retardation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Women with GDM are also at risk of postpartum complications, including the development of overt diabetes and GDM in subsequent pregnancies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B12"><sup>12</sup></xref> The effects on the children born to women with GDM are of utmost concern due to the increased risk of a range of short- and long-term morbidities. In the postnatal period and depending on the severity of the maternal hyperglycemia, these can range from high birth weight, serum C-peptide, and newborn percent body fat above the 90th percentile, neonatal hypoglycemia, macrosomia to shoulder dystocia and trauma during delivery, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory distress syndrome, hypocalcemia, polycythemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B13"><sup>13</sup></xref> In later childhood and adulthood, these individuals are at risk of T2DM, obesity, and metabolic syndrome,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B14"><sup>14</sup></xref> an observation that supports the tenets of the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis. The adverse intrauterine environment created by GDM is hypothesized to result in epigenetic changes that predispose the offspring to developing metabolic disease later in life. In turn, these traits are transmitted to the following generation, thereby perpetuating the vicious cycle of metabolic diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B15"><sup>15</sup></xref> A recent US study estimated that the economic burden associated with adult diabetes, gestational diabetes, and prediabetes exceeded $322 billion in 2012 (combining excess medical costs and reduced productivity).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B16"><sup>16</sup></xref> This national estimate is 48% higher than the $218 billion estimate for 2007.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B16"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B17"><sup>17</sup></xref> These findings underscore the importance of the economic burden of GDM, and in low- to middle-income countries where GDM is more prevalent, the burden is likely to be proportionally even higher.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of rising GDM prevalence and adverse outcomes for the following generations, nutritional interventions are moving to the forefront as effective strategies to address the lifestyle and dietary issues contributing to the development of GDM. This article reviews the burden of GDM and the current evidence that supports maternal nutritional interventions for reducing the risk of developing GDM, and thereby addressing related noncommunicable diseases such as obesity.</p>

<title>GESTATIONAL DIABETES DIAGNOSIS</title>
<p>Moderate levels of peripheral insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are normal occurrences during pregnancy and are accompanied by increasing levels of the hormones prolactin, lactogen, and estrogen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B18"><sup>18</sup></xref> These processes ensure a sufficient nutrient supply to the fetus and prevent low maternal blood glucose levels by counteracting the actions of insulin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B18"><sup>18</sup></xref> Insulin secretion increases early on in pregnancy, although insulin sensitivity may or may not change during this time. By mid-pregnancy, and until the end of the third trimester, insulin sensitivity begins to decline.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B2"><sup>2</sup></xref> A normal response by the maternal pancreatic islets is to augment insulin production. In GDM, the balance between the increased insulin resistance and maternal insulin production is disrupted, and the pancreas cannot meet the increased insulin requirements of pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B2"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
<p>Until recent international efforts to standardize diagnosis and screening of GDM,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B3"><sup>3</sup></xref> there was a complete lack of consensus that led to significant differences in the reported prevalence, which posed a challenge for the application of research findings obtained using different criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B15"><sup>15</sup></xref> Currently, the World Health Organization formally recognizes the criteria defined by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nuw033-T1">Table 1</xref>). Since the presence of only 1 of these criteria is sufficient to reach a diagnosis, the overall prevalence of GDM will increase significantly from the current estimates, if these criteria are applied.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B12"><sup>12</sup></xref><table-wrap id="nuw033-T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Most widely accepted diagnostic criteria for diabetes in pregnancy and GDM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B3"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B16"><sup>16</sup></xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Diagnosis</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="4">Diabetes (WHO)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Recorded at any time during the course of pregnancy; one or more of the following criteria:</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Fasting plasma glucose levels ≥7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2-h OGTT values ≥11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) after a 75 g oral glucose load</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Random plasma glucose levels ≥11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="4">GDM (WHO and IADPSG)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">When 1 or more of the following results are recorded during routine testing between 24 and 28 wks of pregnancy or at any other time during the course of pregnancy:</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Fasting plasma glucose levels 5.1–6.9 mmol/L (92–125 mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1-h OGTT values ≥10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) after a 75 g oral glucose load</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2-h OGTT values between 8.5 and 11.0 mmol/L (153–199 mg/dL) after a 75 g oral glucose load</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nuw033-TF1"><p><italic>Abbreviations</italic>: GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; IADPSG, International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; WHO, World Health Organization.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

<title>RISK FACTORS FOR GESTATIONAL DIABETES</title>
<p>There are several risk factors associated with developing GDM. A genetic component is likely to be involved, with some populations being more susceptible than others. There is evidence associating variants in several key genes with the pathogenesis of insulin resistance during pregnancy, including the adipokines,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B19"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B20"><sup>20</sup></xref> the prolactin receptor,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B21"><sup>21</sup></xref> and the melatonin receptor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B22"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B23"><sup>23</sup></xref> Not surprisingly, all of these genes are known to play a role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and metabolism. Polycystic ovarian syndrome, another medical condition that results in metabolic and hormonal dysfunction, also increases the risk of developing GDM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B24"><sup>24</sup></xref> Finally, the high concordance of T2DM in monozygotic twins and evidence from family studies further support the importance of genetic background in an individual's propensity for developing GDM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B25"><sup>25–28</sup></xref></p>
<p>However, several lines of evidence point to the complex and multifactorial nature of this health condition. First, there are no defining genetic factors that can be exemplified as the hallmark of GDM; thus, lifestyle factors in early pregnancy, including nutritional factors, are moving to the forefront as key forces that drive the pathogenesis of GDM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B29"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B30"><sup>30</sup></xref> Indeed, among the strongest risk factors is prepregnancy obesity (defined as body mass index [BMI] &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B28"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B31"><sup>31</sup></xref> Other risk factors are excessive gestational weight gain (GWG),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B32"><sup>32</sup></xref> advanced maternal age,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B33"><sup>33</sup></xref> and a previous pregnancy with GDM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B34"><sup>34</sup></xref> The presence of these factors can propel an individual toward developing GDM, particularly in the case of a genetic predisposition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B35"><sup>35–37</sup></xref> Not surprisingly, there is significant overlap between GDM and T2DM, in terms of risk factors (elevated BMI, family history, ethnic background),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B38"><sup>38</sup></xref> genetic variants,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B27"><sup>27</sup></xref> and pathogenesis (peripheral insulin resistance alongside pancreatic B-cell insufficiency).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B27"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B36"><sup>36</sup></xref> Women with GDM are also at high risk of developing T2DM after pregnancy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nuw033-T2">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that GDM is an environmental stressor in its own right and can drive the progression toward a diabetic state in some individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B39"><sup>39</sup></xref> Altogether, the striking connections between GDM and T2DM highlight the importance of the gestation period as a pivotal window of time that can tip the balance in favor of obesity and other noncommunicable diseases in the mother and the offspring.

<title>CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES FOR OFFSPRING</title>
<p>Although there is no evidence for increased congenital abnormalities in the offspring of women with GDM, poor glycemic control has been shown to increase the incidence of stillbirths.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B40"><sup>40</sup></xref> Women with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus are more likely to experience miscarriages compared to their healthy counterparts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B28"><sup>28</sup></xref> In response to high maternal glucose levels, the fetus increases insulin secretion. Due to the growth-promoting properties of insulin, a large proportion of these fetuses are macrosomic,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B41"><sup>41</sup></xref> or large for gestational age (LGA).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B13"><sup>13</sup></xref> Macrosomia, defined as a weight of more than 4 kg at birth or a weight above the 95th percentile for the gestational age, is the most frequently seen effect of GDM in neonates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B42"><sup>42</sup></xref> Due to their higher innate insulin levels, infants born to mothers with GDM frequently experience marked hypoglycemia after birth when they are no longer in a high-glucose environment, necessitating additional medical care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B43"><sup>43</sup></xref> Compared to the children of mothers without GDM, the offspring of women diagnosed with this condition have increased rates of cognitive and motor abnormalities, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning difficulties, and autism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B35"><sup>35</sup></xref></p>
<p>Among all the consequences of GDM, the most insidious effects are on the long-term health of the child.

<p>Currently, the key factor in the management of GDM is strict glycemic control, including frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels throughout the day.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B2"><sup>2</sup></xref> Target levels are 5.0–5.3 mmol/L or lower (90–95 mg/dL) for fasting glucose, 7.8 mmol/L or lower (140 mg/dL) 1 hour after a meal, or 6.7 or lower mmol/L (120 mg/dL) 2 hours after a meal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B2"><sup>2</sup></xref> Dietary control is normally the first line of treatment and generally involves limiting carbohydrate intake to between 35% and 45% of total calories, distributed in 3 small- to moderate-sized meals and 2–4 snacks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B55"><sup>55</sup></xref> If nutritional control is not successful in the first 2 weeks, pharmacotherapy is initiated. To date, many guidelines using blood glucose-lowering pharmacological therapy exist, and depending on the country, different oral hypoglycemic agents, specifically metformin or glyburide, and/or insulin and insulin analogs, are used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B56"><sup>56</sup></xref></p>
<p>Although the monitoring of glucose levels is essential in women with GDM, additional primary care interventions are needed that target the fundamental causes of GDM. Of note, weight loss is not recommended during pregnancy (even for obese women), underscoring the importance of addressing body weight and nutritional status before conception and between pregnancies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B57"><sup>57</sup></xref> In this sense, metformin has been used as a prevention strategy against pregnancy complications such as GDM, typically among women with specific conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, whereby a 10-fold reduction in GDM and a reduction in insulin resistance and insulin secretion were demonstrated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B58"><sup>58</sup></xref> However, among nondiabetic pregnant obese women, daily administration of 3 g of metformin from the first trimester until delivery did not result in a decrease in GDM incidence, although significant beneficial effects were observed on gestational weight gain and incidence of pre-eclampsia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B59"><sup>59</sup></xref> Positioning metformin as a prevention strategy could be challenging because studies have reported increased incidence of side effects as it can easily cross the placenta. Hence, it is important to understand its effect on fetal insulin sensitivity, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and long-term fetal programming.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B60"><sup>60</sup></xref> Given the key role played by nutrition in defining the long-term consequences of GDM on women and their offspring, nutrition appears to be the prime target for addressing prevention of GDM.</p>
<p>The current approaches in GDM prevention are focused on interventions such as diet, physical activity, or even a combined approach of dietary modification with lifestyle and behavioral changes. More recently, interventions using nutritional supplements incorporating bioactive agents with positive effects on insulin sensitivity, such as myo-inositol and probiotics, have shown promising results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B61"><sup>61</sup></xref> In addition, some micronutrients have been proposed as potentially modulating glucose tolerance in pregnancy. The results are from observational studies showing associations between low levels of specific micronutrients (e.g., vitamin D, iron, selenium) and glucose tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B62"><sup>62–65</sup></xref></p>
<p>Following is an overview of the efficacy and/or effectiveness of diet, physical activity, combined diet and physical activity, and nutrient-based interventions in the prevention of GDM and the impact on other key related pregnancy and infant outcomes based on recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nuw033-T3">Table 3</xref>). The maternal outcomes include: GWG, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (gestational hypertension and/or pre-eclampsia and/or eclampsia), and Caesarian section (C-section). The infant outcomes are: small for gestational age, LGA, macrosomia, birth weight, preterm birth, and neonatal hypoglycemia.

<title>Diet-based interventions, including dietary counseling</title>
<p>Various dietary interventions including diet counseling, low glycemic index (GI) diet, energy restriction diet (∼33% reduction in caloric intake), and low carbohydrate content diet (carbohydrate intake lower than 45% of energy) have been studied in relation to pregnancy and infant outcomes. Dietary counseling vs standard prenatal care was shown to reduce the risk for GDM and to significantly lower GWG; however, no benefits on any of the infant outcomes were reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B66"><sup>66</sup></xref> The interventions included in this systematic review were diverse, randomized control trials (RCTs), were of poor quality, and the inclusion criteria were heterogeneous. Dietary interventions specifically targeted at preventing excessive GWG or reducing pregnancy-related complications such as low-fat, low-carbohydrate, or low-energy diets, as well as dietary education about healthy eating and nutritional advice on how to stay within the GWG guidelines, significantly reduced GWG and the incidence of C-section. However, the results need to be interpreted with caution since no common standard was applied in these studies for the calculations of GWG.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B67"><sup>67</sup></xref> Comparisons for efficacy have also been performed for low-moderate GI vs high-moderate GI diets, low-GI vs high-fiber moderate-GI diets, energy-restricted vs no energy restriction diets, low- vs high-carbohydrate diets, high-monounsaturated fats vs high-carbohydrate diets, and diets with 20 gram fiber per day vs 80 gram fiber per day among pregnant women with GDM or pre-existing diabetes mellitus, but not among women who were healthy or at risk of GDM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B68"><sup>68</sup></xref> None of these diets showed any beneficial effect on either pregnancy or infant outcomes, and it is impossible to recommend any particular types of dietary advice that would be most suitable for women with GDM considering that data were only available from single studies, thereby limiting the possibility to make any reliable conclusions for comparing the efficacy or effectiveness of different dietary interventions. A striking example is the recommendation of carbohydrate restriction (40% of calories) to blunt postprandial glucose excursions, whereby, women are substituting fat for carbohydrates. But there is an increasing recognition that replacing dietary carbohydrates with fat may be detrimental to maternal insulin resistance and may result in excess fetal fat accretion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B60"><sup>60</sup></xref> A study of the CHOICE diet, which is rather high in carbohydrates (60% complex carbohydrates and 25% fat), found that it was able to maintain a 24-hour glucose area under the curve well below targets. The postprandial free fatty acids were 20% lower compared to the conventional low-carbohydrate/higher-fat diet (40% carbohydrates and 45% fat). Such a diet strategy may have important implications for preventing infant complications such as macrosomia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B69"><sup>69</sup></xref>; however, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p>

In addition, 1 of the biggest challenges in any physical activity intervention is identifying and addressing barriers that may reduce adherence.</p>

<title>Combined diet and physical activity-based interventions</title>
<p>The combination of diet- and lifestyle-based interventions appears to show a consistent reduction in GWG, although the effect estimates varied widely, with some meta-analyses showing small differences between the intervention and control groups,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B74"><sup>74</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B75"><sup>75</sup></xref> others reporting a larger difference of 2.2 kg between the intervention and control groups,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B66"><sup>66</sup></xref> and yet others showing a reduction in risk for excessive GWG of approximately 20%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B76"><sup>76</sup></xref> Such differences may be partly due to differences in the trials included, variations in the quality of the trials, characteristics of the interventions, populations assessed, reporting of outcomes, and outcome definitions. A combination of dietary and physical activity interventions was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia by 26% and the risk of having an LGA baby by 27% among healthy pregnant women or those who were overweight or obese compared to normal-weight women receiving standard care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B74"><sup>74</sup></xref> A Cochrane systematic review also showed that any type of dietary advice (standard or individualized) with metabolic monitoring reduced the risk of macrosomia by 62% and LGA by 63% compared to standard antenatal care among pregnant women with hyperglycemia who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for GDM and T2DM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B77"><sup>77</sup></xref> However, the result of this review was only based on 4 small RCTs with moderate to high risk of bias.

<title>Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids</title>

<title>Other micronutrients</title>
<p>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 observational studies found a positive correlation between ferritin levels and GDM (relative risk = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.17–2.00).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B88"><sup>88</sup></xref> The elevated ferritin may reflect elevated body iron stores, but it could also be due to inflammation as ferritin is an acute-phase reactant. Considering this, the study concluded that the results did not constitute definitive proof that dietary total iron or serum transferrin levels are related to GDM and that more research needs to be done. Another recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 6 studies comparing the levels of selenium in pregnant women with and without GDM revealed that serum selenium concentrations were lower in women with GDM (Hedges, −1.34; 95% CI: −2.33, −0.36) and in women showing subclinical levels of glucose intolerance (Hedges, −0.85; 95% CI: −1.18, −0.52).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B89"><sup>89</sup></xref> Due to the limitations of observational studies, it is still unclear whether reduced serum selenium levels are a risk factor for GDM and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

<p>Although the evidence is still limited and based mainly on 3 small trials conducted in healthy women at high risk of developing GDM, a daily dose of 2 gram myo-inositol twice per day has been shown to reduce the risk of developing GDM by approximately 60%–70% and to have a positive effect on birth weight.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B61"><sup>61</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B91"><sup>91</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B92"><sup>92</sup></xref> Most maternal and neonatal outcomes included in this review were not reported in the systematic reviews and meta-analyses available to date. One additional study in overweight (BMI, ≥25 and &lt;30) pregnant women in Italy has been recently published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B93"><sup>93</sup></xref> that shows a 67% risk reduction of GDM, which is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nuw033-T3">Table 3</xref>). Additional evidence should be generated in larger trials in diverse settings, including participants of different ethnicities and varying risk factors, to confirm these promising results.</p>

<title>Probiotics</title>
<p>The clinical trial consistently reported in the cited reviews (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nuw033-T3">Table 3</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B61"><sup>61</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B94"><sup>94</sup></xref> was conducted in Finland and used a double-blind design from the first trimester to the end of exclusive breastfeeding in which 2 intervention groups were compared: 1 received intensive dietary counseling promoting a healthy diet and another received the same dietary advice plus daily administration of <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG and <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> Bb12 (dosed at 10<sup>10</sup> colony-forming units each).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B95"><sup>95–97</sup></xref> The combination of dietary advice with the probiotic intervention reduced the rate of GDM, while dietary counseling alone had no effect compared with no intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B97"><sup>97</sup></xref> The risk of larger birth size in participants with GDM who received the combination therapy was also reduced.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B96"><sup>96</sup></xref> Although this study used a different criterion for GDM diagnosis compared to most others, blood glucose concentrations were also significantly reduced in the probiotics-supplemented group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B96"><sup>96</sup></xref> Interestingly, the beneficial effect of probiotics appeared to extend beyond the risk of developing GDM, with the group receiving them also demonstrating reduced maternal central adiposity 6 months after delivery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B95"><sup>95</sup></xref> and lower blood glucose concentrations 12 months after delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B97"><sup>97</sup></xref> These data suggest that this probiotic intervention independently modulates the maternal metabolic state when the diet is well balanced. More recently, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B98"><sup>98</sup></xref> assessed the impact of a different probiotic, <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> UCC118, in obese pregnant women. In this study, 138 women were examined between weeks 24 and 28 of gestation with fasting glucose as the main outcome and GDM as the secondary outcome after 4 weeks of intervention. The study did not identify a benefit with regard to the maternal fasting glucose level, the metabolic profile, or pregnancy outcomes among obese women. These discrepancies could be related to differences in the length of the 2 study interventions, the probiotic strains used, or the specificity of the probiotic effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B99"><sup>99</sup></xref> Regarding the role of probiotics in glucose tolerance modulation, probiotics have been proposed to act through 1 or more of the following mechanisms: (1) balancing the properties of gut microbiota, (2) normalizing increased intestinal permeability; and (3) controlling systemic and local low-grade inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B100"><sup>100</sup></xref> More insight is expected when the results of 3 additional ongoing trials are published.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B94"><sup>94</sup></xref></p>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>The power of nutrition to influence health from one generation to the next is a fundamental concept that has transformed our understanding of health and disease. The health legacy of an individual is predetermined by a series of factors that occur long before birth and during the earliest days of life. The growing prevalence of GDM, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, is of great concern, especially with respect to its impact on the health of the next generation, the cost burden on health systems, and the loss of societal productivity. Maintaining a healthy prepregnancy body composition, diet, and lifestyle is the most effective solution in many settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nuw033-B6"><sup>6</sup></xref> Considering that there is a high level of controversy with regards to the dietary prevention of GDM, it is imperative to carefully design and conduct RCTs that are sufficiently powered to better elucidate the optimum diet that could help control glycemia, reduce pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia, and improve neonatal and infant outcomes such as by reducing risk for LGA or macrosomia.</p>
<p>Although physical activity programs appear to be an effective and safe strategy to prevent excessive GWG and to reduce the risk of GDM, well-designed trials with sufficient power to demonstrate clear effects on both short- and long-term outcomes in pregnant women and their offspring should be conducted. These are needed because of the limitations of previous studies with regard to the types and intensities of the exercise utilized. In addition, novel strategies to improve adherence should be explored, such as the use of technology-assisted lifestyle interventions that are practical, interactive, and easily integrated in day-to-day practice. The great effort required to deliver complex interventions based on diet, or diet and physical activity, make nutritional supplements based on micronutrients and simple bioactives such as probiotics and myo-inositol a potentially convenient and cost-effective complement, or even an alternative. Nevertheless, in order to provide better recommendations and incorporate nutritional interventions as part of the clinical practice, there is a need to evaluate nutritional supplements’ effectiveness by performing large randomized intervention trials involving a range of healthy women with and without the major known risk factors, such as overweight/obesity, family risk of diabetes, and advanced age. Understanding the potential benefits of combining specific nutritional supplements, as well as dietary and lifestyle advice, and identifying receptive subpopulations represent a great opportunity to develop strategies that aim to break the cycle and abate the burden of metabolic disease by reducing the risk of GDM in populations.</p>
