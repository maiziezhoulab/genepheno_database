<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bisphenol A (BPA), a high production volume chemical widely used in consumer products, is
an endocrine active compound associated with complex epigenetic responses in animal models
and humans. Developmental BPA exposure in mice previously revealed widespread changes in
the mouse liver methylome. Here, we undertake the first epigenome-wide analysis of the
effect of BPA concentration on human fetal liver DNA methylation. Enzymatic enrichment of
genomic DNA for high CG density and methylation followed by next-generation sequencing
yielded data for positional methylation across the genome. Comparing three groups of
BPA-exposed subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 18; 6 per group), high (35.44–96.76 ng/g), low
(3.50 to 5.79 ng/g), and non-detect (&lt;0.83 ng/g), revealed regions of altered
methylation. Similar numbers of regions of altered methylations were detected in pairwise
comparisons; however, their genomic locations were distinct between the non-detect and low
or high BPA groups. In general, BPA levels were positively associated with methylation in
CpG islands and negatively associated with methylation in CpG shores, shelves, and
repetitive regions. DNA methylation at the <italic>SNORD</italic> imprinted cluster
(15q11q13) illustrated both linear and non-monotonic associations with BPA levels.
Integrated methylation and RNA-sequencing gene expression analysis revealed differential
regulation of transcription at low BPA levels, as well as expression changes in RNA for
ligand-binding proteins as BPA levels increase. BPA levels in human fetal liver tissue are
associated with complex linear and non-monotonic as well as sequence-dependent alterations
in DNA methylation. Future longitudinal studies are needed to link these changes with
altered health risks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Environmental exposures during fetal growth can influence later-in-life health risks,
including metabolic and phenotypic outcomes. The developmental origins of health and disease
hypothesis posits that chemical and/or nutritional factors during early life result in
lasting effects on disease risk, even in the absence of chronic exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B2">2</xref>].
Growing evidence supports epigenetic inheritance of chromatin marks, such as DNA
methylation, as a mechanistic link between fetal exposure and later susceptibility to
disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B4">4</xref>]. Adult phenotypic variation deriving from uneven
re-establishment of DNA methylation during blastocyst formation is seen across the animal
kingdom and can be correlated with environment in the form of stress, chemical exposures,
nutrition, maternal behavior, and stochastic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B5">5</xref>]. Next-generation sequencing enables us to move beyond candidate-gene-based
approaches by expanding coverage and sensitivity to detect previously unknown labile regions
of the genome that are responsive to early life toxicant exposure. Here, we evaluate
bisphenol A (BPA) levels and the DNA methylome in human fetal liver, as an extension of our
previously published controlled BPA exposure in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B6">6</xref>], to uncover BPA’s association with the developing human epigenome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). </p>

<p>BPA entered commercial production in the 1950s, and by 2008, it had reached global
production of 11.5 billion pounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B7">7</xref>], making
it one of the highest volume production chemicals in the world. It is used in the
manufacture of clear plastics, bottles, can liners, eyeglass lenses, cell phones, thermal
receipt paper, and adhesives, among many other products. The safety of BPA has been the
subject of long-standing scientific and public debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B8">8</xref>]. A large proportion of the population has detectible levels of BPA in urine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B9">9</xref>]. Consumption of canned soup results in
&gt;1000% increase in urine BPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B10">10</xref>] and
dermal exposure to receipt paper can increase urine concentration from a baseline of 1.8 to
5.8 μg/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B11">11</xref>]. BPA levels in urine have been
correlated with obesity in Caucasian children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B12">12</xref>]. Pregnant women in southeast Michigan were determined to have between 0.5 μg/l
and 22.3 μg/l BPA in circulating blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B13">13</xref>],
and our recent study of human fetal livers indicated that most BPA is in the unconjugated
form not readily eliminated from the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B14">14</xref>]. These findings strengthen the case that early life development is a
particularly crucial window to evaluate BPA’s effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>Our studies and others have found that developmental exposure to BPA is associated with
epigenetic changes in specific tissues at specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B15">15–20</xref>] and
results in genome-wide changes in liver in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B21">21</xref>]. In a cross-sectional study
of Egyptian girls, we identified BPA-associated DNA methylation alterations in saliva. Until
now, there has been no genome-wide studies of altered epigenetic changes associated with
fetal BPA exposure in human tissue. By combining enzymatic methods to enrich genomic DNA for
high methylation and high GC content prior to next-generation sequencing, we identified
regions of altered methylation (RAMs) between groups of fetal human livers, stratified
according to quantified BPA levels. We validated selected top-hit genes to confirm DNA
methylation differences and used RNA sequencing to show differential regulation of
transcription at low levels of BPA, as well as expression changes in ligand-binding proteins
as BPA levels increase. Thus, BPA levels in human fetal liver tissue were associated with
complex and sequence-dependent alterations in DNA methylation, as well as by differentially
regulating transcription.</p>

<sec>
<title>Analysis Pipeline and Quality Control for Identifying Differential
Methylation</title>
<p>We used the MethylPlex-next-generation sequencing (M-NGS) platform to evaluate
genome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with various levels of BPA quantified in
human fetal liver samples. This methodology requires minimal DNA input (∼50 ng) and
enriches methylated DNA using a cocktail of methylation-dependent restriction enzymes
prior to next-generation sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F1">Fig. 1</xref>).
We confirmed that MethylPlex library reads were enriched in genomic regions containing
higher numbers of genes and CpG islands (CGIs). To estimate the false discovery rate (FDR)
of the data analysis pipeline (see Methods for details), we employed a sex-based analysis
comparing methylation profiles between female and male subjects. Under the conservative
assumption that all autosomal regions that pass our filters for significance are false
positives, the FDR was estimated to be 11.4% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1A</xref>); however, the actual FDR may be lower, to the
extent that true autosomal differences in methylation exist between sexes. The difference
in mapped reads on chromosomes X and Y was clearly distinguishable between male and female
subjects with minimal background noise observed on chromosome Y from female subjects,
confirming the noted sex of each sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1B</xref>).</p>

<sec>
<title>BPA-Associated RAMs</title>
<p>We identified BPA-associated RAMs using a moving window approach, the
<italic>edgeR</italic> Bioconductor package, and post-processing filtering steps, across
three BPA categories (non-detect vs. low, non-detect vs. high, and low vs. high), and
conducted a refined downstream analysis. As part of data exploration, overall across
autosomal chromosomes, we observed a greater number of hypomethylated RAMs with increasing
BPA levels, when non-detect subjects were compared with either low or high BPA subjects
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F2">Fig. 2</xref>A<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F2"> and B</xref>). In contrast, when comparing low BPA to high BPA subjects, approximately
similar numbers of genomic regions were identified as hyper- and hypo-methylated with
increasing BPA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F2">Fig. 2</xref>C). Chromosome
level window counts were not tested for significance. </p>

</fig>
<p>Comparing low BPA subjects with high BPA subjects resulted in the largest number of
100 bp windows with RAMs (11 194). When subjects with non-detectable levels of BPA were
compared with those with low and high levels of BPA, similar numbers of 100 bp windows
with RAMs were identified (6286 and 7337, respectively), yet these regions were highly
mutually exclusive with only 634 windows overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F3">Fig. 3</xref>A). A majority of RAMs (19 522 out of a total 24 817 windows) were
distinct from one another, suggesting locus-specific and non-monotonic effects of DNA
methylation patterns. To identify genic regions associated with RAMs, each candidate
100 bp window was mapped to the nearest gene. In total, 10 005 RAMs were identified within
5 kb of a TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F3">Fig. 3</xref>B). A total of 296 RAMs
were shared across all three comparisons. In contrast to the superset of all RAMs, the
TSS-associated RAMs showed greater overlap. </p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="dvv006f3p"></graphic>
</fig>
<p>We also examined the DNA methylation landscape of RAMs around CGIs, CGI shores (0–2 kb
from a CGI), and CGI shelves (2–4 kb from a CGI) among the three BPA groups (non-detect,
low, and high). We observed a trend of increased methylation in CGIs and decreased
methylation in CGI shores and shelves with increasing BPA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These trends did not reach statistical significance. </p>

</fig>
<p>In addition, we examined the genomic distribution of RAMs relative to various genomic
regions: promoters, or exons, introns, and intergenic regions, or repeat elements. The
overview of the statistics of genomic regions overlapping with RAMs is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. In all three
comparison pairs, there were more hypermethylated than hypomethylated regions in the
higher dose group in transcriptional start regions (TSRs), exons, and promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F5">Fig. 5</xref>A). A similar pattern is observed in genomic
areas including gene locus, defined as the entirety of the gene transcript, as well as for
introns alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F5">Fig. 5</xref>B). However, the reverse
pattern is observed in intergenic regions; there were more intergenic hypomethylated
regions than hypermethylated in higher dose groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F5">Fig. 5</xref>B). In the non-detect vs. low comparison, around 40.4 of hypo- and 43.2%
of hypermethylated regions overlapped with repetitive regions. In both non-detect vs. high
and low vs. high comparisons, we observed a striking increase in the percentage of RAMs in
repetitive regions among hypomethylated regions in the higher dose group (73.5 and 72.2%,
respectively), while the percentage of hypermethylated RAMs in repetitive regions remained
similar, at 45.2 and 49.6%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F5">Fig.
5</xref>B). </p>

<title>Validation of RAMs</title>
<p>To investigate the correlation of BPA level with imprinted gene DNA methylation, we
closely examined the snoRNA cluster surrounding <italic>SNORD116</italic>, which is a
maternally imprinted locus implicated in Prader–Willi syndrome. In MethylPlex sequencing,
<italic>SNORD116</italic> was hypomethylated in the non-detect group and hypermethylated
in both the low and high BPA groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F6">Fig. 6</xref>).
Validation via pyrosequencing of four CpG sites in the original samples showed linear
increased methylation between non-detect and low sample groups
(<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.1) but also detected a non-monotonic response with the average
of the low BPA showing higher methylation than the high BPA group
(<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). </p>

<p>A top hit intergenic locus, located on chromosome 7:152888851–152888950, was selected for
quantitative DNA methylation validation via EpiTYPER analysis. MethylPlex sequencing
resulted in a <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 1.5 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>10</sup>
(FDR &lt; 4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>5</sup>) between the low BPA and high BPA groups with
the high BPA group displaying less methylation. This pattern was validated by quantitative
bisulfite sequencing verifying the non- monotonic DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

<sec>
<title>RNA-Seq for Differential Expression</title>
<p>Using RNA-seq, we identified seven, one, and three differentially expressed genes in
fetal liver for non-detect vs. low, non-detect vs. high, and low vs. high, respectively,
using an FDR &lt; 0.10 and 2-fold cutoffs. Although these numbers were small, several high
ranked genes were noted to be involved in estrogen processes, e.g. <italic>AHR</italic>
[<italic>P</italic> = 0.012 (non-detect vs. low) and <italic>P</italic> = 0.0046
(non-detect vs. high)], <italic>PGR</italic> (<italic>P</italic> value = 0.020),
<italic>GPER</italic> (<italic>P</italic> value = 0.025), and <italic>PRL</italic>
(<italic>P</italic> = 0.046). Several genes had known BPA-related interactions, e.g.
genes in the Wnt signaling pathway were significantly enriched (<italic>WNT2</italic>,
<italic>WNT5a</italic>, <italic>WNT7A</italic>, and <italic>WNT11</italic>). Genes
related to pregnancy or placental development were also found (<italic>CGA</italic>,
<italic>CSH1</italic>, <italic>CSH2</italic>, <italic>INSL4</italic>,
<italic>FLT1</italic>, <italic>ADAM12</italic>, <italic>PSG4</italic>, and

<title>Pathway Enrichment Analysis</title>
<p>We performed pathway enrichment analysis with hyper and hypo-methylated RAMs using
ChIP-Enrich (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chip-enrich.med.umich.edu">http://chip-enrich.med.umich.edu</ext-link>), which assigns peaks to genes based on a
chosen method (we used nearest transcription start site, TSS) and tests peaks from
ChIP-seq experiments for enrichment of biological pathways, GO terms, and other types of
gene sets. Pathway analysis found a strong enrichment of genes involved in metabolism in
the low versus high comparison, including regulation of nucleotide metabolic process
(<italic>q</italic> value = 0.023), which was enriched among hypermethylated regions,
and regulation of metabolic process (<italic>q</italic> value = 0.017), which was enriched
among the hypomethylated regions. Genes predicted to be targeted by the aryl-hydrocarbon
nuclear receptor translocator were also significantly enriched with hypermethylated
regions (<italic>q</italic> value = 0.0098). Among the genes regulated by this
transcription factor is the Wilms tumor gene (<italic>WT1</italic>), an imprinted locus.
The most consistent enrichment observed across comparisons and both hypo- and
hyper-methylation was sets of genes down-regulated in response to estrogen. These gene
sets were derived from GEO experiments GSE11324 (3, 6, and 12 h of estrogen treatment),
GSE11791, and GSE10879, and all were performed using MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). In
particular, breast carcinoma amplified sequence 4 and breast cancer anti-estrogen
resistance 3, both involved in the growth and maintenance of breast cancers. In addition,
an enrichment analysis based on transcriptomic data from RNA-seq was performed using a
logistic regression-based pathway enrichment analysis tool (LRpath) available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lrpath.ncibi.org">http://lrpath.ncibi.org</ext-link>. When enriched
concepts among hypomethylated regions and over-expressed genes were compared, the
metabolic and catabolic processes as well as cell cycle were significantly enriched in
both analyses (<italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Integrative Analysis of DNA Methylation and Gene Expression</title>
<p>From the RNA-seq data, we identified 273 (non-detect vs. low), 430 (non-detect vs. high),
and 484 (low vs. high) candidate genes, whose expression levels are inversely correlated
with methylation levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary
File S1</xref>). When the top enriched biological functions were compared across the
three exposure comparison pairs, there were overlapping categories of enrichment shared
between the non-detect vs. low and non-detect vs. high groups: across all three
comparisons, calcium ion binding genes were enriched
(<italic>P</italic> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>4</sup>). Genes in this category
included several protocadherins, which are expressed in nervous tissue and includes
protocadherin19 which, when mutated, results in an epileptic phenotype in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B22">22</xref>]. The shared categories between the
non-detect vs. high and the low vs. high comparisons included ligand-binding functions,
specifically calcium and sulfur compound binding functions
(<italic>P</italic> &lt; 4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>4</sup>). Several genes in the sulfur
compound binding function have also been shown to interact with BPA according to the
Comparative Toxicogenomics Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B23">23</xref>],
including lactotransferrin, chemokine ligand 10, follistatin, glypican 4, r-spondin 1, and
acyl-coa binding domain containing 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B24">24</xref>].
Non-detect vs. low or high compared with the low vs. high groups shared only the calcium

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adaptations of next-generation sequencing to assess DNA methylation and chromatin states
are still rapidly evolving, with a variety of currently available approaches. In this study,
genomic DNA from BPA-characterized human fetal liver tissue was enriched for methylated
regions and high CG density, giving a proxy for differential DNA methylation via regional
read-counts. We previously used this approach to show that the mouse liver epigenome
responds to BPA exposure at comparable levels found in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B6">6</xref>]. Our bioinformatics analysis pipeline has been used in mouse
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B6">6</xref>] and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B25">25</xref>] studies and is validated here by both RNA-seq and quantitative
bisulfite sequencing via EpiTyper and pyrosequencing methylation analysis in selected loci.
In contrast to the mouse, we find large shifts in RAMs at CGIs. We identified an asymmetric
difference in hypo vs. hypermethylated loci in the two exposure groups compared with the
non-detect group, while finding similar numbers when comparing low versus high BPA groups.
This suggests that BPA exposure biases genes towards hypomethylation in general, as we have
previously seen in saliva DNA from a cohort of prepubescent girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B26">26</xref>] and in mouse tail DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B16">16</xref>]. However, the total number of regions with altered methylation was largest
between low and high exposure groups, suggesting that there is a dose-dependent effect.
Though our analysis found RAMs between groups to be largely distinct, enrichment analyses
pointed to overlapping sets of affected pathways; future studies should be conducted with
more granular exposure groups and larger sample sizes to confirm whether the number of genes
shifting in methylation concomitant with BPA exposure is nonlinear with dose.</p>
<p>Growing interest in DNA methylation centers on CGI shores and shelves; e.g. in cancers,
CGIs have been observed to become hypermethylated, while the surrounding regions tend to
become hypomethylated, with an overall loss of signal distinguishing CGIs from their shores
and shelves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B27">27</xref>]. We add to this data by
showing increasing CGI methylation with BPA exposure and decreasing methylation in shores
and shelves with BPA. These general results cannot indicate whether a specific locus will
have altered expression but would be consistent with reduced expression. Overall, we
observed hypomethylation averaged across genic regions; such patterns are also seen in aging
cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B28">28</xref>]. Similarly, long-term
epigenetic drift can be impacted by early life exposures and also acts in a locus specific
manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B29">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Consistent with the CGI results, RAM location analysis showed higher methylation with
higher BPA exposure in the areas most relevant to gene expression: the promoters and TSRs.
By raw read count, the highest enrichment by fold-increase of RAMs between all intergroup
comparisons (when compared with the genome) occurs in promoter regions; however, the global
response of BPA is hypomethylation. The RAM analysis narrows down the location of where the
bulk of this hypomethylation is occurring. We observed a decrease in repeat region reads in
the high BPA group compared with the non-detect group. Hypomethylation in LINE1 repeat
regions with occupational BPA exposure has been documented previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B30">30</xref>]. There was only a small decrease in comparing the low BPA to
the non-detect group, but the low vs. high group mirrored the non-detect vs. high group.
Given the growing concern over transposon methylation and the importance of silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B31">31</xref>], BPA's activity in these genomic regions must
be carefully examined in depth.</p>
<p>Imprinted genes are an important bellwether of environmentally induced epigenetic change
and the SNORD cluster identified here reflects BPA's complex effects. Mouse studies have
demonstrated the effect of BPA on imprinted gene methylation through the estrogen receptor
signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B32">32</xref>] and on imprinted gene
expression in embryos and placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B33">33</xref>]. Even
low levels of neonatal BPA exposure (2.4 μg/pup) in rats cause persistent hypomethylation in
imprinted regions in adult male spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B34">34</xref>]. Here, despite the SNORD cluster's relatively small size and contiguous
maternal imprint, <italic>SNRPN</italic> and adjacent imprinted genes exhibited both linear
and non-monotonic responses to BPA exposure. The difference between the MethylPlex and
pyrosequencing may be explained by their different regions of assessment: MethylPlex
assessed the average of the region, while pyrosequencing probed four specific CpG sites.
Interestingly, recent examination of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in paternal sperm
of autism risk children identified differentially methylated genes involved in developmental
processes, including many genes in the SNORD family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Pathway analysis was utilized to help understand the likely biological impact of the RAMs,
supporting the known estrogenic role of BPA by correlating RAMs with estrogen stimulus
response genes. In all comparisons of altered methylation, estrogen responding gene
categories were statistically significantly enriched, suggesting that this class of genes is
both up- and down-regulated by BPA exposure. Genes targeted by aryl-hydrocarbon nuclear
receptor translocator—AHR complex were hypermethylated in low vs. high BPA, which is
unsurprising given that BPA is an aryl-hydrocarbon receptor ligand. The RNA-seq GO results
taken alone are less clear; however, since methylation does not correspond perfectly to gene
expression, integrating the two datasets provides greater insight. Another potential impact
may be seen in the detection of pregnancy and placenta-related genes in the RNA-seq GO
results, suggesting that differential timing of fetal development may account for the
enrichment of these categories across exposure groups. Thus, by integrating the results of
methylation data with the RNA-seq data and analyzing GO term enrichment, we found several
categories of biological function overlapping between the pairwise comparisons of the
non-detect vs. low and non-detect vs. high, especially those relating to gene transcription,
suggesting that BPA exposure at both levels has wide-ranging effects on gene expression. In
contrast, the genes enriched in the low vs. high group are involved primarily in ligand
binding. The only exception to this was in the calcium binding category. Importantly, given
the sample source, our low and high groups both represent physiologically relevant
concentrations; thus, these results promote the need to examine low-dose BPA exposures in
animal studies where the dose ranges may exhibit large gaps, potentially failing to detect
discrete but relevant changes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these results begin to reveal the complexity of BPA's response in human fetal
liver at both the DNA methylation and the transcription level. While the global response to
BPA exposure is hypomethylation in general, especially in repeats, the CGI hypermethylation
effects appear to be both dose and locus dependent. Thus, BPA levels in human fetal liver
tissue are associated with complex linear and non-monotonic as well as sequence-dependent
alterations in DNA methylation. Furthermore, although the RNA-seq results represent a
functional outcome specific to developmental stage (e.g. gestational age) and tissue, the
DNA methylation changes may persist across developmental stages and tissues, with only a
small subset of the RAMs having a functional consequence for any one time-tissue
combination. These limitations can be addressed by future pregnancy studies with larger
sample sizes and/or longitudinal studies to link changes in DNA methylation or gene
expression with altered health risks and to evaluate target tissue DNA methylation profiles
with surrogate DNA, such as saliva or blood, to best inform studies of epigenetic
epidemiology, when target tissue DNA is not always readily or ethically available.</p>

<title>Human Fetal Liver Tissue Samples</title>
<p>Human fetal liver samples (<italic>n</italic> = 50), ranging from gestational days 70 to
120, were procured from the NIH-funded University of Washington Birth Defects Research
Laboratory Fetal Biobank (2R24 HD000836-47). As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B36">36</xref>], these healthy tissue
specimens were collected from voluntary pregnancy terminations after surgery and proper
consent from donors and were flash frozen and stored in polycarbonate-free tubing at −80°C
until processed for BPA analysis and RNA/DNA extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F1">Fig. 1</xref>, top box). No identifying clinical data were available on
subjects except for gestational age and occasionally sex and race. Thus, samples met the
criteria for IRB exemption for human subjects research (UM IRB Exemption: HUM00024929). As
described previously, sex was determined from subjects with missing data
(<italic>N</italic> = 10) using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays specific
for the Y-chromosome <italic>SRY</italic> and the X-chromosome <italic>ATL1</italic> genes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Total (free plus conjugated) BPA concentrations were measured via high-performance liquid
chromatography coupled with an API 2000 electrospray triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer
(ESI-MS/MS) by the Kannan Laboratory at the Wadsworth Center (New York State Department of
Health) in 0.5 g of <italic>n</italic> = 50 human fetal liver tissue samples and ranged
from below the limit of quantification of 0.1 up to 96.8 ng/g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B14">14</xref>]. From the
wide range of total BPA concentrations quantified in the fetal liver samples, we
trichotomized 18 samples with gestational ages ranging from 80 to 115 into non-detect
(total BPA concentrations ranging from non-detect to 0.83 ng/g; mean gestational age: 96.2
days), low- (3.5 to 5.79 ng/g; mean gestational age: 105.8 days), and high-BPA (35.44 to
96.76 ng/g; mean gestational age: 103.3 days) exposure groups (<italic>n</italic> = 6
samples per group). The <italic>n</italic> = 18 samples for this analysis were selected
from the available set (<italic>n</italic> = 50) based on high DNA and RNA quality, as
well as age and gender match per exposure group. Thus, no significant exposure group
differences by gestational age were present.</p>

<title>M-NGS Library Generation</title>
<p>A MethylPlex library synthesis and GC-enrichment kit (Rubicon Genomics Inc., Ann Arbor,
MI) was obtained, and the experiments were carried out according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F1">Fig. 1</xref>, second box). Methylplex
enzymatic enrichment in combination with next-generation sequencing (M-NGS) is capable of
identifying RAMs. The method used here was previously described for both human and mouse
in Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B25">25</xref>]. Briefly, a patented cocktail of methylation-sensitive
restriction enzymes were used with 50 ng of DNA prior to ligation to universal PCR primer
and amplification to create a Methylplex library. A second step enzymatic treatment
depleted most non-GC-rich DNA sequences, after which, DNA was re-amplified in a second
round of PCR. The adaptor sequences were removed and the product purified prior to
incorporation into the Illumina Hi-Seq sequencing platform at the end-repair step of the
sample preparation kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Illumina Inc., San Diego,
CA). After ligation to Illumina adaptors, the product was run out on a 2% agarose gel with
the DNA excised and extracted at the 400 bp position using Qiagen gel extraction kit
(Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA).</p>

<title>M-NGS Sequencing and Alignment</title>
<p>The purified MethylPlex library was analyzed by Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, San
Diego, CA) prior to flow cell generation, where 10 nM of library was used to prepare
flowcells with approximately 30 000 clusters per lane. Sequencing was performed by the
University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core on an Illumina HiSeq, and the raw sequencing
image data using 100 cycles of single ends were analyzed by the Illumina analysis pipeline
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F1">Fig. 1</xref>, middle box). An average of 104
million reads per sample (ranging from 78 to 125 million reads) were obtained, where
approximately 83.9% of these were mapped uniquely to the human hg19 reference genome using
the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner tool (BWA version 0.5.9-r16, parameters: aln -q 6 -t 6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eep.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/eep/dvv006/-/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>).</p>

<sec>
<title>Differential Methylation Analysis</title>
<p>We applied our tiered-based profiling pipeline developed for mouse BPA exposure studies
to identify human locus-specific RAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dvv006-F1">Fig. 1</xref>,
bottom two boxes), which is described in detail in Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B6">6</xref>]. Briefly, we scanned the entire genome using a window size of
100 bp with a 50 bp moving shift size, which accounts for over 61 million windows for each
sample and obtained the number of mapped reads per 100 bp window per sample. Genomic
regions were then filtered to those with at least three samples having a read count
greater than 20. The resulting 1.34 million regions were then tested for differential
methylation using the <italic>edgeR</italic> Bioconductor package, which we used to test
for differences between each pair of exposure groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B37">37</xref>]. The edgeR analysis was run using the glmFit function with
tagwise dispersion estimation, which uses a negative binomial model with moderated
dispersion estimates, and identified the regions with differential methylation in three
different comparisons; the methylation levels from the non-detect group
(<italic>n</italic> = 6) against the low exposure group (<italic>n</italic> = 6),
non-detect group against high exposure group (<italic>n</italic> = 6), and low exposure
group against high exposure group. To minimize the sample-specific methylation variation
affecting the results, and because edgeR is sensitive to outliers, we further analyzed the
data with filtered RAMs that (i) exhibited methylation change in at least half of the
samples per exposure group and (ii) displayed differential methylation either in at least
one out of two flanking windows (shift window size is 50 bp) or two 100-bp windows within
a 500 bp stretch.</p>
<p>We used the X and Y chromosomes to confirm the sex of each sample and to estimate the
overall FDR resulting from using the filtering steps described above. Using the
methylation reads mapped to chromosome X and Y, the sex of each human fetal sample (8
males vs. 10 females) was re-confirmed, and the underlying methylation difference among
male and female subjects was examined and easily visually distinguished. The above
<italic>edgeR</italic> analysis and filtering steps were used to test for male versus
female methylation differences. Eight random sets of six males and six females were
generated and used for the analysis. Using the conservative assumption that all autosomal
methylation differences detected were false positives, we calculated the average percent
of significant sites that were autosomal as 11.4% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Thus, we estimate that our FDR is no greater
than 11.4% and less to the extent that true autosomal sex-specific differences exist.
Three separate BED files containing 6286 unique genomic coordinates from non-detect vs.
low, 7337 unique genomic coordinates from non-detect vs. high, and 11 194 unique genomic
coordinates from low vs. high analysis were uploaded to Genomatix genome analyzer software
(v2. Release 4.7) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genomatix.de">https://www.genomatix.de</ext-link>) and mapped to the human genome (NCBI build 37).
The classification of regions identifying the overlap with exons, introns, promoters, and
intergenic regions, as well as transcription start regions (TSRs) was performed using the
RegionMiner workflow. Genomatix defines repeat regions using in-house libraries.</p>

<title>Gene Set Enrichment Testing</title>
<p>Genome-wide region enrichment of GO terms was performed using the

were visualized using the Reduce and Visualize Gene Ontology (REViGO) web application
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://revigo.irb.hr">http://revigo.irb.hr</ext-link>), which removed
redundant GO terms and linked highly similar GO terms with the similarity cutoff value of

<title>Quantitative Methylation Validation</title>
<p>Top candidate regions were selected based on various factors, including
<italic>P</italic> values, the number of samples with RAMs, the number of reads, and the
methylation status of adjacent regions. Of the two candidate regions selected for
validation, the first was in the region located 1.5 kb upstream of
<italic>SNORD116-1</italic> in the <italic>SNORD116/SNURF-SNRPN</italic> cluster
(chr15:25050592-25050745), and the other was intergenic on chromosome 7
(chr7:152888651-152889150, hg38) proximal to an <italic>AluSg4</italic> transposon
exclusive to <italic>Hominidae</italic> between the genes <italic>ACTR3B</italic> and
<italic>DPP6</italic>. Genomic DNA (500 ng) from the fetal liver tissue used for M-NGS
was bisulfite treated using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) to allow
for the conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil (read as thymine during PCR
amplification), whereas the methylated cytosines remain unconverted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B40">40</xref>]. Bisulfite-converted DNA (2 µl) was then amplified using
Bio-Rad (Model #C1000) thermal cyclers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref> for primer information and PCR conditions)
using primers targeting the SNORD gene cluster and the intergenic region on chromosome 7
(chr7:152888651-152889150). PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel to ensure PCR
quality, correct product length, and lack of contamination. Following manufacturers’
protocols, amplified SNORD products were analyzed for quantitative DNA methylation levels
via the PyroMark Q96 MD Pyrosequencing system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and amplified
chromosome 7 products were analyzed via the EpiTYPER platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA).
For each primer set, the methylation percentage across individual CpG sites was visualized
along with the amplicon average for each sample. The differences in mean amplicon
methylation levels in each paired group were tested using a two-tailed
<italic>t</italic>-test.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RNA Sequencing and Analysis</title>
<p>RNA-sequencing was performed on 12 human fetal liver samples (<italic>N</italic> = 4 per
group), a subset of the 18 samples profiled with M-NGS, for differential expression
analysis using 150 bp single end reads on the Illumina HiSeq analyzed by the Illumina
analysis pipeline. Over 438 million reads across 12 samples were obtained, where the
average number of reads was 36.5 million per sample. The FastQC tool was used to perform
quality control checks on raw data. Because of poor quality (&lt;28) in the second half of
the reads, we trimmed reads to 70 bases in length and aligned the reads to the hg19 human
reference genome with TopHat, using parameters that accept only the best alignment for
reads that align in more than one location and increased searching time to improve
sensitivity. After using SamTools to remove duplicate reads to eliminate the effects of
PCR duplicates, read counts were generated by CuffDiff software. Differential expression
between the three pairwise comparisons (non-detect vs. low, non-detect vs. high, and low
vs. high) was tested with <italic>edgeR</italic> Bioconductor package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B37">37</xref>], following the developers’ protocol
(calcNormFactors, estimateCommonDisp, estimateTagwiseDisp, exactTest, and topTags), using
<italic>q</italic> values (Benjamini and Hochberg FDRs) to adjust for multiple testing.
Gene set enrichment testing for the RNA-seq data was performed using LRpath (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lrpath.ncibi.org">http://lrpath.ncibi.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="dvv006-B41">41</xref>] against GO and KEGG. Gene set enrichment for
