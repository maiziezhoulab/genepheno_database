<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par1">Moloney leukemia virus 10 (Mov10) is an RNA helicase that mediates access of the RNA-induced silencing complex to messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Until now, its role as an RNA helicase and as a regulator of retrotransposons has been characterized exclusively in cell lines. We investigated the role of Mov10 in the mouse brain by examining its expression over development and attempting to create a Mov10 knockout mouse. Loss of both Mov10 copies led to early embryonic lethality.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par2">Mov10 was significantly elevated in postnatal murine brain, where it bound retroelement RNAs and mRNAs. Mov10 suppressed retroelements in the nucleus by directly inhibiting complementary DNA synthesis, while cytosolic Mov10 regulated cytoskeletal mRNAs to influence neurite outgrowth. We verified this important function by observing reduced dendritic arborization in hippocampal neurons from the Mov10 heterozygote mouse and shortened neurites in the Mov10 knockout Neuro2A cells. Knockdown of Fmrp also resulted in shortened neurites. Mov10, Fmrp, and Ago2 bound a common set of mRNAs in the brain. Reduced Mov10 in murine brain resulted in anxiety and increased activity in a novel environment, supporting its important role in the development of normal brain circuitry.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par3">Mov10 is essential for normal neuronal development and brain function. Mov10 preferentially binds RNAs involved in actin binding, neuronal projection, and cytoskeleton. This is a completely new and critically important function for Mov10 in neuronal development and establishes a precedent for Mov10 being an important candidate in neurological disorders that have underlying cytoarchitectural causes like autism and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par17">Moloney leukemia virus 10 (Mov10) is a superfamily 1 (SF1) RNA helicase that binds to G-rich secondary structures and unwinds RNA in a 5′-to-3′ direction in an ATP-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mov10 was originally described as associating with RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) factor Argonaute 2 (Ago2) and was required in microRNA (miRNA)-guided cleavage of a reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Mov10 also has roles in nonsense-mediated decay, suppression of viral RNAs, and retrotransposition in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We found that Mov10 associates with the fragile X mental retardation protein (Fmrp) in the adult brain to regulate translation of a commonly bound set of RNAs by modulating their association with Ago2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Fmrp is required for normal cognition, and our findings suggested a possible role for Mov10 in brain function. Currently, there are no studies describing a role for Mov10 in the developing brain.</p>
<p id="Par18">In the central nervous system (CNS), RNA helicases function by affecting neuronal differentiation, RNA localization, cell morphology, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Examples of helicases that are miRNA-related include DHX36, which is required for dendritic localization of pre-miR134 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and DDX6, which binds TRIM32 to increase the activity of RISC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Importantly, none of these helicases could functionally compensate for Mov10, since the Mov10 knockout is embryonic lethal in the mouse.</p>
<p id="Par19">Mov10 is also significantly elevated in the brain shortly after birth through adolescence. Isolation of Mov10-associated RNAs from the P2 brain reveals two critical roles for Mov10 in early brain development: a suppressor of retrotransposition and a regulator of neuronal projections. Two-thirds of the Mov10-associated RNAs encode retroelements, including long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), while the rest of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encode proteins involved with neurite outgrowth and cytoskeleton.</p>
<p id="Par20">Mov10 is a strong suppressor of endogenous transposition of L1, an active LINE element in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. During neuronal differentiation, there is increased L1 retrotransposition in the hippocampus and several regions of the adult brain. We hypothesize that Mov10 is elevated in the postnatal brain to suppress retrotransposition, which is highly active during this time in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As neurons mature and arborize, Mov10 regulates the translation of actin binding proteins and cytoskeleton, which is required for neuronal migration and function. This is the first study to show a role for Mov10 during embryogenesis and in postnatal brain development and function. We propose that Mov10 is vital for viability and for normal CNS development and function.</p>

<title>Mov10 is elevated in the postnatal mouse brain</title>
<p id="Par21">Since Mov10 functionally associates with Fmrp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], we examined Mov10 expression in the postnatal murine brain across development. As early as embryonic day 18, there was a higher level of Mov10 in the whole brain compared to adults (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, compare first and last lanes). Mov10 expression continued to rise at birth (P0) and remained elevated over adult levels until P10–P14, when it began to decline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). We observed the same increase in postnatal Mov10 levels in a different mouse strain (Friend virus B-type (FVB), Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>A), and it was independent of sex (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>B). We conclude that Mov10 is elevated in the postnatal and juvenile mouse brain, suggesting an important role for Mov10 in the developing brain.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mov10 is significantly elevated in young mouse brain and is both nuclear and cytoplasmic. <bold>a</bold> Brain extract (25 μg) from C57BL/6 at ages indicated was immunoblotted for Mov10 and eIF5α as a loading control (<italic>top panel</italic>).

</p>
<p id="Par22">To determine the pattern of Mov10 expression, we stained sagittal sections of postnatal and adult brain to examine if Mov10 was elevated in specific brain regions. Mov10 was highly expressed throughout the P1 brain, including the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, midbrain, and hindbrain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). In contrast, there was very little Mov10 expression in the adult brain except in the hippocampus (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>A, right). However, the hippocampus and cortex of P0 mice expressed much more Mov10 than did the adult hippocampus and cortex (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>A, B). In addition, neurons appeared to have both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in the P0 mice compared to the adult (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>A, see inset).</p>
<p id="Par23">Since Mov10 has previously been described as cytoplasmic in both cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and in cultured hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], we examined Mov10 localization in the P2 brain. We observed Mov10 in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d–f</xref>, P2). In contrast, Mov10 was primarily cytoplasmic in the adult hippocampus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g–i</xref>, Adult). To verify these age-dependent differences in the intracellular localization of Mov10 and using a different Mov10 antibody, we examined hippocampal neurons cultured from P0 mice. We found that Mov10 was distinctly nuclear in day in vitro (DIV) 1 neurons (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>C, DIV1) compared to DIV14 neurons, where it was primarily cytoplasmic (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>C, DIV14), as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We further confirmed the nuclear presence of Mov10 by biochemical fractionation of P2 brain (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>E). Mov10 expression was also examined in testes, where it is highly expressed, and found to be cytoplasmic (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>D). We conclude that Mov10 is in the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the postnatal brain.</p>

<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Mov10 knockout is embryonic lethal</title>
<p id="Par24">Mov10, like Fmrp, is expressed throughout the brain. In order to study the function of Mov10 at postnatal stages in the brain, we attempted to generate a Mov10 knockout mouse using an embryonic stem (ES) cell with one copy of Mov10 targeted by a gene trap vector (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>). After screening 156 pups from heterozygote crosses, we found no viable Mov10 knockouts (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>) and concluded with &gt;95% confidence that the Mov10 knockout has an embryonic lethal phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To determine when Mov10 exerts its crucial effect, we genotyped embryos from E9.5 and E12.5 and failed to detect any Mov10 knockout embryos at these early stages (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that Mov10 is essential for embryonic development in the mouse.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of pups from heterozygote mating</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Wild type</th><th>Heterozygous</th><th>Homozygous</th><th>Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> 44 (28%)</td><td>112 (72%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>156 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Screening of embryos from E9.5</td></tr><tr><td> 5 (36%)</td><td>9 (64%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>14 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Screening of embryos from E12.5</td></tr><tr><td> 0 (0%)</td><td>21 (100%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>21 (100%)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

<title>Mov10 suppresses LINE retrotransposition in the nucleus</title>
<p id="Par25">To investigate the role of Mov10 in early brain development, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) from P2 brains and sequenced the RNAs bound to Mov10. The total number of reads was 98,884,367; the number of aligned reads was 71,522,027 (74.59% aligned), and the number of uniquely aligned reads was 57,005,129 (59.45%). We used RIPSeeker to identify RNAs significantly enriched over input RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and found 2996 RIP peaks: 1313 overlapped with repeat elements from the long terminal repeat (LTR) family, the autonomous non-LTR family of LINEs, and the non-autonomous short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) in the RepeatMasker database (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>), and 525 peaks overlapped with RefSeq, indicating that they were mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>). We validated the RIPSeeker result by immunoprecipitating Mov10 from the P2 mouse brain and performing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on an endogenously active autonomous retrotransposon mL1T<sub>F</sub> as well as Prrc2b, a brain mRNA target of Mov10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Although Mov10 has previously been shown to bind the L1 transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we showed here that it binds L1 transcripts from the retrotransposition-competent T<sub>F</sub> subfamily of mouse L1s (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). These primers have been used before by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; however, it is possible that the RT-PCR to detect L1 expression is off-targeting to L1 sequence fragments that might be contained in mRNAs. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the immunoprecipitated signal could be due to the presence of an mRNA that happens to contain the L1 primer target sequence.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Mov10 binds repeat element RNA and mRNA in P2 brain and blocks retrotransposition. <bold>a</bold> Results of RIP followed by sequencing. <italic>Left pie chart</italic> shows the distribution of all immunoprecipitated RNAs. <italic>Right pie chart</italic> shows the classification of the repeat elements. <bold>b</bold> RT-PCR of Mov10 or irrelevant (<italic>IRR</italic>) IP from P2 brains for Mov10 individual nucleotide cross-linking immunoprecipitation (<italic>iCLIP</italic>) target mRNA (<italic>Prrc2b</italic>) and an active mouse L1 RNA (<italic>mL1T</italic>

<p id="Par26">Our hypothesis is that Mov10 binds the RNA of retroelements and inhibits their transposition in the developing brain. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the amount of genomic L1 in P2 brains from heterozygous Mov10 knockout mice compared to WT, hypothesizing that the reduction in Mov10 would lead to an increase in L1 retrotransposition events, as observed in MeCP2 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The qPCR was done using genomic DNA treated with exonuclease 1 to remove any unintegrated complementary DNA (cDNA) and RNAse H to remove DNA-RNA hybrids that might artificially contribute to the observed increase in LINE content. Similar to the MeCP2 study, we found a twofold increase in L1 genomic content in the Mov10 heterozygotes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c, d</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>), supporting a role for Mov10 in L1 suppression in the developing brain.</p>
<p id="Par27">APOBEC3G is an RNA editing enzyme that plays a key role in regulating retrotransposition by directly binding reverse transcriptases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and also by binding RNAs to sterically block reverse transcriptase (RT) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To determine whether Mov10 was able to block RT activity, we incubated equal molar amounts of Mov10 and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (SSRTIII), an engineered version of M-MLV RT, and then performed a reverse transcription reaction in which total RNA from P2 brains was added. Reverse transcription of both L1 RNA and Prrc2b RNA was blocked by the addition of Mov10. In contrast, reverse transcription of the Gapdh transcript, which is not bound by Mov10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], was only partially inhibited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e, f</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>). We also tested purified recombinant human Fmrp, another RNA binding protein, in this assay and found that the addition of Fmrp did not have an effect on cDNA synthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). Thus, Mov10 blocked reverse transcription of its bound targets more efficiently than that of non-target RNAs. Our data agree with the results of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], where the researchers used the L1 element amplification protocol (LEAP) assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to measure the ability of purified L1 RNP to reverse transcribe the bound L1 RNA. Over-expression of Mov10 in transfected cells inhibited reverse transcription of L1 in this assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, another study used the LEAP assay with recombinant Mov10 (from OriGene) and found that reverse transcription was not suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These contradictory results could be due to the differing sources of Mov10 used.</p>
<p id="Par28">Li and colleagues concluded that Mov10 blocks retrotransposition by facilitating L1 RNA degradation and its helicase activity is required for this function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We tested the helicase-deficient mutant of Mov10, where a conserved lysine in motif I has been mutated to alanine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], in our in vitro assay and found that it does not suppress the cDNA synthesis of either mL1T<sub>F</sub> or Prrc2b (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>). Thus, the helicase function of Mov10 is required to block RT activity.</p>
<p id="Par29">To determine if Mov10 directly binds RT, we coupled either SSRTIII or bovine serum albumin (BSA) to beads and found that only SSRTIII efficiently captured Mov10. Additionally, we performed the capture using either the C-terminal half or the N-terminal half of Mov10 and found that only the N-terminal half could bind SSRTIII (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h</xref>). The unstructured N-terminus of Mov10 has been implicated in inhibiting HIV infectivity, though the exact mechanism is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our data suggest that Mov10 binds reverse transcriptase through its N-terminal region and unwinds the L1 RNA using its C-terminal helicase domains. Importantly, Mov10 directly bound ORF2p, which is the RT/endonuclease encoded by L1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2i</xref>). RNAse treatment did not significantly change the amount of immunoprecipitated ORF2p (the difference between the indicated ratios is not significant), suggesting a protein-protein interaction. We conclude that Mov10 is elevated in the nucleus during postnatal brain development when retrotransposition is active to bind retroelement RNAs and block reverse transcription, which is a critical step for retrotransposon insertion.</p>

<title>Mov10 associates with cytoskeletal mRNAs to regulate neurite outgrowth</title>
<p id="Par30">Approximately one-third of the Mov10-associated RNAs in the postnatal brain RIP-seq were mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). We used the DAVID Bioinformatics database to analyze the Gene Ontology (GO) terms assigned to the 525 RNAs, which revealed axon, neuron projection, growth cone, and dendrite among the most significant categories (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>, <italic>p</italic> values 9.1 × 10<sup>–9</sup>, 1.3 × 10<sup>–8</sup>, 7.8 × 10<sup>–7</sup>, 8.6 × 10<sup>–7</sup> respectively). To independently verify this result, we performed individual nucleotide cross-linking immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) on brains isolated from P0–P1 mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>, right panel) and obtained 92,798,446 reads; after quality trimming and deduplication, there were 5,269,506 reads. Further analysis revealed 61,471 unique tags present in the Mov10 IP compared to 3545 tags in the irrelevant IP. A total of 2988 of the tags aligned to the genome, 2333 were uniquely aligned, and 729 regions were identified. The gene identities are provided in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>. GO analysis using a P1 brain transcriptome as background revealed that RNAs encoding proteins involved in neuron projection had the lowest <italic>p</italic> value (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>, Cellular Compartments category). Under GO category Molecular Function, actin binding and protein binding were the most enriched (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref> bottom). In addition, the GO term in the Biological Process category with the lowest <italic>p</italic> value (9.1 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) was actin cytoskeletal organization.

<p id="Par32">To determine how Mov10 participates in differentiation, we isolated RNA from undifferentiated and differentiated WT and KO N2a cells and performed high-resolution RNA-seq analysis. Samples were sequenced extremely deeply to around 350,000,000 paired-end reads 100 base pairs (bp) long to capture lowly expressed genes, with at least 86% reads mapping to the mm10 mouse genome. We identified 16,551 genes and found that 324 genes changed significantly between the differentiated and undifferentiated states of WT N2a with 180 increasing and 144 decreasing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref> top, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>). GO analysis revealed that RNAs implicated in cell cycle arrest were significantly changed (<italic>p</italic> value 4 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) under the GO category Biological Process, which is expected since undifferentiated cells proliferate in contrast to differentiated cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>). GO terms in the category Cellular Compartments revealed a significant enrichment for RNAs implicated in extracellular region/space and neuron projection (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">8</xref>B).</p>
<p id="Par33">To identify Mov10-dependent genes, we compared undifferentiated WT to KO and found 813 significantly changed RNAs (300 + 513), while a comparison of differentiated WT to KO showed 781 RNAs (513 + 268) that were significantly changed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). We found that 513 genes were shared, suggesting that their expression was regulated by Mov10 and independent of differentiation (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">10</xref>). GO analysis of these Mov10 target genes revealed strong clustering with terms relating to nervous system development, axon guidance, and neuron projection, with the majority of the genes in the groups being downregulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref>, orange indicates proportion significantly downregulated and blue indicates proportion significantly upregulated in the KO, see Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">10</xref> for gene list). This result suggests a more general function for Mov10 as an RNA remodeler in addition to its role in revealing microRNA recognition elements (MREs). Similar to its function with Fmrp and Ago2, the fate of the mRNA depended on where Mov10 and Fmrp bound in the 3′untranslated region (3’UTR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The data also show that Mov10 expression is critical for neurite outgrowth in N2a cells and is consistent with the data from mouse brain, where genes representing cytoskeletal components are the predominant functional categories. Additionally, we verified the Mov10 dependence of microtubule-associated protein 1b (Map1b), a cytoskeletal protein important in neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and found that it was reproducibly reduced in the Mov10 KO and rescued on Mov10 re-expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>). Map1b levels went down significantly in the KO cells under both differentiated and undifferentiated conditions, suggesting that it was a direct target of Mov10 irrespective of the differentiation program.</p>
<p id="Par34">To identify the genes regulated by Mov10 that participate in differentiation, we compared the 324 (144 + 180) genes that significantly changed during WT differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>) with Mov10 KO differentiation. There were 64 genes that significantly changed in the opposite direction in the differentiated Mov10 KO compared to WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4h</xref>). This group of 64 Mov10-dependent, differentiation-specific genes include key growth signals such as FGF1 and transcription factors like TEAD2 along with cytoskeletal genes such as actin isoforms and Tnnt1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>). We appreciate that the RNA-seq data include genes indirectly affected by Mov10 loss and are not necessarily directly bound by Mov10, although we do expect there to be some direct mRNA targets of Mov10. The direct binding of Mov10 to cytoskeletal mRNAs from the RIP and iCLIP data suggest that misregulation of those genes in the Mov10 KO leads to reduced neurite outgrowth. In fact some of the same cytoskeletal-related RNAs are found in both the Mov10-dependent genes in N2a (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">10</xref>) and the mouse brain iCLIP lists (Additional Files <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>﻿ as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec12">Methods</xref>). We conclude that Mov10 plays a key role in neurite development and process formation through its regulation of cytoskeletal and neuroregulatory mRNAs.</p>
<p id="Par35">Fmrp predominantly binds brain mRNAs that function in neuron projection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Because we have evidence that Fmrp and Mov10 functionally associate in HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], we examined the effect of Fmrp knockdown on neurite outgrowth in N2a and found that it was significantly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). To ask whether Fmrp and Mov10 functioned in the same pathway, we compared neurite length in the Fmrp/Mov10 double knockdown to the Fmrp knockdown alone and found no difference (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). This result suggests that Fmrp and Mov10 function in the same pathway.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Mov10, Fmrp, and Ago2 bind mRNAs enriched for neuronal genes. <bold>a</bold>

<p id="Par36">In earlier work, we showed that when Fmrp and Mov10 bound the same region in the 3′UTR of cobound mRNAs, binding by Ago2 was blocked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In this subset of mRNAs, Fmrp-Mov10 interaction had a protective effect on the mRNA. To identify commonly bound brain mRNA targets of Fmrp, Mov10, and Ago2, we compared the iCLIP targets of whole brain-derived Mov10, analyzed as described (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec12">Methods</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM11">11</xref>), which came from postnatal mice (P0, P1). We compared these genes to previously published lists of iCLIP targets from brain-derived Fmrp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which came from mice aged P11–P25 and iCLIP targets from human brain-derived Ago2, which came from adult motor cortex and cingulate gyrus from males aged 44–68 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Despite differences between species and age, we found significant overlaps between the Fmrp and Mov10 targets, between the Mov10 and Ago2 targets, between the Ago2 and Fmrp targets, and between all three proteins. All overlaps were highly significant (<italic>p</italic> = 2.15<sup>–19</sup>, <italic>p</italic> = 5.57<sup>–26</sup>, <italic>p</italic> = 4.85<sup>–159</sup>, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.00000 respectively). Using a permutation approach, we also determined that the amounts of overlap in the Venn diagram were significantly more than expected by chance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec12">Methods</xref>). Thus, Fmrp, Mov10, and Ago2 bind a common set of brain mRNAs (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">12</xref>). To understand what the functional consequences of such binding might be, we performed GO analysis of the 47 commonly bound Mov10-Fmrp-Ago mRNAs and found an enrichment of dendrite, synapse, and neuron projection terms under the GO category Cellular Compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). These data suggest a miRNA-mediated function for cytosolic Mov10 in regulating cytoskeletal genes. <italic>Map1b</italic> was one of the genes present in the Fmrp-Mov10-Ago2 overlap (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>) and is regulated by Fmrp through the miRNA pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Similar to the fate described for the Fmrp/Mov10/Ago2-cobound mRNAs in HEK293, <italic>Map1b</italic> is reduced in the absence of Mov10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>), suggesting a protective role for Mov10, likely in association with Fmrp.</p>

<title>Role of Mov10 in neuronal maturation and behavior</title>
<p id="Par37">Because Mov10 is highly expressed in the developing brain and is required for normal neurite development, we hypothesized that the Mov10 heterozygote mouse would show a phenotype. This was the case for the microprocessor component DGCR8: loss of both alleles was embryonic lethal, but the heterozygotes had a neuronal and behavioral phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We verified that the Mov10 heterozygote mouse (HET) expressed half as much Mov10 in the brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>) and then examined cultured hippocampal neurons from WT and Mov10 heterozygotes (HET). Mov10 heterozygotes had markedly less dendritic branching compared to the WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b, c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par39">We show here two independent and previously undescribed roles for Mov10 in embryonic development and postnatal brain. Like the Ago2 knockout, the Mov10 knockout is also embryonic lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], supporting their critical role in miRNA-mediated regulation during development. Since Mov10 is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in neurons, we believe that it is co-opted for critical but distinct functions in brain development. We propose that in addition to the cytoplasmic miRNA-mediated function of Mov10 in regulating neurite outgrowth in the brain, the developmentally timed increase of Mov10 acts as a defense against nuclear L1 retrotransposition.</p>
<sec id="Sec9">
<title>Nuclear Mov10 in LINE-1 suppression</title>
<p id="Par40">There is extensive data in cell culture for Mov10′s role in suppressing LINE-1 retrotransposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], although the mechanism is unknown. We present evidence that Mov10 directly binds retrotransposon mRNAs in the postnatal brain at stages when neuronal differentiation is high and acts to inhibit their reverse transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a, b</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Significantly, the consequence of reducing Mov10 in the brain increases L1 content in the genome in P2 brains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c, d</xref>). The mechanism by which Mov10 inhibits reverse transcription could be by a steric block of ORF2p on L1 mRNA. The L1 endonuclease and reverse transcriptase ORF2p binds the poly(A) tract of L1 mRNA to mobilize it to the insertion site, where it nicks the DNA to prime reverse transcription in a 3′-to-5′ direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We showed previously that Mov10 binds G-rich regions, including G-quadruplexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, we suspect that Mov10 binds the G-rich polypyrimidine tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] present in the 3′UTRs of L1 mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and also interacts with ORF2p through its N-terminal domain. Subsequently, Mov10 proceeds to unwind in the 5′-to-3′ direction, causing a steric hindrance to the progress of ORF2p. In support of this hypothesis, the helicase-deficient mutant of Mov10 is unable to block reverse transcription of L1 mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>). A recent study shows that the G-rich tracts in L1s stimulate retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. We would hypothesize that Mov10 is elevated in the brain postnatally and localizes to the nucleus to suppress this event.</p>

<title>Mov10 in neurite outgrowth, neuronal development, and brain function</title>
<p id="Par41">The RIP from postnatal brain also shows a preponderance of actin and cytoskeletal mRNAs, suggesting an important role for Mov10 in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics in the brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). The same observation was made in the RNA-seq analysis from Mov10 N2a KO cells, further confirming a critical role for Mov10 in neurite outgrowth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). We hypothesize that this reflects Mov10’s cytoplasmic role in miRNA-mediated regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It likely plays a role with Fmrp in modulating Ago2 association with cobound RNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). Mov10 has low expression in the adult brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), similar to what is reported in the Allen Brain Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, there is no report of Mov10 expression in the developing brain. We observe an approximately 40-fold increase in Mov10 levels in P0–P3 mouse brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) when events like synaptogenesis, synaptic pruning, and neuronal differentiation are occurring to shape normal brain circuitry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Mov10 is important for these events since a 50% reduction in Mov10 levels leads to less dendritic complexity in hippocampal neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b–d</xref>). These data suggest a role for Mov10 in the normal development of brain circuitry. Based on the evidence that Mov10 preferentially binds cytoskeletal mRNAs, we hypothesize that the reduction in Mov10 affects dendritic morphology and synaptic remodeling in the brain. Accordingly, the Mov10 heterozygote mice show increased activity in a novel environment and higher anxiety, suggesting that Mov10 is required for normal brain function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a, b</xref>). It is also possible that the increased retrotransposition activity in the Mov10 heterozygote could be contributing to the neuronal phenotype and behavior. In fact, increased L1 insertions have been implicated in the development or predisposition to psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>

In fact, CNVs containing Mov10 have been found in individuals with developmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Our study demonstrates that Mov10 is essential in embryonic development, in normal neuronal development, and in brain function.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par43">Mov10 is significantly elevated in the postnatal murine brain, where it binds retroelement RNAs and mRNAs. Mov10 suppresses retroelements in the nucleus by directly inhibiting cDNA synthesis, while cytosolic Mov10 regulates cytoskeletal mRNAs to influence neurite outgrowth. Finally, reduced Mov10 in the murine brain results in anxiety and increased activity in a novel environment. In summary, Mov10 is essential for embryonic viability and for normal CNS development and function.</p>

<title>Western blot</title>
<p id="Par44">Samples from at least three biological replicates were prepared for immunoblotting after quantification by Bradford assay and suspension in 1× sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western/immunoblotting. Briefly, membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% TWEEN-20 for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C followed by a brief wash in 1% non-fat milk PBS containing 1% TWEEN-20 wash buffer. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody was applied at 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature and washed 4 × 15 min using wash buffer. The HRP signal was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate and exposed to film. The antibodies used were anti-Mov10 (A301-571A, RRID: AB-1040002; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) at 1:1000, anti-Cbx7 (sc-70232, RRID:AB_2071502; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 1:2000, anti-eIF5 (RRID:AB_631427) (Santa Cruz) at 1:10,000, anti-Gapdh (ab9484, RRID:AB_307274; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-LINE-1 (sc-67198, RRID:AB_1249550; Santa Cruz), and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies from GE Healthcare (RRID:AB_772191) and Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA (RRID:AB_2338512) respectively.

<title>Whole mouse brain fixation, sectioning, and staining</title>
<p id="Par45">Three adult C57BL6 (Envigo, USA [formerly known as “Harlan”]) males were euthanized and whole body fixation was done using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brain was dissected out and fixed with a series of ethanol washes for 30 min (25%, 50%, 70%, 83%, 95%, and 100%) and left in methyl salicylate for 3 h to overnight before embedding in paraffin. For P0 and P1 pups, whole, skinned heads were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and dehydrated similar to adult brain. Sections were prepared using a Spencer 820 rotary microtome and dried overnight at room temperature. The sections were de-paraffinized using xylene and rehydrated through a series of ethanol washes (100% and 95% followed by 1× PBS) before boiling in 1× citrate (pH 6.0) for epitope retrieval. The sections were stained using a primary antibody to Mov10 (Abcam ab60132, RRID: AB_944250) at 1:100 and Alexa fluor 596 at 1:800 (RRID: AB_2340621, Jackson Immunoresearch) before imaging using a NanoZoomer Slide Scanner (Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan) and Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining was done using the same antibodies and following the instructions in the DAB staining Kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) and counterstained with hematoxylin before imaging on the NanoZoomer Slide Scanner.

<title>Brain IP, RT-PCR, and RNA sequencing</title>
<p id="Par46">For the brain-RIP-seq, brains were harvested from 28 WT P2 pups. For confirming specific transcripts by brain IP, three WT P2 brains were used. All were triturated in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) and then UV cross-linked thrice for the confirmatory IP. Triturated cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.5% Triton), cleared by ultracentrifugation (35,000 rpm at 35 min at 4 °C), and sequentially immunoprecipitated with an irrelevant rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-EGFP, Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA; RRID: AB_10013427) followed by IP with Mov10 antibody (A301-571A, RRID: AB_1040002, Bethyl). Both IPs were washed sequentially for 10 min with lysis buffer and twice with wash buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40). The IPs were treated with 500 units of RNAse-free DNAse I, washed once for 10 min with high salt buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). To isolate associated RNA, the IPs were treated with proteinase K followed by TRIzol (Ambion) extraction for RNA isolation. The ethanol-precipitated RNA was quantified, and equal amounts were used for cDNA synthesis followed by RNAse H treatment. The RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated in ethanol and converted into cDNA using Oligo dT primer and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase. qRT-PCR was performed with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) using a StepOnePlus RT PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) with gene-specific primers. For the brain IP-RNA sequencing, WT brains were homogenized in the same manner as described above but were not UV cross-linked. Additionally, the TRIzol-extracted RNA was cleaned using an RNA Clean &amp; Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) before sequencing.</p>

<title>RIP-seq analysis</title>
<p id="Par47">Total input RNA and RNA extracted from the irrelevant IP and the Mov10 IP were used for making libraries and produced over 230 million reads with perfect quality scores. The contribution from the irrelevant IP was negligible and removed from further analysis. Each fastq file was broken into 100 smaller fastq files using a Perl script downloaded from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. TopHat2 (version 2.1.1, RRID: SCR_013035) was run on each individual smaller fastq file using –g 2000 and all default parameters. Setting –g 2000 instructs TopHat2 to allow up to 2000 alignments to the reference (version mm10 that is not masked for repetitive regions, obtained from Illumina iGenomes) for a given read.</p>
<p id="Par48">The resulting alignment files in Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) format were merged into a single BAM file for each sample using samtools (version 1.3). BAM files were then sorted based on chromosome coordinates of alignments using novosort (novocraft version 3.02; RRID: SCR_014818). The total number of reads from the Mov10 IP was 98,884,367, the number of aligned reads was 71,522,027 (74.59% aligned), and the number of uniquely aligned reads was 57,005,129 (59.45%). From the input sample, the total number of reads was 67,566,885, and the number of aligned reads was 59,620,379 (88.24% aligned). The number of uniquely aligned reads was 29,124,706 (43.11%). To identify protein-associated transcripts, the Bioconductor-based statistical package RIPSeeker was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. RIPSeeker’s (version 3.3; RRID: SCR_006810) function ripSeek was run using the alignments generated by TopHat2 with parameters:uniqueHit = TRUE, assignMultihits = TRUE, rerunWithDisambiguatedMultihits = TRUE, and binSize = NULL. Setting uniqueHit = TRUE requires training the hidden Markov model (HMM) with only the unique hits; assignMultihits = TRUE enables function disambiguateMultihits to assign each multihit to a unique locus based on the posterior probabilities derived from HMM; rerunWithDisambiguatedMultihits = TRUE tells RIPSeeker to retrain the HMM using the dataset with disambiguated multihits; binSize = NULL enables automatic bin size selection. ripSeek function was run separately for plus strand and minus strand, and the output files in GFF3 format were combined into a single GFF3 file that contains genomic coordinates for all the regions identified to be significantly enriched in Mov10 IP compared to Input. To identify repeat elements and transcripts that overlap with RIP regions identified by RIPSeeker, two tab-delimited text files were downloaded from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser’s table browser interface. One text file contains genomic coordinates of all repeat elements on mouse reference genome mm10 extracted from the RepeatMasker database, and another text file contains genomic coordinates of all mouse transcripts on mouse reference genome mm10 extracted from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) RefSeq database (RRID: SCR_003496). Bedtools intersect (version 2.25.0) was run to identify repeat elements and mouse transcripts that overlap with RIP regions. A total of 2996 RIP peaks were identified: 1313 overlapped with repeat elements from the RepeatMasker database, and 1683 peaks had no overlaps with RepeatMasker with 755 peaks overlapping with RefSeq.</p>

<title>Mouse brain iCLIP analyses</title>
<p id="Par49">Sixteen brains from P0 and P1 mice were triturated in HBSS and UV cross-linked three times (using Stratalinker) with mixing between treatments. A published iCLIP protocol was followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The irrelevant IP was performed with a rabbit affinity purified antibody EGFP (RRID: AB_10013427, Clontech) The Mov10 IP was performed with antibody (A301-571A, RRID: AB_1040002, Bethyl). Mov10-CLIP libraries were sequenced by the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Core Sequencing Facility using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The fastq data were trimmed using Trimmomatic (version 0.30, RRID: SCR_011848) to (1<sup>st</sup>) trim off (crop) the last 14 nucleotides from all the reads, (2<sup>nd</sup>) trim nucleotides with a quality value lower than 20, from the far (3′ end) of the read, (3<sup>rd</sup>) trim nucleotides with a quality value lower than 25 from the 5′ end of the read, and (4<sup>th</sup>) remove the adaptor/known contaminant. Reads with 30 or more nucleotides remaining after the trimming were kept. These data, processed as described below, are presented in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>. Reads with 18 or more nucleotides remaining after the additional trimming were kept and processed as described below. The genes identified are in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM11">11</xref> and were used in the comparisons in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>.</p>
<p id="Par50">The fastq files were converted to fasta files, which were compressed to eliminate duplications, based on the tags. The compressed fasta file of tags was then separated into two files—representing the irrelevant and Mov10 immunoprecipitations—each file containing the tags with a specific barcode. This step utilized scripts that did the separation and also removed the barcode from the read, in preparation for the alignment step. The separated samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using Novoalign (RRID: SCR_014818). The only parameter specified was “-t 60”, this allows for two mismatches between the genome and the read. Uniquely mapping reads were extracted from the resulting sam files, and the information was converted to BAM format using samtools (samtools view; RRID: SCR_002105). The BAM format was converted to bed (genome interval) format using bedtools (version 2.17.0; RRID: SCR_006646) (bamToBed). The genome intervals of the reads (bed file) for each sample were merged into larger intervals using bedtools (mergeBed). The new interval/region is a location with a set of overlapping reads. Any regions that had any presence in the control Irrelevant samples (intersectBed) were removed to give the final set of experimental genome intervals that have reads mapping to them in the Mov10 immunoprecipitations, which will be referred to as “regions” from here on. IntersectBed (bedtools) was used to determine which regions overlap with genes, exons, UTRs, and lncRNAs (Ensembl) regions using bed files specific for these features respectively. All regions that overlap with genes, but not with exons, are considered intronic, and all other regions are considered intergenic. DAVID 6.8 analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] (RRID:SCR_001881) was performed on the Mov10 CLIP targets using a P1 C57Bl/6 brain background (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) numbers GSM417923, GSM417922, and GSM417921).</p>

<title>Behavior tests</title>
<p id="Par64">The sample size for behavioral testing was estimated using G<sup>*</sup> power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] from a pilot study using 5 animals. The analysis recommended a sample size of 4 animals per group and showed an effect size <italic>d</italic> = 2.522797 and a power of 0.842302. We decided to use at least 10–15 animals per group to account for attrition and outliers. We excluded outliers based on a z-test cutoff of +/– 2 standard deviations from the mean. Mice aged 60–65 days old were tested at the same hour of the day in the following sequence: open field, novel object recognition, rotarod, elevated plus maze, and trace fear conditioning. The experimenter was blinded to the genotypes. Both sexes were tested on the rotarod, elevated plus maze, and trace fear conditioning.</p>
<sec id="Sec31">
<title>Open field test</title>
<p id="Par65">The test was performed on the first day of the novel object recognition test. Mice were exposed for 5 min to a rectangular arena (46 × 25 × 20 cm), and the distance covered was tracked using a Logitech HD Pro webcam. The videos were then analyzed using the TopScan LITE software (Cleversys Inc., Reston, VA, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec32">
<title>Novel object recognition</title>
<p id="Par66">The test was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Briefly, mice were habituated to the empty arena on the first day for 5 min. After 24 h, two similar objects were presented, and the interaction with each object was tracked using a webcam. The pair of objects used in the test was randomized between animals. On day 3, a novel object replaced one of the objects, and the mice were video-tracked. The placement of the novel object was randomized between animals. The videos were analyzed using the ObjectScan software (Cleversys Inc.) to estimate interaction times.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec33">
<title>Rotarod</title>
<p id="Par67">Mice were placed on a stationary rotarod (AccuRotor Rota Rod Tall Unit, 63-cm fall height, 30-mm diameter rotating dowel; Accuscan, Columbus, OH, USA). The dowel was then accelerated at 60 rpm/min, and the latency to fall (in seconds) was recorded. The procedure was repeated for four consecutive trials, which were averaged to give the daily latency to fall for each mouse. The trials were repeated for 2 more days for a total of 3 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec34">
<title>Elevated plus maze</title>
<p id="Par68">The apparatus consists of four arms (66 × 6.4 cm), an open area in the center (6.4 cm), two opposing open arms, and two opposing closed arms (20-cm-high wall) with sliding doors at the end. The maze is elevated at a height of 60 cm from the floor. Mice were placed in the center of the maze, and the time spent in each zone was recorded for 10 min using the webcam. The TopScan LITE software analyzed the videos.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec35">
<title>Trace fear conditioning</title>
<p id="Par69">A modified procedure of the test was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Mice were trained by exposing them for 3 min to a chamber (34 × 28 × 30 cm) where they received three consecutive pairs of tone (10 s) and shock (0.5 mA, 1 s) with an empty trace interval of 1 s and a 3-min break between each tone-shock pairing. Behavior was recorded using a webcam in a new context with the same tone but without shock 48 h after training (trace fear conditioning). Five days after training, the mice were placed back in the original training chamber without tone or shock and recorded for 6 min (context conditioning). The videos were analyzed using TopScan LITE to measure the level of freezing in both cases.</p>

<title>Venn diagram for Mov10/Fmrp/Ago2 overlaps</title>
<p id="Par70">A total of 842 genes with Fmrp-CLIP sites from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] contained NCBI’s Entrez Gene IDs in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3232425/bin/NIHMS314927-supplement-Suppl_Table_S2A-C.xls">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3232425/bin/NIHMS314927-supplement-Suppl_Table_S2A-C.xls</ext-link>. All but two of the IDs were in the current Bioconductor org.Mm.eg.db database (version 3.4.0) (RRID: SCR_006442). According to the NCBI, these two IDs were replaced with different IDs, so we used the updated IDs. Mouse gene symbols for the 842 Entrez IDs were pulled from org.Mm.eg.db. Human genes with Ago2 binding sites were taken from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108341/bin/NIHMS553365-supplement-2.xlsx">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108341/bin/NIHMS553365-supplement-2.xlsx</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There were 7153 binding sites in 3416 unique Ensembl Gene IDs. Ensembl Gene IDs were converted to Entrez Gene IDs using the current Bioconductor org.Hs.eg.db database (version 3.4.0); 3173 Ensembl IDs had perfect 1:1 matches with Entrez IDs. There were 150 genes that had no matches based on Ensembl ID, but we were able to assign Entrez IDs for 109 of them using the Gene Symbol or RefSeq ID listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108341/bin/NIHMS553365-supplement-2.xlsx">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108341/bin/NIHMS553365-supplement-2.xlsx</ext-link>. We found 93 genes that had more than one Entrez ID listed for the Ensembl ID; however, many of the Entrez IDs were for miRNA, and 57 genes matched to a single mRNA Entrez ID; an additional 33 genes were matched to a single Entrez ID using the Gene Symbol or RefSeq ID from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108341/bin/NIHMS553365-supplement-2.xlsx">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108341/bin/NIHMS553365-supplement-2.xlsx</ext-link>. We were left with 3372 unique Ensembl genes, although a few of these were assigned the same Entrez ID, so there were 3335 unique Entrez Gene IDs that had Ago2 binding sites. Human gene symbols for these Entrez IDs were pulled from org.Hs.eg.db.</p>
<p id="Par71">Mouse genes with Mov10 binding sites were taken from Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM11">11</xref>. There were a total of 930 binding sites, although 252 of these were in intergenic/intronic regions and were not assigned to a gene. An additional 2 sites were assigned to two different genes, and these were removed. The remaining sites were in 539 unique, current Entrez Gene IDs. Mouse gene symbols for the 539 Entrez IDs were pulled from org.Mm.eg.db.</p>
<p id="Par72">While database IDs like Entrez Gene or Ensembl are much more stable over time than gene symbols, they are species-specific and hence cannot be used to easily map between species. Instead, both human and mouse use similar nomenclature systems for gene symbols, such that gene symbols from different databases <italic>at the same point in time</italic> should be comparable. The main difference is in capitalization, so symbols were matched by converting both to all capital letters. While only using genes with identical symbols between human and mouse will miss some true homologs, it simplifies the comparison by removing any many-to-one or many-to-many relationships that would be impossible to assess statistically. The two Bioconductor databases from the same release, org.Hs.eg.db_3.4.0 and org.Mm.eg.db_3.4.0, share 16,760 gene symbols in common. This gene set was used as the background to assess whether Fmrp, Ago2, and Mov10 tend to have binding sites in the same genes. After removing genes not in the background, we compared 821 Fmrp genes, 3130 Ago2 genes, and 502 Mov10 genes for overlaps (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). First, we compared the pairwise overlaps using a one-sided Fisher’s exact test, and all three sets were highly significant (Fmrp and Mov10, 77 genes in common, <italic>p</italic> = 2.15e-19; Fmrp and Ago2, 490 genes in common, <italic>p</italic> = 4.85e-159; Mov10 and Ago2, 193 in common, <italic>p</italic> = 5.57e-26). If we test the pairwise overlap between Fmrp and Mov10 using the full mouse background of 23,294 genes, their overlap of 80 genes is even more significant (<italic>p</italic> = 2.50e-27), indicating that the common background is actually more conservative. We also used a permutation approach to test whether the amounts of overlap in the Venn diagram were more than expected by chance by randomly selecting gene sets of 821, 3130, and 502 from the 16,760 background and counting the numbers of genes in common. We repeated this 50,000 times and used the resulting distributions of overlap values to empirically derive one-tailed <italic>p</italic> values for our four observed overlaps: (1) Fmrp and Mov10 only (30 genes), (2) Fmrp and Ago2 only (443 genes), (3) Mov10 and Ago2 only (146 genes), and (4) all three binding sites (47 genes). The Fmrp and Mov10 only overlap had a <italic>p</italic> value = 0.01116, which while significant is not nearly as significant as the other three overlap gene sets, which all had <italic>p</italic> = 0, meaning a larger overlap was not seen in 50,000 random samplings. R version 3.3.3 (R project for statistical Computing-RRID: SCR_001905), using a custom script to randomly pull out subsets of genes of the correct sizes and count overlaps, was used.</p>
