<abstract>
<p>Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide, and it involves extensive local tumour invasion, metastasis and poor prognosis. Understanding the mechanisms regulating the progression of GC is necessary for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Transducin (β)-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1) is an important regulator controlling gene activation and repression, which has been thought to be involved in tumorigenesis. However, the role of TBL1XR1 in human GC remains largely unknown. Here, we find that TBL1XR1 is aberrantly expressed in human GC tissues, and TBL1XR1 levels are highly correlated with local tumour invasion, late tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) stage and poor prognosis. Knockdown of TBL1XR1 by shRNA inhibits GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as tumorigenesis and peritoneal metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas overexpression of TBL1XR1 produces the opposite effects. These effects are mediated by activation of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway, and inhibition of this pathway with a specific ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) significantly impairs the tumour-promoting effects induced by TBL1XR1. Moreover, TBL1XR1 mediated ERK1/2 activation is dependent on the β-catenin/MMP7/EGFR signalling pathway. In conclusion, TBL1XR1 contributes to GC tumorigenesis and progression through the activation of the β-catenin/MMP7/EGFR/ERK signalling pathway and may act as a new therapeutic target for GC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gastric cancer (GC) poses a tremendous health burden on communities worldwide, with 7 23 100 deaths reported in 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Despite the declining incidence of GC, patients have poor prognosis due to the high rate of metastasis and postsurgical recurrence. Surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy are the main methods used for the treatment of GC, the overall 5-year survival rate remains grim, with less than 30% survival worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Therefore, it is vital for scientists and physicians to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of GC and identify new therapeutic targets.</p>
<p>Transducin (β)-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1 or TBLR1) is a newly discovered F-box/WD-40-containing protein that is mainly expressed in CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>−</sup> cells and plays a crucial role in regulating the activation of corepressors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> TBL1XR1 is an essential component of the SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors)/N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor)/HDAC3 (histone deacetylase 3)/TBL1 (transducin (beta)-like 1)/GPS2 (G-protein pathway suppressor 2) nuclear receptor corepressor complex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and overexpression of TBL1XR1 can induce gene repression by targeting gene promoters through transcription factors (TFs) and nuclear receptors (NRs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> TBL1XR1 also acts as a special adaptor molecule for the localization of the ubiquitin-19S/proteasome complex, which modulates the efficient exchange of corepressors for coactivators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Many recurrent mutations and <italic>de novo</italic> deletions have been found in the <italic>TBL1XR1</italic> gene, which are associated with intellectual disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Studies have shown that TBL1XR1 can mediate the activation of many different transduction pathways, such as NF-κB, NRs, Wnt/β-catenin and Notch pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, accumulating evidences have indicated that TBL1XR1 plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis, tumour progression and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Liu <italic>et al</italic> indicated that TBL1XR1 is highly expressed in human primary lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Li <italic>et al</italic> showed that TBL1XR1 is amplified in breast cancer and plays an oncogenic role in breast cancer progression through activation of the Cyclin D1 and β-catenin signalling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Liu <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that TBL1XR1 mediates VEGF-C expression by binding to the promoter region of the VEGF-C gene, which induces lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> A recent study showed that TBL1XR1 can also serve as an androgen receptor coactivator and suppress prostate cancer growth by directly activating androgen receptor target genes involved in cell differentiation and growth suppression, instead of cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Although previous findings strongly suggest the critical role of TBL1XR1 in tumorigenesis and progression of many types of cancer, the biological functions and clinical significance of TBL1XR1 in GC are not clear.</p>
<p>In this study, we show that TBL1XR1 is significantly elevated in GC and its overexpression is closely associated with local invasion, late tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) stage and short survival of patients with GC. Studies of TBL1XR1 with gain- and loss-of-function approaches in GC cells reveal that TBL1XR1 regulates cell growth, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as tumorigenesis and peritoneal metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic> through the activation of the β-catenin/MMP7/EGFR/ERK pathway in GC cells. These findings indicate that TBL1XR1 plays a pivotal role in the progression of GC and it may be of clinical value as a therapeutic target to improve the treatment of GC.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec>
<title>TBL1XR1 is highly expressed in human GC and correlated with poor prognosis</title>
<p>To determine the biological role of TBL1XR1 in human GC progression, TBL1XR1 expression was first examined in human GC tissue samples. The mRNA expression of <italic>TBL1XR1</italic> was measured in 31 pairs of GC and patients-matched normal tissues by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a and b</xref>, the <italic>TBL1XR1</italic> mRNA level was significantly higher in GC tissues than in normal tissues. TBL1XR1 protein expression was then examined in 134 pairs of GC and corresponding normal tissues by immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Here, 82 of 134 GC tissues (the positive rate: 61.2%) and 40 of 134 adjacent normal tissues (the positive rate: 30.7%) were found positive for TBL1XR1 expression (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Typical immunostaining of TBL1XR1 in normal and GC tissues was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and positive staining of TBL1XR1 protein was mainly identified in the nuclei of GC cells. The number of TBL1XR1 positive cells per field (200 ×) in tumour tissues was significantly higher than in normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c and d</xref>). Moreover, the Pearson χ2 test showed the expression of TBL1XR1 protein was significantly associated with local invasion (<italic>P</italic>=0.040) and late TNM stage (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), but not with other clinicopathological parameters including age, tumour differentiation or tumour size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high TBL1XR1 expression had a shorter overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In addition, immunofluorescence also proved that TBL1XR1 was highly expressed in the nuclei of GC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). TBL1XR1 expression was also evaluated in seven GC cell lines and one normal gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1g and h</xref>, both mRNA and protein levels of TBL1XR1 were higher than GES-1 in seven GC cell lines. Thus, these results indicate that TBL1XR1 is overexpressed in GC and may play an important role in GC progression.</p>

<title>TBL1XR1 promotes GC cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>Given a potential link between TBL1XR1 overexpression and GC progression, we determined whether knockdown of TBL1XR1 expression could affect cell growth in GC. To further elucidate the biological functions of TBL1XR1 in GC progression, TBL1XR1 expression in GC cells was silenced by transfecting TBL1XR1-shRNA (sh#1, sh#2, sh#3 and sh#4) into NCI-N87 and SGC7901 cells expressing high levels of TBL1XR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a–c</xref>). Sh#3 showed the most efficiency in silencing TBL1XR1 expression in GC cells, therefore, it was selected to establish NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-shRNA and SGC7901/TBL1XR1-shRNA cells stably expressing low levels of TBL1XR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and b</xref>). Meanwhile, TBL1XR1 expression in GC cells was upregulated by transfecting TBL1XR1-expressing vector into BGC823 and MKN45 cells with low levels of TBL1XR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, knockdown of TBL1XR1 (NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-shRNA and SGC7901/TBL1XR1-shRNA) significantly attenuated GC cell proliferation compared with negative controls (NCI-N87/nc-shRNA and SGC7901/nc-shRNA). However, BGC823/TBL1XR1 and MKN45/TBL1XR1 cells proliferated faster than the empty vector groups (BGC823/vector and MKN45/vector) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were then examined by flow cytometry and results showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-shRNA and SGC7901/TBL1XR1-shRNA groups than in NCI-N87/nc-shRNA and SGC7901/nc-shRNA groups (negative control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2f and g</xref>), while knockdown of TBL1XR1 expression did not affect cell cycle of GC cells (data not shown). A colony formation assay was performed to further validate the proliferative effect of TBL1XR1 on the growth of GC cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2h and i</xref>, the number of colonies from BGC823 and MKN45 cells transfected with TBL1XR1-expressing vector was more than those with control vectors. Together, these results indicate that TBL1XR1 promotes GC cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>TBL1XR1 promotes the migration, invasion and EMT of GC cells</title>
<p>We further assessed the tumour cell migration and invasion ability using wound healing assays, transwell migration and invasion assays. The wounds healed better and faster in NCI-N87/nc-shRNA and SGC7901/nc-shRNA cells than in NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-shRNA and SGC7901/TBL1XR1-shRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref>). We further tested GC cell migration and metastatic properties using transwell migration and invasion assays. Knockdown of TBL1XR1 significantly decreased the migration and invasion ability of NCI-N87 and SGC7901 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and d</xref>), while overexpression of TBL1XR1 significantly increased the migration and invasion ability of BGC823 and MKN45 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3e and f</xref>). EMT plays a crucial role in tumour cell migration and invasion. To further investigate the molecular mechanism mediating the aggressive effects of TBL1XR1 on GC cells, we next explored whether TBL1XR1 status regulates EMT in GC cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3g and h</xref>, TBL1XR1 knockdown significantly increased the expression levels of epithelial cell markers (α-catenin and E-cadherin), and decreased the expression levels of mesenchymal cell markers (N-cadherin and ZEB2), which suggests that TBL1XR1 silencing could reverse the EMT phenotypes of GC cells. However, overexpression of TBL1XR1 significantly promotes the EMT phenotypes of BGC823 and MKN45 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3i and j</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that TBL1XR1 may promote GC cell migration and invasion via the induction of EMT.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>The tumour-promoting effects induced by TBL1XR1 in GC are mediated through the activation of ERK1/2 pathway</title>
<p>The ERK1/2 signalling pathway plays a central role in the process of tumour cell migration and invasion induced by EMT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> To better understand the signalling pathways involved in the tumour-promoting properties of TBL1XR1 in GC, we investigated the possible involvement of ERK1/2. We first examined the TBL1XR1 and pERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204 phosphorylation of ERK) protein expression levels in GC and patient-matched normal gastric tissues by IHC and immunofluorescence staining, and found that the pERK1/2 expression level was positively correlated with TBL1XR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). We next investigated the protein expression levels of pERK1/2 and TBL1XR1 in four GC cell lines, and found that both proteins were highly expressed in SGC7901 and NCI-N87 cells, while expression levels were significantly lower in MKN45 and BGC823 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), suggesting that the ERK1/2 signalling pathway may be involved in tumour-promotion effects induced by TBL1XR1.</p>
<p>To explore the involvement and functional effect of ERK1/2 activation in tumour promotion induced by TBL1XR1 in GC, we first treated SGC7901 cells and NCI-N87 cells expressing high levels of TBL1XR1 with a specific ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. We demonstrated that U0126 (20 μ<sc>M</sc>) significantly suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d–f</xref>). Additionally, U0126 also reversed the EMT of GC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). We then determined whether knockdown of TBL1XR1 expression could inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in GC cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4h and i</xref>, TBL1XR1 knockdown significantly reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-shRNA and SGC7901/TBL1XR1-shRNA cells, while TBL1XR1 overexpression significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in BGC823/TBL1XR1 and MKN45/TBL1XR1 cells. We then explored whether TBL1XR1 could enhance GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion through the activation of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway. After incubation with U0126, the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of BGC823/TBL1XR1 and MKN45/TBL1XR1 cells was significantly reduced in comparison with the control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4j–l</xref>). Western blot analysis demonstrated that EMT induced by overexpression of TBL1XR1 was also reversed after the treatment of BGC823/TBL1XR1 and MKN45/TBL1XR1 cells with U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m</xref>). However, U0126 had no effects on the expression of TBL1XR1 in GC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4g and m</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that TBL1XR1 regulates GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT by activating the ERK1/2 signalling pathway.</p>

<title>The activation of ERK1/2 induced by TBL1XR1 is mediated via the β-catenin/MMP7/EGFR signalling pathway</title>
<p>Aberrant activation of β-catenin signalling plays an important role in various cancers such as gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Recent findings indicated that TBL1XR1 and β-catenin can recruit each other to Wnt target gene promoters to facilitate transcriptional activation and oncogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> TBL1XR1 can promote the EMT of tumour cells via activating β-catenin signalling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> To determine whether β-catenin signalling is involved in the activation of ERK1/2 induced by TBL1XR1, we first detected the phosphorylation levels of β-catenin (S675) and ERK1/2 in GC cells with different status of TBL1XR1 expression. We found that knockdown of TBL1XR1 expression significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of β-catenin (p-β-catenin) and ERK1/2 in NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-shRNA and SGC7901/TBL1XR1-shRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). In contrast, TBL1XR1 overexpression significantly increased the phosphorylation of β-catenin and ERK1/2 in BGC823/TBL1XR1 and MKN45/TBL1XR1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We then explored whether TBL1XR1 could promote the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and EMT in GC cells through the activation of β-catenin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, after treatment with β-catenin inhibitor XAV939 (10 μ<sc>M</sc>), the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by overexpression of TBL1XR1 in BGC823/TBL1XR1 and MKN45/TBL1XR1 cells was significantly inhibited. Moreover, the EMT phenotypes induced by overexpression of TBL1XR1 were also reversed after the treatment with XAV939 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of β-catenin induced by overexpression of TBL1XR1 was not affected by U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that TBL1XR1 promotes the activation of ERK1/2 and EMT in GC cells by activating the β-catenin signalling.</p>
<p>To further determine how TBLXR1 activates ERK1/2 by β-catenin signalling, we detected the expression of MMP7 (Matrix metalloproteinase-7), a target gene of β-catenin, in GC cells. We showed that MMP7 was elevated or downregulated in TBL1XR1-overexpressing or TBL1XR1-silencing GC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a and b</xref>). It has been reported that MMP7 is responsible for EGF receptor (EGFR) transactivation, downstream ERK activation and increased cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> This pathway is also confirmed in our study using β-catenin, MMP7, EGFR and ERK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We showed that TBL1XR1 knockdown significantly decreased the expression of p-β-catenin, MMP7, pEGFR and pERK1/2 in NCI-N87 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). However, TBL1XR1 overexpression showed the opposite results in BGC823 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Moreover, Batimastat (MMP7 inhibitor) inhibited the expression of MMP7, pEGFR and pERK, but had no effects on the expression of TBL1XR1 and p-β-catenin in both NCI-N87 and BGC823/TBL1XR1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c and d</xref>). Furthermore, Afatinib (EGFR inhibitor) attenuated the activation of EGFR and ERK, but had no effects on the expression of TBL1XR1, p-β-catenin and MMP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that TBL1XR1 indirectly promotes the activation of ERK1/2 via the β-catenin/MMP7/EGFR signalling pathway.</p>

<p>We further evaluated whether TBL1XR1 knockdown or overexpression could regulate gastric tumour growth and metastatic potential <italic>in vivo</italic>. NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-sh cells, NCI-N87/nc-shRNA cells, BGC823/TBL1XR1 and BGC823/vector cells were subcutaneously transplanted into the nude mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7a–d</xref>, NCI-N87/nc-shRNA and BGC823/TBL1XR1 cells showed progressive growth, whereas the growth of NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-sh and BGC823/vector cells was significantly slower compared with NCI-N87/nc-shRNA and BGC823/TBL1XR1 cells. Additionally, the average weight of tumours generated from NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-sh and BGC823/vector cells was significantly reduced in comparison with tumours from the NCI-N87/nc-shRNA and BGC823/TBL1XR1 cells (0.989±0.094 g vs 4.290±0.224 g, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, 1.581±0.116 g vs 3.679±0.210 g, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7e and f</xref>). To further assess whether the regulation of cell proliferation, EMT and the ERK1/2 pathway by TBL1XR1 could be recapitulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, we analysed the expression of Ki-67 antigen (a cellular marker for proliferation), pERK1/2, E-cadherin and ZEB2 protein expression by IHC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>, there were fewer Ki-67 antigen-positive cells in tumours derived from NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-sh cells than in tumours derived from NCI-N87/nc-shRNA cells. Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data shown above, the expression of pERK1/2 and ZEB2 in NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-sh cells was also significantly lower than in NCI-N87/nc-shRNA cells, while E-cadherin showed increased expression in NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-sh cells. This further indicated that the knockdown of TBL1XR1 expression could inhibit cell growth and EMT of GC cells via the ERK1/2 pathway.</p>
<p>To further quantify metastatic and dissemination potential <italic>in vivo</italic>, NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-sh and NCI-N87/nc-shRNA cells were intraperitoneally transplanted into nude mice. The average volume of ascites NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-sh group was smaller than NCI-N87/nc-shRNA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>). Moreover, there were significantly fewer visible peritoneal nodules in the NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-sh group compared with controls (7.667±1.202 vs 28.670±3.180, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7i and k</xref>). In contrast, treatment of nude mice with BGC823/TBL1XR1 cells increased the formation of peritoneal metastatic nodules compared with BGC823/vector cell treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7j and l</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the biological role of TBL1XR1 and its precise mechanisms in GC. The data show that TBL1XR1 expression is elevated in GC cells and closely correlated with poor prognosis of GC patients. Moreover, the data further reveal a potential molecular mechanism by which TBL1XR1 promotes tumorigenesis and progression of GC via activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. These findings indicate the key role of TBL1XR1 as an oncogenic protein and uncover a novel molecular mechanism underlying the development and progression of GC.</p>
<p>Overexpression of TBL1XR1 has been confirmed in several types of cancer, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, squamous cell lung carcinoma, cervical cancer and breast cancer. Liu <italic>et al</italic> found that overexpression of TBL1XR1 enhanced lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and was positively correlated with tumour stage and overall survival,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> which suggest that TBL1XR1 might serve as an independent unfavourable prognostic factor for outcome of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients. TBL1XR1 amplification has also been shown in breast cancer, and inactivation of TBL1XR1 attenuated tumour cell migration and invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Here, we find that TBL1XR1 is upregulated in GC cells, and correlates with clinicopathological characteristics such as local invasion and late TNM stage. Furthermore, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis shows that patients with high TBL1XR1 expression have a shorter overall survival. Thus, these results indicate that TBL1XR1 can act as a novel predictor of poor prognosis in human GC patients.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidences indicate that TBL1XR1 has an important role in cell cycle regulation, anti-apoptosis, inflammatory responses, resistance to therapies and EMT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> In accordance with previous studies, we find that TBL1XR1 acts as a multifunctional protein that affects tumour cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and knockdown of TBL1XR1 significantly inhibited gastric tumour growth and metastatic potential both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Notably, TBL1XR1 inactivation attenuates GC cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Aberrant apoptotic events are closely involved in oncogenesis and tumour regression in numerous cancers, including GC. Thus, elevated TBL1XR1 conferred growth advantages to GC cells, which may be linked to the chemoresistance of GC. However, further studies are needed to support this hypothesis. EMT, a well-characterized embryological process, contributes to the enhanced motility and invasiveness of cancer cells, which is critical to tumour metastasis. Present data demonstrate that TBL1XR1 status regulates the EMT phenotype, cell migration, invasion and the formation of experimental peritoneal metastasis. Thus, TBL1XR1 overexpression in GC promoting tumour aggressiveness suggests that TBL1XR1 could be a feasible target in cancer therapy.</p>
<p>Multiple different signalling pathways, including NF-kB, Wnt/β-catenin, ERK1/2 and JAK/STAT3, have been reported to regulate EMT in tumour progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> ERK1/2 is one of the most important pathways contributing to cell proliferation, EMT and metastasis during tumorigenesis, and the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and ZEB1 mediated by the ERK1/2 pathway during EMT is regulated by the corepressor CtBP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Researchers have shown that gene activation in cancer requires the dismissal of both N-CoR/SMRT- and CtBP1/2-dependent repression, via the interaction of TBL1XR1 and TBL1, which allow the ubiquitination and degradation of N-CoR/SMRT- and CtBP1/2, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> In the present study, we show that the tumour-promoting effects induced by TBL1XR1 in GC are mediated through the activation of ERK1/2 pathway. TBL1XR1 knockdown attenuated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and consequently led to decreased cell growth, migration, invasion and EMT in GC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, TBL1XR1 overexpression exhibited the opposite results, which supports that TBL1XR1 is an upstream activator of ERK1/2 and serves as an important regulator of cell growth and EMT. Additionally, we find that the inhibitory effects of ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 on GC cells are much more significant than those of silencing TBL1XR1 alone. We consider that there are several reasons resulting in such phenotypes. First, ERK1/2 is known as a convergence point of multiple tumour-promoting cascades, and TBL1XR1 is one of these receptors that can activate the ERK1/2 signalling pathway in tumour microenvironment. Second, RNAi usually does not completely shut off the gene, the knockdown efficiency of RNAi was 70–80% in silencing TBL1XR1 expression in GC cells, and the rest unchanged TBL1XR1 might still promote GC progression. Third, we cannot exclude the possibility of the dose effect of MEK inhibitor U0126 on GC cells.</p>
<p>Recent findings have shown that TBL1XR1 and β-catenin can recruit each other to Wnt target gene promoters to facilitate transcription activation and oncogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Beta-catenin activation could promote the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, leading to the increased expression of Bcl-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> The activation of ERK1/2 mediated by TBL1XR1 was dependent on the phosphorylation of β-catenin. Wang <italic>et al</italic> have indicated that TBL1XR1 could promote EMT via the β-catenin signalling pathway in cervical cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> MMP7 (Matrix metalloproteinase-7) serves as a target gene of β-catenin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> Beta-catenin activation promotes prostate tumour progression by upregulating MMP7.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Further study showed that MMP7 is responsible for EGFR transactivation, downstream ERK1/2 activation and increased cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> This signalling pathway is confirmed in our study using β-catenin, MMP7, EGFR and ERK1/2 inhibitors. Here, we find that β-catenin, MMP7 and EGFR are involved in the activation of ERK1/2 induced by TBL1XR1, and treatment of GC cells with β-catenin inhibitor XAV939, MMP inhibitor Batimastat or EGFR inhibitor Afatinib leads to the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and reversion of EMT induced by overexpression of TBL1XR1. Thus, these data indicate that the activation of ERK1/2 induced by TBL1XR1 is dependent on the β-catenin/MMP7/EGFR signalling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that TBL1XR1 plays a crucial role in tumour growth, metastasis and prognosis via activation of the β-catenin/MMP7/EGFR/ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, this study links TBL1XR1/β-catenin/MMP7/EGFR/ERK signalling to the control of the progression of GC and establishes TBL1XR1 as a potential biomarker for clinical prognosis and a therapeutic target in GC.</p>

<title>Plasmids construction and transfection</title>
<p>TBL1XR1 shRNA sequences and negative control sequences were designed and synthesized by Genechem (Genechem Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). The corresponding vector was hU6-MCS-Ubiquitin-EGFP-IRES-puromycin. SGC7901 and NCI-N87 cells were cultured in six-well plates and transfected with 4 μg shRNA plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were treated with puromycin (1 μg/ml) (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) to produce stably transfected cells (NCI-N87/nc-shRNA, NCI-N87/TBL1XR1-shRNA, SGC7901/nc-shRNA and SGC7901/TBL1XR1-shRNA) for further experiments. The full length TBL1XR1 cDNA was synthesized by RT-PCR from GC tissues. And then TBL1XR1 cDNA was sub-cloned into the CN550-pLOV-EF1a-PuroR-CMV-eGFP-2A-3FLAG plasmid (Obio Technology Co.

<title>Cell migration, invasion and wound healing assays</title>
<p>Cell migration and invasion assays were conducted using 24-well plates and 8 μm transwell inserts (Corning Life Science, Acton, MA, USA). For migration assays, tumour cells were suspended in 200 μl serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells) and cultured in the upper chamber. Fetal bovine serum-conditioned medium (10%) (800 μl) was added to the lower 24-well plates. For invasion assays, the inserts were coated with Matrigel (50 μl/well) (BD Biosciences) before adding the cells. After 24 h of culture, tumour cells remaining in the upper side of the inserts were removed with cotton swabs. Tumour cells that migrated to the lower side of the inserts were fixed in methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 20 min. Migrated cells were photographed using Nikon Digital Sight DS-U2 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and Olympus BX50 microscopes (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Six visual fields were randomly chosen to calculate the number of migrated cells. For the wound healing assay, tumour cells were cultured in six-well plates until confluent, and scratched with a 20 μl pipette tip. The previous medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were photographed at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h after the scratches were made.</p>
