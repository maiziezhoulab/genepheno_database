<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Neurodevelopment requires precise regulation of gene expression, including post-transcriptional regulatory events such as alternative splicing and mRNA translation. However, translational regulation of specific isoforms during neurodevelopment and the mechanisms behind it remain unknown. Using RNA-seq analysis of mouse neocortical polysomes, here we report translationally repressed and derepressed mRNA isoforms during neocortical neurogenesis whose orthologs include risk genes for neurodevelopmental disorders. We demonstrate that the translation of distinct mRNA isoforms of the RNA binding protein (RBP), <italic>Elavl4</italic>, in radial glia progenitors and early neurons depends on its alternative 5′ UTRs. Furthermore, 5′ UTR-driven <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoform-specific translation depends on upstream control by another RBP, Celf1. Celf1 regulation of <italic>Elavl4</italic> translation dictates development of glutamatergic neurons. Our findings reveal a dynamic interplay between distinct RBPs and alternative 5′ UTRs in neuronal development and underscore the risk of post-transcriptional dysregulation in co-occurring neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">The mature neocortex generates complex behaviors including high-level cognition and voluntary motor functions. In the prenatal neocortex, neural stem cells called radial glia progenitors (RG) sequentially give rise to distinct subpopulations of glutamatergic neurons that are critical for normal circuits and functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. RG and glutamatergic neurons execute transcriptional and post-transcriptional programs that drive their development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Post-transcriptional regulatory programs include alternative splicing of mRNA isoforms that determine cell fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and the regulation of mRNA translation (protein synthesis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These two mechanisms are interconnected, as alternative mRNA sequences may yield distinct interactions with translational machinery.</p>
<p id="Par4">Translational control is facilitated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which often act on regulatory elements found in 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. UTRs are sites where multiple trans-acting factors may compete or cooperate to affect translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Alternatively spliced 3′ UTRs not only influence translation efficiency, but also modify the localization and stability of mRNAs in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Alternative 5′ UTRs are upstream of the start codon and are in a powerful position to dictate translational efficiency of a given mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Yet, the effect of alternative 5′ UTRs on translation and how multiple RBPs interact with them to dictate neuronal development are unknown.</p>
<p id="Par5">Two RBPs in the Embryonic Lethal, Abnormal Vision, Drosophila, homolog-Like 4 family, Elavl4 (HuD) and Elavl1 (HuR), regulate neocortical development and mRNA translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Elavl4 deletion in mice results in seizures and repetitive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> reminiscent of phenotypes observed in individuals with comorbid epileptic encephalopathy (EE) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These behavioral anomalies are accompanied by anatomically disrupted glutamatergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Another RBP, the CUGBP Elavl Family Member 1 (Celf1/Cugbp1), is highly expressed during neocortical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. While Celf1 mediates multiple post-transcriptional steps in other systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, its role in developing neocortical progenitors and neurons remains unknown. In addition, it is still poorly understood if and how distinct mRNA isoforms are translationally regulated in space and time during neuronal development.</p>
<p id="Par6">Here, we provide a genome-wide screen of mRNA isoforms during prenatal neocortical neurogenesis and their translational patterns of repression and de-repression. Remarkably, human orthologues of many of these translationally-regulated mRNAs are encoded by known risk genes for comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., EE, ASD, and intellectual disability). We demonstrate that uncontrolled translation of <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms in RG and early neurons leads to defective development of glutamatergic neurons. Moreover, selective translation of distinct <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms via their alternative 5′ UTRs determines neuronal development. We also report that Celf1 is an upstream regulator of 5′ UTR-driven translation and plays a role in neuronal development through <italic>Elavl4</italic>. Finally, we provide the first evidence in both mouse and human neocortex that CELF1 and ELAVL4 proteins are markers of early and late ventral RG, respectively. Our work represents an advancement in understanding the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of RBP-regulated translation of distinct isoforms via alternative 5′ UTRs. Moreover, we provide evidence for the implications of this novel mechanism for neurodevelopment.</p>

<title>RBP isoforms are translationally regulated during development</title>
<p id="Par7">Our previous data has suggested that there are dynamic changes in transcript translation between E13 and E16 and especially of mRNA translation regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Yet, the exact mRNAs and associated isoforms affected by these changes were unknown. To identify translationally-regulated isoforms, we performed an unbiased RNA-seq screen by polysome profiling of dissected wild type (WT) E13 (early neurogenesis) and E16 (mid-to-late neurogenesis) neocortices. We compared isoform levels in total mRNA and in translationally distinct fractions: 40S-60S-80S (including monosome) and polysomal fractions.</p>
<p id="Par8">Multidimensional scaling revealed clusters distinguished by embryonic stage and fraction, confirming the reproducibility of replicates and the unique profiles of free and polysome-associated isoforms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). The volcano plot of these data contains groups of isoforms that are potentially in diverse states of transcriptional or translational regulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). One group includes isoforms that are differentially expressed in their steady state levels, suggesting transcriptional regulation or changes in mRNA stability between E13 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, gold dots) and E16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, green dots). The vast majority of isoforms showed steady state expression between E13 and E16 (30,073 isoforms; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, black dots). Most of these had comparable association with either monosome or polysome fractions (20,643 isoforms; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). However, within the 2114 isoforms that have steady state levels and altered their association with polysomes, 1143 mRNAs decreased association with polysomes between E13 and E16. We define these mRNAs as our set of potentially “translationally repressed mRNA isoforms” for further exploration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>, top). The 971 mRNA isoforms that were unchanged in total steady state levels but exhibited increased association with polysomes between E13 and E16 are defined as our set of “translationally derepressed mRNAs” (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>, bottom).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Elavl4 is translationally repressed during early neocortical neurogenesis.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Multidimensional scaling of neocortical tissue samples from E13 and E16 input (total RNA), 40S-60S-80S, and polysome fractions (<italic>n</italic> = 3 spins).

<title>Elavl4 is derepressed as neocortical neurogenesis proceeds</title>
<p id="Par11">Among the translationally derepressed RBP mRNAs was <italic>Elavl4</italic>. Elavl4 is widely used as an early marker of post-mitotic neuronal differentiation and Elavl4-deficient embryonic neurospheres and adult subventricular zone progenitors demonstrate reduced capacity to differentiate into neuronal lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, the role of this RBP in prenatal neocortical development is unknown. We first established where Elavl4 protein was expressed at key time points during neurogenesis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a pan-isoform antibody showed that Elavl4 is enriched in the cortical plate (CP) where post-mitotic neurons typically reside at E13 and E16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f,</xref> left). Elavl4 was also enriched in the ventricular zone (VZ), where neocortical RG reside, at E16, but not at E13 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f,</xref> right). Using laser capture microdissection (LCM) of the VZ, we identified total <italic>Elavl4</italic> mRNA levels to be unchanged between E13 and E16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>), supporting the idea that <italic>Elavl4</italic> is translationally derepressed between these two stages. Elavl4 colocalized with Nestin and N-Cadherin in RG end-feet in the E16 VZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h,</xref> left, arrowheads). Elavl4 IHC was undetectable in Nestin and N-Cadherin-expressing RG in the VZ of <italic>Elavl4</italic> KO, demonstrating specificity of the antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h,</xref> right)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par12">Since the developing neocortex has a heterogeneous cell population, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on <italic>Nestin-GFP</italic> transgenic mice to selectively isolate RG that typically express Nestin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>).

<p id="Par14">We next aimed to understand Elavl4 isoform-specific protein expression. As there are no isoform-specific Elavl4 antibodies available, we co-transfected E12 and E16 RG with <italic>CAG-GFP</italic> and constructs bearing specific <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoform 5′ UTRs upstream of the <italic>Renilla</italic> coding sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d, f</xref>).

In contrast, <italic>Elavl4-v1&amp;4</italic> 5′ UTR-Renilla was expressed in post-mitotic neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>), which was expected since Elavl4 is a known post-mitotic marker. <italic>Elavl4-v2</italic> and <italic>-v3</italic> 5′ UTR-Renilla were absent from post-mitotic neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Elavl4-v1&amp;4</italic> are the isoforms detected by the Elavl4 antibody in early neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par15">Remarkably, <italic>Elavl4-v2</italic> and <italic>-v3</italic> 5′ UTR-Renilla were abundantly expressed in the VZ at E17 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>), a stage when we detected Elavl4 protein in the VZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>). <italic>Elavl4-v1&amp;4</italic> 5′ UTR-Renilla was only sporadically observed in VZ mitotic cells at this time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). <italic>Elavl4-v3</italic> 5′ UTR-Renilla expression was low or absent in migrating neurons in the intermediate zone (IZ), while <italic>Elavl4-v2</italic> and <italic>-v1&amp;4</italic> 5′ UTR-Renilla remained expressed in neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>). These data are in line with the polysome fractionation experiment as well as with the expression of Elavl4 protein in the VZ, corroborating specificity of Elavl4 IHC.

<title><italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms are bound by Celf1 in developing neocortices</title>
<p id="Par16">Based on these results, we hypothesized that a translational repressor acts on <italic>Elavl4</italic> at its isoform-specific alternative 5′ UTRs. We first tested whether the 5′ UTRs of all translationally repressed or derepressed mRNAs between E13 and E16 bear specific binding motifs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a, b</xref>). We found the binding motif of RBP Celf1 to be present in 4.71% of the 5′ UTRs of translationally derepressed mRNAs, including <italic>Elavl4s</italic>′ (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>). <italic>Celf1</italic> mRNA expression has previously been reported in developing neocortices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Western blot on LCM-dissected VZ and CP corroborated these observations in the VZ and showed an increase in Celf1 in the CP from E13 to E16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b, c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3c</xref>).

<p id="Par17">To assess whether Celf1 binds <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) was performed on E13 and E16 neocortices using RIP-certified Celf1 antibody and corresponding IgG control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>).

These findings suggest that Celf1 may regulate <italic>Elavl4</italic> mRNA translation in developing neocortices on an isoform-specific level.</p>
<p id="Par18">Therefore, our next goal was to understand how Celf1 acts on <italic>Elavl4</italic> mRNA, as RBPs can affect all steps of post-transcriptional processing from splicing to translation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). Celf1 exists in at least two isoforms: “long” representing the full-length protein and a “short” isoform with a 27 amino acid truncation at the N-terminus (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4b, c</xref>). Functional differences between the two isoforms have not been previously established. Structurally, the RNA recognition motif 1 (RRM1) near the N-terminus is truncated in Celf1 short (Celf1S), while RRM3 near the C-terminus is shared between both isoforms. Comparison of RRM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and RRM3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> structures suggests their binding modes have meaningful differences.</p>
<p id="Par19">To investigate functional differences between the two isoforms, we turned to the Neuroblastoma (N2a) cell line for overexpression (OE) experiments.

<p id="Par34">The data thus far suggest that <italic>Celf1</italic> reduction leads to a selective neuronal identity misbalance, possibly induced by Elavl4 increase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8c</xref>).

<p id="Par40">We next wanted to determine if the CELF1 and ELAVL4 protein expression patterns in human developing neocortices resemble those we found in mice. We found conserved changes in ELAVL4 and CELF1 expression in the VZ and SVZ as human neocortical neurogenesis proceeds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9c</xref>). ELAVL4 protein was enriched in the ventral RG of the VZ at later stages of neurogenesis, 17 and 20 post-conceptual weeks (PCW), which was decreased at 10 and 13 PCW. <italic>ELAVL4</italic> mRNA has been reported to be expressed ventral RG and as a novel human intermediate progenitor marker in human developing neocortices between 14 and 16 PCW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In agreement with this, we found ELAVL4-protein expression in the inner subventricular zone (ISVZ) and outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) of all analyzed stages, but also scattered across the periventricular fiber rich zone (PVFRZ) positioned above VZ and ISVZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9c</xref>).

In addition, we found ELAVL4-protein to be expressed in ventral RG after 17 PCW, at later stages of human neurogenesis when CELF1 expression decreases.

<title>Multiple mRNAs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders are translationally regulated in developing neocortices</title>
<p id="Par42">Given the conservation of the expression patterns of ELAVL4 and CELF1 in ventral RG during neocortical development in humans, we sought to explore the disease implications of the translational regulatory mechanisms. Initially, evolutionary constraint scores were computed by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) as a measure of intolerance to damaging mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. We found that RBPs are highly constrained, including the members of the ELAVL family (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). Next, we performed enrichment analyses for published mRNA targets of the neuronal ELAVLs (ELAVL1, CELF1, and CELF4). Various degrees of enrichment were found in risk genes for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) as defined by the DDG2P database, intellectual disability (ID; in OMIM), epileptic encephalopathy (EE; in OMIM) and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10a</xref>). We also found several translationally regulated mRNAs to be targets of an RBP associated with ID and ASD, Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">3</xref>). The human orthologues of the translationally-regulated mRNAs during neocortical development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>) were also found to be constrained (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10b</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par43">Given that these genes are under strong selective pressure, we conjectured that they might be essential for physiological neurodevelopment and vulnerable targets in NDDs. To explore this hypothesis, we cross referenced the list of differentially translated mRNAs at E16 with risk genes for NDDs in the DDG2P database; 61 of the 850 unique human orthologs derepressed at E16 are NDD genes (57 OMIM disease genes); 62 of the 1,070 genes that are repressed at E16 were NDD genes (59 in OMIM) (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>). The mouse orthologs of genes associated with EE (e.g., <italic>GRIN1</italic> and <italic>GABRA1</italic>), ID (e.g., <italic>MEF2C</italic>), and ASD (e.g., <italic>CHD8</italic>, <italic>MYT1L</italic>), often in co-morbidity, were amongst mRNAs showing robust change in their polysome association (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9f</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that genes subjected to translational control during neocorticogenesis, including RBPs, are under strong selective pressure and might contribute to the vulnerability leading to NDDs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par44">The data contained herein demonstrate that one mechanism to achieve the incredible diversity of glutamatergic neurons is translational control by specific RBPs acting on alternative 5′ UTRs of corresponding mRNAs. We demonstrate that identity, subpopulation balance, and connectivity of neocortical glutamatergic neurons are dependent on translational control of <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms at the 5′ UTRs by Celf1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10</xref>). Previously, selective isoform-specific protein synthesis (mRNA translation) and the role of timed releases of translational breaks in any system was poorly understood.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><title>Summary graphic.</title><p>Development of glutamatergic neurons is regulated by Celf1 translational repression of <italic>Elavl4</italic> through its 5ʼ UTRs.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e3698" xlink:href="41467_2020_15412_Fig10_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par45">To our knowledge, our study is the first genome-wide report of isoforms that are translationally repressed and derepressed during neocortical neurogenesis; many of these translationally-regulated genes turn out to be implicated in the etiology of NDDs. Our findings reveal that a robust set of mRNAs and their isoforms are poised to be translated rapidly at an appropriate time point. This sets up not only a highly plastic environment, but also a vulnerable one during cellular development.</p>
<p id="Par46">The pattern of timed translational repression/derepression we revealed applies to <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms. The diverse effects of translational control on <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms within early and late RG and neurons is due to their alternative 5′ UTRs. The presence of specific 5′ UTRs in <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms reversed LL subpopulation-specific glutamatergic phenotypes that were seen with the OE of unregulated <italic>Elavl4</italic>. The differential identity acquisition seen in our cell subtype-specific experiments may further rely on available cell-specific transcripts that RBPs selectively act upon; as 5′ UTR-driven expression favors expression in one subtype identity over another. <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms also teach us that the significance of an mRNA cannot be guessed by its abundance. While <italic>Elavl4-v3</italic> and <italic>Elavl4-v1&amp;v4</italic> are heavily regulated by Celf1, <italic>Elavl4-v2</italic> is less influenced by Celf1. Yet, <italic>Elavl4-v2</italic> is the isoform with the highest abundance. Besides differences in their 5′ UTRs and expression patterns, <italic>Elavl4-v3</italic> and <italic>-v4</italic> exhibit important differences in their “linker” regions positioned between the RNA binding domains, which was found to determine its association with polysomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Therefore, both the UTR and CDS may account for the differential phenotypes that are reflected in the isoform-specific experiments of our study.</p>
<p id="Par47">Our screen led us to investigate another RBP, Celf1, which acts as an upstream regulator of <italic>Elavl4</italic> at its alternative 5′ UTRs. We found that Celf1 suppressed translation of distinct <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms by binding their alternative 5′ UTRs. Mutation of Celf1 binding sites also abolished the subpopulation phenotype observed upon OE of <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoforms with their native 5′ UTRs. Given the number of common binding motifs associated with other RBPs in our screen, Celf1 is likely only one example of an RBP that is an isoform-specific translation regulator and that has broad impacts across cell types during neocortical neurogenesis. Nevertheless, our findings underscore the potential diversity in expression that alternative splicing and precise dynamics of selective isoform translation provides.</p>
<p id="Par48">We also report for the first time that Celf1 silencing itself disrupted the identity, subpopulation balance, and connectivity of glutamatergic neurons. This phenotype can be reversed by silencing of the translationally derepressed <italic>Elavl4</italic> isoform, <italic>Elavl4-v3</italic>. The OE of Celf1 also leads to disrupted development of glutamatergic neurons that can be corrected by overexpressing <italic>Elavl4-v3</italic> bearing its native 5′ UTR. These findings reaffirm that <italic>Elavl4</italic> is downstream to Celf1 and demonstrate that both an upstream regulator and its mRNA target with native regulatory sites work together to give us a balanced neocortex. It is reasonable to expect that other regulators like miRNAs or other RBPs will also compete with Celf1 to not only bind, but also to regulate Elavl4 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par49">There is immense potential for increased understanding of NDDs by studying the mechanisms that control translation during development. Our study has revealed the magnitude of translationally repressed and derepressed mRNAs and their associated isoforms. Disrupted functions and mutations of RBPs are linked with several NDDs associated with abnormal neocortical development. This is particularly interesting given the various neuroanatomical aberrations caused by Celf1 and Elavl4 disruptions. Indeed, prenatal deletion of <italic>Elavl4</italic> has been associated with disrupted development of neocortical circuits, misbalance of glutamatergic identities, seizure susceptibility, and autism-like repetitive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Another paradigmatic example of an RBP associated with NDD is Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by loss of the FMRP and the translational control it executes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.

We found that both CELF1 and ELAVL4 are expressed in developing prenatal human neocortices suggesting their roles and vulnerability to disruption during development. RBPs can thus have diverse effects in different NDDs by causing global misregulation of their mRNAs. This suggests a previously overlooked mechanism contributing to the manifestation of comorbid conditions. Future studies are needed to elucidate the complete picture of collaborative and competitive differences in the control of isoform-specific 5′ UTRs, which we can now appreciate as critical in fully understanding how neocortical RG and neurons develop.</p>

<p id="Par72">All images except from human were taken with an Olympus BX61WI confocal microscope using 10 ×, 20×, or 60× objectives and processed using Fluoview FV-1000. Human IHC was analyzed using Leica TCS SP8 X FLIM confocal microscope. All representative images and images used in analysis were taken with the same confocal settings per experiment to allow for accurate comparisons of fluorescent intensity. Sections were imaged from the top of the cortical plate to the VZ and merged in the photo editing software Gimp2 and Fiji<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. For quantifications of binned images, a rectangle approximately a third of the width of the image was drawn from CC to the tops of the apical tufts at the pia. The rectangle with split into ten equal bins from CC to pia. Cells were counted per condition as appropriate for the experiment, either GFP+ or GFP+ colocalized with a layer marker. DAPI was used to confirm cell nuclei.</p>

<title>RNA immunoprecipitation</title>
<p id="Par73">Six of E13 or E16 neocortices were dissected, pooled together, and considered to be one biological sample. Three biological samples were used for RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments. CELF1 RNA immunoprecipitation validated antibody (Millipore, Cat. no. 03-104) was used coupled to EZ-Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore, Cat. no. 17-701) and qRT-PCR analysis. For each target tested, three qRT-PCR technical replicates were done from each immunoprecipitation of each biological sample. To examine Celf1 binding to <italic>Elavl4</italic> 5′ UTR, the <italic>Elavl4-v3</italic> (or <italic>v4</italic>) 5′ UTR-Renilla + <italic>Celf1S</italic> OE constructs (0.2 and 1 µg/12-well plate) were co-transfected into N2a cells, which were then incubated for 3 days. 10<sup>7</sup> cells were used for one RIP experiment of IgG or Celf1 and followed by the Millipore RIP kit. The effect of Celf1 binding to <italic>Elavl4-v3</italic> (or <italic>v4</italic>) 5′ UTR was measured with a Renilla TaqMan probe. 3–4 replicates of qRT-PCR were performed for each RIP.</p>

<sec id="Sec35">
<title>Western blot</title>
<p id="Par74">Neocortical tissue and N2a cells were lysed in Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Cat. no. 78510) and protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce 660 nm reagent (Thermo Fisher, Cat. no. 22660) on a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotomer. Protein samples were analyzed using the NuPAGE system (Life Technologies) per manufacturer’s instructions and with 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Cat. no. NP0335/6) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GVS Life Sciences, Cat. no. 1215471). The resulting membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dried milk (VWR, Cat. no. M203) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini, 900-108) in PBS with 0.4% Triton-X-100 (PBST). Primary antibody was added and the blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C gently shaking, followed by three washes in PBST. Secondary antibody diluted in 10% FBS in PBST was then added for 1 h. Development of blots was performed with ChemiGlow West Chemiluminescence Substrate Kit (Proteinsimple, Cat. no. 60-12596-00-2) and visualized with Gbox (Syngene). Quantification of band intensity was performed with GeneTools (Syngene) and Fiji<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. The experimental protein of interest was normalized to Gapdh levels on the same blot. At least three biological replicates were performed for all analyses and an ANOVA or Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare averages, as appropriate. <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Laser capture micro dissection</title>
<p id="Par75">Whole brains were dissected from developing embryos at E13 or E16 in an RNAse-free environment and flash frozen. Brains were then sectioned into 60 µm slices on a cryostat at −20 °C and placed onto Molecular Machines &amp; Industries (MMI) RNAse Free Membrane Slides (MMI AG, Cat. no. 50102). The sections were rinsed with nuclease-free water and immersed for 1 min in 95% ethanol. Dried slides were subjected to microdissection using an MMI SmartCut Plus microscope. Neocortical compartments were determined by the cytoarchitecture of cresyl violet-stained tissue. Brains underwent laser capture microdissection of the ventricular zone and cortical plate. RNA was harvested from compartmentalized tissue using the RNAqueous-micro kit LCM protocol (Ambion). RNA from at least three brains was analyzed per experiment (<italic>n</italic> = 3) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR, see below). Significant changes between conditions were analyzed using the ΔΔCt method. A student’s t-test or ANOVA was performed to evaluate significant changes and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Preparation and FACS sorting of GFP+ cells</title>
<p id="Par76">WT female CD1 mice were crossed with Nestin-GFP or Tbr2-GFP males for timed pregnancies. The morning of plug observation was considered to be E0.5. Embryos were taken at E13 or E16 and observed under a dissecting microscope for GFP expression. GFP+ neocortices were dissected, pooled together. and single cell suspension per pregnant animal was prepared as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. GFP+ cells were then FACS-sorted at the local Rutgers University Facility, spun down, and immediately homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen) for further RNA and protein isolation. Average values for cells obtained (from three separate spins): E13 Nestin-GFP, 348 K cells; E16 Nestin-GFP, 1.73 M; E13 Tbr2-GFP, 128 K; E16 Tbr2-GFP, 525 K. Sample purity was determined through ROI determination as well as post-sort visual examination on a fluorescent microscope at the facility.</p>

<title>Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)</title>
<p id="Par77">RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) per manufacturer instructions and as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. After ethanol was removed from the precipitate, the mRNA pellet was resuspended in 20–30 µL of water. Residual DNA was removed by incubating the mRNA with Turbo DNAse in DNAse buffer, and then the DNAse was inactivated with the DNAse inactivation reagent (Invitrogen, AM1907). The mRNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. For LCM samples, 10–25 ng of total RNA was used per reaction. For all other reactions, 50 ng per reaction was used. The Applied Biosystems StepOne Real-Time System and reagents (TaqMan RNA-to-Ct 1-Step Kit, Thermo Fisher, #4392938) were used to perform qRT-PCR. The results were analyzed using the ∆∆Ct method with <italic>Gapdh</italic> as a normalization control unless otherwise specified. For qRT-PCR of <italic>Elavl4</italic> variants, commercially available TaqMan probes (Thermo Fisher) were obtained.</p>

<title>In utero electroporation</title>
<p id="Par78">In utero electroporation (IUE) was performed at E12, E13, or E16 and analyzed at E13, E17, P0, or P7 as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Co-transfections accomplished with approximately 1 µL of mix containing 3.5–4 µg/µL of the control vector or the vector of interest along with 4 µg/µl CAG-GFP reporter in a 4:1 ratio (construct:reporter). For rescue experiments, 8 µg/µL of the shRNA and overexpression vectors were combined and injected to achieve the final concentration of the OE experiments (~3.5–4 µg of construct, ~800–900 ng of reporter, per µl). For each IUE, at least three transfected neocortices were used in experiments and this is indicated in figure legends with the “<italic>n</italic>” value. Two to five sections from each transfected per staining were used in quantifications.</p>

<title>Renilla luciferase reporter assay</title>
<p id="Par80">N2a cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected the next day with 0.2 µg of either of the <italic>Elavl4</italic> 5′ UTR-Renilla reporter vectors and 1 µg of either the Ctrl OE, <italic>Celf1S</italic> OE, or <italic>Celf1L</italic> OE vectors. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized with TrypLE Express (Gibco, Cat. no. 12604-021) and divided equally into two fractions. One fraction of the cells was spun down and lysed at room temperature for 15 min with 250 µL of 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, in Ref# E1910 Kit). The other fraction of cells was used for RNA isolation using TRIzol (Invitrogen). All protein lysates were quantified with the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay reagent (Thermo Fisher) on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and normalized to the same concentration with lysis buffer for equal loading. To measure the Renilla luminescence (REN), 10 µL of normalized protein lysate was mixed with 50 µL of working solution made from the LightSwitch Luciferase Assay Reagent (SwitchGear Genomics, Cat. no. 32035). REN readings were immediately performed on a GloMax 20/20 luminometer (Promega). The levels of Renilla mRNA (<italic>Ren</italic>) with 50 ng of Turbo DNase (Invitrogen, Cat. no. AM2238) treated RNA fraction were quantified by qRT-PCR using the custom made Taqman probe Rensp (Thermo Fisher). The REN luminescence readings were then normalized to <italic>Ren</italic> mRNA levels for each sample. Each assay condition was performed with at least three biological replicates. ANOVA or Student t-test statistical comparisons of REN/<italic>Ren</italic> between experimental conditions were performed. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. The same approach was used for experiments with <italic>Celf1</italic> knockdown except that cells were harvested 72 h after co-transfection of reporter plasmids with the control shRNA or <italic>Celf1</italic> shRNA plasmid. Similar experiments were also conducted for <italic>Elavl4</italic> 3′ UTR reporter gene assay, except that the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) was used for determining the Firefly Luciferase luminescence.</p>

For the enrichment analyses, we used ELAVL1, nELAVLs, CELF4 and CELF1 genes are input sets, the NDD_DDG2P, EE_OMIM, ID_OMIM, and ASD_Satterstrom as target sets, and 19,584 unique human genes as background set. For each comparison between the input and target sets, we first constructed the empirical distribution by sampling the same number of genes as in the input set from the background set 10,000 times. The P value was then computed by calculating the number of sampled gene lists that had at least as many overlapping genes with the target sets as the input set, divided by 10,000 iterations.</p>
