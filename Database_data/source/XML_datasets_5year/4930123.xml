<abstract>
<p>A genome-wide differential expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) was identified
in blood specimens of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A total of 3929 lncRNAs were
found to be differentially expressed in ASD peripheral leukocytes, including 2407
that were upregulated and 1522 that were downregulated. Simultaneously, 2591
messenger RNAs (mRNAs), including 1789 upregulated and 821 downregulated, were also
identified in ASD leukocytes. Functional pathway analysis of these lncRNAs revealed
neurological pathways of the synaptic vesicle cycling, long-term depression and
long-term potentiation to be primarily involved. Thirteen synaptic lncRNAs, including
nine upregulated and four downregulated, and 19 synaptic mRNAs, including 12
upregulated and seven downregulated, were identified as being differentially
expressed in ASD. Our identification of differential expression of synaptic lncRNAs
and mRNAs suggested that synaptic vesicle transportation and cycling are important
for the delivery of synaptosomal protein(s) between presynaptic and postsynaptic
membranes in ASD. Finding of 19 lncRNAs, which are the antisense, bi-directional and
intergenic, of <italic>HOX</italic> genes may lead us to investigate the role of <italic>HOX</italic>
genes involved in the development of ASD. Discovery of the lncRNAs of
<italic>SHANK2-AS</italic> and <italic>BDNF-AS</italic>, the natural antisense of genes
<italic>SHANK2</italic> and <italic>BDNF</italic>, respectively, indicates that in addition to
gene mutations, deregulation of lncRNAs on ASD-causing gene loci presents a new
approach for exploring possible epigenetic mechanisms underlying ASD. Our study also
opened a new avenue for exploring the use of lncRNA(s) as biomarker(s) for the early
detection of ASD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a reported prevalence of 1 in 68 children in the
United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> ASD is a grouping of
lifelong neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by impairments in reciprocal
social interaction and communication, and the presence of stereotypical behaviors,
interests or activities. The etiology of ASD is not yet well understood. Although
mutations of many genes, including <italic>NLGN3, NLGN4, NRXN1, SHANK2, SHANK3 and
PTCHD1</italic>, have been associated with ASD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> metabolic, infectious, inflammatory and
other environmental factors have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of
ASD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> We previously
determined that hypermethylation of the <italic>ENO2</italic> gene is present in 15%
of children with ASD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> indicating that
epigenetic factor(s) may contribute to the etiology of ASD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> In addition, as
transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators, both microRNAs (miRNAs) and long
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in ASD as well as in many
other neurological disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Overexpression and knockdown studies have shown
that lncRNAs have important roles in regulating a variety of processes, including
splicing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup>
transcription,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup>
localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> and the organization
of subcellular compartments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Underscoring
the importance of lncRNAs' regulatory roles is their emergence as essential
components in the etiology of many disorders, and of complex diseases in particular,
for which genetic and environmental interactions have key roles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>LncRNAs are a subset of RNA molecules greater than 200 nt in length that are
transcribed but not translated. They may be positioned in genomic sequences as
antisense, intronic and large intergenic noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), as well as at
promoter-associated and untranslated regions, which function as <italic>cis</italic> or
<italic>trans</italic> regulators. LncRNAs can function as translational and
posttranslational regulators of brain development and differentiation, and are
associated with various human brain disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> LncRNAs have been reported to be involved in
many complex diseases, including neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases,
cardiovascular disease, immune dysfunction and auto-immunity, carcinogenesis and
reproductive diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Deregulation of lncRNAs is becoming recognized as a major
feature of many types of diseases. Importantly, cancer-associated lncRNAs may serve
as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers and provide targets for new therapeutic
strategies for selective silencing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Among
168 human diseases that have been found to be associated with lncRNAs, and that are
recorded in the <italic>lncrnadisease</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/lncrnadisease" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/lncrnadisease</ext-link>) database, neurological diseases,
cardiovascular diseases and cancers account for 8.3%, 10.7% and
40.5%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Altered lncRNA levels have been identified in ASD brains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> In one study of
~33 000 annotated lncRNAs and 30 000 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts
from the postmortem prefrontal cortex and cerebellar tissues of two ASD and two
control subjects, over 200 differentially expressed lncRNAs were detected. These
differentially expressed lncRNAs in the ASD subjects were enriched for genomic
regions containing genes related to neurodevelopment and neuropsychiatric diseases.
Comparison of differences in the expression of mRNAs between the prefrontal cortex
and the cerebellum within individual ASD brains showed more transcriptional
homogeneity than within control brains. This finding was also true of the lncRNA
transcriptome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> Abnormalities in
mRNA expression in ASD have also been observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
which are safely and easily assayed in infants and offer the potential of a
peripheral blood-based, early biomarker panel to detect risk for ASD in infants and
toddlers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> We undertook this study
to determine whether lncRNAs are differentially expressed in the blood of individuals
with ASD, rather than in ASD brains. Our positive findings may open a new approach to
investigate potential epigenetic mechanisms underlying ASD and to explore biomarker
identifications for possible clinical screening and diagnosis of ASD.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>The Hospital Ethics Committee reviewed and approved the research project. Informed
consent was obtained from the parents of the participating children. All the
material and data were previously de-identified and coded, and were anonymous to
the investigators.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Twenty-five pairs of gender- and age-matched Chinese ASD and control children were
recruited for this discovery study at their first-time clinical visit before any
clinical laboratory studies, intervention or medication. The children with ASD
were clinically diagnosed by means of DSM-IV criteria and did not have epilepsy,
any physical disabilities or family history of ASD. The controls were
phenotypically and developmentally normal children who were undergoing an annual
health checkup. There were 17 pairs of boys and eight pairs of girls, 3–5
years of age, in both the ASD and control groups. Lymphocytes were isolated from 3
to 5 ml of peripheral blood specimens of the Caucasian participants and
stored at −70 °C until total RNA was extracted with a Qiagen Mini
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). In addition, total RNAs, isolated from 10
lymphoblast cell lines derived from Caucasian children (seven boys and three
girls, aged 3 to 8 years) with ASD, were subjected to the validation study. There
were no Caucasian control samples used for the validation.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Microarray hybridization</title>
<p>The Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arraystar.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.arraystar.com</ext-link>), which detects genome-wide lncRNAs and
mRNAs simultaneously, was used for this study. This array covers 33 045
lncRNAs and 30 218 mRNAs that were identified from authoritative data
sources, including RefSeq, UCSC Knowngenes and Ensembl. RNA labeling and array
hybridizations were performed according to the Agilent One-Color Microarray-Based
Gene Expression Analysis protocol (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
with minor modifications. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA after the
removal of ribosomal RNA with the mRNA-ONLY Eukaryotic mRNA Isolation Kit
(Epicentre, Omaha, NE, USA). Each sample was amplified and transcribed into
fluorescent complementary RNA (cRNA) along the entire length of the transcripts
without a 3′ bias, utilizing the random priming method. The labeled cRNAs
were purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The concentration and specific
activity of the labeled cRNAs (pmol Cy3 per μg cRNA) were measured with
NanoDrop ND-1000. One microgram of each labeled cRNA was fragmented by adding
5 μl of 10 × blocking agent and 1 μl of 25 ×
fragmentation buffer, and then heating the mixture to 60 °C for
30 min. Finally, 25 μl 2 × GE of hybridization buffer was
added to dilute the labeled cRNA. Fifty microliters of hybridization solution was
dispensed onto the gasket slide and assembled with the lncRNA expression
microarray slide. The slides were incubated for 17 h at 65 °C in
an Agilent hybridization oven. The hybridized arrays were washed, fixed and
scanned by using the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies).
Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 11.0.1.1) was used to analyze the
acquired array images. Quantile normalization and subsequent data processing were
performed using the GeneSpring GX v12.1 software package (Agilent Technologies).
After normalization of the raw data, lncRNAs and mRNAs that had flags (‘All
Targets Value') were chosen for further data analysis. Differentially
expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between the two groups with statistical significance
were identified through volcano plot filtering. Hierarchical clustering was
performed using the Agilent GeneSpring GX software (Version 12.1). Both ‘GO
analysis' and ‘Pathway analysis' were performed with the DAVID
program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov</ext-link>), in which analysis of gene ontology
(GO) and KEGG PATHWAY was conducted. The results were also analyzed using the
genetic and molecular interaction software GeneMANIA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> an algorithm to
determine the relationship between these mRNAs. The bio-functions and canonical
pathways associated with our data were generated by using the core-analysis option
in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>).</p>

<sec>
<title>Quantitative real-time PCR analysis</title>
<p>The total RNA extracted from leukocytes or from lymphoblasts was used to
synthesize cDNA. The expression levels of lncRNAs and of lncRNA-targeted mRNAs
were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative PCR reactions (the
primer sequences used in quantitative PCR are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were performed by the ABI7900 system (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and SYBR green dye SuperArray PCR master mix
(SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). mRNA of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control for quantitative analysis of
lncRNA or mRNA. The lncRNA or mRNA values were normalized to GAPDH levels. For
each lncRNA or mRNA, triple reactions were analyzed simultaneously, and the result
was reported as the relative expression calculated relative to this control. All
the data were given in terms of relative expression of the mean±S.E.
(<italic>n</italic>=10). The data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance
followed by an unpaired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. Differences were considered
significant at <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec>
<title>Differential expression profiles of lncRNA and mRNAs</title>
<p>A total of 3929 lncRNAs were identified as differentially expressed in Chinese ASD
peripheral blood cells, including 2407 that were upregulated and 1522 that were
downregulated. Among these, intergenic lncRNAs were the most common (accounting
for 43%), followed by natural antisense (19%), intronic antisense
(12%), exon sense-overlapping (9%), bi-directional (5%) and
intron sense-overlapping (4%). Five percent of identified lncRNAs belong to
uncharacterized groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).
Simultaneously, 2610 mRNAs, including 1789 upregulated and 821 downregulated, that
were differentially expressed in ASD blood cells genome-wide were also identified.
The entire data set has been deposited in a public domain (DataDryad.org, <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.5061/dryad.d8f84" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">DOI:

</sec>
<sec>
<title>Functional pathways derived from lncRNAs–mRNAs</title>
<p>The gene loci where the lncRNAs are localized were subjected to pathway and gene
ontology analysis. A total of 13 pathways derived from upregulated lncRNAs and 14
from downregulated lncRNAs were identified as being significant in ASD group
(<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). The 10 pathways with the highest enrichment score
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) showed that downregulated lncRNA loci
were mainly involved in infection and inflammatory pathways. However, three
pathways that are related to neurological regulation—the long-term
depression, the synaptic vesicle cycling and the long-term potentiation
pathways—were characterized from the upregulated lncRNA loci. The plot of
enrichment score shows the relevant level of probability of the involvement of
differentially expressed lncRNAs in the pathway. The range-axis in the upregulated
pathways is lower than in the downregulated, suggesting that the pathogenic impact
of lncRNAs in downregulated pathways is heavier than in upregulated pathways and
the downregulated pathways are more likely involved in ASD than in upregulated
pathways.</p>

<title>Differential expression of synaptic lncRNAs and mRNAs</title>
<p>Thirteen synaptic lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1A">Table 1A</xref>), including nine
upregulated and four downregulated, and 19 synaptic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1B">Table 1B</xref>), including 12 upregulated and seven downregulated, were
identified as being differentially expressed in children with ASD. Among the
upregulated lncRNAs, six were intronic antisense, two exon sense-overlapping and
one natural antisense. Among the downregulated lncRNAs, three were natural
antisense and one intronic antisense. To validate the differential expression of
the synaptic lncRNAs and mRNAs identified from the microchip-based discovery
study, the lncRNAs and mRNAs were subjected to quantitative analysis by
quantitative PCR. Before the differential expression between the ASD and the
control groups was analyzed, inter-group comparisons were made between the
lymphocytes in a Chinese population and the lymphoblasts in a Caucasian population
(A1 vs A2, C1 vs C2). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2A">Table 2A</xref>, the
expression of lncRNAs NR_037945 (STX16), ENST00000565041 (SYNGR3), ENST00000425264
(SLC18A2), ENST00000502589 (SV2C) and ENST00000453544 (SNAP25) showed no
significant difference between the Chinese and the Caucasian populations in both
the ASD and the control groups; expression of ENST00000527880 (SYP), NR_034115
(STXBP5), NR_033656 (STX8) and ENST00000553165 (SYT1) showed no significant
difference between the Chinese ASD groups; and expression of uc001mff.1 (SYT9),
ENST00000504206 (SYT9), ENST00000506914 (SYT15) and ENST00000433499 (STXBP5)
showed no significant difference between the two control groups. The differential
expression of all lncRNAs, except ENST00000453544 (locus SNAP25) in the Caucasian
ASD subjects and ENST00000553165 (SYT1) in both the Chinese and Caucasian ASD
subjects, was statistically significant between the ASD and control groups.
However, there was no statistical significance (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) observed
between the males and females, nor between different age groups, in ASD or
controls. No significant difference in the expression of three mRNAs—NGR4,
SYNDIG1 and STX2—was evident between the Chinese and Caucasian ASD subjects.
Expression of the mRNAs SYNJ1, SDCBP, SYPL1, SYNM and SYNDIG1L was not
significantly different between the Chinese and Caucasian control groups.
Expressions of all mRNAs, except SYCE1 in the Caucasian population and STX2 and
SYT3 in both populations, were determined to be significantly different between
the ASD and control groups in both the populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2B">Table
2B</xref>). To integrate the genome-wide-expressed lncRNAs with the synaptic
mRNAs, we were able to draw the networks between the lncRNAs and mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This helps associate differential gene
expression with gene ontology, biological pathway and the regulatory functions of
the lncRNAs.</p>

<title>Association of lncRNAs with autistic genes</title>
<p>Genetic and genomic studies have revealed that a substantial proportion of ASD
risk resides in high-impact rare variation, ranging from chromosome abnormalities,
single-nucleotide variation, copy-number variation to gene mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> To match our lncRNA results to these gene
loci, 19 lncRNAs were found to be associated with ASD genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3A">Table 3A</xref>). Among these lncRNAs, seven were natural antisense (AS);
six, intronic antisense; three, bi-directional; two, intron sense-overlapping; and
one, intergenic. Twelve of the 19 lncRNAs associated with ASD genes were homeobox
or homeobox-related genes, including nine that were upregulated and three that
were downregulated, followed by four brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
isoforms. Interestingly, differential expression of mRNAs for <italic>HOXA</italic> and
<italic>HOXB</italic> was also identified in our microarray-based discovery study of
the ASD patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3B">Table 3B</xref>). However, no mRNAs, which
are the targets of <italic>BDNF-AS</italic> and of the intronic AS of
<italic>SHANK2</italic>—a membrane of the SHANK gene family and its gene mutations
found in ASD patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://autism.mindspec.org/GeneDetail/SHANK2" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://autism.mindspec.org/GeneDetail/SHANK2</ext-link>)—were
identified.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec>
<title>Differentially expressed lncRNAs represent a new potential biomarker
category for the early detection of ASD</title>
<p>Previous studies have reported that lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in brain
tissues and associated with ASD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup>
However, brain tissue cannot be used as clinical material for early screening or
for diagnostic purposes. In addition, there is no specific biomarker at present
that can be applied in clinical practice, owing to the genetic heterogeneity of
ASD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> although efforts have been
undertaken to characterize blood mRNA profiles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref></sup> Use of a panel of
lncRNAs that are specifically associated with ASD phenotypes and are
differentially expressed in ASD peripheral blood would be valuable and practical.
In this study, we presented metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure
1</xref>) that define peripheral blood lncRNAs that are differentially
expressed in ASD. Among these, synaptic vesicle cycling, long-term depression and
long-term potentiation are neurologically related pathways. LncRNAs that are
differentially expressed in ASD and have been identified in these pathways include
IGF1, mGluR1, CRFR1, IGF1R, NMDAR and VDCC, which are localized to cell membranes;
and Ras, G protein, PLC, IP3R, PKG, ERK1, ERK2 and PP2A, which are in the
cytoplasm and involved in signal transduction for long-term depression and
long-term potentiation. The differentially expressed lncRNAs involved in the
synaptic vesicle cycling pathway are Rab3A, Munc13, Syntaxin, SNAP25, Clathrin,
V-ATPase and trans-SNARE complex. Expression of all these genes is found with
various technology platforms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.genecards.org</ext-link>). It is not clear whether the lncRNAs and mRNAs
identified in the peripheral lymphocytes are identical to those expressed in
neuronal cells or whether they reflect ASD brain functions.</p>
<p>Although lncRNAs have been determined to associate with transcriptional regulation
in neuronal development and diseases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup>
applying gene differential expression profile analysis of peripheral bloods for
brain disorders presents a challenge to convince that the differential expression
profile in the peripheral bloods may be relevant to that in brain tissues. In
fact, there is no way to obtain human brain tissue for routine screening or
diagnostic analysis in clinical practice. The eQTL gene transcripts identified
from brains was demonstrated as being stably expressed in peripheral
bloods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref></sup> Our earlier study also determined that the brain gene
<italic>ENO2</italic> showed differentially expressed methylation in peripheral
bloods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Therefore, to analyze
differential expression profile in blood may open a new approach to explore
applying differential expression profile in blood as a biomarker for brain
diseases.</p>
<p>The differential expression we found demonstrates the potential for lncRNAs to be
applied as clinical biomarkers. Replication of our study with larger samples and
various ethnic backgrounds will be needed. Indeed, we noted differences in the
lncRNAs when comparing the Chinese and Caucasian populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2A">Table 2A</xref>). These differences suggest that there exist, at certain
gene loci, inter-population and inter-condition differences in gene expression. A
similar finding of the influence of different ethnic backgrounds was also observed
in the mRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2B">Table 2B</xref>).</p>

<sec>
<title>Synaptic lncRNAs may regulate synaptic vesicle transportation</title>
<p>Among the 13 synaptic lncRNAs, three were lncRNAs, which resided at the genes for
synaptic vesicle proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1A">Table 1A</xref>). The gene
<italic>SLC18A2</italic>, a member of the vesicular monoamine transporter family,
encodes a vesicular monoamine transporter of cytosolic monoamines into synaptic
vesicles, using the proton gradient maintained across the synaptic vesicular
membrane. Its proper function is essential for the proper activity of
monoaminergic systems, which have been implicated in several human
neuropsychiatric disorders, including brain dopamine–serotonin vesicular
transport disease and cocaine dependence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> The gene <italic>SV2C</italic> encodes synaptic vesicle
glycoprotein 2C, which has a role in the control of regulated secretion in neural
and endocrine cells, selectively enhances low-frequency neurotransmission, and
positively regulates vesicle fusion by maintaining the readily releasable pool of
secretory vesicles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup>
<italic>SYP</italic> is a gene that encodes the synaptic protein synaptophysin, an
integral membrane protein of small synaptic vesicles in the brain and endocrine
cells, which is a transporter and a calcium ion–binding protein. This
protein may also bind cholesterol and is thought to direct targeting of
vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (synaptobrevin) to intracellular
compartments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref></sup> Mutations in this
gene are associated with X-linked mental retardation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/12901506_XLMR_database" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.researchgate.net/publication/12901506_XLMR_database</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref></sup> In addition to these three synaptic vesicle
proteins, the genes <italic>STX8</italic> and <italic>STX16</italic> are also involved in synaptic
vesicle metabolism. The <italic>STX8</italic> gene is involved in protein trafficking from
early to late endosomes via vesicle fusion and exocytosis. It encodes a vesicle
trafficking protein that functions in the early secretory pathway, possibly by
mediating retrograde transport from <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi membranes to the endosome
reticulum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref></sup> The <italic>STX16</italic> gene is a member of the t-SNARE
(target-SNAP receptor) family. Proteins in this family are found on cell membranes
and serve as the targets for V-SNARES (vesicle-SNAP receptors), permitting
specific synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. A disease associated with
<italic>STX8</italic> includes visual epilepsy, and diseases associated with
<italic>STX16</italic> are pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b and
pseudohypoparathyroidism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref></sup></p>

<sec>
<title><italic>HOX</italic> genes are likely to be deregulated in ASD</title>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs can function in the regulation of
<italic>in vivo</italic> transcription. An lcnRNA dubbed linc-HOXA1 RNA has been found
to repress <italic>Hoxa1</italic> expression. Knockdown of linc-HOXA1 increases
transcription of the <italic>Hoxa1</italic> gene that is located some 50 kb
adjacent to the linc-HOXA1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref></sup>
<italic>HOXA</italic> cluster antisense RNA 2 (HOXA-AS2) is an lncRNA located between the
<italic>HOXA3</italic> and <italic>HOXA4</italic> genes in the <italic>HOXA</italic> cluster. HOXA-AS2
is an apoptosis repressor in all <italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid-treated NB4
promyelocytic leukemia cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref></sup> Its
transcript is expressed in NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells and human peripheral
blood neutrophils, and expression is increased in NB4 cells treated with all
<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid. The all <italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid induction of
HOXA-AS2 suppresses all <italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid-induced
apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref></sup> The <italic>HOTAIR</italic>
(Hox transcript antisense RNA) gene contains 6232 bp and encodes a
2.2- kb lncRNA. Its source DNA is located within a <italic>HOXC</italic> gene
cluster. Recently, differential expression of <italic>HOTAIR</italic> has been determined
to be associated with cancer metastasis and possibly to represent an independent
prognostic factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref></sup> The 5′ end of
<italic>HOTAIR</italic> interacts with the polycomb-group protein Polycomb repressive
complex 2 and as a result regulates chromatin state. It is required for
gene-silencing of the <italic>HOXD</italic> locus by Polycomb repressive complex 2 and the
3′ end of <italic>HOTAIR</italic> interacts with the histone demethylase
LSD1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref></sup> In our study, we
identified several lncRNAs of the <italic>HOX</italic> genes (<italic>HOXA13</italic>,
<italic>HOXB5</italic>, <italic>HOXB6</italic> and <italic>HOXD1</italic>) and <italic>HOX</italic>-related
genes (<italic>DLX6</italic>, <italic>HMBOX1</italic> and <italic>BARX1</italic>) from leukocytes derived
from ASD patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3A">Table 3A</xref>). These findings led us
to hypothesize that the differentially expressed lncRNAs of <italic>HOX</italic> genes and
<italic>HOX</italic>-related genes, referred to as lncHOXs, could represent a new set
of biomarkers for ASD.</p>
<p>The variety of identified lncRNAs suggests that lncRNAs' regulatory
functions involved in ASD may have various epigenetic mechanisms.</p>
<p>LncRNAs have been recognized as transcriptional and posttranscriptional
regulators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> They may function to activate gene transcription by
binding a transcriptional factor to the promoter region to signal or guide
transcription. They may prevent miRNA from binding to the target gene, may
suppress gene transcription by decoying the transcription factor away from the
promoter, or may be a chromatin modifier by bringing a chromatin enzyme onto
chromatin to form a complex and thereby modify histones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Usually, if the
lncRNA is the antisense of a gene, the lncRNA likely functions as the
<italic>cis</italic>-suppressor to inhibit gene transcription. This could be the case for
both the natural and intronic antisense lncRNAs that we identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1A">Tables 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3A">3A</xref>). To further
understand their molecular mechanisms, transgenic models created by introducing
extragenic lncRNA to generate a knockout, knockin or knockdown model at the
cellular and/or animal level could be investigated. Such a transgenic model
could provide phenotype(s) to mimic ASD. So far, there is little evidence that
details the molecular and pathogenic mechanisms of the bi-directional and
intergenic lncRNAs involved in ASD and other neurological diseases. In the present
study, we identified three bi-directional and one intergenic lncRNA, and observed
that all are located within <italic>HOX</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3A">Table
3A</xref>). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms will clarify
how these lncRNAs are involved in regulating gene expression in ASD and other
neurological conditions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have profiled here the differential expression of lncRNAs and
mRNAs in ASD peripheral leukocytes and have identified important clusters that may
be associated with this disorder. Our findings suggest the importance of synaptic
lncRNAs, which are likely involved in synaptic vesicle transportation and cycling
and thus would be important for the delivery of synaptosomal protein(s) between
presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes. LncRNAs that are the antisense of the
<italic>HOX</italic> genes may be related to ASD. This finding may open a new approach
to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of the <italic>HOX</italic> genes in the
development of ASD. Identification of the lncRNAs of <italic>SHANK2-AS</italic> and
<italic>BDNF-A</italic>S indicate that in addition to gene mutation, de-regulation of
lncRNAs on ASD-causing gene loci may represent a new category of, and allow
exploration of, the epigenetic mechanisms involved in ASD. Further investigation
with larger sample sizes may validate the use of lncRNAs as biomarkers for early
detection of ASD.</p>

<p>Metabolic pathways characterized from the lncRNAs differentially expressed in ASD:
The top-10 score of up- and downregulated pathways were characterized with KEGG
functional analysis. Three <italic>P</italic>-values, the EASE-score, Fisher
<italic>P-</italic>value and Hypergeometric <italic>P</italic>-value were integrated for the
analysis. The bar plot shows the top Enrichment Score
[−log10(<italic>P-</italic>value)] value of the significant enrichment
pathway. The higher Enrichment Score indicates that more lncRNA molecules are
involved in this pathway. ASD, autism spectrum disorder; lncRNA, long noncoding
RNA.</p>

<p>Validation of lncRNAs: qRT-PCR was applied to validate differentially expressed
lncRNAs (right panels) and mRNAs (left panels) between the ASD and the control
groups. Other than the gene symbol, each lncRNA was labeled with its name that can
be matched to the symbol in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3A">Table 3</xref>. The height of
each bar, measured by mean±s.d., represents the relative expression level.
