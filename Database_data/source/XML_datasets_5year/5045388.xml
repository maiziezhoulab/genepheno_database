<abstract>
<p>Historically, understanding of acquired resistance (AQR) to combination treatment has been based on knowledge of resistance to its component agents. To test whether an altered drug interaction could be an additional factor in AQR to combination treatment, models of AQR to combination and single agent MEK and PI3K inhibitor treatment were generated. Combination indices indicated combination treatment of PI3K and MEK inhibitors remained synergistic in cells with AQR to single agent but not combination AQR cells. Differences were also observed between the models in cellular phenotypes, pathway signaling and drug cross-resistance. Genomics implicated <italic>TGFB2-EDN1</italic> overexpression as candidate determinants in models of AQR to combination treatment. Supplementation of endothelin in parental cells converted synergism to antagonism. Silencing of <italic>TGFB2</italic> or <italic>EDN1</italic> in cells with AQR conferred synergy between PI3K and MEK inhibitor. These results highlight that AQR to combination treatment may develop through alternative mechanisms to those of single agent treatment, including a change in drug interaction.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Combination therapy, entailing treatment using two or more agents together, has become a common strategy for optimizing treatment efficacy, and reducing toxicity and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The strategy is based on the principle that an additional effect is generated by combining agents over using them individually. These effects can be synergistic, additive, or antagonistic, namely greater than, equal to, or worse than the added effects of the component agents respectively.</p>
<p>Drug resistance remains a major cause of treatment failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The resistance can be due to intrinsic factors that manifest in a lack of initial drug activity. Resistance can also be acquired, developing as a result of changes induced by the selection pressure of drug treatment. Many mechanisms of acquired resistance (AQR) have been identified, including changes in drug efflux, metabolism and detoxification, and acquired DNA mutations, gene amplification, pathway redundancy, crosstalk and feedback, and the enrichment of resistant subclones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>In recent times, the emergence of molecular-targeted therapy has led to an increased consideration of combination therapy as a means of circumventing drug resistance. However, AQR to combination therapy can still be expected, with evidence readily available from the clinic. What is unclear is whether mechanisms of AQR to combination therapy are the same as those for monotherapy, and whether an altered drug interaction could also be a factor. In this study, models of AQR to the prominent combination of MEK and PI3K inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] were generated concurrently with models to single agent treatment. Selective loss of synergy in combination treatment was observed in the cells with AQR to combination treatment but not single agent treatment, presenting loss of synergy as a novel mechanism of AQR to be considered in the application of combination therapy.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2_1">
<title>Generation of AQR and loss of synergy</title>
<p>HCT116 cells with <italic>KRAS</italic> G13D and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> H1047R mutations (cancer.sanger.ac.uk) were cultured in the presence of both AZD6244 (MEK inhibitor) and BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor) at IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of each agent, AZD6244 alone (2 treatments of ½ IC50 concentrations), BKM120 alone (2 treatments of ½ IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations), or vehicle (2 treatments of 0.25% DMSO). Two treatments were provided for all models to minimize bias from the number of treatments of the cells.</p>
<p>After prolonged treatment, HCT116 cells cultured with both AZD6244 and BKM120 became resistant to combination AZD6244 and BKM120 treatment (designated as “HCT116CR” cells) compared to HCT116 cells cultured with DMSO (“HCT116DM” cells) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Combination index (CI) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] indicated that AZD6244 and BKM120 were antagonistic in HCT116CR cells, while they were synergistic in HCT116DM cells. HCT116CR cells also displayed increased resistance to single agent treatment with AZD6244, but not BKM120.</p>

<p>HCT116 cells treated with AZD6244 alone (“HCT116AR” cells) and BKM120 alone (“HCT116BR” cells) displayed AQR to their respective treatments. Cross-resistance was observed for HCT116AR cells to BKM120, as well as for HCT116BR cells to AZD6244. Nonetheless, the combination of AZD6244 and BKM120 remained synergistic in HCT116AR and HCT116BR cells.</p>
<p>To confirm that the AQR and loss of synergy was not compound specific, the sensitivity of the cells to GDC0973 (MEK inhibitor) and BYL719 (PI3K inhibitor) treatment was assessed. Similar patterns of AQR, cross-resistance and loss of synergy was observed with these agents in respective cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The only difference in pattern was an increased resistance of HCT116CR cells to BYL719.</p>
<p>To confirm that the observations were not specific to HCT116 cells, LoVo (<italic>KRAS</italic> G13D mutant, cancer.sanger.ac.uk) colorectal cancer cells with AQR to AZD6244 (“LoVoAR”), BKM120 (“LoVoBR”) and their combination (“LoVoCR”) were generated using the same methods applied to HCT116 cells. The cells exhibited similar patterns of resistance to AZD6244 and BKM120 treatment, as well as GCD0973 and BYL719 treatment, as observed for HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Following combination treatment, p-Erk, p-Akt, p-S6 and p-4EBP1 were reduced in all cells, indicating pathway inhibition activity was retained. AZD6244 treatment also reduced p-Erk in all cells, and BKM120 treatment reduced p-Akt in all cells, indicating that the inhibitory activity of single agents was retained as well. BKM120 also reduced p-4EBP1 in HCT116CR and HCT116AR but not HCT116BR cells, suggesting the AQR of HCT116BR cells to PI3K inhibition could involve reduced p-4EBP1 inhibition. AZD6244 also significantly reduced p-Akt, and p-4EBP1 (not statistically significant; <italic>p</italic> = 0.06) in HCT116CR but not the other cells.</p>

<title>Cell phenotype analysis</title>
<p>Consistent with their known activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], single agent AZD6244 and BKM120 treatment led to increased G1 phase populations, and combination treatment led to an increased sub-G1 population and apoptosis in HCT116DM cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In HCT116AR and HCT116BR cells, the increase in G1 phase populations was not observed following single agent treatment. However, combination treatment still led to an increased sub-G1 population and apoptosis in these cells. In HCT116CR cells, there was no significant increase in G1 or sub-G1 populations or apoptosis following single agent and combination treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Indeed, apoptosis after combination treatment was significantly reduced in HCT116CR cells compared to HCT116DM cells. In wound healing experiments, HCT116AR, HCT116BR and HCT116CR cells displayed increased migration compared to HCT116DM cells when treated with DMSO. Combination treatment led to a reduction in migration of HCT116DM, HCT116AR and HCT116BR, but not HCT116CR cells.</p>

<title>Drug cross-resistance analysis</title>
<p>No significant differences were observed in the sensitivity of HCT116-derived cells to 5-Fluorouracil, carboplatin and sorafenib, suggesting that a multi-drug resistance phenotype was not responsible for resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Consistent with the earlier observations, HCT116AR, HCT116BR and HCT116CR cells were more resistant than HCT116DM cells to an extended panel of MEK and PI3K inhibitors. Interestingly, HCT116CR cells also exhibited sensitivity to Akt and mTOR inhibitors. HCT116BR cells shared sensitivity with HCT116CR cells to Akt inhibitors. HCT116AR cells were more resistant to mTOR inhibitors.</p>

Treatment ceased after 10 days when the tumors in the mice treated with vehicle reached their maximum allowed tumor volume. Consistent with the treatment synergy observed <italic>in-vitro</italic>, HCT116DM tumor growth was significantly inhibited by treatment with the combination compared to vehicle (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Consistent with the AQR observed <italic>in-vitro</italic>, combination treatment reduced tumor growth less in HCT116CR than HCT116DM tumors, however the difference was not statistically significant. After treatment withdrawal, tumors from mice receiving combination treatment were measured for an additional 10 days.

<title>Modulation of <italic>EDN1</italic> and <italic>TGFB2</italic></title>
<p>To investigate the involvement of EDN1 in drug resistance, parental HCT116 were cultured with 100 nM endothelin-1 or with vehicle for 24 hours before treatment with the combination of AZD6244 and BKM120. The two drugs were antagonistic in cells cultured with endothelin-1 (CI<sub>fu0.5</sub> = 1.9 ± 0.05) while they were synergistic in HCT116 cells cultured with vehicle (0.19 ± 0.02). Cells cultured with endothelin-1 also had higher p-Akt, p-Erk and p-4EBP1 levels than those cultured with vehicle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>HCT116 and HCT116CR cells were also transfected with <italic>EDN1</italic> and <italic>TGFB2</italic> siRNA, and confirmed to have reduced <italic>EDN1</italic> and <italic>TGFB2</italic> RNA levels respectively compared to cells transfected with scramble siRNA. <italic>TGFB2</italic> siRNA transfection also reduced <italic>EDN1</italic> RNA levels, while <italic>EDN1</italic> siRNA transfection did not reduce <italic>TGFB2</italic> RNA levels, consistent with TGFB2 being a upstream regulator of <italic>EDN1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Transfection of <italic>EDN1</italic> siRNA in HCT116CR cells led to synergism between AZD6244 and BKM120 (0.52 ± 0.03), while antagonism remained in cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (2.1 ± 0.05). In parental HCT116 cells, the two drugs remained synergistic whether transfected with <italic>EDN1</italic> siRNA (0.25 ± 0.04) or scrambled siRNA (0.22 ± 0.02). Similarly, transfection with <italic>TGFB2</italic> siRNA (0.62 ± 0.08) but not scrambled siRNA (1.9 ± 0.07) also converted antagonism to synergism in HCT116CR cells. There was also no change in the synergism of combination treatment from the transfection of <italic>TGFB2</italic> siRNA (0.49 ± 0.06) or scramble siRNA (0.32 ± 0.05) in HCT116 cells. <italic>EDN1</italic> and <italic>TGFB2</italic> siRNA also both reduced the levels of p-Akt and p-Erk in HCT116CR cells, but not HCT116 cells.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>During the execution of this study, two controlled studies of AQR to combination treatment were reported. Ahronian <italic>et al.</italic> described AQR to combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor treatment in melanoma cells <italic>in-vitro</italic> that was associated with acquisition of <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification was also observed in a tumor at recurrence in a melanoma patient treated with combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy. Pirazolli <italic>et al.</italic> reported on AQR to combination afatinib and cetuximab treatment in <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant lung cancer <italic>in-vitro and in-vivo</italic> that was linked to acquisition of mTOR activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Similar resistance and aberration was observed in a lung cancer patient treated with afatinib and cetuximab.</p>
<p>A major element in the consideration of combination therapy however, is the effect of the drug interaction, be it synergistic, additive or antagonistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Traditionally, this interaction has been measured by the protocol of Chou and Talalay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The protocol allows calculation of a CI value derived from IC<sub>50</sub> values of respective drugs at fixed ratios over a concentration range. Through this approach, the nature of interaction of combined drugs can be quantified, and misinterpretation of “one-sided” enhancement as synergy can be avoided.</p>
<p>The primary hypothesis of this study was that an altered drug interaction could have a role in AQR to combination therapy, based on the rationale that drug interaction can be a determinant of combination treatment efficacy. To test this hypothesis, models of AQR to either the combination of AZD6244 and BKM120 (HCT116CR), AZD6244 alone (HCT116AR), or BKM120 alone (HCT116BR) were generated through prolonged treatment, along with cells treated with DMSO vehicle (HCT116DM). In support of the hypothesis, CI values revealed the combination of AZD6244 and BKM120 was antagonistic in HCT116CR cells, while it remained synergistic in HCT116DM cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Combination treatment also remained synergistic in HCT116AR and HCT116BR cells, indicating that the loss of synergy was a specific feature of AQR in HCT116CR cells. In addition, pathway signaling analysis revealed that both single agent and combination treatment continued to inhibit expected targets in all cells. This suggested that factors other than loss of direct inhibitory activity were involved in the resistance.</p>
<p>Numerous measures were included in this study to support the validity of the loss of synergy. For single agent treatment, two doses of drugs at ½ IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations were used to provide consistency with combination treatment in the number of drug aliquots. Cells with prolonged vehicle treatment were used to control for the effects of treatment over time. Cells were treated with alternative MEK (GDC0973) and PI3K (BYL719) inhibitors and similar trends were observed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), supporting that the observations were not compound specific. Parallel lines of LoVo cells were generated and similar patterns of resistance were observed in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), indicating that the observations were also not cell line specific. Lastly, tumor xenografts confirmed the resistance phenotype <italic>in-vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>Many other differences between AQR to combination and single agent treatment were revealed by the study design. Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 was uniquely reduced, and AZD6244 treatment reduced p-Akt and p-4EBP1 in HCT116CR cells but not others (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In addition to reduced G1 arrest observed in HCT116AR, HCT116BR and HCT116CR cells, apoptosis was reduced in HCT116CR cells following combination treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Cell migration was less impeded by combination treatment in HCT116CR cells compared to all other cells. While HCT116AR cells were more resistant to mTOR inhibitors, HCT116CR cells were more sensitive. These additional phenotypes caution against the assumption that resistance to combination treatment is a composite of resistance to its component agents.</p>
<p>To gain insight into potential mechanisms for the loss of synergy, sequencing of 50 genes frequently mutated in cancer was performed. Unique DNA variants were detected in <italic>SMAD4 (Y412H)</italic> in HCT116AR, <italic>PTEN (A126S)</italic> in LoVoAR, and <italic>TP53 (T18A)</italic> and <italic>TP53 (Y236C)</italic> in HCT116CR cells. All these variants were predicted to be “deleterious” and “probably damaging” by SIFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] and Polyphen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. The <italic>PTEN (A126S)</italic> variant partially inactivates PTEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], and thereby could activate PI3K signaling and compensate for MEK pathway inhibition. Inactivation of p53 by <italic>TP53 (18A)</italic> and <italic>TP53 (Y236C)</italic> mutation could be involved in AQR, given the role of p53 in tumor suppression and stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, these aberrations were not consistent between models, prompting further investigation.</p>
<p>Gene expression array analysis revealed <italic>EDN1</italic> and <italic>TGFB2</italic> as the top candidate genes overexpressed in both HCT116CR and LoVoCR cells but not in the other cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The <italic>EDN1</italic> gene encodes for endothelin-1, a vasoactive peptide, which is typically associated with vasoconstriction and endothelial functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Endothelin-1 binds to endothelin receptors A and B, which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and via second messengers activate many signaling pathways, including MEK and PI3K pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Endothelin-1 can also trigger activation of protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], which can lead directly to Erk and Akt activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. TGFβ is a well-known cytokine that mediates numerous processes such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, adhesion, and migration through its activation of the SMAD family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, inhibition of MEK and PI3K signaling can lead to TGFβ activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], and <italic>EDN1</italic> is a known downstream target of TGFβ/SMAD activated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Taken together, a mechanism through which HCT116CR and LoVoCR cells AQR to combination treatment can be rationalized (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It can be hypothesized that the combined inhibition of PI3K and MEK pathways led to the activation of TGFβ and subsequently <italic>EDN1</italic>. The increased endothelin-1 then provided compensatory activation of the PI3K and MEK pathway, contributing to resistance to combination treatment. In support of this hypothesis, supplementation with endothelin-1 converted the synergism of combination treatment in parental HCT116 and LoVo cells to antagonism, along with activating Akt, Erk and 4EBP1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Silencing of <italic>EDN1</italic> or <italic>TGFB2</italic> by siRNA also changed the antagonism of combination treatment in HCT116CR and LoVoCR cells to synergism, and reduced p-Akt and p-Erk levels. Additionally, bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist restored synergy between BKM120 and AZD6244 in HCT116CR and LoVoCR cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>However, it is less clear how a change in drug interaction has occurred. Historically, synergy or antagonism could be understood as an enhancement or reduction of receptor binding or enzyme activity resulting from the combination of two agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Without a common receptor or enzyme in this study, one approach could be to consider the coordinated inhibition of the MEK and PI3K pathways and its downstream effects as the singular target of drug interaction. With this consideration, the upstream activation of MEK and PI3K pathways by endothelin-1 through GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], or activation of Erk and Akt downstream of MEK and PI3K inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], can be viewed as means to decouple pathway inhibition and/or bypass inhibitor effects, and thereby alter the singular system. It also remains that endothelin-1 could activate alternative pathways that modify the downstream events of MEK and PI3K inhibition through its multiplicity of pathways. The reduced apoptosis and inhibition of migration of HCT116CR cells following combination treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) could be a manifestation of this effect. The unexpected sensitivity of HCT116CR cells to Akt and mTOR inhibitors could be indicative of altered pathway dynamics, while also highlighting a potential rationale for intervention.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results of this study have supported the hypothesis that an altered drug interaction can determine AQR to combination treatment. Differences in the phenotypes of AQR to single agent and combination treatment have indicated that caution should be exercised in assuming mechanisms of resistance for combination treatment can be determined from studies of single agent treatment. Overexpression of the <italic>TGFB2-EDN1</italic> axis was identified as a potential mechanism of acquired loss of synergy for combination MEK and PI3K inhibitor therapy, and it would be of interest to observe whether this mechanism has a role in clinical resistance as current trials of this combination mature. A precise delineation of the mechanisms of altered drug interaction could not be achieved, as the protocol of Chou and Talalay only informs on the overall nature of interaction and not its components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Systems biology characterization of the complex multiplicity of effectors and pathways in the <italic>TGFB2-EDN1</italic> axis may help to shed further light on how drug interactions can affect drug resistance in its modern setting.</p>

Cell lines were continuously exposed to either a) two aliquots of vehicle (DMSO), b) two aliquots of ½ IC<sub>50</sub> concentration of AZD6244, c) two aliquots of ½ IC<sub>50</sub> concentration of BKM120, or d) aliquots of IC<sub>50</sub> concentration of AZD6244 and BKM120 each for a period of 3–8 months. The growth of the cells was monitored weekly and acquisition of resistance was indicated by normal proliferation of cells under the described selection pressures. The cells were maintained with the relevant concentrations of compounds or DMSO respectively. Clonal selection was not carried out for these various AQR cell lines. All the parental and resistant cells passed the authentication testing using short tandem repeat profiling performed by Promega GenePrint<sup>®</sup> 10 system (Madison, WI, USA).

Carboplatin and 5-FU were obtained from Sigma. All stock solutions were prepared in DMSO (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) at a final concentration in culture media of 0.25% (v/v). Cells in 90 μl medium were seeded (3000 cells/well) onto 96-well microtitre plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY). After 24 hours, 10 μl of medium containing compounds in graded concentrations ranging from 0.1 μM to 1000 μM was added to the wells. Control wells contained 20 μl of relevant solvent to achieve a final concentration of 0.25% of each solvent. The effect on cell numbers was assessed using the CellTiter 96<sup>®</sup> AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) (MTS Assay) at 72 h post-treatment.

Cells were transfected with siRNA at concentrations of 10 nM and exposed to a range of concentrations of AZD6244, BKM120 or their combination 24 h post-transfection. The effect on cell numbers was measured at 72 h post-transfection by the CellTiter 96<sup>®</sup> AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). Validation of knockdown efficiency was performed on the ABI7900HT real time system (Thermo Fisher) using Taqman gene expression assay for <italic>EDN1</italic>, <italic>TGFB2</italic> and <italic>ACTB</italic>. Relative quantities were measured by the ΔΔCT method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], using <italic>ACTB</italic> as a reference gene and parental HCT116 cells as a calibrator.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Differences in IC<sub>50</sub> values and protein ELISA were assessed using a paired sample <italic>t</italic>-test. A one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed) was used to compare the CI<sub>fu0.5</sub> with the predicted value for additivity of 1. For apoptosis, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's Multiple Comparison test was performed to assess for differences. All statistical analyses were two-tailed and performed using GraphPad Prism 5.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was considered when <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
