<abstract>
<p>Jacobsen syndrome (JBS) is a rare congenital disorder caused by a terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11. A subset of patients exhibit social behavioural problems that meet the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the underlying molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood. <italic>PX-RICS</italic> is located in the chromosomal region commonly deleted in JBS patients with autistic-like behaviour. Here we report that <italic>PX-RICS</italic>-deficient mice exhibit ASD-like social behaviours and ASD-related comorbidities. <italic>PX-RICS</italic>-deficient neurons show reduced surface γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) levels and impaired GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated synaptic transmission. PX-RICS, GABARAP and 14-3-3ζ/θ form an adaptor complex that interconnects GABA<sub>A</sub>R and dynein/dynactin, thereby facilitating GABA<sub>A</sub>R surface expression. ASD-like behavioural abnormalities in <italic>PX-RICS</italic>-deficient mice are ameliorated by enhancing inhibitory synaptic transmission with a GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist. Our findings demonstrate a critical role of PX-RICS in cognition and suggest a causal link between <italic>PX-RICS</italic> deletion and ASD-like behaviour in JBS patients.</p>

<body>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a group of aetiologically different neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by a triad of behavioural deficits: impairment in social interaction, difficulty with verbal and non-verbal communication and repetitive behaviour or restricted interests<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. ASD is a highly heritable condition, with estimated heritability indices of 80–90% (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition (E/I) within specific cortical circuits is a shared cellular mechanism for the behavioural and cognitive symptoms in several psychiatric diseases, including ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Several known ASD-causative genes encode neuron-associated proteins that are essential for the formation and maintenance of glutamatergic excitatory synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Recent studies have also indicated that impaired presynaptic release of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the resulting dysfunction of GABA-mediated inhibitory signalling, has been associated with ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. These findings suggest that a balance between glutamate and GABA signalling is essential for normal cognitive function.</p>
<p>ASD-like behaviour is also known to appear as one of the comorbid symptoms of several developmental syndromes such as fragile-X syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Studying these syndromes will assist in better understanding the pathogenesis of non-syndromic ASD. Jacobsen syndrome (JBS; MIM 147791), also known as 11q deletion syndrome or partial 11q monosomy syndrome, is a rare congenital disorder caused by a deletion within the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 11 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The incidence of JBS has been estimated to be ∼1 of every 100,000 births<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. JBS patients commonly suffer from a variety of pre- and post-natal developmental anomalies such as intellectual disability, characteristic facial dysmorphism, heart dysplasia and thrombocytopenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Prospective genotype/phenotype studies have revealed several candidate genes that may be causative for each symptom of JBS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Recently, Akshoomoff <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> have presented evidence that approximately half of JBS patients exhibit behavioural problems that meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD, and identified four annotated genes localized within a tiny (0.24 Mb) interstitial deletion region on 11q24.3 as candidate genes responsible for ASD-like behaviour in JBS. They have concluded that <italic>PX-RICS</italic> is the most promising candidate gene based on its predominant expression in the brain and its critical roles in dendritic spine morphology and axon elongation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
<p>PX-RICS (ARHGAP32 isoform 1), a longer splicing isoform of RICS (ARHGAP32 isoform 2), is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Cdc42, containing multiple domains for protein–protein interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. RICS is expressed exclusively in the brain in humans and regulates <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated signalling at the postsynaptic density and axonal elongation at the growth cone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In contrast, PX-RICS is expressed in relatively wide range of tissues but is predominantly expressed in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. PX-RICS has a unique phospholipid-binding domain not shared by RICS: the Phox-homology (PX) domain that mediates its interaction with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Recently, we have shown that PX-RICS interacts with GABA type A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R)-associated protein (GABARAP) and 14-3-3ζ/θ to facilitate trafficking of the N-cadherin/β-catenin cell adhesion complex in non-neuronal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the autistic-like behaviour of <italic>PX-RICS</italic>-deficient mice. Our results demonstrate an essential role for PX-RICS in normal cognitive function and suggest that PX-RICS deficiency contributes to the behavioural deficits in JBS patients.</p>

<title><italic>PX-RICS</italic>-deficient mice exhibit ASD-like social behaviour</title>
<p>JBS is a haploinsufficiency disorder in which most cases carry a <italic>de novo</italic> terminal deletion of one chromosome 11q (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). We thus included <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice in addition to <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in all behavioural assays. We first examined voluntary social interaction using the three-chamber test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In the empty–empty (habituation) session, no significant differences were observed between the time spent exploring both wired cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) and between the time stay in left and right chambers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>) in all genotypes. When a stranger mouse was placed in one wired cage (stranger–empty session), every genotype had a similar preference for the stranger-containing cage or chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>), suggesting that <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have normal voluntary sociability. In the subsequent familiar–stranger session in which a novel stranger mouse was placed in the previously empty wired cage, <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice spent more time with the novel stranger mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>). In contrast, <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice did not show such a preference for social novelty and instead showed a tendency to spend more time with a familiar stranger mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>). <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice exhibited an intermediate phenotype in the familiar–stranger session. No significant differences in exploration and locomotor activity were observed between genotypes in each session (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d–f</xref>).</p>
<p>We next performed a reciprocal social interaction test in which dyadic pairs of test (every genotype) and stimulator (<italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) mice could freely move and mutually interact in an open arena. We found that <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice spent less time on social activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) such as nose-to-nose sniffing, anogenital sniffing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>) and close huddling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). In addition, the rate of successful social interactions of <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> test mice was significantly lower than that of <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> test mice, regardless of whether the approach to the test mouse was initiated by the stimulator or the test mouse itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> test mice frequently showed apathetic or avoidance responses to approach from the stimulator, resulting in an extremely poor success rate (34.5% in −/− versus 61.4% in +/+) of social interactions. This result suggests that <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice show normal voluntary social interaction as in the three-chamber test, but show less interest in or avoidance of passive social interaction. <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice showed intermediate phenotypes.</p>
<p>The results from both social interaction tests demonstrate that PX-RICS deficiency leads to inappropriate or poor social interaction in mice, as is commonly observed in ASD individuals. To further evaluate social interaction, we investigated mice for social dominance and social hierarchies using the tube test, a useful paradigm in predicting impairments in social interaction. In the social dominance tube test, <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> rarely won against unfamiliar <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>), suggesting that <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are socially subordinate to <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, and thus tend to avoid passive social contact with other unfamiliar mice. The test mice displayed no aggressive behaviour; they only pushed their opponent, tried to squeeze themselves into the space between the opponent and the tube wall, or remained still.</p>
<p>Social interaction of nocturnal rodents is primarily driven by olfactory perception<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. We thus examined responses to olfactory cues using the olfactory habituation/dishabituation test. We found that <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice show strong habituation/dishabituation responses to all olfactory cues presented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>). In contrast, whereas <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed normal responses to non-social odours, they spent much less time interacting with unfamiliar social odours than <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. This result suggests that <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have decreased interest in unfamiliar social olfactory cues, although their olfactory perception is not impaired.</p>
<p>Mouse pups, when separated from their mother, emit communicative ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during the first 2 or 3 postnatal weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We thus measured maternal separation-induced USVs to quantify social communication deficits. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>, USVs of <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> pups reached a maximum on postnatal day (PND) 7 and then decreased gradually to almost zero by PND21. In contrast, <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> pups emitted USVs much less frequently after PND7 and required more time to emit the first call on PND14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). No significant differences were observed in the mean duration of calls, total calling time, peak frequency and peak amplitude between genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b–e</xref>). These results suggest atypical postnatal development of mother–pup communication in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> pups.</p>
<p>Repetitive behaviour is the most noticeable symptom in ASD individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. We monitored repetitive self-grooming behaviour and found that <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice spend more than twice as much time on repetitive self-grooming, persisting intermittently for an unusually long (more than 2 min) period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>). The marble-burying test also revealed that <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have more than twofold higher activity of repetitive digging behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j,k</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice exhibited intermediate phenotypes in these assays. These results clearly demonstrate increased repetitive behaviour in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>
<p>ASD individuals often exhibit inflexible adherence to routines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. To assess the ability of mice to switch flexibly from a previously established habit to a novel habit, we employed acquisition and reversal learning tasks in a water T-maze<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Learning performance was represented by the number of trials in which mice made the correct arm choice, the number of trials required to achieve five consecutive correct arm choices and the latency to reach an escape platform. In the acquisition session, <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed good learning performance comparable to <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l,m</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>). In the subsequent reversal learning session, however, <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice persistently chose the correct arm of the previous acquisition session, resulting in significantly worse learning performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l,m</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have a tendency to adhere a previously established habit and less ability to adapt their behaviour to a novel situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title><italic>PX-RICS</italic>-deficient mice exhibit ASD-related comorbidities</title>
<p>In ASD individuals, the triad of core behavioural problems is commonly accompanied by neurodevelopmental comorbidities, including impaired motor coordination and epilepsy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. We investigated whether these ASD-related phenotypes are present in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. The accelerating rotarod test revealed that <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice can stay on a rotating rod for significantly less time than <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), indicating impaired motor coordination. <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice displayed intermediate motor coordination between <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
<p>When suspended by the tail, several mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders display a limb-clasping phenotype, a dystonic posture characterized by holding the fore- and/or hindlimbs together<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. This behaviour is a pathological reflex that indicates lesions in the cerebellum, basal ganglia or neocortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We observed severe limb-clasping behaviour in 68.2% of <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), which is similar to a mouse model of Rett syndrome, one of the constituent conditions of ASD.</p>
<p>The prevalence of epilepsy is much higher in autistic children (∼30%) than non-autistic individuals (∼1%), which suggests a common molecular basis for cerebral hyperexcitability and impaired cognitive function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. To assess the susceptibility to epilepsy, we scored progressive seizures induced by kainic acid, a specific agonist for the kainate subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors, with Racine's scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were more sensitive to kainic acid than their <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Seizures in the <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were more severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and progressed more rapidly to each seizure stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken all behavioural data together, we concluded that PX-RICS deficiency in mice leads to behavioural deficits reflecting the core symptoms of ASD and its related comorbidities. We propose that <italic>PX-RICS</italic> is the gene responsible for ASD-like symptoms in JBS.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Impaired GABA<sub>A</sub>R surface expression in <italic>PX-RICS</italic>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice</title>
<p>Results from the behavioural tests prompted us to investigate the cellular function of PX-RICS underlying ASD-like behaviour. We have previously shown that the PX-RICS/GABARAP/14-3-3 complex facilitates dynein-/dynactin-dependent trafficking of the N-cadherin/β-catenin complex in non-neuronal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. GABARAP was originally identified as a protein that binds to the γ2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>R and is known to promote GABA<sub>A</sub>R trafficking to the neuronal surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. We thus hypothesized that the PX-RICS/GABARAP/14-3-3 complex facilitates surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in neurons and that impairment of this trafficking mechanism causes ASD-like behaviour in <italic>PX-RICS</italic>-deficient mice.</p>
<p>We first tested the possibility that PX-RICS is involved in GABA<sub>A</sub>R trafficking to the neuronal surface. We utilized γ2<sup>EP</sup>, a γ2 subunit tagged at its N-terminal extracellular domain with ecliptic pHluorin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, a pH-sensitive variant of green fluorescent protein that is non-fluorescent in acidic environments (pH&lt;6)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Thus, γ2<sup>EP</sup>-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are non-fluorescent during trafficking but become readily visualized when expressed on the neuronal surface. When γ2<sup>EP</sup> was expressed in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> cortical neurons and observed in pH 7.4 buffer, robust dot-like fluorescent signals could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This fluorescence was almost entirely derived from surface-expressed γ2<sup>EP</sup> because transient exposure to a pH 6.0 buffer quenched the fluorescent signals. Total γ2<sup>EP</sup> fluorescence was revealed by subsequent exposure to an NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-containing pH 7.4 buffer, which equilibrates the intracellular pH to 7.4. In contrast, in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cortical neurons, surface fluorescence was markedly reduced, but total fluorescence in pH 7.4 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-containing buffer was similar to that in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Quantification of the fluorescence intensities revealed that the amount of surface-expressed γ2<sup>EP</sup> is markedly decreased in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This result was confirmed by the cell surface labelling and surface biotinylation assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Internalization activity for γ2 was similar between the <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cortical neurons, suggesting that the reduction in surface γ2<sup>EP</sup> in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons is due to impaired trafficking to the plasma membrane, not to enhanced endocytic withdrawal of surface γ2<sup>EP</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3e–h</xref>). The cell surface labelling and surface biotinylation assays revealed that surface-expressed γ2 is markedly reduced in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hippocampal neurons and cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,c,d</xref>). Taken together, we concluded that surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is impaired in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons.</p>
<p>The efficacy of GABAergic inhibitory transmission is modulated by altering the number of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs expressed on the neuronal surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We next examined whether reduced surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons affects inhibitory synaptic transmission. We measured miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), which reflect postsynaptic responses to GABA released from single synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminal, in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells using the whole-cell patch–clamp recording technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Quantitative analysis of mIPSCs revealed no significant difference (<italic>P</italic>=0.89) in the mIPSC frequency (evaluated by the interval between mIPSCs) between <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (99.4±19.4 ms) and <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (95.4±21.4 ms) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting that presynaptic neurotransmitter release is similar between <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons. In contrast, the mIPSC amplitude of <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons (26.8±1.2 pA) was significantly smaller (<italic>P</italic>=0.0075) than that of <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> neurons (32.5±1.6 pA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). These electrophysiological data indicate that postsynaptic responsiveness to inhibitory inputs is attenuated in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which is in line with the reduced surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p>

<title>PX-RICS forms a trafficking complex for GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs</title>
<p>We next analysed whether GABARAP, 14-3-3 and dynein/dynactin participate in PX-RICS-mediated GABA<sub>A</sub>R transport. We found that the γ2 subunit, GABARAP and PX-RICS form a ternary complex in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and are colocalized in the perinuclear region of the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b–d</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining with organelle-specific markers revealed that this region corresponds to the endoplasmic reticulum, endoplasmic reticulum exit sites and endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b–l</xref>). They were also colocalized in dendritic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b–d</xref>) that were immunopositive for endoplasmic reticulum-, endoplasmic reticulum exit site-, endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment- and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network-specific markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b–l</xref>), suggesting that PX-RICS and GABARAP are localized in the dendritic satellite secretory outposts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The colocalization results were confirmed by quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescent signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5 and 6</xref>). This localization is consistent with their involvement in local delivery of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to the dendritic surface. Further ultracentrifugation analysis revealed that 14-3-3ζ/θ and dynactin1, as well as γ2 and GABARAP, coimmunoprecipitated with PX-RICS in high-molecular-weight (&gt;440 kDa) fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). We confirmed that 14-3-3ζ/θ and dynactin1 are colocalized with γ2, PX-RICS and GABARAP in the soma and dendrites of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g–i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5 and 6</xref>). The introduction of siRNA against any one of them into cortical neurons resulted in a drastic reduction in surface γ2 levels and a simultaneous increase in intracellular γ2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>).</p>
<p>We further determined whether the PX-RICS/GABARAP/14-3-3 complex is required for surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. When wild-type PX-RICS was exogenously expressed in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons, surface expression of the γ2 subunit was drastically increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c–g</xref>). In contrast, PX-RICS-ΔRSKSDP and PX-RICS-S1796A, two mutants lacking the binding ability to 14-3-3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), had no apparent effect on surface expression of γ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c–g</xref>). Similarly, surface γ2 levels remained unchanged in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons expressing PX-RICS-ΔGBR, a mutant defective in GABARAP binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c–g</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that γ2, GABARAP, PX-RICS, 14-3-3ζ/θ and dynactin1 are assembled into a large cargo-adaptor-motor complex that plays a facilitating role in GABA<sub>A</sub>R surface expression. On the basis of a similarity to the trafficking mechanism previously proposed for the N-cadherin/β-catenin complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, we speculate a possible model for trafficking γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<title>A curative effect of clonazepam on autistic-like behaviour</title>
<p>Cell surface labelling revealed that a small amount of the γ2 subunit remains on the surface of <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). We speculate that this observation may be due to an auxiliary secretory route for γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs that complements or bypasses the PX-RICS-dependent pathway. We reasoned that ASD-like behaviour in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice may be treatable by potentiating synaptic inhibition through the GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs remaining on the neuronal surface. Before testing this idea, we first determined an optimum injected dose of clonazepam (CZP), a benzodiazepine agonist for GABA<sub>A</sub>R, to avoid its sedative and anxiolytic effects that could potentially affect our behavioural experiments. Open-field and elevated plus-maze tests revealed that intraperitoneal administration of CZP in a dose up to 0.03 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> causes no significant sedative or anxiolytic effects in both <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a–d</xref>).</p>
<p>We then conducted behavioural tests of CZP-treated <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. In the three-chamber social interaction test, we found that vehicle-treated <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice show impaired preference for social novelty, whereas preference for social novelty in CZP-treated <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice is almost completely normalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a–d</xref>). No significant differences were observed in exploration and locomotor activity in each session (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7e–g</xref>). Similarly, the water T-maze test revealed that learning performance of CZP-treated <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in the reversal learning session is remarkably improved compared with vehicle-treated <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7h</xref>), indicating that persistence to a previously established habit is significantly alleviated by CZP administration. In each test, intraperitoneal injection of 0.03 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> CZP had no effect on the social behaviour of <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice. These results demonstrate that ASD-like behaviour in <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice is caused by impaired postsynaptic GABA signalling and that GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonists have the potential to treat ASD-like behaviour in JBS patients and possibly non-syndromic ASD individuals.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>JBS is a contiguous gene disorder caused by large terminal deletion of chromosome 11q (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Simultaneous loss of multiple genes results in a wide variety of congenital defects, including intellectual disability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Recently, Akshoomoff <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> have conducted cognitive and behavioural assessments of JBS patients using standardized diagnostic procedures and shown that more than half of JBS patients meet the criteria for ASD diagnosis. Furthermore, they defined the 0.24-Mb autism critical region in distal 11q and identified four annotated genes: <italic>KCNJ1</italic>, <italic>KCNJ5</italic>, <italic>TP53AIP1</italic> and <italic>RICS/PX-RICS</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). <italic>KCNJ1</italic> encodes the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK), a member of the inward-rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel (K<sub>ir</sub>) family that plays important roles in K<sup>+</sup> secretion into the tubular lumen in the nephron<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Mutations of <italic>KCNJ1</italic> cause antenatal Bartter syndrome type 2, a renal tubular disorder characterized by hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis and hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism with normal blood pressure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. <italic>KCNJ5</italic> encodes the G-protein-activated inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel that regulates aldosterone secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Mutations of <italic>KCNJ5</italic> are implicated in primary hyperaldosteronism and cardiac long QT syndrome type 13 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). <italic>TP53AIP</italic>, p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1, is a transcriptional target gene for p53 tumour suppressor protein and is specifically expressed in the thymus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. The encoded protein is localized in the mitochondrion and mediates p53-dependent apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Given their reported localizations and functions, it is unlikely that <italic>KCNJ1</italic>, <italic>KCNJ5</italic> and <italic>TP53AIP1</italic> are involved in cognitive function and cause the ASD-like behaviour observed in JBS. In contrast, <italic>PX-RICS</italic> is the only candidate that is expressed predominantly in the brain and known to play functional roles in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The present study has shown that loss-of-function of PX-RICS in mice results in various ASD-like behaviour associated with deficits in PX-RICS-dependent GABA<sub>A</sub>R surface expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Our findings strongly support the notion that <italic>PX-RICS</italic> is the gene responsible for ASD-like symptoms in JBS patients and also provide evidence that a gene encoding a trafficking factor is implicated in ASD-like behaviour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). We therefore propose that JBS-related ASD (and possibly a subset of ASD) is a trafficking disease.</p>
<p>Our findings also demonstrate that PX-RICS-mediated GABA<sub>A</sub>R trafficking is one of the biological systems that support normal cognitive function. Recently, dysfunctional GABA signalling has been increasingly reported to be associated with ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. GABA-releasing neuron-specific deletion of the gene for methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (<italic>Mecp2</italic>), a chromatin-associated transcription factor, in mice leads to a variety of Rett syndrome-like behavioural features<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Mice lacking the contactin-associated protein-like 2 gene (<italic>Cntnap2</italic>) encoding a neuronal transmembrane protein of the neurexin superfamily display a reduced number of GABA-releasing interneurons and ASD-related phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Forebrain interneuron-specific deletion of the <italic>Scn1a</italic> gene, which encodes the α subunit of the sodium channel neuronal type I, in mice results in decreased firing activity of GABA-releasing interneurons and ASD-related behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. These findings demonstrate that dysfunction of the presynaptic mechanisms for releasing GABA contributes to ASD-like behaviour. In contrast, the present study has shown that dysfunction of the postsynaptic mechanism for trafficking GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in GABA-receiving neurons is also associated with ASD-like behaviour. Collectively, GABA signalling is essential for normal cognitive function and seriously affects social behaviour if impaired in either GABA-releasing or GABA-receiving neurons.</p>
<p>Another important finding is that the ASD-like behavioural phenotypes of <italic>PX-RICS</italic>-deficient mice can be successfully rescued by treatment with a low dose of CZP, which suggests that compensatory potentiation of postsynaptic GABAergic signalling could be an effective therapeutic strategy for controlling ASD-like behavioural problems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Despite the increasing number of children diagnosed with ASD and the high prevalence of ASD of ∼1% of the population, currently available pharmacological therapies remain supportive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. A recent whole-exome-sequencing study has identified a rare missense single-nucleotide variation in the <italic>PX-RICS</italic> gene in a non-syndromic ASD patient, suggesting that PX-RICS deficiency can be a pathogenic factor for this type of ASD as well<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. We believe that our <italic>PX-RICS</italic>-deficient mice can be a unique disease model that properly recapitulates the pathogenic process of ASD-like behaviour in JBS patients and a valuable tool for the discovery of permanent cure drugs, as well as for a better understanding of non-syndromic ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p>Our previous reports revealed that PX-RICS is a GAP that selectively targets Cdc42 and that PX-RICS deficiency leads to an increase in neuronal Cdc42 activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. We also found that the Cdc42GAP activity is required for PX-RICS-mediated transport of the N-cadherin/β-catenin complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. How is Cdc42 activity connected with PX-RICS-mediated GABA<sub>A</sub>R trafficking? In this context, it is notable that collybistin, a brain-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor for Cdc42, is present in the scaffold protein complex for synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and regulates gephyrin-dependent GABA<sub>A</sub>R anchoring and clustering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Collybistin binds to phosphatidylinositols (PIs), with a preference for PI3P and PI4P, through its pleckstrin homology domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, as PX-RICS does<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Thus, the balance between the activities of the Cdc42 GDP/GTP exchange factor and GAP (that is, collybistin and PX-RICS) might control the synaptic expression and localization of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p>
<p>In summary, we have found that surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is impaired in PX-RICS<sup>−/−</sup> neurons. More importantly, stimulation of GABA signalling with a GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist improved some autistic-like phenotypes of <italic>PX-RICS</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Consequently, we conclude that dysfunctional PX-RICS-mediated GABA<sub>A</sub>R trafficking in postsynaptic neurons is a plausible cause for the observed behavioural and molecular deficits. It is possible that alternative binding partners of PX-RICS are also relevant for GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated signalling; PX-RICS is known to interact with more than 60 proteins other than GABARAP and 14-3-3 s, many of which have potential roles in important neuronal processes such as neurite extension, regulation of Rho GTPases pathway and transcriptional regulation. Cleary, further investigation is needed to test the involvement of other putative PX-RICS interactors in GABA signalling, as well as other proteins implicated in complementary or compensatory pathways.</p>

Mutant mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6N (CLEA Japan) background to the F10 generation. The mice used in behavioural and electrophysiological studies were generated by breedings of heterozygous mutant males and females in the C57BL/6N background. Young adult male mice (8–10 weeks old) were used in all behavioural tests except for USV analysis and the foot-clasping test, in which both male and female pups of PND5–21 and PND21 were used, respectively. Unless otherwise noted, all tests were conducted with a naive cohort. Six- to eight-week-old male mice were used for electrophysiological analysis. The embryos and newborns for primary neuronal cultures were generated by crossing wild-type C57BL/6N males and females, or homozygous mutant males and females in the C57BL/6N background. Embryonic day (E) 16–18 embryos were used for primary culture of cortical and hippocampal neurons, and PND7 pups for CGNs.</p>

<title>Three-chamber social interaction test</title>
<p>Mice were tested for voluntary social interaction as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The three-chamber apparatus (O'HARA &amp; CO., LTD.) was a non-transparent acrylic open arena (61 × 40 × 22 cm) with a removal floor placed in a soundproof chamber (74 × 50 × 83 cm). The arena was divided into left, middle and right chambers (20 × 40 × 22 cm) by two semi-transparent partitions with a small rectangular opening (5 × 3 cm) in the bottom centre, through which a test mouse could travel between the three chambers. A quarter cylindrical wired cage (10 cm in radius and 10.5 cm in height) was placed at each back corner of the left and right chambers. A quarter cylindrical weight (10 cm in radius and 10.5 cm in height) was placed on the top of each wired cage to prevent the test mouse from climbing the wired cage and the stranger mouse from escaping. Illumination on the arena floor was kept at 100 lx during the tests.</p>
<p>Male test mice 8–10 weeks old were habituated to the testing room for at least 1 h before beginning the test. For 3 days before testing, age-matched wild-type males unfamiliar to the test mice (stranger mice) were left inside the wired cages for 20 min per day for habituation. A test mouse was first placed in the centre of the middle chamber and left to habituate for 10 min in the absence of stranger mice in the wired cages (empty–empty session). Subsequently, a stranger mouse was introduced into one of the two wired cages. Then, the test mouse was placed in the centre of the middle chamber and allowed to freely explore all three chambers for 10 min (stranger–empty session). Finally, after a novel stranger mouse was placed in another wired cage that had served as the empty cage in the previous sessions, the test mouse was again allowed to freely explore for 10 min (familiar–stranger session). Movement of the test mouse was recorded by a charge-coupled device camera and analysed online with Time CSI video tracking software (O'HARA &amp; CO., LTD). The open arena, partitions, wired cages and weights were cleaned with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels before the next trial. Time spent in close interaction near each wired cage and time spent in each chamber were converted into a preference index, which was calculated as 100 × (time with a right empty cage)/(time with a right empty cage+time with a left empty cage)−50 (in the empty–empty session), as 100 × (time with a stranger mouse)/(time with a stranger mouse+time with an empty cage)−50 (in the stranger–empty session) or as 100 × (time with a novel stranger mouse)/(time with a novel stranger mouse+time with a familiar stranger mouse)−50 (in the familiar–stranger session).</p>

<p>Mice were tested for reciprocal social interaction as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Male test mice 8–10 weeks old were habituated to the testing room for at least 1 h before beginning the test. Wild-type males unfamiliar with the test mice were used as stimulators, and their tail tips were painted black with a marker for identification before habituation. An age-matched pair of test and stimulator mice was placed in a non-transparent acrylic open arena (50 × 50 × 40 cm) lined with fresh paper bedding, and their behaviour was video-recorded for 10 min. The number and duration of the following social behaviour were measured by visual observation of the movie: sniffing (nose-to-nose, anogenital and to other areas (neck, flank, tail and so on)), social pursuit (following within one body length as the stimulator mouse moved continuously throughout the cage), social proximity (close huddling within one body length of each other without movement) and total social activities, as well as the latency to the first social contact. We did not observe other social behaviour, such as allo-grooming and social mounting, in our 10-min tests. In addition, we quantified the responses of the test mice (successful interaction or no interaction (no interest or escape)) when approach to the test mouse was initiated by stimulator or test mouse itself. The open arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels before the next test.</p>

The apparatus was a transparent plexiglass tube 30 cm in length and 3.5 cm in diameter. Two age-matched (8–10 weeks old) male mice of different genotypes unfamiliar to each other were placed at opposite ends of the tube and simultaneously released in a forward direction towards each other. Almost all mice entered the tube obediently without any particular training. A mouse was judged as a loser when it backed away and put its four paws outside the tube earlier than its opponent within 2 min. A mouse was judged as a winner when it remained inside the tube after the opponent backed out of the tube. To avoid bias, the same pair of mice was subjected to a second match with no interval, switching the releasing side. All matches ended within 2 min in our test.

<title>Olfactory habituation/dishabituation test</title>
<p>The ability of mice to discriminate odorant stimuli was tested as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. We employed water as a control, almond and banana extracts as unfamiliar non-social odours, male mouse urine as a social odour and food pellets as a familiar non-social odour. The almond (KYORITSU FOODS) and banana (NARIZUKA Corporation) extracts were diluted (1:100) with water. The mouse urine was obtained separately from two age-matched wild-type males unfamiliar to the test mice. Food pellet odorant was prepared by soaking a ground food pellet in water. Cotton swabs saturated with these odorants (50 μl) were presented to mice using a test tube clamp so that the tips of the swabs were fixed 2 cm above the centre of the cage lids to prevent the test mice from touching the swabs with their forepaws. Before beginning the test, a male test mouse 8–10 weeks old was habituated to a cotton swab for 30 min in its home cage. Then, the odours were sequentially presented in three consecutive trials per odorant stimulus (2 min per trial) in the following order: water, almond extract, banana extract, mouse urine 1, mouse urine 2 and food pellet. In each trial, the time spent sniffing towards the swab was measured by an observer with a stopwatch.</p>

<p>Maternal separation-induced USVs were monitored as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. All procedures were performed in a soundproof chamber (O'HARA &amp; CO., LTD.). Both male and female pups were individually removed from their mother at PND5, 7, 10, 14 and 21, and gently placed inside a stainless steel open cylinder (7.5 cm in diameter and 7 cm in height) on a cooling plate set at 24 °C. Recording was started after a 1-min delay because we commonly observed that immediately after being placed inside the cylinder, pups emitted unusually frequent and strong USVs, regardless of their genotype, sex and PND. After a 5-min recording period, pups were promptly returned to their mother. We utilized the UltraSoundGate system (Avisoft Bioacoustics) for recording and SASLab Pro software (Avisoft Bioacoustics) for quantitative analysis. The cylinder was cleaned with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels between recordings.</p>

<p>Digging behaviour was evaluated using the marble-burying test as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. Twenty black glass marbles (15 mm diameter) were gently placed evenly spaced apart in a 4 × 5 arrangement on 5-cm-thick fresh paper bedding in a clean cage (27.5 × 17 × 13 cm). After taking a still image of marbles from straight above the cage, a male mouse 8–10 weeks old was gently placed in the centre of the cage and left for free exploration for 30 min. Then, the mouse was removed and a still image of the marbles was taken again from straight above the cage. Digging behaviour was quantitatively evaluated by analysing pre- and post-test images with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Strong colour contrast between the black marbles and the white bedding enabled us to easily define the marble area. The marble was judged as ‘buried' if more than 50% of the marble area was covered by the paper bedding. The number and area of marbles buried were evaluated.</p>

A white escape platform (6 × 6 cm, 21.5 cm in height) was designed to fit snugly to the end of the side arms to prevent it from wobbling. The apparatus was filled with tap water at 23±1 °C to a depth of 22.5 cm so that the top of the escape platform was positioned 1 cm below the water surface. The water was coloured white with poster paint (Nicker Colours) to make the submerged escape platform invisible.</p>
<p>In a habituation swim trial on day 1, a male mouse 8–10 weeks old was placed on the water surface at the starting end of the main arm facing towards the side arms and then gently released. After 60 s of free swimming without the escape platform, the mouse was gently wiped with a towel, placed in an empty cage on a warming plate (38 °C setting) for 5 min, and then returned to its home cage. On the following 3 days (day 2–4), acquisition swim trials were performed in which the escape platform was submerged at the end of the right arm of the T-maze. Fifteen consecutive swim trials were performed every 3 days. In each trial, the latency to reach the escape platform and the result of arm choice were recorded. The mouse was removed from the platform after a 20-s stay when it reached the escape platform within 35 s. The mouse was guided onto the escape platform and left for 20 s when it could not find the platform within 35 s. In the last 3 days (day 5–7), reversal learning trials were performed as described above, except that the escape platform was placed at the end of the left arm.</p>

(<bold>g</bold>–<bold>i</bold>) γ2, GABARAP and PX-RICS were colocalized with 14-3-3ζ (<bold>g</bold>), 14-3-3θ (<bold>h</bold>) and dynactin1 (<bold>i</bold>) in the perinuclear region of the soma and specific compartments of the dendrites (white arrowheads).

<title>A possible model for a PX-RICS-dependent cargo-motor interconnection.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) The multiple domains mediating protein–protein and protein–phospholipid interactions of PX-RICS enables PX-RICS to play a central role as a scaffold in assembling the constituents of the trafficking complex. Cargo recognition is conducted by GABARAP through its binding to the cytoplasmic region of the γ2 subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. GABARAP also serves as a binding cue for PX-RICS. Crystal structure analysis has revealed that GABARAP can self-associate in a head-to-tail manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>, and this oligomerization activity may underlie its multitasking ability. Phosphorylation of PX-RICS by CaMKII induces the sequential assembly of 14-3-3ζ/θ and dynein/dynactin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. By interconnecting the transport-competent γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R complex with the dynein/dynactin motor complex, the PX-RICS/GABARAP/14-3-3 adaptor complex facilitates GABA<sub>A</sub>R transport from the somatodendritic secretory compartments to the neuronal surface. (<bold>b</bold>) A previously proposed trafficking model for the N-cadherin/β-catenin (β-cat) complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Cargo recognition is accomplished by PX-RICS through its binding ability to β-catenin. GABARAP provide a binding cue to PX-RICS to anchor it on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. See also our previous papers for further details<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Recently, it has become apparent that an increasing number of plasma membrane-bound receptors depend on GABARAP for their cell surface expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>. Thus, the PX-RICS-dependent adaptor system may be implicated in the delivery of a wide variety of cell surface proteins.</p>
