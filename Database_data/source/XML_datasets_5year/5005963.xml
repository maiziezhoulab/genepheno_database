<abstract>
<p>Autistic traits can help people gain and sustain power, and has probably done so throughout history, says the present paper. A number of testable claims follow from this assumption. First, the powerful should have more autistic traits than others – which they do appear to have. Among other things, powerful people, and those with many autistic traits, tend to prefer solitary activities and are often aloof. Moreover, they are often rigid and socially insensitive, low on empathy and with low scores on the trait of agreeableness – and as a rule they do not have many friends. Both groups are also more self-centered than others, more honest, less submissive, more sensitive to slights, and with a stronger tendency to engage in abstract thinking. They tend to behave in bossy or dominant ways, and their moral judgment is more based on rules than on feelings. In addition to experimental evidence, I cite biographies showing that a surprising number of presidents, prime ministers and other powerful people seem to have had traits like those in question – and interestingly, in animals, leaders are often rigid and insensitive to group members’ needs and feelings, mostly acting the way they are themselves inclined to, not responding much to others. Problem solving is important in leadership, and people with many autistic traits appear often to be better thinkers than typical subjects with similar IQs. However, these and other congruities could be coincidences. Hence the question of whether traits the two groups have in common also have a common cause constitutes a strong test of the paper’s thesis – and a common cause does appear to exist, in the form of testosterone’s effects on the central nervous system. Finally, there is evidence that, other things equal, powerful men have more reproductive success than others. If men wielding power do indeed have more autistic traits than those less powerful, this will lead to, other things equal, such traits becoming more common – which can help explain the prevalence of autistic traits.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To understand human behavior, we must understand power – “a universal and indispensable feature of social organization,” in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B302">Turner (2005</xref>, p. 1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B261">Russell (1938</xref>, p. 4) calls power “the fundamental concept in social science.”</p>
<p>Some have more power than others, and powerful people tend to have certain characteristics, such as expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B284">Stehr and Grundmann, 2011</xref>), resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">Galbraith, 1983</xref>), and male gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Baumeister, 2010</xref>). Though interesting, this does not tell us why people with such features gain and hold on to power more often than others.</p>
<p>I shall argue that those who gain and sustain power often have many autistic traits, and that the autistic traits of these individuals have often helped them reach their powerful position. This hypothesis leads to several testable claims, some supported by the extant literature, and some in need of further investigation. If the hypothesis is correct, it can also help explain why men have more autistic traits than women, why there are more powerful men than women, and why autistic traits are so prevalent. This may strike some readers as counterintuitive. Hence I shall do my best to make clear why the hypothesis is not only testable, already having considerable support, but also why it seems the most parsimonious explanation of a large body of data from several areas of research.</p>

<title>The Broader Autism Phenotype</title>
<p>Some people have autism or related conditions. The present paper is not primarily about them. But then there are those who have more autistic traits than the average person, while still not qualifying for a diagnosis. The latter category is often referred to as the “broader autism phenotype” (BAP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B153">Ingersoll and Wainer, 2014</xref>). More people are assumed to belong in this category, thus having “subclinical” autistic traits, than those who have full-blown autism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>). Given that in the USA, one boy in 42 and one girl in 189 are now assumed to have an autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Baio, 2014</xref>), the subclinical group could be quite substantial.</p>
<p>In discussing relevant traits in the powerful, I sometimes refer to findings from autism research, and sometimes to what we know about the BAP. This seems reasonable, since there is no clear boundary between autism and the BAP, and, in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B153">Ingersoll and Wainer (2014</xref>, p. 43): “… research indicates that the BAP is comprised of a number of characteristics seen in individuals with ASD (autism spectrum disorder), but to a lesser extent.”</p>
<p>Among other things, persons with subclinical autistic traits are often aloof, rigid, anxious, shy, suspicious, and self-conscious (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B153">Ingersoll and Wainer, 2014</xref>). They also tend to be neurotic introverts who score low on the trait of agreeableness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B315">Wainer et al., 2011</xref>), and as a rule they do not have many friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B160">Jobe and Williams White, 2007</xref>). Are these people who can win elections and gain power? Before you say no, let’s have a look at some very powerful people – not to give them a diagnosis, but to get a picture of their tendency, if any, toward autism.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Eccentric and Powerful</title>
<p>John Adams, the second president of the United States, was a “stiffly formal and aloof” man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Ferling, 1992/2010</xref>, p. 170). He was called cold, pugnacious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">DeGregorio, 2009</xref>, p. 19), stubborn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B209">McCullough, 2001</xref>), and said to have a “ready temper” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">DeGregorio, 2009</xref>, p. 19). He seemed rigid, in the sense that “[a]ll his life he adhered to the habits he had learned in his youth …” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Ferling, 1992/2010</xref>, p. 173). It also appears he had frequent fits of depression, described as “black despair” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">DeGregorio, 2009</xref>, p. 19). Depression is common in autism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B288">Stewart et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>“There are very few People in this World, with whom I can bear to converse,” wrote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Adams (1776)</xref>. He could discuss business with colleagues, “but I am never happy in their Company. This has made me a Recluse …,” he continued. Adams lacked the facility for making small talk, and “social gatherings were maddeningly disagreeable ordeals for him” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Ferling, 1992/2010</xref>, p. 170). Socializing and making small talk is difficult and uncomfortable for most people with autism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Adams also seems to have had a certain tendency toward intense interests in restricted areas, which is often seen in autism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Asperger, 1944</xref>). Not only did Adams spend “a lifetime in politics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Ferling, 1992/2010</xref>, p. 452), he was also “if not obsessed with the law, at least extraordinarily committed to it…” Indeed, his legal studies were said to have “taken on a life of their own, spurring him to master obscure… precedents … far beyond the needs of his practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B263">Ryerson, 2005</xref>, p. 90).</p>
<p>Let us move across the Atlantic, and to times much closer to the present. After 10 years as chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown was prime minister of the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2010. Called “aloof” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">Davis, 2009</xref>) and claimed not to function well socially, he is said to be oblivious to the impacts of his actions on others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B271">Seldon and Lodge, 2011</xref>). We saw above that those with many autistic traits are often aloof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B315">Wainer et al., 2011</xref>). They also tend to be socially insensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Asperger, 1961</xref>).</p>
<p>Dubbed “humorless” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B255">Richards, 2010</xref>, p. 315), and unable to make small talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">Freedland, 2007</xref>), Brown is also said to have problems getting across to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B259">Robinson, 2013</xref>), with an “apparent inability to show empathy with voters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Brindle, 2008</xref>). Humor and empathy also tends to be problematic for those who have autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, Brown may have some tendency toward intense and restricted interests. He has spent a lifetime in politics, even writing a doctoral thesis on political change in his native Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Brown, 1981</xref>). A biography of the former prime minister has been called “a study in political obsession” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B289">Sylvester, 2004</xref>). Yet Brown appears to have room for one more enthusiasm. His Labor Party homepage claims he was “football<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>-obsessed” as a little boy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B291">The Labour Party, n.d.</xref>), and as prime minister he was still “totally obsessed” with the sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136">Hencke, 2008</xref>), demonstrating “encyclopedic knowledge” of football and footballers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B207">McBride, 2014</xref>, p. 30).</p>
<p>Brown is also called “obsessive” more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">Harris, 2006</xref>) – indeed, a “control freak” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">Harris, 2006</xref>), or even a “control freak’s control freak” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B253">Rawnsley, 2010</xref>, p. 473), with an “inflexible style” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B292">Theakston, 2011</xref>, p. 92) and a “neurotic attention to detail” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B255">Richards, 2010</xref>, p. 382), all traits often found in autistic people (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>). Lord Turnbull, former head of Britain’s civil service, has claimed that Brown operated with “Stalinist ruthlessness” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B298">Timmins, 2007</xref>). This seems not to be an untypical assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B292">Theakston, 2011</xref>), and may indicate a lack of empathy.</p>
<p>Physical clumsiness is also often observed in people with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B245">Papadopoulos et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">Harris (2006)</xref> describes Brown’s “physical awkwardness” and calls him “autistic.”</p>
<p>Harold Macmillan was prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1957 to 1963, and is generally seen as one of the more successful British heads of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">Historical Rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom, 2016</xref>). “A shy and sensitive child” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B205">Matthew, 2011</xref>), Macmillan had a “lonely childhood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B296">Thorpe, 2010</xref>, p. 18), and was “not popular” at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B296">Thorpe, 2010</xref>, p. 24). Children with autism are often seen as shy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B162">Jones and Frederickson, 2010</xref>) and sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B204">Markram and Markram, 2010</xref>). They tend to have a lonely childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Bauminger and Kasari, 2000</xref>) and to be unpopular at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Asperger, 1961</xref>).</p>
<p>Macmillan grew up to be “a rather awkward figure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B296">Thorpe, 2010</xref>, p. 283) who called himself a “very buttoned-up person” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147">Horne, 1989</xref>, p. 12) – and people with autism have been called “awkward” since they were first described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B166">Kanner, 1943</xref>, p. 229). “[F]riends … were, in truth, few and far between,” says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B325">Williams (2010</xref>, p. 473). Hence Macmillan could feel “deeply lonely” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B225">Mount, 2011</xref>), and, said <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B294">Thomas (1998</xref>, p. 180), “suffered from extremes of loneliness.”</p>
<p>Macmillan had a “habit of lecturing his colleagues” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B325">Williams, 2010</xref>, p. 183), but an “inability to listen” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B225">Mount, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B325">Williams (2010</xref>, p. 471) reports that even Queen Elizabeth was “bored at being lectured (by Macmillan) and not being listened to.” People with autism often monopolize conversations with lectures or monologs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B157">James, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A certain lack of empathy may be behind Macmillan’s reported “ability to ignore, often brutally, those who stood in his way” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B325">Williams, 2010</xref>, p. 174). “Again and again, one notices the callous insouciance …,” says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B225">Mount (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Macmillan is called “sensitive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B296">Thorpe, 2010</xref>, pp. 31, 105) “highly strung” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147">Horne, 1989</xref>, p. 13) and prone to recurrent depressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Davidson, 2011</xref>), with a “lifelong hypochondria” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B205">Matthew, 2011</xref>). At 37, he had what “seemed to have been a full-scale nervous breakdown” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147">Horne, 1989</xref>, p. 98), and “another bad collapse” at 49 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B225">Mount, 2011</xref>). Motorically, he was described as “clumsy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B304">Van der Kloot, 2009</xref>, p. 4) with “a marked lack of prowess… for any kind of athletics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147">Horne, 1989</xref>, p. 13).</p>
<p>The three people just described are one long dead American and two more recent characters. The two were Britons, however, from a nation said to appreciate eccentrics. Indeed, a political observer points out that many British heads of government have been somewhat eccentric, and feels the British electorate wants their prime ministers to be “slightly set apart, a little bit weird” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145">Hoggart, 2010</xref>). There is evidence that people with more than the average number of autistic traits are often seen as eccentric (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B153">Ingersoll and Wainer, 2014</xref>). So before we continue, let’s have a look at just one more powerful person, one who wasn’t British.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan was “aloof,” says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Bolton (2008</xref>, p. 99). “Adored by so many, he was a man with no real friends,” says his biographer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B221">Morris (2004)</xref>, who also calls the 40th president “remote,” “detached,” and often insensitive to others. But <italic>system</italic> appealed to him. Reagan “needed to impose order on chaos … he liked punctuality, symmetry, sureness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B221">Morris, 2004</xref>). A strong affinity for systemizing, another word for imposing order on chaos, is said to be a central feature of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Baron-Cohen et al., 2011</xref>). While Reagan’s diary is “remarkable for a near-total lack of interest in people as individuals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B221">Morris, 2004</xref>), the game of politics aroused an intense and restricted interest in the former actor. In his thirties he was already “so obsessed with trade unionism and anti-Communism as to lose interest in casual chat,” and his first wife divorced him citing politics as her co-respondent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B221">Morris, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Characteristics of the Powerful</title>
<p>The biographical sketches above may indicate that it is not impossible for individuals described as cold, aloof, rigid, depressive, obsessive, socially insensitive, etc. to achieve power. More interesting, however, and a stronger test of the present hypothesis, are findings describing how those who feel powerful behave more generally.</p>
<p>It seems priming a feeling of power makes people more self-centered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Galinsky et al., 2006</xref>), or more focused on the self than are those who have less power (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B309">Van Kleef et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Also, those feeling powerful seem to engage in more abstract thinking than do those who feel less powerful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B200">Magee and Smith, 2013</xref>). People primed to feel powerful often seem more honest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Anderson and Berdahl, 2002</xref>), perhaps because power makes a person care less about what others might think (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">Galinsky et al., 2008</xref>). At the same time, those primed to feel powerful appear more sensitive to being slighted than subjects primed to feel they have less power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B266">Sawaoka et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Powerful people also often appear suspicious about the causes of subordinates’ good behavior – not attributing it to selflessness or intrinsic motivation, but to their own power as managers to distribute reward and punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B173">Kipnis, 1972</xref>). Simply priming the thought of being powerful appears to make subjects start thinking in similarly cynical ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B150">Inesi et al., 2012</xref>). It is relevant that agreeableness appears to correlate negatively with leadership success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Boudreau et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A feeling of power, it seems, also tends to reduce submissiveness. For instance, college students primed to feel powerful were less willing to try and reach goals their mothers had set for them than were members of a group who had engaged in a neutral priming procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B151">Inesi and Rios, 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">Gardner (1995)</xref> studied the biographies of people who were later to become very powerful leaders, and found that quite early in their lives, they were typically marked by “a willingness to confront individuals in authority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">Gardner, 1995</xref>, p. 286).</p>
<p>Compared to those who feel they lack power, those feeling powerful have a stronger preference for solitary activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Conlon, 2012</xref>), and are more socially distant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B183">Lammers et al., 2012</xref>), with an increased tendency to treat people as objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B173">Kipnis, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B185">Lammers and Stapel, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on biographical material, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B194">Ludwig (2002)</xref> studied a great number of individuals who had ruled a country in the 20th century, and found that “[o]ther than voicing their views on politics, they usually were not adept as conversationalists and did not feel comfortable in social settings…. Despite their outer veneer of sociability, they remained very private people …” (p. 336). When people who feel powerful do take part in conversations, they often monopolize them with lectures or monologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B300">Tost et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, priming a feeling of power tends to give subjects more difficulty reading others’ emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Galinsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">Gonzaga et al., 2008</xref>), and more difficulty taking others’ perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Galinsky et al., 2006</xref>). Those feeling powerful also tend to have a strong and narrow focus on goals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B142">Hirsh et al., 2011</xref>), which may help explain the finding that this group seems <italic>better</italic> than controls at taking others’ perspectives when a concrete goal must be reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B268">Schmid Mast et al., 2009</xref>). The construct of perspective taking is related to empathy and empathic accuracy, which has been found to be reduced in subjects primed to feel powerful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B310">van Kleef et al., 2008</xref>), as well as in real managers wielding structural power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B275">Sherman et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, as opposed to most people, there is evidence that the morality of those who feel powerful is based on rules, not affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B184">Lammers and Stapel, 2009</xref>). A feeling of power also frequently leaves people insensitive to social consequences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B142">Hirsh et al., 2011</xref>), and less easily influenced by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">Galinsky et al., 2008</xref>). It may also seem that very powerful people are lonely and depressed more often than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B194">Ludwig, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B196">Luntz (2011)</xref> points out that many powerful business leaders are very detail-oriented. One such leader is James Sinegal, founder of Costco, the multi-billion retailer. Sinegal feels a focus on details is essential to success in his line of business, and says: “[S]how me a big-picture guy, and I’ll show you a guy who’s out of the picture” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B196">Luntz, 2011</xref>, p. 179). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Collins and Hansen’s (2011)</xref> study of business leaders selected for their unusual degree of success, these individuals were described as relentless truth-seekers not influenced much by others’ opinions, always seeking out hard data instead. Subjects primed to feel powerful are also more diligent, as long as they do not find a task uninteresting because it is “beneath” them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">DeWall et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, what is it people do when they exercise power? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">Ent et al. (2012</xref>, p. 620) states that “power is essentially the control over other people and over what happens to them.” Not surprisingly, a tendency to act dominantly predicts power attainment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Anderson and Brion, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>It seems, then, that certain ways of thinking and acting are typical of those who feel powerful. What may be most interesting to us, however, is that studies have often found the same tendencies and characteristics in those who have many autistic traits (see <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Are They Really Autistic Traits?</title>
<p>The thesis of the present paper is that autistic traits can help people gain and sustain power. But traits found in one group of people can also be found in another. How do we know that what we discuss is related to autism? To the extent that powerful people have something in common in the way they differ from others, how do we know that they aren’t psychopaths, for example? It has been argued that psychopathic people can often be found high up in many organizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Babiak and Hare, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Boddy et al., 2010</xref>). And yes, as might be expected of psychopaths, the leaders discussed in the present paper appear at times to have lacked empathy. However, they do not seem to have much of the glib and superficial charm often ascribed to psychopaths, nor of other traits included in a much-used instrument like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129">Hare’s (2003)</xref> Psychopathy Checklist, like pathological lying, parasitic lifestyle, and irresponsibility.</p>
<p>It’s been argued that many leaders are narcissistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B198">Maccoby, 2007</xref>), and, as pointed out by a reviewer, it must be hard for a leader to avoid becoming at least somewhat narcissistic, once he or she gains power. It we turn to diagnoses, however, a category such as “narcissistic personality disorder” in the DSM-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>) is probably not the right one for the powerful people discussed here. The lack of empathy can be there, but not typically the expectation to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements, the preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, or ideal love, nor the belief that one should only associate with other special or high-status persons, to take the first three on the DSM-5 list of nine diagnostic criteria.</p>
<p>Could we instead be talking about schizoid, or perhaps obsessive-compulsive personality traits? People with such characteristics have much in common with those who have autism, to the extent that there is evidence of appreciable overlap among these categories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Constantino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B195">Lugnegård et al., 2012</xref>). Quite a few characteristics, in other words, can reasonably be called autistic, as well as schizoid or obsessive-compulsive.</p>
<p>At the same time, some traits are more common in autistic people than in other personality types. For instance, people with schizoid personality disorder are often indifferent to either praise or criticism, they rarely appear angry, and take pleasure in few, if any activities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B215">Millon et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>People with autism are typically sensitive to criticism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">Fitzgerald, 2004</xref>). There are no indications that powerful people are typically indifferent to praise or criticism, and many descriptions of powerful people who are not. They also seem to want praise at least as much as others.</p>
<p>One example is Lyndon Johnson, who, it seems, was always seeking approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B276">Shesol, 1997</xref>). In presidents Washington and Nixon, it appears that both were the case. The first president “was overly sensitive to criticism and suffered from a lifelong need for approval,” says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Chernow (2010</xref>, p. 11), his biographer. Richard Nixon, too, it seems, sought constant approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">Frank, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B283">Stanley, 2013</xref>), while also reacting to criticism with strong negative emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B168">Karpowitz, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B194">Ludwig (2002)</xref> gives more examples of powerful people who yearn for approval and are sensitive to criticism.</p>
<p>Approval or praise can also serve as potent reinforcers of autistic patients’ behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B317">Walton and Ingersoll, 2013</xref>). Both powerful and autistic people will often get irritated easily (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Bower, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>), and both groups tend to be strongly engaged in one or a few interests, like politics or trains – and sometimes both. British prime minister Harold Wilson was fascinated by trains and railway timetables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B159">Jenkins, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Roy Jenkins, former president of the European Commission, described as a boy as “obsessively numerate… addicted to numbers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Campbell, 2014</xref>), said he and Wilson had common interests, not only is statistical details, but also in “railway timetables and railway stations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138">Hennessy, 2001</xref>, p. 363). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Campbell (2014)</xref> recounts that all his life Jenkins loved making lists and grading things, and says his love of numbers was what brought him to trainspotting. As a boy, says Campbell, Jenkins used to plan train journeys, including times and interchanges, to faraway destinations, and could reel off all the stations on the Paris metro.</p>
<p>Harry Truman, too, was a train lover. Truman excelled in math as a boy. His entire life, he was often lonely, and the kind of man who “insisted that things be done just so,” concerning himself “with details of a kind others would never have bothered with” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B208">McCullough, 1992</xref>, quotations from p. 182). His communication skills were said to be so bad as to be “instructive mainly as a source of warnings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">Greenstein, 2009</xref>, p. 39). But when it came to trains, Truman was “fascinated.” As a boy, he used to sit alone on the roof and count the number of freight cars in each train rolling by. When asked, years later, if he remembered how much he used to love trains, he said, “I still do” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B208">McCullough, 1992</xref>, p. 44).</p>
<p>A look at obsessive-compulsive (or “anankastic”) personality disorder shows that, like autistic persons, people of this type often want others to perform a task in exactly the right way. They also tend to be inflexible and obsessed with details (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B215">Millon et al., 2004</xref>). However, they tend not to have the problems communicating and interacting socially that typify autistics (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>), and, it seems, many of the powerful people described here.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s worth mentioning that schizotypal personality disorder can also overlap with autism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Barneveld et al., 2011</xref>). The tendency to be cold, aloof, and withdrawn is a commonality. However, schizotypal types also often have abnormal perceptual experiences, magical thinking, and paranoia, among other things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>), signs and symptoms not typically found in autistics or powerful persons.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Affable and Socially Talented?</title>
<p>It has long been a popular assumption that successful leaders are affable and socially talented (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Caldwell and Wellman, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B164">Judge and Bono, 2000</xref>). Leadership scholars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121">Goleman and Boyatzis (2008</xref>, p. 74) depict “great leaders,” and “place them on the opposite end of the neural continuum from people with serious social disorders, such as autism.”</p>
<p>Yet several powerful individuals have been deemed autistic by other authors, among them legendary leaders such as U.S. president Thomas Jefferson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B187">Ledgin, 2000</xref>), French president Charles de Gaulle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">Fitzgerald and O’Brien, 2007</xref>), and Irish president Éamon de Valera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">Fitzgerald, 2004</xref>), as well as tyrants such as Vidkun Quisling, Norway’s WWII collaborationist prime minister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Dahl, 2012</xref>). Like other diagnoses from afar, these, too, must be viewed with skepticism – but they could lend some credence to a slightly less specific assumption, that powerful politicians such as these may have had more autistic traits than the average person. Let us look at one of them.</p>
<p>Charles de Gaulle thought a true leader should renounce friendship and isolate himself from his men, says his biographer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Fenby, 2010</xref>). “One does not exist in his eyes as a distinct person,” wrote Claude Mauriac, the president’s private secretary. De Gaulle, he continued, “judges what you say <italic>in abstracto</italic> without linking it to who one is or what one knows” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B206">Mauriac, 1970</xref>, p. 167, translated by Jonathan Fenby). Control was everything to de Gaulle, says Fenby, who goes on to describe the president using words like “aloof” (p. 138), “cold” (p. 82), “distant” (p. 82), “compulsive” (p. 5), and “physically awkward” (p. 82), calling him a loner, ill at ease on social occasions, and with an explosive anger. De Gaulle’s command of the French language was extreme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Fenby, 2010</xref>), yet “foreign diplomats were often dumbfounded by his lack of verbal communication” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B132">Haskew, 2011</xref>, p. 40). Anomalous communication and social interaction are typical of autistic people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Descriptions of other presidents can also cast light on the possible connection between power and autistic traits. South Africa’s Nelson Mandela, for instance, was often described as “aloof” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B258">Roberts, 2013</xref>). Family members felt he was cold and unable to express love, describing instead the extent to which politics was an intense and circumscribed interest for Mandela: “He’s given his life to politics. He lives and breathes politics” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B202">Malone, 2013</xref>). Mandela’s daughter has been quoted as saying: “He’s awkward. To his children he’s awkward; he doesn’t know how to reach out” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B202">Malone, 2013</xref>). “[R]emote self-sufficiency,” were the words a biographer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B189">Lodge, 2006</xref>, p. 17) used to describe the typical attitude of the liberation hero.</p>
<p>Mandela’s children, then, thought him a distant father – and “old friends teased him about his being persnickety and pedantic,” reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B258">Roberts (2013)</xref>. People with autism are often said to be pedantic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Attwood, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Mandela, whose record-keeping was “obsessive” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B236">Nkosi, 2015</xref>), was also obsessed with newspapers, said his wife, and after reading them he folded every paper exactly the same way every day. Each day he also took off his hearing aid, lined it up on the table, and then placed a badge he was wearing in position, and then his pens, so that “the pens, and everything has the same line” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B257">Roberts, 2008</xref>). Lining things up in rows or patterns is a common habit among people with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B281">South et al., 2005</xref>). It appears Mandela was “structuring his life down to the smallest details” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B257">Roberts, 2008</xref>). People with autism tend to be very attentive to details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Baron-Cohen et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Another African president, Robert Mugabe, was not popular with the children he grew up with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B256">Robert Mugabe, 2007</xref>), who used to tease him (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B146">Holland, 2008</xref>). Teasing and bullying happens, alas, to most high-functioning children with autism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B165">Kaland, 2010</xref>). Mugabe was always a loner, says a biographer, an aloof man who wanted to make all decisions himself, and never made any friends (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B146">Holland, 2008</xref>). He “lacked emotional understanding of social interaction,” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B146">Holland, 2008</xref>, p. 74), sometimes refusing, for instance, to say a word in one-on-one meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B256">Robert Mugabe, 2007</xref>). “Almost everybody who knows Robert Mugabe has commented on his coldness,” says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B146">Holland (2008</xref>, p. 182), who first met him in 1975, and noted later that he “he swaggered awkwardly as he does still” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">Heidi Holland, 2012</xref>). People with autism often have a strange gait (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B245">Papadopoulos et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Let’s end this part with U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson. He was a bossy child, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Caro (1982)</xref>: If little Lyndon wasn’t allowed to be in charge, he would not take part in a game. As an adult, he still had a strong need to dominate. Autistic people are often bossy and controlling (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In discussions, Johnson tended to lecture – and always about politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Caro, 1982</xref>). For Johnson, politics is described as being an intense and circumscribed interest from childhood. Even as a boy, Johnson was only happy when he was “politicking,” said his relatives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Caro, 1982</xref>, p. 72).</p>
<p>Johnson was a perfectionist, a “very, very detailed” man for whom “things had to be absolutely correct,” said an old friend (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Caro, 1982</xref>, p. 354). This is also typical of many people with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Caro (1982)</xref> goes on to describe the 36th president as intense and rigid, often worried and fearful, with periods of depression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Caro (1982)</xref> also often returns to his “lack of physical coordination” (p. 192), pointing out, among other things, Johnson’s “awkward walk” (p. 171).</p>

<title>Did Power Change Them?</title>
<p>Lord Owen, a physician and former British foreign secretary, has described a condition he calls “hubris syndrome,” which he claims can befall the powerful. Reduced empathy and loss of contact with reality, often associated with progressive isolation, are among the signs and symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B241">Owen, 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B242">Owen and Davidson (2009)</xref> assume that hubris syndrome will tend to abate once power is lost.</p>
<p>There is every reason to think that autistic traits exist from early childhood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B192">Loveland, 2011</xref>). We have just seen, however, that feeling powerful can make a non-autistic subject seem more autistic-like. So when powerful people in real life seem somewhat autistic – have they always been that way, or did power change them? Not only Owen’s hubris syndrome, but also the priming studies discussed above might point to the latter alternative. A clear possibility, however, is that power does change people, but not completely. Indeed, achieving power might often strengthen autistic tendencies that were already there, already stronger than average. Our discussion of testosterone, below, will be relevant in this regard. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Asperger (1944)</xref> claims that autistic traits can help people get high-status jobs. It is not a great leap to assume that some of those jobs will be positions of power.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>But Can Autistic Traits Be Helpful?</title>
<p>It may be, as our discussion indicates, that autistic traits do not necessarily prevent a person from achieving power. Moreover, it is interesting that so many autistic-like traits can be found in the powerful – their thinking styles, self-centeredness, preference for solitary activities, being socially distant, having less empathy, a reduced ability to recognize emotions, and several other things (see <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). However, the present paper’s hypothesis specifically says that autistic traits can be helpful in achieving power. We shall look at this in the sections to follow.</p>
<p>Thought-provoking data exist that can throw light on whether autistic traits can help propel a person (or another primate) to power. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B303">van de Waal et al. (2013)</xref> describe 10 male vervet monkeys who migrated into a new group. Nine of the 10 changed their diet, and started eating what the new group ate. One individual held out, however, and kept eating what he had always eaten. This inflexible, socially insensitive monkey quickly rose to take the top rank of the group he had migrated into.</p>
<p>Let’s continue, however, with a quick look at what humans need to acquire and sustain power. Does it take a gregarious and agreeable personality? Many studies now indicate that this is not the case (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Collins and Hansen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">Grant et al., 2011</xref>), and illustrative cases are legion. President Obama is generally said to be “aloof” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Bouie, 2013</xref>), dealing with foreign leaders and members of Congress in a “cool, businesslike” manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B274">Shear, 2015</xref>). “He’s not good with personal relationships; that’s not what interests him,” said a U.S. diplomat (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Cooper and Worth, 2012</xref>). Obama “has largely outsourced the relationship building,” says <italic>The New York Times</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B274">Shear, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Mitt Romney, Obama’s 2012 opponent, has been called “reserved by nature,” “data-driven,” and “emotionally remote,” with a “sometimes awkward style and aloof manner.” As governor of Massachusetts, “he wanted to control everything,” “tended not to socialize,” and tried to avoid casual conversations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Barbaro, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Does acquiring and holding on to power take strong motivation? There are often more ambitious individuals than positions available, which would indicate that much motivation is needed. Where, then, could motivation to acquire power come from? We shall consider evolutionary mechanisms, but let us first look at proximate causes. Whether or not Ronald Reagan had more autistic traits than the average person, he was seen as having a need “to impose order on chaos” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B221">Morris, 2004</xref>) – and this may be a good place to start.</p>
<p>Having autistic traits tends to mean feeling a need for control and orderliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B166">Kanner, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B240">Overskeid, 2016</xref>). That need may make you try to order the physical world, as in scientific research – and people with autistic traits seem especially drawn to the physical sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Baron-Cohen et al., 2001</xref>). Yet holding social power may well mean having even more control.</p>
<p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, could be a case in point. A biographical portrait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B252">Radice, 2013</xref>) pointed out that “she always wanted to use power. It’s just that before the [Berlin] wall came down, she wanted power over molecules… and after the wall came down, it was power on a wider stage.” Merkel studied physics and holds a doctoral degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B181">Lachmann and Reuth, 2013</xref>). People in the “hard” sciences tend to have more autistic traits than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Austin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As a girl, Merkel took part in the “Math Olympics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B228">Müller-Lissner, 2015</xref>), and knew all the names of members of the East German as well as the West German governments, but still “… tried not to be a nerd” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B216">Mills, 2008</xref>, p. 25). She was also physically clumsy, and has explained: “What a normal person can do quite naturally, I had to process consciously and perform laboriously. I was a little idiot when it came to moving. My patient parents always had to tell me how to walk down a hill – from a technical point of view” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B188">Leßnerkraus, 2005</xref>, p. 97, my translation). An associate who has known her long says Merkel is “very difficult to know … She is like a computer …” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B243">Packer, 2014</xref>). In political meetings, “she is almost uncannily immersed in the details of whatever is under discussion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B154">Irwin, 2015</xref>). Other observers have called Merkel “remote,” “a bit awkward,” and noted her “analytical detachment” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B243">Packer, 2014</xref>). High-functioning people with autism are often seen as analytical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Bryson, 2005</xref>), and can be socially detached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B279">Soderstrom et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>An important reason for the success of a surprising number of people with many autistic traits, said <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Asperger (1944)</xref>, is the fact that people in this group tend to concentrate strongly on a special interest, which he thought could result in great accomplishments. And when those tending toward autism choose politics, perhaps we should not be so surprised. Politics has been called “a hypermasculine world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Brooks, 2015</xref>, p. 46), and autism is, after all, seen by some as hypermasculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Asperger, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Baron-Cohen, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>It was perhaps to be expected, then, when researchers found autistic people to often be controlling and bossy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>), with an intense and narrow focus on the goals or interests that preoccupy them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Bryson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B278">Smith et al., 2009</xref>), and ofttimes extremely persistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">Gillberg, 2002</xref>). This combination of traits may help people get ahead in many areas. Regarding <italic>where</italic> these individuals might want to get ahead, it is interesting to note that many individuals with autism do appear to take a strong interest in politics (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Baron-Cohen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B316">Walker and Fitzgerald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B244">Palermo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">Government Equalities Office, 2014</xref>). So when high-functioning autistic people are asked about their interests, science and gadgets are not the only subjects they mention – but also politics and closely related areas, such as the U.S. Congress, U.S. presidents, history, and social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B281">South et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B175">Klin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B191">Lorenz and Heinitz, 2014</xref>). It does not seem unthinkable, then, that people with many autistic traits will try their luck in politics, and that some will reach positions of power.</p>

<title>Buy A Dog</title>
<p>Autistic traits that contribute to persistence and a strong focus on goals can increase one’s chances of reaching ambitious objectives. To most people, however, another consideration is also important: we want to be liked. At a minimum we want to avoid being disliked. On the other hand, achieving much social power is well-nigh impossible if one is too sensitive to others’ real or imagined negative reactions. There is competition for positions, and it is difficult to be popular among those one tries to beat and their allies. Also, having won a position of power, one must make decisions that will often be opposed.</p>
<p>“If you want a friend in Washington, buy a dog,” is a tip that comes not only from kennel owners, but also from politicians (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">Fisher, 1987</xref>). Donald Rumsfeld has added: “Better make it a small dog, because it may turn on you also” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B264">Safire, 2008</xref>, p. 635). People observing politics outside of Washington have reached similar conclusions, for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B199">Machiavelli (1966)</xref>, in renaissance Italy, and Manmohan Singh, the former prime minister, in present day India (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B249">PM hints at, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, then, many powerful people have been rather lonely figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B194">Ludwig, 2002</xref>). Among those described with words to that effect are presidents like Washington [“had no friends in the real sense of the word” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">Ferling, 1988/2010</xref>, p. 262)], Polk [“… not well liked … He had few close friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Byrnes, 2001</xref>, p. 157)], Truman [“never popular like other boys” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B208">McCullough, 1992</xref>, p. 35); often felt “lonely” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B208">McCullough, 1992</xref>, e.g., p. 1042)], and Carter [“as a boy, and later as a man, Jimmy was ‘lonely”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">Godbold, 2010</xref>, p. 22)]. Legendary Polish president Józef Piłsudski was “a loner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140">Hetherington, 2012</xref>, p. 357), as was West German chancellor Willy Brandt [“an utter lack of intimates … a loner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">Drath, 2005</xref>, p. 15)], and also recent British prime ministers Thatcher [“She had no real friends” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Campbell, 2009</xref>, p. 367), Wilson (“general lack of need or gift for friendship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B159">Jenkins, 2004</xref>)], and Heath [“introverted and lonely man” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B331">Ziegler, 2011</xref>, p. 512), Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion (“made few friends” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B273">Shapira, 2014</xref>, p. 54)], Danish prime minister Jens Otto Krag [“did not make many friends – if any” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B246">Pedersen, 1995</xref>, p. 255)], and Scottish first minister Alex Salmond [“always… something of a lone operator” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B321">Wheeler, 2014</xref>)]. This list must have an end, but finding more examples is not difficult (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B194">Ludwig, 2002</xref>). Those with many autistic traits also tend not to have many friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B186">Lasgaard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B153">Ingersoll and Wainer, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>It should perhaps not surprise us, then, that powerful people often act in ways that do not normally further friendly relations. As we saw above: They tend to be more self-centered than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Galinsky et al., 2006</xref>), more socially distant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B183">Lammers et al., 2012</xref>), more often treat others as objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B185">Lammers and Stapel, 2011</xref>), and have a stronger preference for solitary activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Conlon, 2012</xref>). Many such characteristics we saw the powerful share with those who have autism (see <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>A lack of interest in others and what they might think could leave you rather lonely, but such lack of interest need not be a handicap for the person wanting to gain and hold on to power – and it could be an advantage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">Galinsky et al. (2008</xref>, p. 1463) point out that “the experience of power liberates individuals from the straightjacket of the social world, allowing them to define for themselves what is and is not achievable…. [I]t is the protection from situational influence … that helps powerful individuals surmount social obstacles and reach greater heights of creativity to express the unpopular ideals of today that can lead others to the horizons of tomorrow.”</p>
<p>And there is more. In explaining Gordon Brown’s success as a negotiator, a senior official said: “Gordon is stronger because he doesn’t care whether people hate him …” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B253">Rawnsley, 2010</xref>, p. 58). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B225">Mount (2011)</xref> described another British prime minister, Harold Macmillan: “[T]hroughout his life he was disliked by many and hated by quite a few…. Not that he much minded being unpopular.” Autistic people often seem unconcerned regarding what others might think of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B156">Izuma et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It is also worth contemplating that even in animal leaders, lack of social sensitivity is widespread (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B303">van de Waal et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">Johnstone and Manica (2011)</xref> see leaders across types of animals as stubborn, mostly acting the way they are themselves inclined to, not responding much to other group members. Interestingly, in humans, the most effective leaders appear to be those who do <italic>not</italic> behave in accordance with the cultural norms of the organizations they lead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131">Hartnell et al., 2016</xref>). Autistic children, says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Asperger (1961</xref>, p. 182), “in all things follow their own impulses and interests. Unconcerned by others’ wishes, they say and do exactly what they want” (my translation).</p>
<p>Across types of animals, there are many indications, then, that those who acquire power are often the most stubborn individuals – those who paddle their own canoes, not those most sensitive to others’ needs or feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Conradt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">Johnstone and Manica, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B312">van Vugt, 2014</xref>). This could of course be different in humans – but it does not seem to be. We saw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">Gardner (1995)</xref> pointing out that those who go on to be leaders often confront authority from an early age. In Britain, the most rebellious member of Parliament for the 13 years that Labor was last in government, voting against his own party 428 times, was Jeremy Corbyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Cowley, 2015</xref>). He is now the leader of the Labor party. Other recent British party leaders, Labor as well as Conservative, have also been rebellious in this sense – examples being Neil Kinnock and Iain Duncan Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Cowley, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Features powerful humans seem to share with autistics also have to do with insensitivity: we saw the diminished capacity to read others’ emotions, the reduction in empathy or empathic accuracy, the bossy behavior. Autistic children, says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Asperger (1961</xref>, p. 188), feel a “need to always go their own way and use methods they have themselves invented” (my translation).</p>
<p>Powerful persons make decisions affecting many lives, and must sometimes even place others in harm’s way. In such circumstances, empathy can be a poor guide to ethically sound decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Bloom, 2013</xref>). Instead, the best decisions will often be made by following utilitarian ethical rules, instead of trying to empathize with all affected individuals. It is, for example, a common view that Congress was ethically right in declaring war on Germany in 1941. Yet too much empathy with those bound to suffer and die in that war might have made the decision difficult, though it ultimately helped rid the world of Nazism and thus prevented wretchedness affecting even more individuals. We saw that autistics and the powerful tend more often to make rule-based moral choices than do other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B184">Lammers and Stapel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Baron-Cohen, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B193">Lucas and Sheeran (2006)</xref> assume that Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, had Asperger syndrome.</p>
<p>In less dramatic situations, too, a powerful person may have few alternatives other than treating others as tools or as objects. In filling a post, you want the most qualified individual, even if another applicant would be bitterly disappointed by not getting the job. In other words, you want the best human tool, not the person who might most need your empathy. It is probably also a fact that those aiming for powerful positions may find that it necessary to use people and hurt feelings in order to satisfy their ambition. This, too, will likely be easier for those with some degree of social insensitivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B133">Hauser (2013</xref>, p. 20) goes further, claiming that a “tendency toward cruelty has been selected because it can help achieve and sustain power by striking fear in others.”</p>
<p>Many powerful people have been described in ways that are consistent with a lack of social sensitivity. If we limit ourselves to some early American presidents and the most recent British prime ministers, we see that John Quincy Adams was supposedly “famous for his cold demeanor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">DeGregorio, 2009</xref>, p. 89), that James K. Polk appeared “cold” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Byrnes, 2001</xref>, p. 157), and that Lincoln was seen as a “cold man” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Burlingame, 2008</xref>, p. 181) – while David Cameron “can be ruthless” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B293">Theakston, 2015</xref>, p. 7), and Gordon Brown, as we saw, was said to operate with “Stalinist ruthlessness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B298">Timmins, 2007</xref>). Autistic children, says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Asperger (1961</xref>, p. 191) are “ruthlessly intent on enforcing their wishes” (my translation).</p>
<p>Now achieving power and keeping it are two different things. It seems reasonable, given the relevant data, that holding power can increase the tendency to make cold decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B185">Lammers and Stapel, 2011</xref>), and be more self-centered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Galinsky et al., 2006</xref>) and less sensitive (among other things, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B142">Hirsh et al., 2011</xref>). But though that may be true, we should perhaps assume that on their way up, those who aren’t yet very powerful would have much to gain by being warm, other-centered, and sensitive to the feelings of people around them.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. By the time Lyndon B. Johnson was a college student, he showed signs of limited empathy. He used threats to win a student election, and to have fun, he tricked an acquaintance into putting cow dung on his face, then telling others so they could ridicule the boy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Caro, 1982</xref>). At the same time Johnson flattered the college president so intensely that the president “displayed toward Lyndon a friendliness he had never displayed to any other student …” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Caro, 1982</xref>, p. 192).</p>
<p>Much genuine empathy may not be necessary to rise in an organization. And we saw that even psychopaths can have impressive careers, at least in the corporate world (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Babiak et al., 2010</xref>). There is also evidence that following a simple rule of flattering those you want to influence can get you a long way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B320">Westphal and Stern, 2007</xref>) – and there is no doubt that people with many autistic traits can learn and practice complex sets of rules to master social interaction. It seems clear that those who have Asperger syndrome can do it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Baron-Cohen, 2003</xref>), and they get better as they get older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Asperger, 1961</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B270">Schwenck et al. (2012)</xref> found continuous improvement in the empathic skills of autistic people through childhood and adolescence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Baron-Cohen et al. (1999</xref>, p. 477) point out that “a good understanding of politics” may be “independent of the kind of empathic skills involved in more intimate social relationships.” And even with the social handicaps that come with autism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Asperger (1944</xref>, p. 117, my translation) noted that “these children … often make astonishingly precise and mature judgments of the people around them.” And since our focus, after all, is primarily on people who have many autistic traits without quite deserving a diagnosis, it is interesting to see that the jury is still out with regard to which (if any) deficiencies this group has when it comes to understanding other minds. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Baron-Cohen and Hammer (1997)</xref> found that parents of children with Asperger syndrome did worse than controls on a theory of mind-related test – while in a study of healthy university students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B179">Kunihira et al. (2006)</xref> did not find a relation between results on a theory of mind test and a test of autistic tendencies – and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137">Henderson et al. (2015)</xref> found no difference between high functioning autistic participants and typical controls on theory of mind tasks.</p>
<p>Finally, the extent to which autistic people’s typically low scores on tests of theory of mind are caused by low motivation rather than low ability is also unclear. It does appear, however, that when the setting is competitive, many children with autism can track the beliefs of other individuals, thus indicating that, at least in this context, they have a theory of mind – even if the same kids fail traditional tests designed to gauge this construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B248">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Chang and Cheung, 2016</xref>). Politics, of course, is often very competitive, and might therefore also motivate theorizing about the minds of others.</p>
<p>As is normally the case in autism, we also saw that taking others’ perspective seems difficult for people who feel powerful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Galinsky et al., 2006</xref>). But this, too, appears to change when participants need to take others’ perspective to succeed in a task they have set out to accomplish. Then subjects primed with high power can do even better than those primed with low power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B268">Schmid Mast et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Competence</title>
<p>Whether voters voice considered opinions or form quick, automatic judgments, they appear to want competent political leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Bull, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B299">Todorov et al., 2005</xref>). So let us look at relevant competence in high-functioning autistics. One aspect is memory: the autistic person will often have an impressive ability to remember facts, especially in his or her areas of special interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B166">Kanner, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Asperger, 1944</xref>) – and to become powerful in competitive fields like business or politics, business or politics must probably be your special interest. Moreover, not only do autistic people often have impressive memories, they also seem better than neurotypicals at distinguishing false from real memories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Beversdorf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141">Hillier et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>But memory is not enough, other aspects of intelligence are also needed, and high-functioning people with autism appear to score higher on fluid intelligence than do controls matched for gender, age, and full IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134">Hayashi et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Specific thinking skills are certainly also important. There is evidence that those who have autism are able to think in more logical and less biased ways than typical controls with similar IQs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">De Martino et al., 2008</xref>); this also includes being better at drawing conclusions regarding causes and mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Baron-Cohen et al., 1986</xref>). Autistics are apparently also less prone to jumping to conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Brosnan et al., 2014</xref>), and to committing a common fallacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B223">Morsanyi et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, autistics and people with subthreshold autistic traits seem better than others at thinking creatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B169">Kasirer and Mashal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Best et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Intelligence, creativity, and thinking skills can help people reach many goals, and it would be surprising if such attributes were irrelevant to achieving power. Given the competence often found in those who have many autistic traits, it may not be surprising that there could be more such persons among the powerful than we had perhaps expected.</p>

<sec>
<title>But Aren’t Autistic People Often Anxious, Depressed, and Powerless?</title>
<p>People who have many autistic traits, sometimes referred to as the BAP, are assumed to have many characteristics in common with those who have autism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B152">Ingersoll et al., 2011</xref>). And we should not forget that much more often than other people, autistic people have various psychiatric problems, such as anxiety – which also appears to be the case in those who simply have many autistic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B179">Kunihira et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Anxiety, especially if frequent and severe, can make it difficult to function well in any job. Difficulties can be overcome, however, and a number of people have performed well in powerful positions while battling angst and apprehension – three examples being British prime ministers Stanley Baldwin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B295">Thorpe, 1998</xref>), Anthony Eden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Davidson, 2011</xref>) and Harold Macmillan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B225">Mount, 2011</xref>). Hence it does not seem that being anxious rules out gaining and sustaining power – nor, apparently, does having depression, which may be more common among the powerful than anxiety (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Davidson, 2011</xref>). There is some evidence, even, that tending toward depression need not be a disadvantage to one who wants power, and could even be an asset, especially if paired with periods of elevated mood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B180">Kyaga et al., 2015</xref>). Let us look a little closer, then, at the relations among autism, power, and fear, which have some intriguing aspects.</p>
<p>First, while there is no doubt that autism often implies anxiety and depression, autistics may also seem fearless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Bachevalier and Loveland, 2006</xref>) – as may powerful people. Indeed, Winston Churchill, while suffering from recurrent depressions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Davidson, 2011</xref>), proved time and again his lack of fear, which more than once gave rise to foolhardiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Arnett, 1991</xref>). De Gaulle “suffered from periodic moods of depression” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Fenby, 2010</xref>, p. 415), and said his life had been “fairly filled with worries and melancholy” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Fenby, 2010</xref>, p. 349), yet “[h]is habitual fearlessness was evident to all …” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Fenby, 2010</xref>, p. 125).</p>
<p>We saw above that Harold Macmillan had nervous breakdowns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B225">Mount, 2011</xref>) and recurrent depressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Davidson, 2011</xref>). Yet as a soldier in World War I, he showed conspicuous bravery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B205">Matthew, 2011</xref>). Later, himself wounded in a plane crash, Macmillan risked his life to save another man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B296">Thorpe, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The examples of Churchill, de Gaulle, and Macmillan should be sufficient to show that powerful people can be in far from perfect psychological health, but still tolerate substantial risks when needed, which is presumably often necessary for those who seek and hold power.</p>
<p>The extent to which high risk tolerance is important for acquiring and holding on to power is important, and not yet resolved. For example, the exceptionally successful leaders studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Collins and Hansen (2011)</xref> were called “neurotic” (p. 30), and said to show “hypervigilance” at all times (p. 29). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Collins and Hansen (2011</xref>, p. 27), these leaders never felt safe, and were “afraid – terrified, even – of what the world [might] throw at them.”</p>
<p>It seems, then, that people with some anxiety, perhaps even a good deal, can acquire power and keep it for some time. There is even the possibility that tending toward anxiety can help a person’s career – it may be smart, for instance, to never fully relax in an ultra-competitive environment. On the other hand, there is much evidence indicating that neuroticism in general and anxiety in particular may be unhelpful to someone seeking power (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B285">Stein and Kean, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B226">Moutafi et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of what we think we know about autism comes from people who need help. They come into contact with psychologists and doctors and hence become their research subjects. These people often have other problems in addition to autism, such as anxiety or attention deficit disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B219">Montes and Halterman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B322">White et al., 2009</xref>). It might be that undiagnosed autistics have less depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>Then again, we saw above that the group we are most interested in (the BAP, that is, those with subclinical autistic traits), have many of the characteristics often found in autistic people – anxiety prominent among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B179">Kunihira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B315">Wainer et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>An interim conclusion, then, would be that some anxiety could at times be helpful to those wanting power. Yet anxiety and other problems that often bother autistics can very probably also hinder the power-hungry.</p>
<p>In the average person, lack of power can lead to anxiety (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">Fiske et al., 1996</xref>). There is much evidence indicating that being in control feels especially important to autistics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B166">Kanner, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B197">Lyons and Fitzgerald, 2005</xref>). And since the connection between power and social control is so intimate – could it be that lack of power feels especially anxiety-provoking to those who have many autistic traits? And might it also be that such anxiety could be one source of motivation for power-seeking in people with many autistic traits? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B163">Josephs et al. (2006)</xref> found that people high in baseline testosterone (T) reported increased emotional distress when placed in a low status position, while those low in baseline T thought being placed in a high status position was distressing – and there is much evidence that testosterone and other androgenic hormones plays a role in occasioning autistic and power-related behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Testosterone As A Common Cause</title>
<p>It may well be important that autistic and powerful people seem to share many traits. Yet this remains a correlation. A stronger test of the claim that powerful people have more traits that can really be called autistic, would be to look for a common mechanism causing the shared traits. Interestingly, one appears to exist.</p>
<p>All humans produce testosterone (T), but in different amounts depending on sex, individual differences, and possible diseases (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Auyeung et al., 2013</xref>). Significant quantities of T originate in the testes, with the ovaries and adrenal glands as other sources (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B251">Puri, 2011</xref>), while a preponderance of the brain’s relevant receptors can be found in a subset of hypothalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">Fernández-Guasti et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>T helps shape thinking, feeling, and behavior in specific ways. This takes place in concert with other hormones and neurotransmitters, but T’s role is important. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B306">van Honk et al. (2014</xref>, p. 201) argue that “the social brain’s main chemical, without exaggeration, is testosterone.” One’s current stage of development helps determine testosterone levels (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Auyeung et al., 2013</xref>), as do life events, such as social success or defeat (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">Eisenegger et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>T starts shaping the brain in the womb, a point in time at which the amount of the hormone available is important in deciding the relatively permanent organization of several aspects of the brain. The amount of T available prenatally can vary greatly as a function of sex, and also among individuals of the same sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B190">Lombardo et al., 2012</xref>). After birth, varying levels of circulating testosterone can also activate tendencies to think, act, and feel in specific ways (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B306">van Honk et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<sec>
<title>Testosterone and Behavior</title>
<p>Since autism is much more prevalent among males, but not restricted to that sex, it is not surprising that several researchers have focused on androgenic hormones, and testosterone in particular, as possible causative factors. Some findings indicate that adult persons with autism, perhaps especially women, have excessive androgen levels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">Geier and Geier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B262">Ruta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B269">Schwarz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">El-Baz et al., 2014</xref>). Yet there are more studies to back the assumption that high prenatal (i.e., intrauterine) androgen levels increase the probability of autism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Baron-Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). The one, of course, does not rule out the other. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158">James (2014</xref>, p. 37): “The evidence is overwhelming for Baron-Cohen’s hypothesis that one cause of autism is exposure to high levels of intrauterine testosterone.” Many studies indicate that administering T to healthy adults of both sexes will increase the probability of several behaviors associated with autism as well as with the feeling of being powerful (see, e.g., <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>And what kind of person do we talk about when we talk about someone affected more strongly than most by T? Among other things, this individual would tend to be detail-oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Auyeung et al., 2009</xref>), bossy or dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B301">Turan et al., 2014</xref>), self-centered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B213">Mehta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B327">Wright et al., 2012</xref>), and often lonely and socially distant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B301">Turan et al., 2014</xref>). The person would have difficulty reading others’ emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B260">Ronay and Carney, 2013</xref>), and be low on empathy and empathic accuracy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Auyeung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B260">Ronay and Carney, 2013</xref>). He (or she) would probably be somewhat insensitive to social consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B307">van Honk and Schutter, 2007</xref>), but often quite persistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B319">Welker and Carré, 2015</xref>), and, at least if a boy, with a strong and narrow focus on goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Auyeung et al., 2013</xref>). <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold> shows that most of these behaviors (and others) can be found in powerful people, as well as in those with many autistic traits.</p>
<p>If authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Auyeung and Baron-Cohen (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158">James (2014)</xref> are right, then, high prenatal T levels are an important cause behind autistic traits. And if their brain sare shaped by T – assumed to be the hormone of social dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B306">van Honk et al., 2014</xref>) – it is not surprising that those with many autistic traits behave in ways that can help them achieve positions of power (see <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Since behavior like that of the powerful and those with many autistic traits has also been shown to result from T, it is interesting to note that the effect of T administration is especially strong in people exposed to high prenatal levels of T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B308">van Honk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Carré et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>It seems a reasonable assumption, then, that if a person exposed to high levels of prenatal T achieves power as an adult, traits that helped him or her achieve that power (many of which may well be autistic traits) will be strengthened, perhaps considerably, by the increased level of circulating T that tends to result from feeling powerful. Several studies have now shown that making people feel dominant, powerful, or victorious will tend to increase T levels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Bernhardt et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Coincidental Commonalities?</title>
<p>The many characteristics common to autistics and the powerful may not be a coincidence, then. There are indications, as we saw, that autistic behavior is caused, in part, by T’s effect on the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B269">Schwarz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158">James, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence that feeling powerful can increase T levels (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B212">Mehta and Josephs, 2011</xref>), and that T can increase the tendency to act in ways that are typical of powerful people (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B308">van Honk et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In a literature review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B212">Mehta and Josephs (2011</xref>, p. 176) concluded that people “high in basal T are chronically motivated to gain status.” There are many similarities between those who presently have a high basal T level and autistics, whose prenatal brain organization has presumably been affected by T to a greater extent than that of most people (see <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B265">Sapienza et al. (2009)</xref> found that the effect of T measured in saliva (hence being present in the body here and now) was quite similar to the effect of T measured by way of markers of prenatal exposure.</p>
<p>So if people high in basal T are chronically motivated to gain status, it is not unthinkable that autistic people are also motivated to gain status, perhaps more so than others. To the extent that status is a means to achieving power or control, that assumption is supported by the finding that people with many autistic traits have a strong need to be in control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B197">Lyons and Fitzgerald, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Dominant or Alienated?</title>
<p>Here’s a good question: If T gives rise to dominant behavior, why are autistic people often, in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen (2008</xref>, p. 10), “struggling with… feelings of marginalization, alienated on a planet where they do not feel they belong?” Part of the answer begins with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen (2008</xref>, p. 79) pointing out in the same book, that “bossy, controlling behavior” is also typical of autistic people. This reflects what we have already seen: It is possible to often feel wretched and still behave in a domineering manner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are still primarily discussing people who do not qualify for a diagnosis. Presumably, those who have subclinical autistic traits do not struggle with problems that are quite as big as those of real autistics. Moreover, the extent to which effects of high T levels in adults parallel those arising from high prenatal T levels still is not clear. It is interesting, however, that T appears to give rise to dominant behavior only in people whose cortisol level is low. Combined with a high cortisol level, T does not seem to occasion dominance. Indeed, it may make people behave in less dominant ways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B211">Mehta and Josephs, 2010</xref>). Those who have many autistic traits are often plagued by feelings of stress and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B322">White et al., 2009</xref>), feelings known to be correlated with heightened levels of cortisol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B128">Hamer et al., 2012</xref>). This is one potential reason why people with many autistic traits may not be dominating at all.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>The Need to Take Risks</title>
<p>Several disorders are thought to exist because there has been, and perhaps still is, selection for genes that promote certain characteristics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B234">Nesse and Williams (1998)</xref> give the sickle cell gene as an example. One copy of the gene will protect against malaria, and is thus selected for where that disease is prevalent – even though those who inherit two copies will get sickle cell anemia, a painful and often deadly disease.</p>
<p>No single gene lies behind autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Chahrour et al., 2012</xref>). It still makes sense, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B254">Reser (2011)</xref>, to assume that autism has persisted because genes that help cause it have provided some advantage. The hypothesis advanced in the present paper is based on this assumption, which has been voiced by several authors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">Del Giudice et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B254">Reser, 2011</xref>). The nature of the hypothetical advantage conferred by autistic genes is unclear, however.</p>
<p>Researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Baron-Cohen (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Baumeister (2010)</xref> have pointed out the possible advantages of typically male characteristics in acquiring power. Indeed, in discussing the brain of typical human males, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Baron-Cohen (2003)</xref> notes, among other things, how low empathizing and good systemizing abilities could lead to power, which could in turn bring reproductive success – and in doing so, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Baron-Cohen (2003)</xref> gives several examples similar to those in the present paper. As regards autistic traits and fitness, however, Baron-Cohen and his co-workers assume that autistic traits may have been selected for “because of the potential benefits of a solitary single-minded obsessive focus on innovative understanding of a system,” which could help a person acquire resources by way of his or her “building and fixing skills,” or via trade in products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B182">Lai et al., 2014</xref>, p. 903).</p>
<p>It is possible, however, that hypermasculinity resembling autism can sometimes be an advantage in the struggle for power. Competition is stiff; opponents intelligent, driven, and often insensitive. The behavior pattern known as the BAP is, it appears, an adaptation that increases the probability of strong motivation, a willingness to run risks, and test smart, unconventional thinking – which for some individuals will result in power and more procreation.</p>
<p>In describing the phenomenon of sexual selection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">Darwin (1871)</xref> pointed out that there is competition within each sex for reproductive access to the most desirable members of the other sex. He also noted that in most species, males tend to be “more eager” to engage in copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">Darwin, 1871</xref>, p. 272). This, it seems, includes the human male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Baumeister et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Bateman (1948)</xref> called attention to the fact that females tend to choose among competing males, and that fewer males than females thus get a chance to procreate, leading to stronger competition among males. The range and variance in reproductive success has thus been considerably larger for men than for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Betzig, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Baumeister (2010)</xref> points out some relevant facts: humans alive today are descended from twice as many women as men. Estimates may vary, but throughout history, around 80% of women but only 40% of men have reproduced. Getting access to females in the face of intra-sex competition is not always easy for a man, in other words. But the problem can be solved by acquiring power.</p>
<p>There are several ways in which power can reduce or eliminate competition from other men. President Mobutu of Zaire, for example, was offered virgins from local chiefs on his travels around the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B311">Van Reybrouck, 2014</xref>). Men are also known to have used what power they have had to rape or buy women.</p>
<p>The harem is another alternative. Powerful men have kept groups of concubines in many different cultures, such as Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">Goodwin, 1997</xref>), Arabia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B238">Olin, 1843</xref>), India and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Betzig, 2012</xref>), as well as Africa, pre-Columbian America, and other places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Betzig, 1986</xref>). European kings have tended not to have harems, but they have had many illegitimate children, and also often powerful descendants through their misbegotten progeny – among them David Cameron, the recently departed British prime minister [descended from William IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">Heritage, 2014</xref>)], and, indeed, his wife [descended from Charles II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B210">McSmith, 2011</xref>)].</p>
<p>A third way in which power can reduce competition from other men is by making sure one’s power is well known – and, given the typical female preference for men with power and power-related qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Buss, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">Fieder and Huber, 2012</xref>), chances are that, other things equal, potential mates will rather bear the child of a powerful man than that of lesser rivals.</p>
<p>There is evidence that men take more risks than do women, a difference affected by testosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B265">Sapienza et al., 2009</xref>). In the right circumstances, most men are willing to risk life and limb – if their country is at war, for example. But “[f]ew men,” noted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B170">Kennedy (1966)</xref> “are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society.” Those who have many autistic traits more often appear to take this latter risk, however.</p>
<p>Our discussion so far leads to the conjecture that nature creates people willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows by reducing their sensitivity to socially mediated punishment – resulting in traits that make you “trust yourself when all men doubt you” in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B172">Kipling (1910</xref>, p. 181). In the poem, “If –,” from which the line is taken, Kipling describes an ideal man – a figure that evokes the thought of hypermasculinity, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Asperger (1944)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Baron-Cohen (2003)</xref> as the essence of autism. Indeed, to trust yourself when all men doubt you is what you do when your primary reference point is yourself, which is often the case in autistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Baron-Cohen, 2005</xref>), in whom context, social or otherwise, tends not to matter much (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B314">Vermeulen, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>An independent outlook, sometimes fiercely so, is needed for creative thinking, for “defying the crowd,” to use the title of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B286">Sternberg and Lubart’s (1995)</xref> fascinating treatise. From their research on mental effects of power, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">Galinsky et al. (2008</xref>, p. 1463) conclude: “For the powerful, the situation recedes, and they are left with their own opinions, beliefs, attitudes, and personalities to drive their behavior. This receding of the situation may be a springboard for new ways of thinking.”</p>
<p>New ways of thinking can make the powerful take great risk, then, risk that can result in loss of social position, and sometimes of life itself. Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian scientist, explorer, and diplomat, is one such example. Starting out in biology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B230">Nansen (1887)</xref>, took great intellectual risk, “presaged Ramon y Cajal’s famous formulation of the Neuron Doctrine” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">Edwards, 2006</xref>, p. 288), and “altered the course of neuroscience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Compston, 2010</xref>, p. 2173). Nansen then found fame through perilous polar expeditions, before taking on a political role, first “leading [his] people to self-respect and independence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B297">Thyvold, 2011</xref>, p. 3), then becoming an internationally leading diplomat and the first high commissioner for refugees, taking more risk in saving thousands of lives – not just from behind a desk, but also on the ground, typhus claiming some of his closest collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B282">Stang, 1922</xref>). In 1930, the front page of <italic>The New York Times</italic> said “NANSEN DIES AT 68…” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B232">Nansen dies at 68 of heart paralysis, 1930</xref>) “His outstanding figure shines in history,” said <italic>Nature</italic>’s obituary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B214">Mill, 1930</xref>, p. 933). Called “father of the nation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B277">Skouen, 1991</xref>, p. 4), “Norwegians voted Nansen the greatest figure of the 20th century. So could we all,” wrote Britain’s <italic>The Guardian</italic> newspaper (In praise of …, 2008).</p>
<p>Nansen said he never had friends (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B167">Karlsen, 2013</xref>), and was called “too self-centerd to be anyone’s friend … unsociable and clumsy” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149">Huntford, 2001</xref>, p. 335). Not a team player, “in everything he … did, he led,” said <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B177">Kobak (1999)</xref>. Nansen’s brother remembered him simply as “the boss” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149">Huntford, 2001</xref>, p. 11). A “driven and tormented man,” said <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149">Huntford (2001</xref>, p. 668) his biographer, who also called him a “tortured, isolated polymath” (p. 586) with a “flawed insight into natures other than his own” (p. 635). “[S]eriously obsessed by my work …,” was Nansen’s self-description (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B167">Karlsen, 2013</xref>, my translation).</p>
<p>Maybe somewhat inflexible, “my trouble in life,” Nansen wrote, “is that I have never been able to compromise” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149">Huntford, 2001</xref>, p. 455). Seeming socially insensitive, he also wrote: “not worrying about the impression I make on others, I often insult those I least want to insult” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B167">Karlsen, 2013</xref>, my translation). And politically, “to a man like Nansen, it meant nothing that the positions he took made him unpopular” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B174">Kleivan, 1961</xref>, p. 451, my translation). Nansen had, he explained himself, “the habit of making up my mind without asking the opinion of others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B231">Nansen, 1926</xref>).</p>
<p>We have seen similar traits in other powerful persons, not least the apparent lack of interest in what others might think or feel – and we find the same insensitivity in many creative scholars. Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and Bertrand Russell are just three examples. The tendency is evident in their fresh and original thinking, but also in an often unfeeling manner, as their biographies show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B218">Monk, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B155">Isaacson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B171">Keynes, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Nature could (and does) create many people that are flexible, take others’ judgments into account, and adapt to societal norms. Among other things, such norms tend to regulate how to act, and what we should hold to be morally and factually right. Follow norms, and chances are you’ll live a reasonably safe and unremarkable life. If you are a woman, there is also a good chance that you will find a mate. For men who have thus chosen to play it safe, however, the chance of procreating has historically been considerably lower than in women choosing the same strategy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Baumeister, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Take risks, break with norms, and you could find yourself in prison (or worse) – but with the right upbringing, luck, and intelligence, you could also be Charles de Gaulle, Bertrand Russell, or Nelson Mandela (though they, too, all spent time in prison)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn02">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Focus narrowly and perhaps obsessively on your goal, be inflexible and blind to others’ judgments, and you could win big or lose big. If losing means not procreating, chances are you would not have done so anyway. If you win, your descendants could be many. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B312">van Vugt (2014)</xref> points out that those who lead chiefdoms, kingdoms, and empires have greater reproductive success than does their average subject, and that male leaders in Western organizations have more sexual encounters than do men of lower rank.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, today a powerful businessman and the founder of PayPal, SpaceX, and Tesla Motors, was bullied so violently as a boy that at one point, he spent 2 weeks in hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144">Hogg, 2015</xref>). Musk tends to “come off as aloof and hard,” says his biographer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B313">Vance, 2015</xref>, p. 363), and his communication skills may not be so good (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B178">Koetsier, 2015</xref>). He is also described as being socially insensitive, with intense and restricted interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B313">Vance, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>If you are insensitive to social signals, you can easily become a bit peculiar, and peculiar people are often bullied, as are those who have many autistic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Baron-Cohen, 2008</xref>). But that same insensitivity can help you think creative thoughts, as we have seen. Creative thinking and intense interests can give you power, and Musk not only has power, but also six sons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B229">Musk, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>“Remember,” says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Baumeister (2007)</xref>, “most of the mediocre men left no descendants at all.” Indeed, in societies spanning from hunter-gatherers to the most modern, there is a positive association between reproduction in men and power-related characteristics like wealth and status. An important reason appears to be that men with low income are often childless (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B148">Huber et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, there is little doubt that powerful men have had many children. Sultan Moulay Ismael of Morocco, for example, may well have had around 1170 children with more than 500 women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B237">Oberzaucher and Grammer, 2014</xref>). In a large region of Asia, genetic analysis indicates that about 8% of all men today are descendants of Genghis Khan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B330">Zerjal et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with this, a recent study showed that “male descendants of high-status males account for a disproportionately large share of the male population in later generations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B280">Song et al., 2015</xref>, p. 574). It thus appears that people alive today are disproportionately the descendants of powerful men.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Women</title>
<p>Indications seem strong, then, that a tendency toward autistic-like behavior has been selected because it has increased the probability of achieving power, and hence reproductive success. Testosterone appears to have been an important tool evolution has used to generate the behavior known as autistic – and power related – traits.</p>
<p>But what about women? Though the sex ratio is skewed, there is no doubt that many women have many autistic traits. I have argued that a subgroup of men with many autistic traits have hit the evolutionary jackpot by becoming powerful and have thus had many descendants. Is there a subgroup among women with many autistic traits who have also gained power and have had more children as a consequence?</p>
<p>Though the issue is controversial, it is possible that women who gain power are more like men or become more like them (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B239">Oshagbemi and Gill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Andersen and Hansson, 2011</xref>), which would mean having more autistic traits than other women (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Baron-Cohen, 2003</xref>). Moreover, the literature on power priming indicates that the effect is very similar in the two sexes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Anderson and Berdahl, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B150">Inesi et al., 2012</xref>), as is the effect of T, in the sense that the hormone appears to masculinize individuals of both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B222">Morris et al., 2004</xref>). It is definitely possible, then – even probable – that autistic traits can increase women’s chance of gaining power, as it can men’s.</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B201">Major, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">British Broadcasting Corporation, 2011</xref>) and Angela Merkel (see above), are two very powerful women who appear to resemble many equally powerful men when it comes to autistic-like traits. At least, this does not speak against the hypothesis that powerful women and men can be similar in important respects. An important question remains, however: Is there any reason to assume that being powerful has increased women’s reproductive success? I cannot see that there is.</p>
<p>Across cultures, there is increasing evidence of considerable sex differences regarding mate choice in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Conroy-Beam et al., 2015</xref>). While women are typically attracted by men who have power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">Fieder and Huber, 2012</xref>) or qualities closely related to power, such as money, status, and ambition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Buss, 1989</xref>), these are not things that men will typically look for in a woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Buss, 1989</xref>). Many studies indicate that in modern women, there is a negative relationship between socioeconomic status and the number of children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B148">Huber et al., 2010</xref>), while in men the correlation is positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">Fieder and Huber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B235">Nettle and Pollet, 2008</xref>). I have not been able to locate literature indicating that this has been fundamentally different in earlier times or in non-Western cultures. It seems, then, that the presence of autistic traits in women cannot be explained by appealing to natural selection of characteristics that increase the probability of gaining and retaining power.</p>
<p>There is considerable support, however, for the assumption that having a partner with power and resources increases the probability of offspring survival, and that this is why that preference has been selected in the human female (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B324">Wiederman, 1993</xref>). Interestingly, there is evidence that female birds and rats engage in more intrasexual competition following experimental elevation of T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Albert et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B332">Zysling et al., 2006</xref>), and a correlation appears to exist between T level and intrasexual competitiveness in women, so that within an individual, the motivation to compete with other women for mating opportunities appears to increase with salivary T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">Hahn et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Elevated androgen levels in women with autism and/or their mothers also seem to play a causative role with regard to autism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Auyeung and Baron-Cohen, 2013</xref>). Findings such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">Hahn et al. (2016)</xref> make it an interesting question whether women high on autistic traits (presumably often reflecting high present and/or prenatal T levels) engage in more intrasexual competition than do typical women. If high T thus increases women’s reproductive success, this could help explain why many women have many autistic traits.</p>
<p>Whether or not women with subclinical autistic traits engage in more intrasexual competition, it should be stressed that the main hypothesis of the present paper is still that autistic traits can help women as well as men acquire and retain power. Furthermore, in women as well as men, T can increase the rate of autistic and power-related behavior, the two often being the same.</p>
</sec>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A reviewer pointed out that the paper’s main hypothesis can be put as a strong or a weaker version. It may be that most people with power have subclinical autistic traits that helped them get where they are – or it may be the case that such traits have helped only a subset of the powerful achieve their positions. Two obvious questions are in need of answers, then: (a) Which proportion of powerful people have many autistic traits? (b) Which proportion of powerful people have been helped on their way to the top by any autistic traits they might have? Based on the extant research, the answer to both questions appears to be: Quite a few. But this is an inexact assertion.</p>
<p>Both power and autistic behavior are the subjects of vigorous research, however, which should help us find more specific answers to these empirical questions. Furthermore, if subgroups of powerful people are identified that do and do not have many autistic traits, this leads to questions regarding differences among members of the two groups, the sort of power they wield, how they achieved it, characteristics of their organizations, etc. Meanwhile, several conclusions can be drawn, based on the findings discussed above.</p>
<p>It was postulated that (i) those who gain and sustain power often have many autistic traits, and that (ii) when autistic traits are found in powerful persons, it is often because those traits have been helpful in gaining and sustaining power. These testable claims appear to have considerable empirical support, and they lead to other propositions that are also testable. Among the most important are the following four:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<label>(1)</label>
<p>It was predicted that powerful people and those who have many autistic traits are alike in important ways. This claim was found to be supported by the literature. It should be mentioned, though, that much relevant evidence comes from priming experiments, and though biographies as well as more systematic studies of individuals with real power (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B194">Ludwig, 2002</xref>) point in the same direction, it would be good to have more stringent studies focusing specifically on the possible existence of autistic traits in people wielding power in the real world.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<label>(2)</label>
<p>An attempt was made to establish if a common mechanism exists that could cause the same behavior in powerful and autistic people. This constitutes a relatively strong test of the claim that these traits can reasonably be called autistic, also in the powerful. Interestingly, a common mechanism does appear to exist: In both groups, there is considerable evidence of a causal connection between testosterone and the traits in question.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<label>(3)</label>
<p>Relevant findings concur that having power has increased reproductive success in men, but probably not in women. It follows that evolution should thus select for traits contributing to the achievement of power in men. To the extent that such traits are autistic, they will be selected for, and will hence be found more often in men than in women.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<label>(4)</label>
<p>One reason why autistic traits are so prevalent, it would seem, is that humans today are disproportionately the descendants of powerful men.</p>
