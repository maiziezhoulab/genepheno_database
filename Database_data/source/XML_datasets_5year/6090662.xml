<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par1">Prenatal infection is a substantial risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism in offspring. We have previously reported that influenza vaccination (VAC) during early pregnancy contributes to neurogenesis and behavioral function in offspring.</p>

<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par2">Here, we probe the efficacy of VAC pretreatment on autism-like behaviors in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model. We show that VAC improves abnormal fetal brain cytoarchitecture and lamination, an effect associated with promotion of intermediate progenitor cell differentiation in MIA fetal brain. These beneficial effects are sufficient to prevent social deficits in adult MIA offspring. Furthermore, whole-genome analysis suggests a strong interaction between Ikzf1 (IKAROS family zinc-finger 1) and neuronal differentiation. Intriguingly, VAC rescues excessive microglial Ikzf1 expression and attenuates microglial inflammatory responses in the MIA fetal brain.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par20">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by severe and pervasive impairments in communication and social interaction and by stereotyped or repetitive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Studies have revealed that maternal immune activation (MIA) increases the risk for ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Currently, the most widely used animal model for MIA is gestational exposure to bacterial or viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The literature reveals that a single injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can result in deficits in social interaction, novel object recognition, anxiety-like behavior, and activation of microglia in the fetal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par21">Data have confirmed that pregnant women are vulnerable to influenza virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, influenza vaccination (VAC) is recommended in pregnant women for its efficacy and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our previous findings suggest that prenatal VAC contributes to neurogenesis both in pregnant mice and in their offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Notably, maternal VAC promotes exploratory behaviors in offspring and blocks subsequent LPS challenge from causing spatial cognitive impairments in Morris water maze performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These effects are also accompanied by a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines, reminiscent of the inflammatory response induced by LPS treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Mechanistically, VAC promoted M2 microglial/macrophage polarization via neuronal secretion of BDNF and microglia expressing IGF-1, thereby developing a pro-neurogenic niche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These results revealed that whether VAC could prevent LPS-induced autism-related behaviors and defects in neurodevelopment is worthy of exploration. Therefore, we assume that VAC pretreatment in early pregnancy has the potential to exert protective effects against autism-like behaviors and on the developing brain in an LPS-induced MIA model.</p>
<p id="Par22">Previous neuroimaging studies of autistic patients and animal models have revealed several anatomical alterations that may be related to their behavioral abnormalities. These changes include altered total brain volume and cortical plate (CP) thickness, a thinner corpus callosum, and malformations in cortex lamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We then explored whether VAC protected the thickness of neocortex and lamination in the fetal brain of an MIA-related model. Furthermore, it is well known that radial glial cells (RGCs) and intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) are primary cortical precursor cells that are located in the VZ/SVZ and differentiate into mature neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Notably, precursor cell proliferation and differentiation are most intense during a crucial period of time before birth. During that period, RGCs and IPCs form substantial numbers of neurons in an inside-out pattern that gives rise to neocortical lamination, suggesting a tight connection between neuronal differentiation and lamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par23">In this study, we explored the influence of VAC on autism-like behaviors and on the laminar organization of cortical neurons in an LPS-induced MIA mouse model. As hypothesized, we found that VAC improved social deficiency in adult MIA offspring. Further, VAC prevented the LPS-induced aberrations in brain morphology and laminar cytoarchitecture, probably by counteracting abnormal neuronal differentiation. Finally, RNA-Seq was carried out to explain the biological mechanism at the genome level, and Ikzf1 (IKAROS family zinc-finger 1) was proved to be tightly correlated with autism-like behavior through its regulation of neuronal differentiation. Meantime, VAC also attenuated the central inflammatory response to LPS challenge. Collectively, these data suggest that VAC is a potential precaution against maternal bacterial infection.</p>

<sec id="Sec3">
<title>Animals</title>
<p id="Par24">C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Mice harboring green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the Cx3cr1 promoter (B6.129P-Cx3cr1tm1Litt/J) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (stock no. 005582). To generate timed pregnancies, we housed pairs of females with single males overnight. The mice were separated at noon the next day. The time when a vaginal plug was observed was defined as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5), and the delivery day was designated postnatal day 0 (P0). Pups were weaned at postnatal day 21 and caged separately in groups of four to five littermates by sex. To rule out maternal variables, all experiments used one pup per dam. The basic experimental operation flow is shown in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>. All animals were housed under standard illumination parameters (12-h light/dark cycle) and received water and food ad libitum. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Experimental flowchart. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were treated with influenza vaccineÂ (VAC) orÂ sterilized PBS at E2.5 and withÂ sterilized LPS or PBS at E14.5. Two hours after the LPS or PBS injection at E14.5, maternal serum corticosterone and IL-17a levels were detected. The fetal brains were removed for morphology, protein, and gene detection at E18.5. The offspring were submitted to behavior tests at 4Â weeks (P28) and 8Â weeks (P56) after birth, and the brains wereÂ removed for immunofluorescence staining at 6Â weeks (P42)</p></caption><graphic id="MO1" xlink:href="12974_2018_1252_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>

<title>Influenza vaccination</title>
<p id="Par25">Mice were randomly treated with split inactivated influenza vaccine (VAC) or sterilized PBS (PBS) by intramuscular (i.m.) injection in their quadriceps at a single dose of 3Â Î¼g/mouse during the first trimester (E2.5). The inactivated influenza vaccines (split virion) contain the following: an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (B/Victoria lineage). Excipients in vaccines include NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and NaCl. Vaccines produced by Changchun Institute of Biological products were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Guangdong, China) and had previously been shown to be immunogenic and safe.</p>

<title>Maternal immune activation</title>
<p id="Par26">The potassium salt of LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O111:B4; L2630; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to induce MIA, but the recommended dose was not determined a priori, as previous reports have used doses from 120 to 300Â Î¼g/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We injected pregnant mice with a range of LPS concentrations at E14.5 and found that 150, 125, and 100Â Î¼g/kg induced abortion or resorption of the fetuses, but viable offspring were obtained with 75Â Î¼g/kg LPS (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>; <italic>F</italic><sub>3,12</sub>â=â2.979, <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05). Maternal serum corticosterone was evaluated at 2Â h after injection of 75Â Î¼g/kg LPS, and the level of corticosterone was increased after LPS exposure, suggesting that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis was activated by a dose of 75Â Î¼g/kg LPS (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Effects of maternal VAC and MIA on maternal inflammatory response, litter characteristics, and body weight. <bold>a</bold> Pregnant mice were treated with LPS at doses of 150, 125, 100, and 75Â Î¼g/kg LPS, and viable embryos were obtained at the dose of 75Â Î¼g/kg (<italic>F</italic><sub>3,12</sub>â=â2.979, <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05). <italic>n</italic>â=â4 mice/group (one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc test). <bold>b</bold> A two-way ANOVA for corticosterone level revealed a significant effect of MIA (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,19</sub>â=â76.971, <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.001) and VAC (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,19</sub>â=â14.568, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.001) and interaction of MIA Ã VAC (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,19</sub>â=â14.369, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.001).

A post hoc test showed that LPS increased the level of IL-17a in the maternal serum at E14.5 compared to controls (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.001), and VAC pretreatment prevented this effect (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.024), but there were no significant effects on IL-17a expression in the fetal cortex at E18.5 (<italic>p</italic>â&gt;â0.05) (<bold>d</bold>); <italic>n</italic>â=â5â7 mice/group. <bold>e</bold> A two-way ANOVA for the number of embryos revealed a significant effect of MIA (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,20</sub>â=â13.344, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.002) and a significant interaction of MIA Ã VAC (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,20</sub>â=â4.804, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.04). A post hoc test showed that MIA significantly reduced the average number of embryos (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.01) and VAC pretreatment rescued the fetal loss (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.028). <italic>n</italic>â=â6 mice /group. <bold>f</bold> Offspring were weighed at the indicated times. <italic>n</italic>â=â6 mice/group (repeated-measures ANOVA). *<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05, ***<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.001; the results are all shown as the meanâ+âs.e.m.</p></caption><graphic id="MO2" xlink:href="12974_2018_1252_Fig2_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par27">Thus, 75Â Î¼g/kg LPS or saline was administered to pregnant dams by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at E14.5. This time point is in the second half of mouse gestation, which roughly corresponds to the late first or early second trimester in human gestation, when infections confer the greatest risk of ASD in human offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. At this stage, the pregnant dams were divided into four treatment groups: PBS+PBS, VAC+PBS, PBS+LPS, and VAC+LPS. The number of pups for each pregnant mouse was recorded on P0, and the weight changes from 0 to 8Â w of age in each group were also recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">
<title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</title>
<p id="Par28">Two hours after LPS injection, serum was separated from trunk blood by centrifugation at 2500Â rpm for 15Â min and was subsequently stored at ââ80Â Â°C until use. Serum corticosterone levels were measured using a corticosterone ELISA kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. The concentration of serum IL-17a was measured using a Mouse SimpleStep ELISA kit (Abcam).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec7">
<title>Behavioral tests</title>
<p id="Par29">One limitation of the current MIA models is that they focus on ASD-related phenotypes once the offspring reach early adulthood, whereas overt ASD symptoms typically emerge during childhood. Thus, we chose two time points, 4 and 8Â w, for testing ASD behavior. Behavioral testing of the offspring was performed during the light period (between 10:00 and 16:00Â h). Before the assay began, the mice were moved to a holding room in the behavioral testing area, where they were kept for at least 1Â h. The apparatuses were cleaned with 70% ethanol and allowed to dry completely before each test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec8">
<title>Open field test (OFT)</title>
<p id="Par30">The animals were individually placed in the center of the open field arena (50âÃâ50âÃâ50Â cm) with the illumination located on the top surface of the equipment.

Animals were placed in the center of a clear acrylic arena (59âÃâ39âÃâ22Â cm) that was divided into three equal compartments. Testing consisted of three phases: 5Â min of acclimation to the empty arena, 10Â min of sociability testing, and 10Â min of social novelty testing. Each side compartment contained a clear plexiglass cylinder (7.5Â cm in diameter, with several holes to allow nose contact). At the beginning of the test, each animal was placed in the central compartment and allowed to explore for 5Â min (habituation). Then, an unfamiliar young (4Â weeks) C57BL/6 mouse was placed in one of the cylinders for sociability testing. Finally, another C57BL/6 mouse of the same age was placed in the other cylinder for social novelty testing.

<p id="Par35">For Western blotting, mice were sacrificed under deep anesthesia at E18.5. The cortex was immediately removed from the brain of each embryo and processed into tissue homogenate in ice-cold RIPA buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, Wuhan, China) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) using a homogenizer. After centrifugation (4Â Â°C, 12000Â rpm, 15Â min), the supernatant was subdivided and stored at ââ80Â Â°C for further measurements. A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Beyotime Biotechnology, Wuhan, China) was used to measure the protein concentrations of the samples. The supernatant was mixed with loading buffer and boiled for 5Â min. Equivalent amounts of protein extracts were separated on 15% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA for 1Â h and then incubated overnight at 4Â Â°C with the primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used at the indicated concentrations: anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Pax-6 (1:1000, Abcam), and anti-Î²-actin (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology). HRP-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used at 1:10000.

<title>VAC counteracted the LPS-induced maternal immune activation and decrease in embryo number</title>
<p id="Par46">Maternal serum levels of corticosterone and of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17a were evaluated at 2Â h after 75Â Î¼g/kg LPS injection at E14.5. The data revealed increases in the corticosterone and IL-17a levels of LPS-exposed dams compared to those of the controls at E14.5, and VAC pretreatment alleviated these effects (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>), suggesting that vaccination at E2.5 could reduce the inflammatory response to LPS at E14.5 in the dams. However, IL-17a expression in the fetal cortex at E18.5 did not differ significantly among the groups (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). MIA is associated with spontaneous pregnancy loss and decreased fetal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our data revealed a significant reduction in the number of embryos after exposure to LPS, whereas VAC attenuated this effect (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). The body weights of the offspring were also measured weekly during postnatal weeks 0â8 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). Interestingly, LPS caused a dual effect on body weight, i.e., higher weights than the controls at 2 and 3Â weeks but lower weights than the controls at 8Â weeks. Notably, VAC reversed the LPS-induced effects at 8Â weeks (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). These results suggested that VAC prevented abortion of the fetuses and improved the physical condition of offspring subjected to MIA, which may be related to the reduced maternal inflammatory response.</p>

<title>VAC rescued LPS-induced decreases in the numbers of IPCs in the developing neocortex and of astrocytes in the adult neocortex</title>
<p id="Par53">The transcription factors Pax6, Tbr2, and Tbr1 are expressed sequentially by RGCs, IPCs, and postmitotic neurons in the developing neocortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In the present study, to determine whether abnormal neuronal differentiation contributes to dysfunctional lamination in the embryonic cortex, the protein extracts were separated from the fetal cortex at E18.5, and Pax-6 protein was detected. In addition, Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells were counted in the fetal neocortex at E18.5. The data revealed that the Pax-6 level and Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cell number were significantly lower in the MIA offspring than in the controls (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7aâd</xref>); VAC pretreatment rescued only the number of Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c, d</xref>) and not the Pax-6 level in MIA offspring (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a, b</xref>). In addition, cell apoptosis and proliferation were measured by quantifying cleaved caspase-3 protein (CC3) and PCNA, respectively (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Figure S1G). The results showed that there were very few CC3<sup>+</sup> cells present in the developing neocortex (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Figure S1AâE). MIA increased the concentrations of CC3 and PCNA in fetal cortex at E18.5, which was consistent with previous reports in LPS-induced MIA models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, we found that VAC exerted no obvious effects on the increases in apoptotic cells and proliferative cells in MIA fetal neocortex (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Figure S1H and I), implying that apoptosis and proliferation may not contribute to the effects of VAC in this study. These results suggested that MIA induced aberrant lamination of the neocortex, at least partly attributable to differential reduction in IPCs and RGCs. Interestingly, VAC mitigated the aberrant lamination of the embryonic neocortex in MIA offspring by restoring IPC differentiation.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Maternal VAC and MIA effects on neural precursor cells in the embryonic cortex at E18.5 and astrocytes in the adult cortex at 6Â weeks. <bold>a</bold> Representative Western blot bands of Pax-6 and Î²-actin. <bold>b</bold> The ratio of Pax-6 to Î²-actin was quantified.

<title>Changes in expression of relevant genes in the fetal cortex after VAC and LPS treatment</title>
<p id="Par55">To gain mechanistic insight into the regulatory effect of VAC pretreatment on cortical lamination, we conducted an RNA-Seq assay to determine relevant gene expression in the cerebral cortex. The numbers of genes showing differential expression (q-value| FDRââ¤â0.05) between groups are presented in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a, b</xref>. A Venn diagram was constructed to present the overlap of these differential genes among groups, and 13 genes were related to the effects of VAC treatment on the MIA fetal brain (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8c</xref>). Importantly, based on Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment results, we identified neuronal differentiation as one of the biological processes showing the greatest differences between VAC+LPS and PBS+LPS mice, which confirmed the effect of VAC on MIA offspring at the gene level and was in accordance with our histomorphology results (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8e</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Whole-transcriptome analysis of maternal VAC and MIA effects on E18.5 cortical gene expression. <bold>a</bold> The volcano diagram includes 53 upregulated genes (red) and 17 downregulated genes (green) in VAC+LPS compared to PBS+LPS. <bold>b</bold> Volcano diagram includes 29 upregulated genes (red) and 29 downregulated genes (green) in PBS+LPS compared to PBS+PBS. <bold>c</bold> Venn diagram represents the overlap of differentially expressed genes among groups; 13 common differentially expressed genes were analyzed (<italic>n</italic>â=â3 mice/group). <bold>d</bold> Real-time PCR analysis validated common differential gene expression among the four groups (<italic>n</italic>â=â3 mice/group).

<p id="Par56">Next, qRT-PCR was performed to analyze these candidate genes, and four differentially expressed genes were confirmed to be related to the ability of VAC to protect against social deficits and abnormal cortex development in MIA mice (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>). Of the four genes, Ikzf1 (IKAROS family zinc-finger 1) was notable because it not only participated in the process of neuronal differentiation but also played a central role in the interaction network of proteins (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8f, g</xref>). Expression of Ikaros (Ikzf1), which promotes the differentiation of early-born cortical neurons, is high in mouse cortical progenitor cells at early stages and then decreases over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Notably, overexpression of Ikaros results in abnormal lamination during the late embryonic stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Ikaros copy number variants have reportedly been identified in ASD probands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Consistently, our data showed that LPS mice had higher Ikzf1 expression than controls at a late stage (E18.5) and that VAC preconditioning rescued its expression (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>; <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05), supporting a vital role for Ikzf1 in the effect of VAC pretreatment on abnormal lamination and autism-like behaviors. Intriguingly, Ikaros was located in the neocortex and VZ/SVZ (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8hâj</xref>) and colocalized with various morphological forms of CX3Cr1-GFP<sup>+</sup> microglia (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8kâo</xref>), suggesting that microglia in the cerebral cortex could express Ikaros. Although Ikaros is well described in the lymphoid system and neuronal precursors, our findings extend the known biological functions of Ikaros to regulating cortical lamination from neuronal precursors to microglia.</p>

<title>Pretreatment with VAC ameliorated the microglial inflammatory response to LPS challenge</title>
<p id="Par57">Microglial priming has been proposed to be a major consequence of MIA and represents a critical link in a causal chain that leads to a wide spectrum of neuronal dysfunctions and behavioral phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. To determine whether VAC pretreatment could influence microglia in the developing brain after LPS challenge, we observed the Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells (microglia) and Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD68<sup>+</sup> cells (activated microglia) located in the dorsal and lateral cortex of the fetal brain at E18.5 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a</xref>). Quantitative analysis with a stereology system showed more microglia (Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells) and activated microglia (Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD68<sup>+</sup> cells) in MIA offspring than in controls, and preconditioning with VAC restored the numbers to normal levels (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9b</xref>). Numerous microglia were also observed to be located in the VZ/SVZ, which was divided into several subsetsâcortical area (CA), striatal area (SA), and else areas (EA)âfor quantification (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9c</xref>). Our data showed that VAC had a similar effect on microglia in the VZ/SVZ of MIA mice, especially in the CA (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9d</xref>), suggesting that VAC could rescue the LPS-induced inflammatory response in the brain. Additionally, the ratio of activated microglia (ratio of CD68/Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells to Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells) averaged 90% and did not differ among groups (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9e</xref>). Furthermore, the activation of microglia paralleled the change in Ikaros expression in the present study.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Effects of maternal VAC and MIA on central inflammatory response at E18.5.

<p id="Par58">Given that microglia are reported to phagocytose neural precursor cells in the developing neocortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], we next detected microglia phagocytosing IPCs by colocalization of Tbr2 and CD68 in the fetal neocortex at E18.5 (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S3EâJ). Quantitative analysis revealed that LPS promoted microglial phagocytosis of IPCs, and this effect was mitigated by pretreatment with VAC (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S3AâD and K), suggesting that VAC rescued the number of IPCs not only by restoring IPC differentiation but also by attenuating microglial phagocytosis. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanism of this phagocytosis has not yet been clarified, and our results provide evidence for the daring conjecture that Ikaros expression may be correlated with the microglial phagocytosis of neural precursor cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par59">Herein, we show that VAC attenuated the deleterious effects induced by MIA, including its effects on fetal loss, social behaviors, thickness of the CP, and abnormal neocortical lamination. Importantly, these effects are closely associated with the fact that VAC promotes differentiation of neural progenitor cells, a phenomenon that may involve microglia-derived Ikaros. VAC rescued the abnormal Ikaros expression, microglial proliferation, and activation in MIA offspring. This work highlights the key preventive impact of VAC on LPS-caused autism-related impairments during brain development.</p>
<p id="Par60">Social interaction behavior is associated with some specific brain areas, especially the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, our study showed that social deficits were related to decreased thickness of the fetal CP in LPS-induced MIA offspring, which was consistent with previous reports of reduced cortical volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] or thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] in similar ASD models. However, there were conflicting results from other ASD models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and this discrepancy may be due to differences in infection models and target animal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Further, we found aberrant lamination of the embryonic neocortex and reduced neuron counts, especially in the upper layers, which contributed to the reduction in CP thickness. The development of the six-layer neocortex in rodents is known to start at E11.5 in an inside-out pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Thus, the upper layers were more susceptible than deeper layers when maternal immunity was mobilized by LPS at E14.5. Overall, VAC attenuated the deleterious effects of MIA on thickness and lamination, which mainly manifested in the restored neuronal numbers in the upper layers. These effects on cortical layers might be associated with apoptosis or proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; however, we confirmed that there was a negligible effect on apoptotic factors, reflected by a slight increase in CC3<sup>+</sup> cells in MIA offspring, and VAC had no protective effect on apoptosis. Moreover, similar results for proliferation were obtained in the embryonic neocortex. Consequently, apoptosis and proliferation were excluded as causes of the recovery in neuron number for VAC.</p>
<p id="Par61">Another possible explanation for the alteration of neuron number may be abnormal neuronal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The numbers of RGCs and IPCs were decreased in the embryonic neocortex of MIA models, but VAC pretreatment rescued the loss of IPCs. These data thus confirmed our conjecture that VAC prevents the effects of LPS on the developing cortex, a phenomenon that was linked to the decreased autism-like behavior. However, our data are not consistent with the results observed in an autism-specific maternal autoantibody infection model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], which may be because of autoantibody-induced increases in stem cell proliferation, whereas MIA might affect RGC differentiation and have little effect on proliferation. Moreover, our in-depth experiments revealed that the restorative effects of VAC on the number of IPCs in the MIA fetal cortex were due to the increase in IPC differentiation and the decrease in microglial phagocytosis of IPCs. Later, in adult MIA offspring (6Â weeks), neither VAC nor LPS influenced the numbers of neurons, but VAC increased the BDNF expression in the MIA cortex through other types of cells, such as astrocytes, to provide more trophic support to neurons. Therefore, neuronal functions in adulthood, such as neuronal plasticity, remain to be explored in future research. In addition, the decreased number of astrocytes in the adult brain differed from the reports that two injections of LPS (500Â Î¼g/kg) led to an increased number of astrocytes in 8-day-old rat pups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This inconsistency may be because the present study used a milder stimulus (LPS, 75Â Î¼g/kg) than the previous study, meaning that the dose of LPS used in this study might induce treated animals to produce fewer RGCs than controls.</p>
<p id="Par62">The development of a six-layer neocortex is coordinated by specialized genes programming neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, which was confirmed by the pathways identified in our study as most enriched according to GO analysis. Ikzf1 was the most important gene showing differential expression among the four groups. Reports have shown that Ikzf1 (Ikaros) is expressed in cortical progenitor cells and helps determine the fates of early-born neurons in the cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, Ikzf1 is a promising candidate gene to mediate the effect of VAC treatment on MIA models. In addition, Ikzf1/Ikaros seems to have a complex role in neuronal differentiation. Ikaros was previously reported to be a tumor suppressor and pro-differentiation factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. By contrast, a recent study revealed that Ikaros overexpression decreased the number of upper-layer neurons in the cortex at E17.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Consistent with this result, we found that MIA induced an increase in the expression of Ikzf1 at E18.5, accompanied by a decrease in neurons in the upper layers, and VAC pretreatment alleviated these effects. Unexpectedly, the total number of neurons showed no difference across the four groups in adulthood. One explanation may be that LPS-induced sustained Ikzf1 expression results in a delayed appearance of upper-layer neurons and that the disorganized laminar structure returns to normal after birth. Alteration in the migration of newborn cells has previously been linked to autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Another explanation may be that overexpressed Ikzf1 extends the window of deeper-layer neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], so that the overall number of neurons in the cortex in MIA mice became normal during adulthood. In addition, Ikaros/Ikzf1 gene-deficient mice displayed behavioral alterations in an antidepressive phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], implying that Ikaros is relevant to depression-related behavior, which is consistent with our results from the FST and TST. Taken together, our data provide evidence for the crucial role of Ikzf1 in determining cortical lamination and the development of autism-like behaviors in the late stage of prenatal development. Importantly, VAC pretreatment prevented MIA-induced social deficits and aberrant lamination by promoting neuronal differentiation, which depended on restoring normal Ikaros expression. Moreover, we found that Ikzf1/Ikaros was expressed in microglia, and microglial proliferation and activation paralleled the expression of Ikaros. Although an immune-mediator signaling cascade was reported to upregulate the Ikzf1 gene specifically by activating the upstream protein STAT3 in BV-2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], the specific mechanism whereby Ikaros regulates the differentiation of cortical progenitor cells still needs further investigation.</p>
<p id="Par63">VAC prevents the effects of LPS challenge on neuronal progenitor cells, microglial activation, and the numbers of astrocytes. Therefore, we hypothesize that VAC exerted protective effects through the following mechanisms. VAC-induced M2 microglial/macrophage polarization developed a pro-neurogenic niche via astrocytic secretion of BDNF (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>e and AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S2G) and microglial expression of IGF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, a recent report revealed that Ikaros is expressed in progenitor cells and regulates early-born neuronal fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Ikaros overexpression in neuronal progenitor cells induced developmental defects, including disrupted cortical lamination. In line with our results, LPS-treated fetal brain showed sustained Ikaros expression, which could be inhibited by VAC. However, our findings show that microglia, not neurons, could express Ikaros in the cerebral cortex, reflected by colocalization with CX3Cr1-GFP<sup>+</sup> microglia (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>k). Because the Ikaros family of transcription factors has critical functions in immune regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], VAC may regulate microglial inflammation via Ikzf1. Thus, we conclude that VAC indirectly influences cortical lamination after maternal immune activation, through a mechanism involving Ikaros.</p>
<p id="Par64">It has been reported that the cytokine IL-17a, which is relevant to microglial activation and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], promotes abnormal cortical development and ASD-like behavioral phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, we failed to detect any alteration in IL-17a in the cortex of E18.5 mice after VAC or MIA. One possible reason is that cytokines may have been transiently altered after maternal LPS exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and that IL-17a expression was restored to normal levels by E18.5. Another possible reason is that, unlike in the polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-induced autism model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], IL-17a may be not sufficient to cause aberrant lamination and social deficits in this LPS-induced MIA model. Therefore, more information about cytokines will be necessary in the future.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par65">Overall, for the first time, we show that VAC pretreatment in early gestation is sufficient to prevent impairments in social interaction and lamination in an MIA-induced autism model and that this process is associated with neuronal differentiation and Ikzf1 gene. Our findings strongly suggest that influenza vaccination in early pregnancy is a potential preventive measure against autism induced by maternal bacterial infection.</p>
