<p id="Par1">Functional variomics provides the foundation for personalized medicine by linking genetic variation to disease expression, outcome and treatment, yet its utility is dependent on appropriate assays to evaluate mutation impact on protein function. To fully assess the effects of 106 missense and nonsense variants of PTEN associated with autism spectrum disorder, somatic cancer and PTEN hamartoma syndrome (PHTS), we take a deep phenotypic profiling approach using 18 assays in 5 model systems spanning diverse cellular environments ranging from molecular function to neuronal morphogenesis and behavior. Variants inducing instability occur across the protein, resulting in partial-to-complete loss-of-function (LoF), which is well correlated across models. However, assays are selectively sensitive to variants located in substrate binding and catalytic domains, which exhibit complete LoF or dominant negativity independent of effects on stability. Our results indicate that full characterization of variant impact requires assays sensitive to instability and a range of protein functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the most common genetic neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by impaired social communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Headway in understanding ASD pathophysiology has been stymied by tremendous phenotypic heterogeneity and complex genetics across individuals. Conclusively linking genes to ASD is challenging since sequencing efforts have identified mutations in hundreds of genes from individuals with the disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Confidence of gene association to ASD is enhanced by identification of de novo, likely gene disrupting (LGD) mutations; however, the most common de novo mutations identified in individuals with ASD are missense (MS) variants of unknown significance (VUS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A complete understanding of ASD genetics and their link to pathophysiology requires deciphering how these mutations impact protein function, and how protein dysfunction affects neural circuits and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">The lipid and protein phosphatase, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), has well-established links to ASD, somatic cancers, and the cancer-predisposing PTEN hamartoma syndrome (PHTS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, while LGD mutations in <italic>PTEN</italic> have been found in individuals with ASD, the majority of variants identified are MS VUS, and their impact on protein function and causal links to the molecular mechanism(s) of disease expression remain unclear. Understanding the specific impact of these point mutations on PTEN function and their repercussions in cellular and tissue development is necessary for relating its disruption to disease.</p>
<p id="Par5">As PTEN is a multifunctional protein expressed throughout the body, and both cancer and ASD are complex conditions involving diverse tissues, it is likely that VUS may disrupt distinct PTEN functions in different cell types and developmental conditions to contribute to disease. Saturation mutagenesis and massively parallel functional approaches to characterize single-nucleotide variants of PTEN have identified a large range of impacts on PTEN’s lipid phosphatase activity using single-cell assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In order to more comprehensively assess a full range of PTEN functions, here we take a deep phenotypic profiling approach by assessing the impact of MS and nonsense (NS) variants in 18 bioassays in 5 model systems. Applying high-throughput unbiased analyses of genetic interactions of human PTEN in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> we develop an assay of PTEN variant function sensitive to lipid phosphatase activity. By expressing human <italic>PTEN</italic> variants in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> we assess the rate of development in an invertebrate model, regulated by the insulin receptor pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We test a smaller subset of <italic>PTEN</italic> variants for effects on neuronal dendritic and axonal growth, and excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis using rat primary neuronal cultures, processes found to be disrupted in ASD models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and mediated by both lipid and protein phosphatase PTEN activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. As ASD is primarily defined as disordered behavior and sensorimotor processing, we test impact of variants on chemotaxis in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. In order to probe the molecular mechanisms causing variant dysfunction in these assays, we perform flow cytometry analysis of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells overexpressing <italic>PTEN</italic> variants to parse effects on protein stability and catalytic activity. These multi-model results provide robust validation of measures of variant function in highly diverse cellular environments to uncover complexities of the contribution of single-nucleotide mutations to protein dysfunction and pathophysiology.</p>

<title>Categorization of PTEN variants</title>
<p id="Par6">We selected PTEN MS and nonsense (NS) mutations identified in individuals with ASD, intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay (DD), somatic cancer and PHTS, as well as variants found among the general population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). We categorized a total of 48 variants as ASD (15 de novo) found in cases of ASD, ID, or DD. A set of 4 MS variants were classified as Somatic Cancer which have not been reported in ASD, but exhibit a high frequency of reports in the COSMIC database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A further 19 variants termed PHTS were found in individuals with PHTS, but not ASD and low frequency in somatic cancer. There is high overlap in variant incidence across these disorders (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). We included 5 PTEN variants with well-characterized disruptions on protein function, termed Biochemical Variants. These include C124S, which is both protein- and lipid-phosphatase catalytically inactive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; G129E, a lipid phosphatase-dead variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>; Y138L, a protein phosphatase-dead variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>; 4A, in which the four phosphorylation sites Ser<sup>380</sup>, Thr<sup>382</sup>, Thr<sup>383</sup>, and Ser<sup>385</sup> were replaced with alanines, creating a phospho-null construct lacking self-repression, rendering it constitutively active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>; and C124S-4A which contains both catalytic inactive and phospho-null mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. C124S has also been found in somatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and G129E has been found in macrocephaly, DD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, PHTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and somatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In order to understand the range of PTEN protein function existing in the general population, 8 variants were selected based on their relatively high frequency in the gnomAD database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, termed Population Variants. Additionally, variants were included with either Predicted High Impact (17) or Predicted Low Impact (5) as determined by CADD phred version 1.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> or SNAP2 scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We also included 2 NS mutations, R130X and R335X, due to their common association with ASD, PHTS and somatic cancer. Many variants exist in multiple categories, and the full variants classification, reference, and CADD phred and SNAP2 scores can be found in Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. We use the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) reference sequence of PTEN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_000314.7">NM_000314.7</ext-link>) as wild type (WT). PTEN variants were placed in model-specific plasmid expression constructs, and variants for yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> were expressed as non-tagged proteins, while variants for rat neurons and HEK293 were fused with a 3XHA epitope, and Superfolder Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP) at the N-terminus, respectively.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Functional assessment of <italic>PTEN</italic> variants for genetic interactions in yeast.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of 106 MS and NS variants indicating their positions across the functional domains of PTEN with each variant represented by a circle colored following the coding table at right. <bold>b</bold> Venn diagram showing the overlap of PTEN variants used in this study identified in individuals with different disorders.

<title>Yeast gene interaction assay for lipid phosphatase function</title>
<p id="Par7">We took advantage of the high-throughput capacity of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> synthetic dosage lethality screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> as an unbiased assay to identify genetic interactions of PTEN. By overexpressing human WT PTEN (WT), empty vector (EV), or the catalytically inactive variant C124S, in ~5000 non-essential gene mutant strains of the yeast deletion collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, we identified 44 potential genetic interactions. Eight of which, deemed sentinels, show significant, strong negative genetic interactions with WT, but not EV or C124S, and were selected for inclusion in our assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Overexpression of WT in all 8 sentinel strains reduced colony growth. The sentinel proteins Vac7 and Vac14 interact and promote the synthesis of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> by activating Fab1, a kinase for PI3P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). Fig4, when recruited to the vacuolar membrane by Vac14, dephosphorylates PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> to form PI3P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, lack of any of these genes alters PI3P metabolism. Likewise, the other sentinels directly or indirectly influence PI3P signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Vam3 and Vam7 are SNARE proteins and Ypt7 is a Rab GTPase. All three are components of the vacuolar fusion complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, in which Vam7 directly binds PI3P on the vacuolar membrane to initiate fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. While yeast does not contain the primary PTEN substrate, PIP<sub>3</sub>, nor an endogenous PTEN homolog, PTEN also binds PI3P, which is present in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that PTEN utilizes PI3P as a substrate in yeast and antagonizes compromised PI3P levels in these mutants.</p>

To assay variant function in these ASD-associated growth processes, we overexpressed WT, 19 PTEN variants, or Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) alone, in rat primary hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal cultures. We find that overexpression of WT induced the opposite effects observed by reducing PTEN, including decreased density of PSD95 puncta, a marker of excitatory glutamatergic synapses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a, c</xref>), but had no impact on density of the inhibitory GABAergic synapse marker Gephyrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>).

We measured PTEN protein abundance for WT and 97 variants tested in yeast using western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>) and found a significant reduction in PTEN levels for 31 variants compared to WT, with 21 variants having stability below 50% of WT. Notably, of 46 ASD variants measured, nearly half (22/46) had significantly reduced levels of PTEN. To examine whether the changes in protein abundance assessed in yeast is reflected in a human cellular environment, we overexpressed WT and 105 variants as sfGFP-fusion proteins in HEK293 cells, with the red fluorophore mTagRFP-T co-expressed from the same plasmid. The green-to-red ratio for each cell was quantified using flow cytometry, with a decrease from WT level indicating reduced protein stability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b–d</xref>). In all, 77/105 variants were significantly less stable than WT, of which 50 exhibited stability of 50% or less than WT. 19/105 showed WT-like stability, and 9/105 were significantly more stable. Of the 47 ASD variants tested, most (40/47) were significantly less stable than WT, and 29 exhibited less than 50% WT stability. Only 5, P354Q, R130L, R15S, R14G, and T78A, were not significantly different from WT. The variants H93Y and K6E were hyper-stable.

<p id="Par13">PTEN functions as a negative regulator of the PI3-AKT signaling pathway by decreasing the pool of available PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> via its lipid phosphatase activity, causing a reduction in the level of activated, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. To assess the lipid phosphatase function of WT PTEN and 105 variants, we measured pAKT/AKT in insulin-treated HEK293 cells using flow cytometry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a-c</xref>). As expected, overexpression of WT decreases pAKT levels in an exogenous PTEN expression level-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). In all, 25/105 variants showed complete LoF and 19/105 showed partial LoF. 29/105 variants retained WT-like function, and P354Q, Q396R and the constitutively active 4A, exhibited GoF. Further, 65/105 variants had &lt;50% functionality, including 42/47 ASD. Expression of C124S or G129E raised pAKT/AKT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>), consistent with a dominant negative phenotype, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Remarkably, we identify 27 additional variants (25 uncharacterized) exhibiting dominant negative activity, including 17 ASD. To further investigate these phenotypes, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a bi-allelic knockout (KO) of PTEN (PTEN-KO) in HEK293 cells and repeated the pAKT/AKT assay for 32 variants. For 21 of 28 variants exhibiting dominant negative activity in parental cells, the absence of endogenous PTEN abrogated this effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). Interestingly, the GoF of constitutively active 4A was markedly reduced in PTEN-KO, yet still significantly more active than WT, suggesting it may enhance endogenous PTEN activity when present.

<p id="Par15">In order to identify features of variant impact contributing to varied phenotypes in different assays we investigated the relationship between protein function and stability. To determine whether function directly tracks stability we subtracted the normalized stability (nS) of each variant from its normalized function value (nF) in each assay. If function directly follows stability then nF-nS≈0, while values closer to 1 or −1 would suggest function/dysfunction independent of stability. Positive values indicate variants with greater function than predicted from stability, while negative values indicate variants with less function than predicted from stability. We used measures of protein abundance in yeast for nS for yeast, and stability measures in HEK293 for all other assays. Interestingly, we find domains within PTEN in which variants predominantly exhibited either stability-independent function (nF-nS&lt;&gt;0), or stability-dependent function (nF-nS≈0; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a, b</xref>). Stability-independent domains, encompassing variants which largely exhibit greater dysfunction than predicted from their instability (nF-nS ≈ −1), are associated with previously well-characterized substrate binding and catalytic domains including within the N-terminal phosphatase and the PIP3-binding domain (PBD) (amino acid (AA) positions 1–55); the WPD-loop (AA 92–93); and the P-loop (AA 123–131)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Therefore, we define stability-independent domains as AA 1–55, 92–93, and 123–131, and variants outside these regions, largely exhibiting nF-nS≈0, as being in stability-dependent domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a, b</xref>). Variants within these two groups showed distinct distributions when plotting the frequency of nF-nS values (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). Plotting the HEK293 pAKT/AKT function against stability reveals that for variants in stability-dependent domains, function tracks stability, yielding a range of function from WT to partial and full LoF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>). For these variants, instability is likely the primary molecular mechanism underlying dysfunction. In contrast, variants within stability-independent domains exhibit complete LoF or dominant negativity irrespective of level of instability, likely indicating molecular mechanisms of dysfunction associated with aberrant substrate binding or catalytic activity. We find similar distributions of nF-nS values using data from yeast or combining results from all models (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), and when removing variants with function and stability values not significantly different from WT (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4f</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Functional and stability data identifies distinct mechanisms of molecular dysfunction.</title><p><bold>a</bold> A normalized plot displaying stability values subtracted from function values for each assay with variants displayed according to their amino acid position below a schematic of PTEN structural domains.

<title>Relationship of PTEN variant dysfunction and disease</title>
<p id="Par17">Attempts to associate MS induced dysfunction to specific disease states is a major role for functional variomics for PTEN, however, this goal is challenged by variants selection bias and high incidence of the same variants in multiple disorders. To investigate this relationship, we reclassify variants as ASD or PHTS if they have been identified in any individual with these disorders (including ID or DD in ASD), and as Somatic Cancer if variants have eight or more cases reported in COSMIC. For this analysis, we allow the same variants to be in multiple classes. Of the 106 PTEN variants we tested, 49 have been identified in individuals with ASD, DD, or ID, with 40/49 also found in PHTS, 15/49 in somatic cancer, and 14/49 in all three disorders (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Further, 64 of the total 106 are PHTS, 20 are Somatic Cancer, and 18 found in both disorders. We find that in yeast and HEK293 lipid phosphatase assays, ASD, PHTS, and Somatic Cancer variants all performed significantly worse than Population Variants. However, no significant difference was found for variant function between these disorders, except between PHTS and Somatic Cancer in the HEK293 pAKT/AKT assay (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>), but this difference was lost when variants we determined to be likely benign due to WT stability and function in multiple models (below) were removed from analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6b</xref>). We note that this analysis relies on assumptions of disease causality that are uncertain, so we interpret the negative result as inconclusive on whether there are disease-specific differences in PTEN variant effects. In contrast, we find that variant impact on function in the yeast, fly and HEK293 assays all show significant predictive powers when stratified by their frequency of occurrence in somatic cancers as reported in COSMIC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>Severity of variant dysfunction correlate with occurrence in cancer.</title><p>Distribution of normalized PTEN variant function by its frequency within the COSMIC database, with variants with a frequency of 0 in purple, 1–7 reports in green, and 8 or more reports in tan.

<title>High-confidence variant classification</title>

For each variant, a score from 0 to 1 is then obtained by dividing the number of LoF assays by the number of assays performed, and then classified as follows: Likely Benign variants have scores &lt;0.25 and are WT-like in at least two assays; Likely Pathogenic have scores &gt;0.5 and are LoF in at least two assays; Pathogenic have scores ≥0.75 and are LoF in at least three assays; and VUS have scores ≥0.25, but &lt;0.5 or too little assay data yielding conflicting results. Stability was only included in discerning variant profiling for unstable proteins, since WT-like stability is not predictive of WT-like function, but instability correlates with dysfunction.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>PTEN variant classification based on 9 assays of variant functions.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The results of 9 functional assays for 106 PTEN variants are summarized according to the following criteria: WT-like variants exhibit no differences to WT, GoF exhibit function values significantly greater than WT, Partial LoF exhibit function significantly greater than null but significantly less than WT, Complete LoF exhibit no differences to null, dominant negative exhibit function significantly less than both null and WT (Below LoF for fly and yeast assays).

<p id="Par19">Of the 106 variants tested, we classify 50 as Pathogenic, including 31 ASD. We further classify 10 variants, including 4 ASD, as Likely Pathogenic. We consider 24 variants to be Likely Benign, including 3 ASD: P354Q, T202I and T78A; and 12 PHTS: I135V, N340H, N356D, K402N, N117S, Y180H, I203V, Q298E, N340D, K342N, L345V, and I400V. We are unable to make a functional classification for 22 variants due to either insufficient data or conflicting results between assays and thus retain the classification of VUS. These include the ASD variants M35V, L70V, H123Q, E157G, C211W, W274L, Y176C, and Y65C, as well as the PHTS variants A79T, N228S, and S229T.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par20">We have taken a deep phenotyping approach to comprehensively assess the impact of single amino acid changes on PTEN function. We use five phylogenetically diverse model systems and phenotypes spanning molecular function to behavior in order to measure variant impact on the multiple complex roles of this protein. By taking advantage of the high-throughput nature of yeast, fly, and HEK293 models, we are able to conduct in-depth analyses of ~100 variants, allowing comparison of effects of overexpression in highly diverse cellular environments. These high-throughput assays allowed selection of a smaller subset of variants exhibiting a range of dysfunction phenotypes to test in lower-throughput neuronal and behavioral assays with more direct relevance to ASD pathophysiology. By utilizing a multi-model system approach including measures of protein stability and function, we identify a diversity of variant impact caused by distinct molecular mechanisms, which would not be apparent from single-model approaches.</p>
<p id="Par21">As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, we find that PTEN variants commonly decrease protein stability. We find that MS variants induce a full range of instability, which was largely consistent between yeast and HEK293 models. Further, for ~50% of PTEN variants tested, located throughout the protein structure, there was strong correlation between instability and dysfunction, resulting in a corresponding range of partial to complete LoF. The consistency of this correlation across models suggests conserved mechanisms for MS-mediated PTEN degradation. For these variants, reduced protein abundance is likely the molecular mechanism underlying dysfunction in each assay, and if consistent under physiologic expression in humans, similar levels of haploinsufficiency may contribute to disease expression.</p>
<p id="Par22">For other variants, including some exhibiting instability, levels of stability did not correlate with protein function, indicating additional molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction. 16 variants, including 4 A, exhibited more function than expected from their stability, suggesting GoF with or without instability. However, most of these variants exhibited greater dysfunction than expected from their instability. These variants largely localized to well-characterized substrate binding and catalytic domains, including the PIP3-binding and N-terminal region of the phosphatase domain, and the catalytic pocket encompassing the WPD- and P-loops. Phenotypes were typically complete LoF or dominant negative/greater than LoF, rather than partial LoF, indicating that these functional domains are intolerant to modification.</p>
<p id="Par23">The large number of variants exhibiting dominant negativity in HEK293 cells was unexpected. While C124S and G129E have previously been established as dominant negatives, such a characterization of other PTEN variants is sparse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Remarkably, we find 29 variants, including 17 ASD, showing dominant negativity in measures of activated AKT. Furthermore, P38S and R130G, two different amino acid substitutions at the same positions as MS variants exhibiting dominant negativity here (P38H, R130L, R130P, and R130Q), have previously been reported to have a dominant negative effect on pAKT levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. We also find 6 dominant negative variants not found in ASD, but identified in PHTS and/or somatic cancer. The mechanism underlying PTEN variant dominant negative activity remains unclear, but potential mechanisms include substrate sequestration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, dimerization-mediated inhibition of WT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, or substrate switching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. It is challenging to predict the effects on pAKT levels by substrate sequestration from PTEN variants lacking phosphatase activity. Our data, however, fits a simpler model in which dominant negativity if effected through heterodimerization of dysfunctional PTEN variants with WT, resulting in inhibition of WT function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Both substrate sequestration and dimerization-mediated inhibition models are supported by our finding that dominant negativity was lost for most variants in the absence of WT in our PTEN KO cell line. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the variant A126G within the P-loop substrate binding site induced a shift in affinity for different substrates, converting PTEN from a 3- to 5-phosphatase, resulting in AKT activation rather than inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. While substrate switching would not be consistent with variants which lose dominant negativity in PTEN KO cells, it might explain the few variants, including A126D, which retain this behavior. Identifying dominant negative variants is of significant clinical value since they may produce outcomes distinct from LoF variants producing haploinsufficiency. Whether phenotypes identified in an overexpression assay are conserved at physiological levels, as shown for C124S and G129E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, requires further study. Overall, these results suggest multiple mechanisms of MS mutation-induced PTEN dysfunction: instability producing haploinsufficiency, and loss of substrate binding or catalytic function leading to either complete LoF or dominant negativity.</p>
<p id="Par24">We found varied strength of correlations between functional measures of PTEN variants across assays and model systems overall, but high correlations for variants in which dysfunction is due to instability. This suggests conserved mechanisms of MS-mediated protein degradation, resulting in reduced protein affecting all assays similarly. Increased intra-assay and -model variability was observed for variants whose dysfunction was associated with mutations in substrate binding and catalytic domains, likely reflecting selective sensitivity of each assay to distinct functions of PTEN. For example, for all eight sentinel assays in yeast, variants within the WPD were better tolerated than in other model systems, potentially due to differences in steric requirements for interactions with the substrate PI3P in yeast and the primary substrate PIP3 in other models. We also find that the sentinels <italic>Δvac14</italic>, <italic>Δfig4</italic>, and <italic>Δvac7</italic>, which mediate PI3P-to-PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> interconversion, are particularly sensitive to mutations in the PIP3-binding domain, implicating PTEN-mediated lipid interconversion in these assays. The other 5 sentinels, <italic>Δvam3</italic>, <italic>Δvam7</italic>, <italic>Δvps30</italic>, <italic>Δvps38</italic>, and <italic>Δypt7</italic>, are more sensitive to variants located adjacent to the CBR3 loop which mediates PTEN binding to endosomal membrane PI3P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, potentially implicating sensitivity to PTEN’s role in endosomal trafficking. The fly eclosion assay, however, exhibited heightened sensitivity to mutations in the TI-loop. Other functional domains exhibit conserved sensitivity across models, including the beginning of the phosphatase domain, bordered by variants D22E to R47K and R47W, the PIP3-domain and the P-loop. Results from all assays we employed found that variants in the C-terminal region encompassing the C2 domain, serine/threonine-rich C-tail and PDZ domain largely exhibited stability-dependent function. Given that phosphorylation of C2 and the C-tail regulate its membrane association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, and variants within the C2 domain exhibit LoF due to reduced nuclear localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, it is likely that additional assays sensitive to these PTEN functions would identify additional stability-independent regions within the C-terminus. Altogether, our results highlight the strength of a multiple-assay and -model system approach for fully assessing variant impact on multifunctional proteins.</p>
<p id="Par25">Complex patterns of variant effects on our measures of neuronal morphogenesis and sensorimotor behavior suggests PTEN has multiple functions in neurons. This is supported by previous findings that both lipid and protein phosphatase PTEN activity participate in synaptogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Here, we find similar impact on excitatory synaptogenesis and dendritogenesis, indicating common PTEN action, which may be due to synapse formation directly affecting dendritic growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Such an interaction would not occur in the axonogenesis assay, since axon growth is measured at stages prior to onset of synaptogenesis. For some variants, results from rat neuronal growth and worm behavior assays differed from yeast and fly assay. For example, H123Q has less impact on the neuronal and behavior assays, while greater impact was seen for a number of ASD variants, including D326N, T167N, I101T, as well as the PHTS variant A79T.</p>
<p id="Par26">A critical role of functional variomics is establishing whether VUS encode dysfunctional proteins potentially causal to disease, or protein with WT function and likely benign. Given the overlap of specific variants associated with ASD, PHTS, and somatic cancer, limited annotation of patient phenotypes, and our inclusion of variants identified in single cases of ASD and PHTS, we could not attribute distinct molecular mechanisms of PTEN dysfunction to distinct disease states. However, of the 74 variants we tested found in ASD, PHTS, and/or somatic cancer, we find 10 with phenotypes not significantly different from WT, or with &gt;50% WT function in all assays tested. We predict that these variants are likely benign and not contributing to disease. For ASD, T78A, T202I, and P354Q, show WT activity across assays, and P354Q is the third-most common variant identified in the population (gnomAD), supporting classification as benign. The remaining ASD variants exhibit dysfunction ranging from partial to complete LoF, and dominant negativity. Furthermore, we find a strong relationship between variant impact on multiple assays and their frequency of detection in cancerous tumors. All of the 19 MS variants we examined with at least eight reports in somatic tumors showed LoF in all high-throughput models, particularly those located proximal to the lipid phosphatase domain. Altogether, our results strongly support a multi-model system approach for high-confidence profiling of genetic variants.</p>

<p id="Par33">Yeast were grown overnight under inducing conditions. <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> was measured for all samples then each were diluted to an optical density (OD) of 0.1 and allowed to grow ~6–8 h or until they reached between 0.8 and 1.0 OD. An equivalent of 1.0 OD was collected for each sample. Samples were pelleted and supernatant discarded before being frozen at −20 °C. After freezing, glass beads and sample buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 2.0% β-mercaptoethanol were added to the pellet then bead bashed for 2 min. Samples were then boiled at 90 °C for 5 min and centrifuged before being loaded into a 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat #NP0322) and run with MOPS running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #NP0001). Gels were transferred in buffer containing 20% methanol and 0.03% SDS for 2 h at 4 C at 28 V onto 0.2 μM nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, cat. #<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/1620097">1620097</ext-link>). Membranes were blocked in tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST) (Acros Organics, cat #AC233360010) containing 5% milk (Bio Basic, cat. #NB0669). Membranes were then stained with PTEN antibody (1:1000; R&amp;D Systems, MAB847) followed by goat-anti-mouse HRP (1:5000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #62-6520) and imaged with ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then stripped with a pH 2.2 stripping buffer containing 1.5% glycine, 0.1% SDS and 1% Tween 20 and re-stained for the loading using the anti-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Millipore, cat. #A9521). Blots were again imaged on ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). Band density was determined using ImageJ. All PTEN bands were normalized first to their loading control then the wild-type PTEN done in each experiment. All variants were tested in triplicate.</p>

<title>HEK293 cell culture, stability, and pAKT/AKT assays</title>
<p id="Par34">HEK293 cells purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, cat. #CRL-1573) and were routinely passaged in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (MilliporeSigma, cat. #D6046) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin. For all experiments herein, HEK293 cells were used for a maximum of 15 passages. Cells were seeded at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> per well in 24-well dishes 16–20 h before transfected with 500 ng of expression plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9 at a ratio of 2 µL to 1 µg DNA. All variants were expressed as an N-terminal fusion with sfGFP with a 13 amino acid linker (TSLYKKAGSEFAL), and expression was driven by a pCAG promoter. In all, 24 h after transfection cells were washed with DMEM and starved for 19 h in serum-free media before being stimulated for 10 min with complete medium plus 10 nM Insulin (Gibco, cat. #12585014), then washed once in 1xPBS before treated with Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, cat. # 25200072) for 5 min to create a single-cell suspension and then fixed for 10 min in 3.2% PFA. Cells were permeabilized with Flow Cytometry Permeabilization/Wash Buffer I (FC005, R&amp;D Systems) and stained with Rabbit anti-pAKT (1:100; Cell Signaling, Ser473, cat. #9271) and Mouse anti-pan-AKT (1:100; Cell Signaling, cat. #2920,) for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed and then stained with Goat anti-Rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 647 (1:100; Thermo Fisher, cat. #<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/A21244">A21244</ext-link>) and Goat anti-Mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 405 (1:100; Thermo Fisher, cat. #<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/A31553">A31553</ext-link>) for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed and re-suspended in Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer (FC001, R&amp;D Systems) before loading into an Attune Nxt Flow Cytometer (Invitrogen). Data was recorded using VL-1 (Alexa Fluor 405), BL-1 (sfGFP), YL-1 (mtagRFP-T), and RL-1 (Alexa Fluor 647) channels, which were single-stain compensated. Using FlowJo, Cells were selected using FSC-H/SSC-H and single cells were selected using SSC-H/SSC-A. For pAKT/AKT measures, cells with sfGFP fluorescence above untransfected cells to 100-fold above untransfected (300 a.u. to 20,000 a.u.) were selected. For stability measures, cells with higher mtagRFP-T fluorescence than untransfected and sfGFP fluorescence &lt;20,000 a.u. were selected. The median of (647 - Background)/(405 - Background) as the pAKT/AKT level was calculated both for the positive and negative (RFP- and sfGFP-, untransfected) population in each sample and the difference was measured as the effect measure, normalizing each sample by its in-well untransfected control. Samples were then normalized to WT = 1 for each day of experiment. For stability measures, the median ratio of (sfGFP - Background)/(mtagRFP-T – Background) was calculated as the relative stability of PTEN compared to its 1:1 transfection control. Samples were then normalized to WT = 1 for each day of experiment.</p>

<title>Data modeling and variant effects analysis</title>
<p id="Par35">The quantitative phenotypes for the yeast, fly, worm, and rat assays were analyzed using a hierarchical (mixed effect) model approach to account for experimental batch effects and variability between replicates. For each assay, we treat the genotype as a fixed effect, which can be either the positive control, the negative control, or a variant, and treat blocking factors such as experimental batch or day as random effects (stratified by variant and accompanying controls). All R scripts are provided at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PavlidisLab/Post-PTEN">https://github.com/PavlidisLab/Post-PTEN</ext-link>. For each assay, we fit models to the data for all tested variants and accompanying controls jointly.

Models were fit using the lmer function of the lmerTest package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> in the R programming environment (R Core Team 2019). To assess the significance of effect between the positive (wild-type PTEN) and negative (no PTEN, empty vector or GFP background) controls, we extracted the model fit <italic>p</italic>-values of each genotype under a comparison where each control is used as the contrast group, using the method of Satterthwaite as implemented in lmerTest. Both comparison yields a vector of <italic>p</italic>-values for all other genotypes except the contrast variant. For visualization purposes, we plot data adjusted for the estimated random effects. Specifically, we compute adjusted values through a multiplication between the fixed-effects model matrix X with the β fixed-effect parameter estimate and a sum of the model residuals vector.
