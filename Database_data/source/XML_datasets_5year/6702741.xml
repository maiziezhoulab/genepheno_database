<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par1">The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been linked to the regulation of glioma progression. However, the underlying signaling mechanisms that regulate EMT are poorly understood.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="Par2">Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot were performed to detect the expression of MeCP2 in glioma tissues and cell lines. MeCP2 functions were tested with cell immunofluorescence staining and western blot. For in vivo experiments, mouse xenograft model was used to investigate the effects of MeCP2 on glioma. ChIP and Co-IP were used to detect the relationships among MeCP2, miR-200c and Suv39H1.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par3">In this study, we found that MeCP2 was frequently up-regulated in human glioma tissues and cell lines. MeCP2 knockdown remarkably induced cell epithelial phenotype and inhibited mesenchymal marker ZEB1 and ZEB2 in vitro and in vivo. In addition, MeCP2 in glioma tissues was negatively correlated with miR-200c expression, and miR-200c overexpression partially abrogated mesenchymal phenotype induced by MeCP2. More importantly, we showed that MeCP2 recruited H3K9 to the promoter of miR-200c by interacting with SUV39H1, resulting in EMT of glioma cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par4">This study for the first time reveals MeCP2 as a novel regulator of EMT in glioma and suggest that MeCP2 inhibition may represent a promising therapeutic option for suppressing EMT in glioma.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par16">Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor characterized by highly infiltrative growth. Base on the pathological characteristics, gliomas can be classified into four clinical grades. (Glioblastoma multiforme, GBM) is one of the most aggressive types of brain tumors, and despite the combination of multiple treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, patients often still develop refractory recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In general, GBM patients have a median survival time of no more than 16 months after optimal treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. GBM are classified into four molecular subtypes including mesenchymal, classical, proneural and neural subtypes based on gene expression-based molecular classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].The mesenchymal GBM subtype has recently been shown to be the most malignant with resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This pathogenic phenotype has been associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The EMT is a key biological process that is normally involved in embryonic development and have been reported to regulate invasion and metastasis of tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In GBM, members of the ZEB-family, e.g., ZEB1 and ZEB2, known as the activators of EMT, can promote the invasiveness of GBM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of EMT is essential for the development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for gliomas.</p>
<p id="Par17">Methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a member of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. MeCP2 has been found to have two functional domains, a 104-amino-acid transcriptional repression domain (TRD) and an 85-amino-acid MBD. MBD binds DNA sequences methylated at cytosine in the dinucleotide 5′-CpG and TRD acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting histone deacetylase complex (HDAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. MeCP2 has been reported to be implicated in a number of molecular functions, such as transcription regulation, RNA splicing, and chromatin organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Loss-of-function mutations in MeCP2 causes Rett syndrome (RTT), whereas the duplications of MeCP2-containing loci may result in spectrum of phenotypes ranging from autism to intellectual disabilities and mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that a non-neuronal role for MeCP2 has emerged in tumorigenesis, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer and gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, little is known about its biological characteristics and molecular mechanisms in human glioma.</p>
<p id="Par18">MicroRNAs, known as small noncoding RNAs, are involved in regulation of downstream gene expression at the posttranscriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Most importantly, the complex regulatory network not only allows one gene by the combination of multiple microRNAs, but also modulates the expression of several genes via one microRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Recently, numerous deregulated miRNAs have been reported to be associated with human cancers progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The miR-200 family (miR-200c/miR-141 and miR-200a/miR-200b/miR-429 clusters) is a tumor-suppressive group of miRNAs that is implicated in suppressing EMT process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recent reports have suggested that the repression of miR-200 s expression occurs due to epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation and histone methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition, our previous study showed that miR-141 methylation mediated by DNMT1 in glioma. However, the association of MeCP2 with miR-200 s dysregulation is still unknown.</p>
<p id="Par19">In this paper, we found that MeCP2 knockdown repressed EMT process of glioma cells, and expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2. Additionally, MeCP2 regulated the expression of microRNA-200 family targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2 transcripts through epigenetic modification. The present work reveals epigenetic regulatory network between miRNA and methylation, which will provide a novel therapy strategy for guarding against EMT of gliomas via targeting MeCP2 and its downstream miR-200c.</p>

<title>Increased MeCP2 levels in gliomas tissues and cells</title>
<p id="Par32">To evaluate MeCP2 expression in glioma samples and cell lines, MeCP2 expression were detected by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>a, MeCP2 mRNA expression was markedly increased in glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues. To determine whether the expression of MeCP2 is linked to the pathogenesis of glioma, MeCP2 expression in glioma tissues with different histopathologic grades was observed. A significant increase was observed in low grade glioma samples, whereas a slight increase in high grade glioma samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>b). Interestingly, MeCP2 expression is significantly increased in mesenchymal glioblastoma as compared with classical subgroup as divided after Verhaak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>c). To confirm the changes of MeCP2 expression in gliomas, immunoblotting analysis was performed. MeCP2 protein expression was increased in glioma tissues compared with that in normal brain tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>d-e). Moreover, we also measured MeCP2 levels in a panel of glioma cell lines and a normal human astrocytes (NHA). Compared with NHA, MeCP2 expression levels were significantly increased in LN-18 and U251 glioma cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>f). Therefore, we chose LN-18 and U251 glioma cells for further functional studies.

<title>MeCP2 knockdown induces epithelial phenotype in vitro</title>
<p id="Par33">To investigate the effect of MeCP2 on EMT in gliomas, LN-18 and U251 glioma cells were transfected sh-MeCP2 and sh-con. Decreased expression of MeCP2 after transfection of sh-MeCP2 was confirmed in LN-18 and U251 glioma cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>a-c). In addition, obvious cell morphology change was observed in the second weeks after MeCP2 knockdown, and cells morphology were changed from mesenchymal morphology to epithelial morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>d and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Fig. S1a).

To determine whether MeCP2 regulate EMT in glioma, the expression of EMT markers was analyzed. We found that knockdown of MeCP2 increased mRNA expression levels of epithelial markers E-Cadherin, and decreased mesenchymal markers, ZEB1, ZEB2, and TWIST1 in LN18 and U251 glioma cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>a-b).

<title>MeCP2 as a regulator of miR-200c transcriptional repression</title>
<p id="Par38">MeCP2 can mediate transcriptional repression of genes by binding specifically to methylated DNA of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To explore the mechanism how MeCP2 repress miR-200c expression in a similar manner, we predicted CpG of miR-200c promoter via using MethPrimer. Pyrosequencing results showed that methylation of miR-200c promoter was not significant change in MeCP2 overexpression compared with vector (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Fig. S3a). Previous study showed that MeCP2 can recruit histone methyltransferase that methylate local H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) are involved in gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To explore whether MeCP2 represses the level of miR-200c expression via H3K9me3 modification in glioma cells, and the results found that a significant enrichment of H3K9me3 in the miR-200c promoter was observed in MeCP2-overexpressed glioma cells compared with vector cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>a-c).

In addition, we found that miR-200c expression was markedly reduced by expression of either WT or MBD truncated form of MeCP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>h), suggesting that MBD is capable of exerting transcriptional repression activity as WT MeCP2.</p>

<title>MeCP2 mediated H3K9me3 of miR-200c via its interaction with SUV39H1</title>
<p id="Par40">MeCP2 initiates silencing with selective methylation on H3K9, thus creating a high-affinity binding site for suppressor of variegation 39H1(SUV39H1) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].To investigate the interaction between MeCP2 and SUV39H1, coimmunoprecipitation(Co-IP) experiments was used to perform in glioma cells. Endogenous MeCP2 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous SUV39H1 in glioma cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>a). The interaction of SUV39H1 with MeCP2 was further confirmed via reverse endogenous coimmunoprecipitation of SUV39H1 with MeCP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>b), supporting a physical SUV39H1-MeCP2 interaction in vitro. These data prompted us to investigate whether SUV39H1 is involved in H3K9me3 of miR-200c mediated by MeCP2, ChIP analysis was performed in MeCP2-overexpressing glioma cells. We found that MeCP2 enhanced the binding of SUV39H1 to the promoters of miR-200c (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>c-d). However, no increase in SUV39H1 binding to the promoters of GAPDH, a gene not mediated by SUV39H1, was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>c-d). These results indicated that MeCP2 is related to SUV39H1 occupancy at miR-200c promoter. To further confirm whether SUV39H1 mediated epigenetic repression of miR-200c, we examined miR-200c expression after transfection of si-SUV39H1 to glioma cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Fig. S3b). As shown Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>e-g, SUV39H1 knockdown reduced H3K9me3 occupancy at the promoter of miR-200c and resulted in the increase of miR-200c expression.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par41">Emerging evidences indicate MeCP2 as a pivotal oncogene in tumorigenesis. MeCP2 as a frequently amplified oncogene has observed in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Recently, overexpression of MeCP2 have found in diverse types of cancers, including gastric cancer, endometrial cancers, and prostate cancer, whereas MeCP2 knockdown repressed the proliferation of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, the role of MeCP2 in glioma is still largely unknown. Here, we showed that the expression of MeCP2 was increased in glioma tissues and associated with pathological grade. Interestingly, MeCP2 expression are highly in mesenchymal GBM subtype, suggesting that MeCP2 may be involve in EMT of glioma. Recently, Li et al. found that MeCP2 promoted EMT by epigenetically silencing BMP7 in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Here, we found that knockdown of MeCP2 significantly induced epithelial phenotype in vitro, whereas overexpression of MeCP2 exerted the opposite effect. These results indicate that MeCP2 may play a key role in the regulation of EMT in gliomas.</p>
<p id="Par42">EMT is a cellular mechanism that is known to promote a developmental transdifferentiation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition, during EMT, epithelial cells lose their polarity, which will increase express mesenchymal markers, such as ZEB1 and ZEB2, and then leading to acquire invasive potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This phenomenon has also been related to tumor progression, during which epithelial cells lose signs of differentiation, and obtain enhanced migratory abilities, which results in invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. ZEB1 increases loss of cell–cell contact and therefore fosters increased motility in glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Additionally, ZEB2 knockdown inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, and increased cell death in glioma-derived cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Here, we found that inhibition of MeCP2 markedly impaired expression of the EMT player ZEB1 and ZEB2 in vitro and in vivo. These results indicated that MeCP2 can function as a transcriptional activator of ZEB1 and ZEB2 in glioma. In this paper, though some important discoveries were disclosed, a subcutaneous tumor model was used in our study, which may result in the consequences that we may not be able to perfectly simulate the microenvironment of intracranial tumor growth in vivo.</p>
<p id="Par43">Previous study showed that MeCP2 is best known for its role as a transcriptional repressor in the regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells. MeCP2 was associated with the methylated of TFPI-2 promoter, and the loss of MeCP2 in TFPI-2 promoter resulted in gene reactivation in human glioma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Recently, it was found that dysregulation of miRNA in cancer is due to the transcriptional repression function of MeCP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. MiR-200 s family have been reported to play a central role in suppressing EMT marker ZEB1 and ZEB2. Therefore, we speculate that MeCP2 may mediate a transcriptional activator of ZEB1 and ZEB2 by repressing miR-200 s family. Here, we showed that MeCP2 repressed expression of miR-200c, but not other member of miR-200 family, in glioma cells, and MeCP2 expression was negatively associated with miR-200c in glioma tissues. In addition, miR-200c was involved in MeCP2-mediated EMT in glioma. These results suggest that MeCP2 may regulate EMT, at least in part, by miR-200c in glioma.</p>
<p id="Par44">MeCP2 is believed to exert the function of transcriptional inhibition via binding to methylated CpG dinucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Unexpectedly, we found that overexpression of MeCP2 not changed the methylation of miR-200c promoter. As a master regulator of gene expression, MeCP2 also acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting corepressors and epigenetic regulator, to the promoter regions to suppress a variety of genes expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The association of MeCP2 with H3K9 methylation has been reported in the region of IL-6 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A direct correlation between the binding of MeCP2 and the presence of H3K9me in promoter of the IκBα gene and the BDNF gene also has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Our ChIP results showed, for the first time, that MeCP2 represses expression of miR-200c by regulating H3K9 methylation of miR-200c promoter. The association of MeCP2 with histone H3 methyltransferase activity is primarily mediated by methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD), represents a specific epigenetic mark for transcriptional repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par45">Here, we showed that MeCP2 mainly exhibit transcriptional repression of miR-200c in glioma depends on its MBD domain, but not TRD domain. As an oncogene, whether MeCP2 exerts its effect in the control of glioma by interacting with other miRNA is still unclear, which is the field we will focus on in subsequent study.</p>
<p id="Par46">Lunyak et al. reported that MeCP2 initiates silencing with selective methylation on H3K9 via interactions with SUV39H1 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].The molecular mechanism underlying its role in epigenetic regulation is yet unknown. Here, we showed that MeCP2 interacts with SUV39H1 to mediate methylation-based epigenetic transcriptional silencing. Our observation showed that MeCP2 is associated with SUV39H1, and aids in the recruitment of SUV39H1 to the promoter. Then, SUV39H1 recruitment induced in the accumulation of H3K9, which represses miR-200c expression at the transcriptional levels. In consistent with the previous study of MeCP2 interacted with SUV39H1 to regulate their target genes suggests that this pattern of mechanism may be more general.</p>

<sec id="Sec24">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par47">In summary, our findings demonstrated that the interaction of MeCP2 with SUV39H1, and deliver H3K9 to the promoter of miR-200c, resulting in the transcriptional repression of the miR-200c, and then activates EMT in glioma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10</xref>). These results suggest that MeCP2 as an attractive therapeutic target, the inhibition of which may potentially downregulate the expression of miR-200c, resulting in subsequent suppression of the EMT. Hence, our study not only reveals a novel mechanism underlying the epigenetic regulation of EMT in glioma but also provides a novel therapeutic target of glioma. Moreover, identification of MeCP2-specific inhibitor could potentially create a new paradigm in the discovery and development of molecular target therapy for glioma.
