<abstract abstract-type="teaser">
<p>This cross-sectional study evaluates the prevalence of pathogenic copy number variations and identifies possible candidate copy number variations and genes in adults with epilepsy and intellectual disability with unknown cause.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="key-points">
<title>Key Points</title>
<sec id="ab-noi170050-1">
<title>Question</title>
<p>What is the role of copy number variation investigation in adults with unexplained epilepsy and intellectual disability?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="ab-noi170050-2">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>In this cross-sectional study, pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic copy number variations were found in 16.1% of the probands investigated using microarray analysis; 8 nonrecurrent rare copy number variations were identified. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was associated with an <italic>ABAT</italic> duplication and Jeavons syndrome with a <italic>KIAA2022</italic> deletion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="ab-noi170050-3">
<title>Meaning</title>
<p>This study highlights the importance of investigating adults with childhood-onset epilepsy and intellectual disability without an etiologic diagnosis.</p>
</sec>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<sec id="ab-noi170050-4">
<title>Importance</title>
<p>Copy number variation (CNV) is an important cause of neuropsychiatric disorders. Little is known about the role of CNV in adults with epilepsy and intellectual disability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="ab-noi170050-5">
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>To evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic CNVs and identify possible candidate CNVs and genes in patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="ab-noi170050-6">
<title>Design, Setting, and Participants</title>
<p>In this cross-sectional study, genome-wide microarray was used to evaluate a cohort of 143 adults with unexplained childhood-onset epilepsy and intellectual disability who were recruited from the Toronto Western Hospital epilepsy outpatient clinic from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014. The inclusion criteria were (1) pediatric seizure onset with ongoing seizure activity in adulthood, (2) intellectual disability of any degree, and (3) no structural brain abnormalities or metabolic conditions that could explain the seizures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="ab-noi170050-7">
<title>Main Outcomes and Measures</title>
<p>DNA screening was performed using genome-wide microarray platforms. Pathogenicity of CNVs was assessed based on the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. The Residual Variation Intolerance Score was used to evaluate genes within the identified CNVs that could play a role in each patient’s phenotype.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="ab-noi170050-8">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 2335 patients, 143 probands were investigated (mean [SD] age, 24.6 [10.8] years; 69 male and 74 female). Twenty-three probands (16.1%) and 4 affected relatives (2.8%) (mean [SD] age, 24.1 [6.1] years; 11 male and 16 female) presented with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs (0.08-18.9 Mb). Five of the 23 probands with positive results (21.7%) had more than 1 CNV reported. Parental testing revealed de novo CNVs in 11 (47.8%), with CNVs inherited from a parent in 4 probands (17.4%). Sixteen of 23 probands (69.6%) presented with previously cataloged human genetic disorders and/or defined CNV hot spots in epilepsy. Eight nonrecurrent rare CNVs that overlapped 1 or more genes associated with intellectual disability, autism, and/or epilepsy were identified: 2p16.1-p15 duplication, 6p25.3-p25.1 duplication, 8p23.3p23.1 deletion, 9p24.3-p23 deletion, 10q11.22-q11.23 duplication, 12p13.33-13.2 duplication, 13q34 deletion, and 16p13.2 duplication. Five genes are of particular interest given their potential pathogenicity in the corresponding phenotypes and least tolerability to variation: <italic>ABAT, KIAA2022</italic>, <italic>COL4A1, CACNA1C,</italic> and <italic>SMARCA2</italic>. <italic>ABAT</italic> duplication was associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and <italic>KIAA2022</italic> deletion with Jeavons syndrome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="ab-noi170050-9">
<title>Conclusions and Relevance</title>
<p>The high prevalence of pathogenic CNVs in this study highlights the importance of microarray analysis in adults with unexplained childhood-onset epilepsy and intellectual disability. Additional studies and comparison with similar cases are required to evaluate the effects of deletions and duplications that overlap specific genes.</p>
