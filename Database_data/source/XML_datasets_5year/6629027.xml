<abstract id="ABS1">
<p id="P1">Repetitive behaviors are diagnostic for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and commonly observed in other neurodevelopmental disorders. Currently, there are no effective pharmacological treatments for repetitive behavior in these clinical conditions. This is due to the lack of information about the specific neural circuitry that mediates the development and expression of repetitive behavior. Our previous work in mouse models has linked repetitive behavior to decreased activation of the subthalamic nucleus, a brain region in the indirect and hyperdirect pathways in the basal ganglia circuitry. The present experiments were designed to further test our hypothesis that pharmacological activation of the indirect pathway would reduce repetitive behavior. We used a combination of adenosine A1 and A2A receptor agonists that have been shown to alter the firing frequency of dorsal striatal neurons within the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. This drug combination markedly and selectively reduced repetitive behavior in both male and female C58 mice over a six-hour period, an effect that required both A1 and A2A agonists as neither alone reduced repetitive behavior. The adenosine A1 and A2A receptor agonist combination also significantly increased the number of <italic>Fos</italic> transcripts and <italic>Fos</italic> positive cells in dorsal striatum. <italic>Fos</italic> induction was found in both direct and indirect pathway neurons suggesting that the drug combination restored the balance of activation across these complementary basal ganglia pathways. The adenosine A1 and A2A receptor agonist combination also maintained its effectiveness in reducing repetitive behavior over a 7-day period. These findings point to novel potential therapeutic targets for development of drug therapies for repetitive behavior in clinical disorders.</p>
