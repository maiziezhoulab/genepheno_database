<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is a regulator of local translation through its mRNA targets in the neurons. Previous studies have demonstrated that FMRP may function in distinct ways during the development of different visual subcircuits. However, the localization of the FMRP in different types of retinal cells is unclear. In this work, the FMRP expression in rat retina was detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence double labeling. Results showed that the FMRP expression could be detected in rat retina and that the FMRP had a strong immunoreaction (IR) in the ganglion cell (GC) layer, inner nucleus layer (INL), and outer plexiform layer (OPL) of rat retina. In the outer retina, the bipolar cells (BCs) labeled by homeobox protein ChX10 (ChX10) and the horizontal cells (HCs) labeled by calbindin (CB) were FMRP-positive. In the inner retina, GABAergic amacrine cells (ACs) labeled by glutamate decarbonylase colocalized with the FMRP. The dopaminergic ACs (tyrosine hydroxylase marker) and cholinergic ACs (choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) marker) were co-labeled with the FMRP. In most GCs (labeled by Brn3a) and melanopsin-positive intrinsically photosensitive retinal GCs (ipRGCs) were also FMRP-positive. The FMRP expression was observed in the cellular retinal binding protein-positive Müller cells. These results suggest that the FMRP could be involved in the visual pathway transmission.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable form of intellectual disability caused by the decreased expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The FMRP is an mRNA-binding protein mainly involved in intracellular RNA transport and translational regulation. The defective regulation of the local protein synthesis in the synapse results in altered synaptic plasticity and abnormal dendrite growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This condition suggests that the FMRP acts as a critical player in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and thus in circuit formation and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, loss of the FMRP leads to several deficits in visual subcircuits of the superior colliculus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and exhibit impairments in visual discrimination similar to those in <italic>Fmr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice and human FXS participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although little is known about the FMRP and its possible role in vision, <italic>Fragile X</italic> premutation carriers have been found to have some visual perception impairments caused by the lack of the FMRP in the geniculo-striatal magnocellular visual pathway, which processes information about stimulus movement and cortical recipients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, evidence shows that the FMRP regulates the translation of rhodopsin through post-translational modifications (phosphorylation in particular) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Patients with FXS exhibit a wide range of vision integration dysfunctions that manifest in multiple modalities. These defects in visual sensory are a hallmark feature of many neurodevelopmental disorders associated with cerebral neuron immaturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], especially in the primary visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover, a report revealed that impairing the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<italic>Fmr1</italic>) gene expression by injecting morpholinos causes malformation of the zebrafish retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Several key proteins involved in synaptic transmission have been shown to be regulated by the FMRP. The defective regulation of local protein synthesis in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mice lowered the levels of GABAergic proteins, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13–15</xref>]. The altered expression of the GABAR subunits redundancy was also linked to the FMRP loss-of-function in FXS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. One of the main pathways of the FMRP regulation is through the activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which is expressed in the retina along with other mGluR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19–21</xref>]. Moreover, the FMRP is expressed in the retina, and the leading role of the FMRP is highlighted in the retinal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The absence of the FMRP correlates with the increase in the electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave, which mostly reflects ON-bipolar cell (BC) depolarization to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Nevertheless, the localization of the FMRP in different types of retinal cells has not been studied yet.</p>
<p>In the present study, by using double-labeled immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that the FMRP is cell-type dependent in rat retina, including horizontal cells (HCs), several subtypes of amacrine cells (ACs), BCs, ganglion cells (GCs), and Müller cells.</p>

<title>Experimental procedures</title>
<sec id="sec2-1">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>A total of 20 male Sprague–Dawley rats (7–8 weeks old) were used in the present study. All were obtained from Anhui Medical University. In the supplementary data, two C57BL/6J male mice (7–8 weeks old, Anhui Medical University) and four <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO male mice (7–8 weeks old, The Jackson Laboratory, 003025) were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-2">
<title>Tissue preparation for immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>The retinas were prepared as previously described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In brief, the animals were deeply anesthetized with 20% urethane (10 ml/kg). The posterior eyecups were immediately fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) for 20 min and chilled sequentially in 10% (w/v), 20%, and 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB at 4°C. The eyecups were then embedded in OCT (Sakura Finetek U.S.A., Inc., Torrance, Japan), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned vertically at 14-μm thickness on a freezing microtome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany). The sections were mounted on gelatin chromium-coated slides.</p>

<sec id="sec2-3">
<title>DNA analysis and genotyping</title>
<p>Total DNA was isolated from the tail tissue that were collected from wild-type (WT) mice and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice at approximately 2 weeks of age in the EP tube, cut and mark it. Add 80 μl NaOH (50 mmol/l), put in a metal bath at 99°C for 30 min, and add 40 μl Tris/HCl (1 mmol/l). After mixing, take 1 μl of each sample and add it to the reaction system (ddH<sub>2</sub>O + Buffer + dNTP + Taq enzyme + primer). <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO forward primer (5′-GTGGTTAGCTAAAGTGAGGATGAT-3′), and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO reverse primer (5′-GTGGGCTCTATGGCTTCTGAGG-3′). WT forword primer (5′-ATCTAGTCATGCTATGGATATCAGC-3′), and WT reverse primer (5′-CTTGACTGTGCCGTTGAACT-3′). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with the following protocol on a MyCycler Thermal Cycler™ (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States): 94°C for 5 min, 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, 72°C for 45 s (35 cycles); 72°C for 10 min, and a final hold at 4°C. PCR products were run on 1% agarose gel. The <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse amplicon was approximately 400 bp. The WT mouse amplicon was approximately 131 bp (Supplementary Figure 1). The amplicon was sequenced to determine the genotypes of the mouse. Select the required genotype <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO male mice and raise them separately.</p>

<title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>The procedures of immunocytochemistry were modified from Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Briefly, the retinal sections were preincubated in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), containing 6% normal donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 2 h at 4°C. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat/mouse FMRP (corresponding to amino acid residues 549–569) (1:500 dilution, Abcam, ab17722, U.K.) was used for labeling the FMRP. The experiments were conducted by double labeling. All antibodies were mixed with PBST. The sections were combined with primary and secondary antibodies sequentially. The primary antibody has a unique locus for the secondary antibody that can emit immunofluorescence. Mouse anti-calbindin D-28k (CB) monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution, Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) and sheep anti-homeobox protein ChX10 (ChX10) polyclonal antibody (1:800 dilution, Abcam) were used for labeling HCs and BCs, respectively. The antibodies used for labeling the different subtypes of ACs were as follows: mouse anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD 65) monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution, Abcam) for GABAergic ACs, mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) monoclonal antibody (1:10000 dilution, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) for dopaminergic ACs, and sheep anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution, Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.) for cholinergic ACs. Mouse anti-Brn3a monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, U.S.A.) and goat anti-homeobox protein melanopsin polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz, U.S.A.) were used for labeling GCs and self-sensitized GCs, respectively. Mouse anti-cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution, Abcam) was used for labeling the Müller cells. The secondary antibodies used in this work were as follows: Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG for labeling the FMRP; Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG for CB, GAD 65, TH, Brn-3a, and CRALBP; Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG for melanopsin; and Fluor 555-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG for ChX10 and ChAT. The control experiments included the omission of the primary and/or secondary antibodies.</p>

<sec id="sec2-5">
<title>Confocal laser scanning microscopy</title>
<p>The sections were scanned with a Leica SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope (ZEISS, LSM880+Airyscan, Germany) using a 40× immersion objective lens. For each double-labeling experiment, 30–36 sections on six different glass slides derived from three or four eyeballs were examined. Single optical sections were taken through the preparation and recorded digitally. To avoid any possible reconstruction stacking artifact, double labeling was precisely evaluated by sequential scanning on single-layer optical sections. The images were resized and adjusted for brightness and contrast in Adobe Photoshop to reproduce the original histological data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-6">
<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Western blot analysis was performed as described previously in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Rat retinal extract samples (20 µl per lane) were loaded, subjected to 10% SDS/PAGE, and then transferred on to PVDF membranes. Non-specific binding was blocked for 2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, and 5% non-fat milk. The blots were incubated with the anti-FMRP antibody (1:1000 dilution, Abcam) overnight at 4°C, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1.5 h at room temperature, and finally visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence automatic gel imaging analysis system (Peiqing Science and Technology, Shanghai, China). To estimate the molecular weight (MW) of the FMRP, a pre-stained protein mouse homeobox action (Tiangen, Beijing, China) was used.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The specificity of the FMRP was examined using Western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, in the rat retinal homogenates, the antibody against the FMRP recognized one band at ∼80 KDa, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. No band was found when the FMRP antibody was absent from the incubated solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). These results suggest that the FMRP is indeed present in rat retina.</p>

<p>To determine the spatial expression pattern of the FMRP within the retina, the rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat FMRP was used. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C shows the general expression profile of the FMRP in the vertical section of adult rat retina. The immunoreaction (IR) of the FMRP was mainly observed in the inner retina, and the labeling was diffusely distributed throughout the full thickness of the retina, including the inner nucleus layer (INL), GC layer (GCL), and outer plexiform layer (OPL) but not the inner plexiform layer (IPL). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D shows that no signal was detectable when the primary antibody for FMRP was omitted. Compared with the general IR of the FMRP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, great differences were found in the expression of the antibody between them, and no FMRP-positive IR was found. Another negtive control, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse was used, and the same thing happened in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse, no significant FMRP-positive IR was found in this mouse (Supplementary Figure 2, is the negtive control for FMRP antibody). These findings prove that the labeling signals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C are FMRP-specific.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1">
<title>Colocalization of the FMRP in the INL</title>
<p>To determine the FMRP expression in the outer retina, or specifically, the fraction near the OPL, which actually is the synaptic connection layer, the colocalization of the FMRP with the HC and BC markers was performed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A,A′′ show the vertical sections of the rat retina double-immunolabeled with the antibodies against the FMRP and CB, a marker for rodent HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As revealed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A′′, the merged image of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A,A′ in the INL labeling for the FMRP and CB, the CB-positive HCs were clearly stained by the FMRP, especially in the membrane. The BCs labeled with ChX10, a specific pan-BC marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] were uniformly ChX10-positive in the outermost portion of the INL but not in the axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B′). When the sections were co-stained with the FMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B′′), the soma of the BCs was prominently embedded within the membrane. Thus, the BCs were also expressed FMRP especially in the cytoplasm, and possibly associated with the plasma membrane.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the inner part of the INL, as shown in the vertical section of a rat retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), the FMRP has a clear expression in this region. According to their positions and shapes, these FMRP-positive cells could be ACs, displaced ACs, or GCs. ACs are composed of numerous subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Special markers for the different subtypes of ACs were used to determine the identity of FMRP-labeled ACs.</p>
<p>The GABAergic ACs are observed to constitute the majority of ACs in the mammalian retina, and they include dopaminergic and cholinergic ones stained by TH and ChAT, respectively. Thus, the double-labeling experiments were performed to explore the identities of the neurons immunolabeled by the FMRP in the inner retina. Intriguingly, GABAergic drugs (e.g., baclofen) were examined for neurodevelopmental disorders, which prominently include the FXS and related autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>The GABARs are expressed in the retina, which is largely a neural tissue, and the GABAergic ACs constitute approxiamtely half of all those in the mammalian retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] labeled by GAD 65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, the anti-GAD 65 antibodies were used to label the GABAergic ACs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A,A′′ show the micrographs of a vertical section of the rat retina double labeled by the antibodies against GAD 65 and FMRP, respectively. The peripheral cytoplasm of the scattered cells in the INL (arrows) labeled by GAD 65 were GABAergic ACs. The numerous neuronal processes of these cells in the IPL were also labeled by GAD 65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A′). As shown in the merged image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A′′) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A (labeling for FMRP) and 3A′, most of the GABAergic cells in the INL were co-labeled by FMRP. Therefore, the presence of the colocalization of FMRP and GAD 65 confirmed that FMRP is expressed in GABAergic ACs.</p>

<p>The GABAergic ACs constitute the majority of ACs in the mammalian retina, include dopaminergic and cholinergic ones. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B′ shows a TH-labeled dopaminergic AC (arrow) in an adult rat retinal section, which is located in the inner part of the INL and emits its process mainly into the outmost border of the IPL. As shown in the merged image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B′′) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B,B′, the somata of the TH-positive cell were strongly colocalized (arrow) with FMRP. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the somata of the ChAT-labeled cholinergic ACs were situated either in the INL (arrow) or in the GCL (arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C′) and their processes forming two distinct narrow fluorescence bands in the IPL. Thus, somata of these cholinergic ACs, including in the GCL, were FMRP positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C,C′′), but their processed bands were FMRP-negative.</p>

<title>Colocalization of FMRP in the GCL</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, the cells in the GCL that were labeled by FMRP could be the GCs or displaced ACs. To clarify these cells, a double-labeling experiment was further conducted with FMRP and Brn3a, a specific GC marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A,A′′) revealed that the Brn3a-positive cells in the GCs expressed FMRP because the two label colors (somata, stained red by Brn3a; membranes, stained green by FMRP) perfectly fit into each other. However, some Brn3a-positive cells were not labeled (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A,A′′), and these cells could be the displaced ACs or Brn3a-negative GCs.</p>
<p>The intrinsically photosensitive retinal GCs (ipRGCs) are a special GC subtype that accounts for a small number of GCs involved in setting the suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and they are Brn3a-negative GCs. Melanopsin polyclonal antibodies were used for labeling the ipRGCs. The anti-melanopsin experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C′) demonstrated that melanopsin-positive GCs only accounted for a small population of the GCs and that the fluorescence appeared in the membrane and the cytoplasm of the ipRGCs. The double-labeling experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B,B′′) with FMRP and melanopsin showed that the FMRP-stained cells found within the GCLs were also positive for melanopsin. That is, FMRP was also expressed in the ipRGCs, especially in the soma of the ipRGCs.</p>

<title>Colocalization of FMRP in the Müller cells</title>
<p>From the panoramic distribution of the FMRP, we observed regularly arrayed fiber-like processes and trunks spanning the entire neural retina, with their characteristic end-feet in the GCL, which corresponds with the distribution of the Müller cells. Therefore, CRALBP was used to mark the rat Müller cells, including the processes and somata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C,C′′, the overlay of the corresponding paired images of the double labeling of the FMRP and CRALBP appeared yellowish in the vertical sections of rat retina. The FMRP was also expressed in the soma of the Müller cells (arrows), but the main trunks, the distinguishable parallel processes, and the end-feet in the GCL could not be labeled with the FMRP.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The FMRP is an mRNA-binding regulator encoded by the <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene. The FMRP was detected in the retina in previous experiments, but its localizations and functions have not yet been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In this work, we demonstrated that the FMRP was expressed diffusely in the inner and outer rat retina, especially in the INL and GCL, through immunohistochemistry doubled-labeling experiments. According to its location, we speculated that it could be involved in the transmission and integration of visual signals to some extent.</p>
<p>According to the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], FMRP is detected in photoreceptors inner/outer segments, but not clear in the soma. Based on our results, the FMRP was expressed in HCs (marked by CB) and BCs (marked by ChX10) in the INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). GABAergic neurons (marked by GAD 65) were also labeled by the FMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A′′). The FMRP IRs were observed in almost all dopaminergic neurons (marked by TH) and cholinergic ACs (marked by ChAT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B′′,C′′) as well as in GCs (marked by Brn3a) and ipRGCs (marked by melanopsin) in the GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A′′,B′′). The Müller cells, which were stained by CRALBP, were also co-labeled with the FMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C′′). The schematic diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> summarizes the colocalization of the FMRP in rat retina.</p>

<p>FMRP is clearly expressed in somata of HCs and BCs, definitely in the process of BCs. In addition, somata of GABAergic ACs, including dopaminergic and cholinergic ACs, somata of GCs, MCs and ipRGCs are FMRP-positive (all in green). The dendrites of BCs in the OPL are not labeled by FMRP (all in gray). Because of diffuse labeling in the OPL and IPL, terminals and dendrites of photoreceptors, processes of ACs and dendrites of HCs and GCs may be FMRP-positive (all in yellow). Abbreviations: C, cone; Ch, cholinergic AC; DA, dopaminergic AC; dCh, displaced cholinergic AC; GABA, GABAergic AC; MC, Müller cell; R, rod.</p>

<p>BCs are intermediate neurons in the signaling pathway of the mammalian vision system. They receive signal inputs from the photocatalyst (cones and rods) and transmit them to the non-dendritic cells and GCs. In conclude, BCs play a key role in the processing of visual information and the longitudinal transmission of information, after the integration of the information. Retinal HCs have an important role in the processing of visual information and the transverse transmission of information. We speculate that the FMRP may be involved in the retinal information processing in different ways, probably by modulating the radial flow of visual signals and the lateral interaction mediated by BCs and HCs, as visual sensory impairments have been described in mental deficiency (MD) and ASD, including FXS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This protein has been proved to be ubiquitously produced in mammalian tissues with high levels in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and localized predominantly in cytosolic light and heavy membranes. Furthermore, the retina is part of the central nervous system with a common embryonic origin, the mechanisms in the signal transmission from outer to inner retina were described in the ERGs of the <italic>Fmr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and were shown to have very early onset in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p>
<p>In fact, MD and ASD have been linked to brain dysfunction caused by axonal development and maturation of dendritic spines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] that lead to synaptic defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. At present, impaired perception is attributed to changes in the brain's phenotype. According to researches, in patients with FXS, visual integration is particularly affected, with changes in temporal processing capabilities, reduced high-frequency visual stimulation contrast sensitivity, and sensitivity to dynamic and static images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. These visual sensory defects are related to the immature development of neurons in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], especially in the main visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. So far, no data on the retinal perception light signal has been collected in patients with MD, ASD, and FXS. Although the retinal conduction pathway is localized in the cerebral cortex, the retina is part of the central nervous system and shares a neurodevelopmental origin with the mesencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Therefore, retinal and brain nerve cells show great similarities in neurotransmitters, highly differentiated neuron configurations and functional procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Based on these similarities, we speculate that the perception function of the retina itself may change accordingly.</p>
