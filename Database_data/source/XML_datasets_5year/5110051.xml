<abstract>
<p>There is a growing concern in the ethics literature and among policy makers that
de-identification or coding of personal data and biospecimens is not sufficient for
protecting research subjects from privacy invasions and possible breaches of
confidentiality due to the possibility of unauthorized re-identification. At the same
time, there is a need in medical science to be able to identify individual patients.
In particular for rare disease research there is a special and well-documented need
for research collaboration so that data and biosamples from multiple independent
studies can be shared across borders. In this article, we identify the needs and
arguments related to de-identification and re-identification of patients and research
subjects and suggest how the different needs may be balanced within a framework of
using unique encrypted identifiers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In an era of genomics, rapid technological advances, and globalization there are new
challenges for protecting the identity and the privacy of the patient and balancing
privacy interests against the needs of particular patient groups or societal
interests; specifically for patients with rare diseases. These developments have
resulted in a rapid increase in the volume of data collection and secure data-sharing
platforms. In contrast, individuals increasingly are making their personal
information available in social networking and globally, especially in the case of
rare diseases, to access improved diagnosis, inform themselves of management and
therapy options and to access clinical trials. From the health services perspective,
additional safeguards are required to protect confidentiality and patient privacy but
without restricting access to improved services, as these new advances facilitate the
free flow and sharing of data between different organizations and across
international boundaries. In particular, there is a growing concern in the ethics
literature and among policy makers that de-identification or coding of personal data
and biospecimens is not sufficient for protecting research subjects from privacy
invasions and possible breaches of confidentiality due to the possibility of
re-identification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>As pointed out by Tabor <italic>et al</italic>, some bioethics research and consent
discussions tend to focus on identifiability as a harm in itself, rather than on the
potential subsequent harms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> This emphasis may lead to an imbalance between different
interests in the ethical assessment where different kinds of potential harms as well
as benefits need to be balanced against each other. As argued previously, research
subjects have interests at the beginning of the research, for example, on being
informed about the purpose, expected benefits and risks of harm, as well as during
the process of research, for example, preservation of confidentiality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> They also have interests related to the end of the
research line, reaping the fruit of research in terms of new, improved and safer
medical treatment. Consequently, they have an interest in committing to the widest
possible access and most effective use of data and biosamples among researchers as
being conducive to those ends. Accordingly, ethical assessments related to data and
biobank management in research need to move beyond the narrow focus of
identifiability and acknowledge and balance the potential harms and benefits in a
broader context. An important primary task then is to explore why it is important to
identify individual research subjects, that is, that a given data set refers to one
specific individual, entailing the possibility to distinguish between data belonging
to different individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of this paper is to discuss the need to protect the confidentiality of
research participants and the need to make them identifiable to facilitate medical
treatment and/or for biomedical research.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>The importance of protecting privacy</title>
<p>The two key elements of privacy are (i) that an individual has access to a secluded
private sphere and (ii) that each individual is free to decide who will have access
to this sphere, for example, to private information or to a private
space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Invasion of privacy can lead
to injustice through unfairly discriminatory use of personal information though an
individual may be harmed merely by having exposed to the public gaze what they would
prefer to be private.</p>
<p>Respect for privacy is a means of respecting an individual but it can also be
instrumental to establish trust, for example, in medical research contexts. In the
context of data sharing, as we discuss in this paper, privacy is to be respected by
information and consent procedures and protected by confidentiality procedures. In
this paper, we argue that the use of a unique identifier to enable wide data sharing
is a proportionate and responsible means of balancing privacy interests with
important goods that data sharing is likely to achieve.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>The importance of identifying individuals</title>
<p>In order to be able to accurately diagnose; classify the genetic of rare diseases,
and to address the complexity of managing many of these diseases there is a need for
good knowledge and a reliable high quality of data. A critical component in building
the knowledge and evidence is the need for large volume of clinical data collected
and biosamples from affected individuals and their families. These collections enable
genotype–phenotype studies to understand how particular genetic changes, that
is, the genotype, produce the different disease characteristics we see clinically,
that is, the phenotype and how other genes moderate or otherwise the pathology of a
disease. This is particularly important in rare diseases where the phenotype results
often from a single genetic change. The rarity of the condition is particularly
powerful from a clinical perspective because it provides a very high degree of
clarity of the genotype–phenotype relationship, and the biological pathways
involved; but equally the rarity also represents a barrier to diagnosis and discovery
as there are limited data due to the relatively small numbers of affected
individuals. Consequently, there is a special and well-documented need for research
collaboration so that data and biosamples from multiple independent studies can be
shared across borders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> The two data sets of
clinical data and biospecimen data are critical for understanding the pathogenesis
and the management of diseases, both common and rare. In relation to empowering
clinical diagnosis of diseases and clinical discovery of disease mechanisms, and
possible therapies, there are several scenarios where the absence of a
re-identification method such as a unique identifier, of data or samples potentially
put patients at risk. There is a risk of not reaching scientific objectives in
research projects, because data cannot be connected on an individual patient level.
Not reaching clinical studies objectives because of insufficient scientific evidence
may also put patients at risk by prolonging the period for diagnosis and the options
for treatment. Data sets of different experiments and samples of the same patients
are held by different research organizations such as samples held at a biobank of
university X, clinical or genetic data from a natural history study or registry with
hospital Y and biomarker data with research lab Z. Having different organizations
involved, including cross border, is a common situation in clinical research for rare
diseases. To fully exploit unanticipated, out-of-the normal signals in the biomarker
results, the researcher (z) would need to have access to clinical and genetic data
(y) of a particular participant from the hospital Y and be in a position to request
another sample (x) of the same participant from the biorepository X. In the absence
of a re-identification method such as a unique identifier, this research question may
remain unanswered. Alternatively, the research needs to be re-done that may not be
feasible based on costs and participant/sample availability without access to
shared data and resources across borders. In addition, feeding back individual-level
results to participants or inclusion in follow-up research may be impossible without
a secure way of re-identification.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Identifying individuals while protecting confidentiality</title>
<p>The basic rationale of a unique identifying system is that a medical researcher puts
identifying information about a research participant into a client application that
in turn sends encrypted information to a server application, which then returns a
generated unique identifier for that individual. A unique identifier for research
purposes is a random sequence of characters that is unique to each research
participant, regardless of the study, without exposing personally identifiable
information. It should also be observed that with such a system ‘personal
data' in the legal sense is still being processed; and thus, the usual
safeguards such as consent and ethics approval must be observed. Identifiers, known
as Global Unique Identifiers or GUIDs, for example, NDAR GUID,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> GRDR GUID
(https://grdr.ncats.nih.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=113&amp;Itemid=129)
and HDI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> are meant primarily to
facilitate the following patient data in a larger setting. A research network
involved in autism research has recently demonstrated how such a system (GUID) may be
set up in order to achieve a favourable balance between the competing goals of
distinguishing individuals, collecting accurate information for matching and
protecting confidentiality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> The GRDR GUID
facilitates also linking biospecimens and the patient clinical information in GRDR by
linking the GUID to the specimen of the same participants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncats.nih.gov/grdr" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://ncats.nih.gov/grdr</ext-link>).</p>
<p>A similar system is operated by the European Huntington's Disease Network
(EHDN) to generate unique IDs for participants in their studies including the
international observational study REGISTRY.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Across participating sites, the algorithm for generating that
ID is the same. This means that the same ID is generated irrespective of where a
given individual takes part in the study. Thus, a participant cannot take part in a
study more than once. In addition, the HDID identifier allows the site that enrols
the participant to identify that participant at the annual follow-up visit. Further,
the same algorithm has been used in other HD studies, for instance
TRACK-HD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> This HDID identifier
means it is possible to merge the data of REGISTRY and TRACK-HD. The same is true for
the recently launched global HD observational study Enroll-HD (www.enroll-hd.org).
Participants who already took part in REGISTRY keep their unique identifier in
Enroll-HD. Once they have consented for Enroll-HD, all data in REGISTRY can be merged
with the Enroll-HD database.</p>
<p>Importantly, these systems will generate a unique ID for each participant, if the
identifiable information (or the hash code) is correctly transmitted. The system does
not retain any personal, identifiable data of the participant, but will recognize
whether an ID is requested for the same individual based on the same identifiable
data that are required (from the submitter) to generate the ID. We will not go deeper
into technical details in this paper, but when setting up systems like this, one has
to be sensitive to the possibility that the process of determining which personal
identifiers are used to create the unique identification may touch on social,
cultural and ethical sensitivities for the research participants. So even though
breaches of confidentiality may be avoided there may be other ethical sensitivities
to be managed. In the referred autism linkage study, the coordinators experienced
significant resistance from subjects in collecting some kinds of personal identifying
information, for example, a mother's maiden name and government issued
identifier (usually social security number). Upstream consultation with patient
organizations can be very useful in facilitating open and informative dialogue, help
to identify potential sensitivities and to enable a meaningful informed consent
process.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>The risk of re-identification</title>
<p>There have been several efforts to demonstrate that re-identification of individuals
following the sharing of anonymised data is possible by using publicly available
databases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Gymrek relied on publicly accessible Internet resources in
order to show that a combination of a surname with other types of data, such as age
and state, can be used to triangulate data and thus reveal the identity of the
target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Arguments like these have
been used in order to substantiate calls for regulatory changes and policy
recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> However, as was shown in
a recent systematic review of re-identification attacks (see below) on health data,
there are reasons to proceed with caution and to wait for more nuanced accounts
before changing policies and regulatory frameworks. It should be remembered, as
argued above, that too strict legal regulatory requirements to maintain anonymity may
be detrimental to research where maximum benefit from data may only be achieved by
distinguishing individuals within the data set.</p>
<p>Searching through 1522 reports of demonstrated re-identifications, El Emam <italic>et
al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> concluded that the overall
success rate for all re-identification attacks was approximately 26 and 34%
for health data. However, the confidence interval around these estimates was large,
partly because many of the attacks were on small databases. In addition, not all of
these examples were using current standards for de-identification, such as the USA
Safe Harbor standard or the statistical standard specified in the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
We should not be so alarmed whether databases are easily hacked due to negligence
regarding the de-identification or coding measures used; as this is to be expected.
Of more concern are the serious breaches of existing standards that these databases
did not employ the adequate measures to protect participants in the first place; this
is the matter for serious concern. El Emam <italic>et al.</italic> found only two studies
that succeeded in re-identification when the original data were de-identified in
accordance with HIPAA standards. One of these attacks was on health data with the
success rate in terms of percentage of records re-identified being 0.013%,
which may be considered low. Some of the issues in the policy discussions on
re-identification emanate from the deliberate efforts that have been made to identify
individuals accessing data associated with queries made through internet services,
which are not comparable to the systems described here. When the New York Times
reported on the ability to identify a woman it was only possible because her queries
included her town name and her personal name (ibid. p.6). It should also be observed
that a majority of the demonstration attacks were made by highly qualified experts in
the fields of computer science, and they were made for demonstration purposes, not in
order to use the information.</p>
<p>El Emam <italic>et al</italic> conclude that it would be prudent for data custodians to use
existing standards for de-identification while applying due diligence in prohibiting
re-identification attempts as part of data-sharing agreements, providing
accountability for data custodian's actions. However, as they assert, this may
be appropriate for health data records and databases; regarding genomic information
there is need for further analyses where the potential of combining genomic, omic and
environmental information for identification of individuals has not yet been
sufficiently explored.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Risk of harm</title>
<p>A number of potential harms have been associated with the collection and exchange of
sensitive personal data. It has been suggested that any re-identification may
potentially harm study participants because it will release information on individual
disease risks into the public domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup>
Data subjects might then become vulnerable to the consequences of detrimental genetic
information being accessible by insurance companies or employers. Lunshof <italic>et
al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> suggest that intrusion on
privacy can cause harm to social position and opportunities, to personal and family
status, for example, identification of an anonymous sperm donor, and to self-image
and perception by others. A breach of confidentiality is unlawful, in most
jurisdictions, and may also be construed as a personal harm but the issue is rather
complex. In Sweden, there is a law requiring consent from a proband in order to
contact a genetic relative, for example, to inform about a risk of breast cancer (Law
on Genetic Integrity 2006:351). Also, even the referring physician will not get data
of genetic testing necessary for further treatment strategies (for instance like
cancer or cardiomyopathies) if the patient does not allow it explicitly. Ordinarily,
this does not constitute any problem since genetic relatives care for each other or
the patient has an interest that his treating physician gets this information and
thus allows such contacts. However, there may be exceptions to these moral bonds
within a family and if the proband does not allow it, the doctor is bound by law not
to tell. In this case breaking the confidentiality agreement may, arguably, lead to
decreased risk of harm to others. In the United Kingdom, disclosures are also
permissible if the person consents to them but a breach of confidentiality may also
be lawful without consent where there is a sufficiently strong public interest at
stake thus potentially avoiding a replication of the well-known USA case of Tarasoff
in which a psychiatrist failed to breach confidentiality and warn a woman who was
killed by one of his patients who had specifically threatened her.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> From a consequentialist perspective, whether a
breach of confidentiality is good or bad is then an open question.</p>
<p>Broken promises and mistrust may also lead to harm. For instance, if a researcher
informs an individual study participant that no one will get access to the personal
data except the researchers, and the individual later learns that it is not possible
to give such a guarantee this may lead to decreased trust and this may in turn lead
to harmful consequences, for example, that study participants start opting out of
scientific studies. For these reasons, the proposal by Lunshof <italic>et al</italic> that
one should not promise more than one can keep and that the rapid development in
genetics and bioinformatics calls for an <italic>open consent</italic>, for example, being
open to study participants that there is no guarantee of non-identification, was
appropriate and timely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> They conclude,
rightly in our view, that veracity and transparency should be the leading principles
in modern research on genotype–phenotype interaction. Thus, research
participants must be informed and understand that although all measures will be taken
to secure the data and protect the privacy of the individual, there is no 100%
guarantee, and there is a small risk that the identity of one individual may be
revealed by outsider hackers.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge (personal communication) that patients with rare diseases do
acknowledge this risk and are keen to make personal decisions based on their
understanding of risks and benefits. Many patients with rare and ultra-rare disease,
where a firm clinical or genetic diagnosis is elusive, predictions on inheritance,
prognosis and life expectancy cannot be made and treatments are unavailable, consider
identification as a minor risk and display their personal information freely on the
internet and social media. If children are affected by the rare disease, these
decisions will be made by their parents or guardians. In contrast, patients who are
pre-symptomatic carriers of a genetic fault that predisposes them to develop a rare
condition, but do not show overt signs of the condition and do not have any impact on
their life quality, may feel that the risk of identification out-weighs the benefits
for research. An important issue in order to maintain trust and be honest to
patients, in our view, is how to consent participants. Consent is a two part process.
Part one is providing the participants with all the information about the study and
making sure they understate that. For example, participants need clear information
about the type, the purpose of the research. The participants must understand that
participating in a research does not mean getting treatment. They also need to know

<p>The second part of the consent is the signature itself, where they sign to agree to

</sec>
<sec>
<title>The need to balance benefits and harms</title>
<p>Hypothetically, it is possible that on first sight, study participants may prefer
strong protections of their right to privacy and to autonomy in the sense of making
decisions in matters that directly concern them, for example, excluding secondary
uses of data and samples without a re-consent, placing strict limits on sharing data
and samples or prohibiting unique identifiers. However, on closer inspection, if they
are informed about the benefits of sharing and being able to use multiple data and
sample collections with the possibility to distinguish individuals, and the costs of
re-consenting (or the cost of re-running the research and recollecting the samples
and data), they may reconsider.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup>
Responsible ethical deliberation need to take into consideration a more comprehensive
and broader evaluation balancing the options, both the benefits and costs of acting
as well as the benefits and costs of not acting, or of acting in another way. Such
broad and comprehensive approaches are not always reflected in the ethics and policy
literature on re-identification. As argued by von Wright, to get access of something
X that one desires increases one's welfare on the condition that one is
informed about the causal relations and consequences both of the totality where X is
part as well of the totality where not-X instead of X is part.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Informed preferences are more valuable than
non-informed, something we will get back to when we later refer to the empirical
literature on privacy.</p>
<p>Wrongings in the sense of not being able to keep promises may be prevented by
veracity and transparency as leading principles in information and consent
procedures. The risk of some harms may be minimized by legislative measures. An
essential part of the public trust in medical research using genetic and other kinds
of sensitive medical information may depend on patients and research subjects knowing
that third parties are prohibited by law from requesting, or inquiring about, genetic
or medical information from an individual, with the exception of specified medical
situations. This is the case in Sweden. According to Swedish legislation, there has
been a shift of attention from putting cumbersome restrictions on research to prevent
unauthorized use to making such use in itself unlawful. The law on genetic integrity
that came into effect 1 July 2006 laid down that nobody may stipulate as a condition
for entering into an agreement, that another party should undergo a genetic
examination or submit genetic information about themselves. There should also be a
general prohibition to the effect that without support in law, genetic information
may not be sought after or used by anyone other than the person that the information
is about. This applies even if the person concerned has given his or her consent to
such an investigation or use, but not if they themselves have requested it.</p>
<p>The proposed prohibition is not to be applicable to genetic information that is
sought for medical purposes, for scientific or genealogical research or to obtain
evidence in legal proceedings. For criminal investigations and for insurance
purposes, there is regulation in place. Illegitimate requests of or uses of
information may still be a problem, but this risk is minimized since such actions
will, according to this law, constitute criminal offences. A scale of penalties that
includes fines or a term of imprisonment up to 6 months will enforce the proposed
prohibitions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Legislation like this
and similar legally binding agreements in sharing and access documents may minimize
the risk of harm related to unauthorized use. The remaining risks of harm should be
balanced against the expected benefits.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>How concerned are patients and the general public?</title>
<p>The literature with concerned scientists, ethicists, lawyers and policy makers is
growing almost exponentially in the field of re-identification and privacy. The
question is whether these concerns are a true reflection of the potential research
participants'? There are a growing number of studies investigating how
individuals of different ages look upon and manage risks related to the use of the
internet and social media.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Privacy
concerns have also been the focus of many, mostly qualitative studies related to
health care and hospital settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Several
studies across different medical fields show that patients understand very well that
doctors need to share patient information with other doctors involved in their
treatment, but this does not include administrative staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> The increased use of
electronic medical records has inspired a growing number of proposals for technical
solutions in order to make information accessible while protecting privacy
interests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Issues related to access
to medical records for research, for example, in primary health care have been focus
for some smaller studies, indicating that patients are not aware about the need for
this research but, when told, were concerned about the leakage of information to
unauthorized persons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Regarding what kind
of information and consent procedure that is appropriate for research using medical
records the results are not conclusive. Some want to give explicit consent while
others are satisfied with information and the possibility to opt-out.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Clinical anecdotal evidence indicates that
patients with rare diseases are often aware of the fact that there are only limited
resources available to carry out research for their particular condition. Therefore,
they often altruistically donate their personal time, data and samples to research,
and expect that the utility of these gifts is maximized for public good. They are
often surprised to hear that data from one research organization cannot be shared
with another limiting the conclusions drawn from the research or requiring data
and/or samples to be collected again.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of registries and databases with medical and personal information
there are only a few studies. A large and well-designed study of values related to
this was done in Great Britain in 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup>
The background of the study was the perceived increase in regulatory requirements and
demands of specific informed consent from ethical review boards and data inspection
authorities in relation to the use of personal data for research, a request made in
the name of protection if privacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> In all, 2872
individuals in a representative sample of the British population, 97% of those
participating in the investigations made by the national statistics bureau in March
and April that year, responded to the survey (response rates 62% (March) and
69% (April), respectively). A majority of the British general public did not
regard the use of coded data from the national cancer registry for research as an
intrusion of privacy. Seventy-two percent did not think that provision of name,
address and postal number or receiving a letter with a request for participation in a
research project constituted a breach of their privacy. The study draws the
conclusion that the increased regulatory requirements are not in accord with what the
general public thinks on these matters.</p>
<p>In a study about attitudes to research among participants in a rehabilitation
registry in United States, researchers wanted to see whether there were differences
in attitudes depending on ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup>
There was a difference but not that much. In all, 72% of the Afro-Americans
and 62% of the white population were positive to participate in registry-based
research. As indicated there is need of more studies in order to see whether the
protection of privacy suggested in the literature harmonizes with the attitudes of
patients and the general public. A deficiency with the current studies that then
needs to be acknowledged is that questions are seldom formulated in a way so that one
can see how an individual balances different preferences against each other, for
example, protection of privacy against the prospect of successful research needed to
provide new knowledge and treatment. The need to incorporate different views means
that a robust and reproducible method of eliciting preferences for risk of harm is
needed: benefit trade-offs must be used to ensure that the resulting values are
sufficiently robust to use the information to guide the future development of
regulatory policies in this area.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Re-identification may potentially bring harmful consequences for the individual, for
example, related to insurance and discrimination. On the other hand, as has been
demonstrated, there are clear benefits in terms of patient safety with regard to
diagnosis and treatment as well as possibilities to generate new and improved
treatment through research provided that one can distinguish between individuals by
identification. We suggest that open and transparent information and consent
processes, not promising too much and the use of safe unique personal identifiers,
for example, the GUID or HD identifiers, represent a morally favourable balance,
leading to the following recommendations for governance of biobank and data
research.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that there are <italic>potential</italic> risks associated with the
handling of personal data for medical purposes. The research community must therefore
show itself equal to the task of managing those risks and deserving the trust of
those whose data it utilizes. The need for a global alliance of responsible data
sharing is now well recognized (World Wide Web Consortium), but there must be an
ongoing commitment to high professional standards and to the training of the next
generation of researchers in the ethics of research.</p>
<p>Adequately informed consent of research participants is one mechanism which
contributes to responsible data sharing, but ethical access to, sharing, and use of
data are compatible with broad consent, and even no consent, where the justification
is ethical, the use lawful and the processing of data is conducted under demonstrably
high standards of governance. We have argued for the necessity of using a unique
identifier where data from multiple sources are to be accessed, shared and exchanged.
In most cases, the use of personal data in research produces benefits which far
outweigh the risks though it is important to have an ongoing dialogue with patients
and the wider public to ensure that researchers are aware of their concerns and that
the public gain an informed understanding of the risks and benefits of
research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> Researchers should show
willing to facilitate upstream engagement with research participants and include
governance structures, which reflect the patient/public perspective (could refer
to TREAT-NMD or other project examples). As data collection and sharing becomes ever
more complex and international there will be a need for harmonized ethical, legal and
regulatory approaches and these must recognize the necessary role of a unique
identifier to responsible data sharing.</p>

<title>Terminology</title>
<sec>
<title>Identified data</title>
<p>Data labelled or linked to the individual in a way that makes them directly
identifiable (name and surname or social security numbers).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title><italic>Coded</italic> data (may be single or double coded)</title>
<p>Personally identifying information is removed and replaced with a code. In the
case of <italic>double-coding</italic>, two or more codes are assigned to the same
donor's data held in different data sets, with the key connecting the codes
back to the donor's direct identifiers held by a third party and not
available to the researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Anonymized data</title>
<p>Data that have been identified earlier or coded, but the identification, or the
code and the code key have been destroyed, and thus there is no longer any link to
the individual.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Anonymous data</title>
<p>There are no links to the individual donor, the data and biospecimens were never
associated with identifiers, and the risk of identification of individuals is very
low. There may be general descriptions such as ‘man, aged 50–55 years,
cholesterol level 240 mg per 100 ml'.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Re-identified data</title>
<p>Data that were rendered anonymous but the identity has been retrieved by matching
the anonymous information of different databases.</p>
