<abstract>
<p id="P2">The function of cortical GABAergic interneurons is largely determined by their integration into specific neural circuits, but the mechanisms controlling the wiring of these cells remain largely unknown. This is particularly true for a major population of basket cells that express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK). Here we found that the tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 is required for the normal integration of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells into cortical circuits. The number of inhibitory synapses made by CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells and the inhibitory drive they exert on pyramidal cells are severely reduced in conditional mice lacking ErbB4. Developmental disruption of the connectivity of these cells diminishes the power of theta oscillations during exploratory behavior, disrupts spatial coding by place cells, and causes selective alterations in spatial learning and memory in adult mice. These results suggest that normal integration of CCK+ basket cells in cortical networks is key to support spatial coding information in hippocampus.</p>

<body>
<p id="P3">The function of cortical networks relies on the precise interaction between pyramidal cells and interneurons. Interneurons are uniquely placed to orchestrate cortical activity in manifold ways due their great diversity, defined by a unique set of neurochemical, electrophysiological and morphological features<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. Accordingly, interneurons have adopted a division of labor within cortical circuits, through which distinct classes of interneurons specialize in innervating particular classes of neurons and, within them, targeting different subcellular compartments at precise time windows in reference to specific behavioral events or brain states<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>. Parsing the function of different classes of interneurons is therefore crucial for unveiling how the cerebral cortex encodes information.</p>
<p id="P4">Basket cells comprise a heterogeneous collection of interneurons that confine their synapses around the soma and primary dendrites of target neurons, thereby exerting a powerful control over their output. There are two main classes of basket cells, with distinct developmental origins and singular neurochemical and electrophysiological properties, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) fast-spiking basket cells and cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK+) regular spiking basket cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>. CCK+ basket cells are further subdivided in two main subtypes based on the mutually exclusive expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGlut3+) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Ref. 7</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">Several lines of evidence suggest that PV+ and CCK+ basket cells contribute differently to cortical operations. In the hippocampus, PV+ and CCK+ basket cells modulate different microcircuits by preferentially targeting pyramidal cells located in deep or superficial layers of the stratum pyramidale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. The fast dynamics and reliable release of PV+ basket cells make them suitable to operate as clockworks by actively generating fast network oscillations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>. In contrast, the relatively unreliable and asynchronous release of GABA by CCK+ basket cells suggests a weaker contribution to gamma rhythms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. Indeed, the precise contribution of CCK+ basket cells to cortical rhythms remains unknown. Current views suggest that they may contribute to place cell firing during theta oscillations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, but this hypothesis remains to be experimentally tested.</p>
<p id="P6">The molecular mechanisms controlling the wiring of basket cells in specific neural circuits are poorly understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. It has been previously shown that loss of the neuregulin receptor ErbB4 decreases the number of excitatory synapses received by PV+ basket cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. Here, we have generated <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants to investigate the function of this receptor in the connectivity of CCK+ basket cells. Because ErbB4 expression is restricted to some GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, this strategy also offered a unique opportunity to investigate the consequences of disrupting the development of CCK+ basket cells. In the past, the absence of unique markers for CCK+ basket cells has limited the functional interrogation of this population of interneurons to single cell analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>. Our results reveal that ErbB4 is required both for the normal wiring of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells. These developmental defects impair the normal inhibitory function of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells in the adult brain, decreases the power of theta oscillations during exploratory behavior, disrupts spatial coding by place cells, and causes selective alterations in spatial learning and memory deficits.</p>

<title>Basket CCK+ interneurons containing VGlut3 also express ErbB4</title>
<p id="P7">We observed that nearly half of the CCK+ interneurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal area express VGlut3 (46%), whereas only a small fraction of them contain VIP (16%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 is abundantly expressed among CCK+ interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>), but it is unclear whether only a particular subset of these cells expresses ErbB4. We found that ErbB4 was prominently expressed by CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons (72%), but only marginally expressed by CCK+/VIP+ (16%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c–f</xref> and data not shown). These observations therefore revealed that ErbB4 is enriched in the largest population of CCK+ basket cells, which also contain VGlut3.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Wiring defects in CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells lacking ErbB4</title>
<p id="P8">Others and we have previously shown that ErbB4 plays a prominent role in the development of the connectivity of fast spiking interneurons in the cerebral cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>. To examine the function of ErbB4 in the wiring of CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons, we generated CCK-specific conditional <italic>Erbb4</italic> mutants by breeding <italic>CCK-Cre</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> with mice carrying floxed <italic>Erbb4</italic> alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. As described before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <italic>CCK-Cre</italic> mice triggered recombination in the majority of CCK+/VGlut3+ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Consistently, we observed a prominent decrease in the number of CCK+ and VGlut3+ interneurons containing ErbB4 in the mutants compared to controls. As expected, expression of ErbB4 was maintained in interneurons lacking VGlut3 (putative PV+ interneurons) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig.2</xref>). We found that ErbB4 is dispensable for the generation and migration of cortical CCK+ interneurons, since the density and laminar organization of CCK+ cells in the hippocampus is similar between both genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">ErbB4 is required for the normal development of excitatory synapses onto fast spiking interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>. In the hippocampus, ErbB4 is also prominently clustered in the somatic proximal area of CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We quantified the density of excitatory presynaptic inputs (VGlut1+/PSD95+) impinging into the soma of CCK+ cells at the end of synaptogenesis (P30). We found a significant decrease in the number of VGlut1+/PSD95+ structures around the soma of these cells, but similar total density in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). These results indicate that CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons receive a reduced number of excitatory inputs in the absence of ErbB4.</p>
<p id="P10">We next examined whether ErbB4 plays a role in the establishment of the inhibitory synapses made by CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons. ErbB4 is present in about a quarter of the inhibitory synapses contacting the soma of pyramidal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, but PV+ basket cells do not require ErbB4 to make a normal complement of synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. One possible explanation is that ErbB4 is only present in synapses made by CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons. To test this hypothesis, we used antibodies for both VGlut3 and the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), which identifies somatic CCK+ axon terminals<underline><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, and</underline> quantified the number of VGlut3+/CB1+ boutons contacting the soma of CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). We found that the density of VGlut3+/CB1+ boutons targeting the soma of pyramidal cells was significantly reduced in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c–e</xref>). Similar reduction was observed in the CA3 region (data not shown). This analysis revealed that hippocampal CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells make fewer inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal cells in the absence of ErbB4.</p>
<p id="P11">Since VGlut3+/CB1+ terminals are also very abundant around the soma of PV+ interneurons in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1e,f</xref>), we hypothesized that ErbB4 might also be required for the development of these synapses. We found that PV+ fast spiking interneurons received significantly fewer VGlut3+ boutons in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants than in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g–j</xref>). In addition, we observed a decrease in total protein levels for GAD65, but not GAD67, in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Since GAD65 is particularly enriched in CCK+ interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, these observations reinforced the notion that CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells have important synaptic deficits in the absence of ErbB4.</p>
<p id="P12">We next explored whether the synaptic deficits observed at P30 were maintained in adult mice. At P60, we found a consistent reduction in the density of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cell boutons impinging onto both pyramidal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6a–d</xref>) and PV+ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6e–h</xref>) in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants. To further strengthen our conclusions, we filled VGlut3+ interneurons with neurobiotin in control and <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice and analyzed the density of varicosities per axon. We found a significant decrease in the density of neurobiotin-filled varicosities in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6i,j</xref>). Altogether, our results revealed that in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells have prominent wiring defects that begin during postnatal development and persist into adulthood.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Decreased inhibitory drive to pyramidal cells in CCK-specific Erbb4 mutants</title>
<p id="P13">We investigated the functional consequences of the abnormal connectivity of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells lacking ErbB4. To this end, we first recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) from individual CA1 pyramidal cells in acute slices from P60-70 control and <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We found that pyramidal cells of <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice exhibit a modest but significant decrease in sIPSC amplitude, with no significant changes in sIPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a–d</xref>). Moreover, we observed no apparent changes in the intrinsic properties of CCK+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary 7a</xref>). These findings indicated that basal inhibitory synaptic transmission is compromised in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants.</p>
<p id="P14">We reasoned that compensatory mechanisms and/or polysynaptic effects could mask a more vigorous synaptic transmission phenotype. To circumvent this problem, we directly assessed the function of CCK+ interneurons in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants using optogenetics. We injected the CA1 region of control and conditional mutants with adeno-associated viruses (AAV) carrying a conditional construct expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) fused to EYFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8a–d</xref>). Since CCK drives the expression of <italic>Cre</italic> in pyramidal cells as well as CCK+ interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, AAV injections led to ChR2 expression in both cell types, which precluded the exclusive activation of CCK+ interneurons. To overcome this limitation, we developed a strategy through which we could specifically examine the inhibition arising from infected CCK+ interneurons. First, we recorded from control and mutant ChR2+ pyramidal cells in voltage-clamp under GABAergic and glutamatergic blockade, obtaining I-V curves in response to 473nm photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8e–g</xref>). At a holding potential of +10 mV, direct ChR2 photocurrents were negative and modest for all pyramidal cells recorded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8e</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 21 cells, -59.1 ± 10.2 pA), which enable us to unequivocally distinguish them from CCK-light evoked positive synaptic GABAergic currents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8f</xref>). This observation held when splitting results by genotype (n = 15 control cells, 6 mutant cells), as there were no significant differences in photocurrent amplitude at +10 mV (Mann-Whitney U = 32, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05, Control median = -45 pA, <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> median = -60 pA). All subsequent optogenetic experiments were thus performed under glutamatergic receptor blockade, at a holding potential of +10 mV.</p>
<p id="P15">We then characterized light-evoked spiking in CCK+ interneurons to verify that photostimulation produced similar responses in both genotypes. Recordings were targeted to CCK+ cells in CA1 stratum radiatum, where the VGlut3+ population is enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3f-h</xref>), and revealed no effect of genotype on the number of spikes fired per stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e–g</xref>). We then recorded optogenetically-evoked IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). The peak amplitude of evoked IPSCs was significantly reduced in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants compared to controls, with multiple-comparisons testing revealing statistically-significant effects for photostimulation irradiances above and including 2 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). GABAzine completely abolished synaptic currents, confirming them to be GABAergic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8g</xref>). These results confirmed that the inhibitory input of CCK+ interneurons onto pyramidal cells is functionally impaired in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants. Under optogenetic stimulation at low illumination intensities, a mixture of successes and failures in spiking can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>, 0.23 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> irradiance), similar to minimal stimulation using electrodes. For a subset of pyramidal neurons, we were able to lower illumination intensity to a point where we correspondingly observed a mixture of successes and failures in IPSCs in an “all-or-none” pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8h inset, 8i, j</xref>). Successfully evoked synaptic currents under these conditions are interpreted as arising from a single action potential from one pre-synaptic neuron<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>. In the subset of pyramidal cells where minimal intensity IPSCs could be distinguished from the direct ChR2 photocurrent, we observed that the average peak amplitude of IPSCs was significantly lower in <italic>CCK-Cre;ErbB4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j</xref>). The frequency distribution of all such events also suggested a shift towards lower IPSC amplitudes in the mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8h–j</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrated that the inhibition of pyramidal cells by CCK+ interneurons is functionally impaired in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants.</p>
<p id="P16">To assess the impact of these defects on the activity of pyramidal cells, we next recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) in CA1 pyramidal cells from acute slices at P60-70. We observed that the activity of pyramidal cells is moderately disrupted in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Altogether, our findings demonstrate that synaptic deficits in the wiring of CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons caused by the loss of ErbB4 impair the inhibition of pyramidal cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Reduced hippocampal theta activity in CCK-specific <italic>Erbb4</italic> mutants</title>
<p id="P17">We next sought to investigate the impact of the observed deficits in vivo by recording hippocampal local field potential (LFP) in freely moving control and <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice. We implanted tetrodes in the dorsal hippocampus and recorded LFP during spontaneous exploration in a square open field arena. We found that <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants have a significant decrease in the power of delta and, most prominently, theta oscillations, with no significant changes in the theta/delta ratio, theta frequency, or power of high frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a–h</xref>). Since <italic>CCK-Cre</italic> mice do not drive recombination in the septum or brainstem pontine nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), two structures that influence theta activity in the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, the prominent decrease in the power of theta frequency observed in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants is likely caused by defects in cortical CCK+ interneurons. These observations revealed that developmental disruption of the wiring of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells alters hippocampal rhythms, most notably in the theta frequency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Spatial memory formation is altered in CCK-specific <italic>Erbb4</italic> mutants</title>
<p id="P18">We next performed a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate locomotor activity, anxiety responses and cognitive function in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants. We found no differences in locomotion or anxiety responses between both genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 10a–d</xref>). We also analyzed LFP in relation to several variables of motor behavior in control and <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice, and found no significant differences between both genotypes. These results suggested that the theta power deficits observed in the mutants are independent of the locomotor activity of the mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 10e–j</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">We next used the prepulse inhibition of the startle response test to analyze the ability of <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice to filter out unnecessary information. While the amplitude of the startle response was similar between both genotypes, <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants failed to inhibit their startle response when the pulse was preceded by a weaker stimulus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). These results suggested that mutant mice have deficits in sensorimotor gating or attention.</p>
<p id="P20">To begin examining cognitive capabilities in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants, we used the one-trial novel object recognition and object location tasks. These tests explore hippocampal function and are based on the natural preference of mice towards novelty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). We found that total exploration times during the test phase and discrimination indices for a novel object were similar for both genotypes in both tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c–f</xref>). In object location tasks, however, conditional mutants were less capable to discriminate a displaced object compared to control mice, independently of the retention interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d,f</xref>). These experiments suggest that the impaired wiring and function of CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons do not interfere with recognition memory in general, but disrupt the ability of conditional mutants to recognize novel spatial configurations, a task that is critically dependent on hippocampal function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>.</p>
<p id="P21">To investigate to what extent spatial information encoding is affected in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice, we assessed spatial reference memory using the Morris water maze (MWM). The acquisition phase and the probe test analysis failed to reveal prominent differences between both genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12a–f</xref>). However, closer examination revealed that whereas control mice switched from thigmotaxis to full exploration of the maze on the second day, <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice shifted to full exploratory behavior one day later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). This observation suggested that conditional mutants might have a delay in spatial learning.</p>
<p id="P22">To further explore spatial memory, we used the 8-arm radial maze. We first carried out experiments in a conventional version of the radial maze (3/8 baited arms, all arms remaining opened), assessing simultaneously reference and working memory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12g–i</xref>). In this task, reference memory errors (i.e., entries into an unbaited arm) and total errors (reference errors + entries into already visited arms) were higher and showed significance at day 3 in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12g,h</xref>). In contrast, working memory errors (re-entries into an arm) were not significantly different between controls and their mutant littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12i</xref>), which indicated that working memory might not be particularly affected in these mutants. Consistently, we did not observe prominent differences between controls and mutants in other working memory tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 11b,c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">We used two different automated 8-arm radial maze setups to further characterize memory impairments in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,f</xref>). We analyzed reference memory again by using a radial-maze task (3/8 baited arms) in which re-entries were prevented and found that, similar to our observations in the MWM, <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants showed a transitory delay of spatial learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). In contrast, long-term retention of spatial memory was not altered; mutant mice even made fewer errors than controls in the retention test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,e</xref>). Then, we evaluated short-term working memory with an experimental design that allowed us to manipulate the task demand on <italic>retention</italic> (“which arm was visited last”) and <italic>organization</italic> (update of successive spatial memories, avoiding interference from irrelevant memories) by using different inter-trial interval conditions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref> and Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). We observed that <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants have a selective impairment in the organization but not in retention aspects of spatial short-term memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f–h</xref>). These findings indicate that abnormal wiring and function of CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons do not affect short-term/working memory in general, but selectively disrupt an organizational component, necessary for the fast update of spatial memories. Collectively, our experiments demonstrated that <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice display deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning tasks that require encoding of spatial information and update of novel spatial information during short-term memory, but can consolidate and/or retrieve spatial information normally.</p>

<title>Defective place cells fields in CCK-specific <italic>Erbb4</italic> mutants</title>
<p id="P24">The previous results prompted us to investigate the characteristics of place cells in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> conditional mutants. We implanted tetrodes in the hippocampus and recorded the activity of single units during a pellet-chasing exploration task in the open field. We isolated single units from these recordings and selected those that met specific qualitative and quantitative criteria for place cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14</xref>). We observed that the majority of pyramidal cells displayed spatial selectivity in control mice, but not in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> conditional mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). Detailed analyses revealed that single units in the mutants have lower spatial coherence and spatial information per spike than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). In contrast, we found that the firing field area and firing rates of pyramidal neurons are increased in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e,f</xref>). Similar to our findings during spontaneous exploration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), we found a significant decrease in theta power between both groups, with no changes in theta/delta ratio or theta mean frequency (data not shown). To assess whether the distortion of theta activity could predict place cells properties, we correlated the theta power obtained during the pellet-chasing task with the mean spatial coherence. We found a significant correlation between both parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7g</xref>).</p>
<p id="P25">To investigate the stability of place cells in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice, baseline recordings were divided in two epochs, and pairwise correlations between the firing rate maps were performed for each cell within the same recording session (intra-trial). Place cell stability was significantly lower in conditional mutants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a–c</xref>). Consistently, we also found a higher percentage of unstable place cells in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>). In contrast, stability across different recording sessions (inter-trial) was not significantly different between both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8e</xref>). We also noticed that intra-trial stability strongly correlates with performance in the object-place recognition, which suggests that the behavioral abnormalities might be linked to place cell stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8f</xref>). Altogether, our results indicated that place cells exhibit lower spatial modulation in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants than in controls, which reveals a prominent role for CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons in circuits processing novel spatial configurations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P26">Understanding the role that specific classes of GABAergic interneurons play on cortical operations is essential to shed light on the organization of cortical microcircuits. The function of interneurons is largely determined by their spiking properties, synaptic features and specific connectivity, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes for different classes of interneuron. Here, we identified ErbB4 as an essential regulator of the wiring of CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons, a population of basket cells whose contribution to cortical function has remained elusive. Genetic manipulation of the normal connectivity of CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons reveals a critical role for these cells in the regulation of theta oscillatory activity and in the coding of spatial information in the hippocampus. Our findings thus demonstrate that normal integration of CCK+/VGlut3+ interneurons in cortical circuits is required for accurate spatial representations of the environment.</p>
<sec id="S9">
<title>ErbB4 is required for the wiring of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells</title>
<p id="P27">The fine-tuning of cortical networks is orchestrated by a collection of interneuron classes with distinctive neurochemical and electrophysiological properties and, most notably, axonal targets. Since the location of synaptic contacts largely determines the influence of interneurons on the postsynaptic neuron, it has been suggested that the elaborate organization of inhibitory inputs greatly increases the overall computational power of individual neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>. Basket cells comprise a major group of interneurons whose synapses surround the cell body and proximal dendrites of their postsynaptic targets, and therefore constitute particularly powerful regulators of the firing of principal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>. The two main classes of basket cells, PV+ fast spiking and CCK+ regular spiking basket cells, are distinctly wired in cortical circuits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>. Previous studies have shown that PV+ cells require ErbB4 to develop and maintain a normal number of excitatory inputs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. Here, we found that ErbB4 signaling is also required for the development of a normal complement of excitatory synapses in CCK+ basket cells, which suggests that at least some of the mechanisms controlling the wiring of basket cells are shared. In contrast, while PV+ basket cells do not seem to require ErbB4 to make synapses onto pyramidal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, we have found that loss of ErbB4 in CCK+ basket cells prominently decreases the number of synapses that these cells make and impair their ability to inhibit pyramidal cells. This finding is consistent with electron microscopy studies that revealed that ErbB4 is present in about a quarter of the inhibitory synapses contacting the soma of pyramidal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>.</p>

<title>Abnormal wiring of CCK+/VGlut3 basket cells disrupts theta oscillations</title>
<p id="P28">Different classes of cortical interneurons seem to contribute to information processing by timing the activity of specific neural networks and gating information flow in relation to specific behavioral states<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>. The introduction of new genetic means that provide unprecedented targeting specificity, together with the tools to manipulate interneuron activity in vivo, is greatly accelerating progress in the field<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>. Genetic manipulation of CCK+ interneurons, however, has proven difficult because CCK is also abundantly expressed in pyramidal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>. Due to the selective expression of ErbB4 in GABAergic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> conditional mutants represent a unique resource to examine the contribution of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells to cortical operations. While the developmental nature of the genetic manipulation reported here might lead to deficits that are not directly comparable to the acute probing of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells, our study offers important clues to the function of these interneurons.</p>
<p id="P29">Previous studies have shown that CCK+ basket cells in the hippocampus fire on the ascending theta phase, when pyramidal cell assemblies emerge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>. Conversely, these interneurons are weakly coupled to gamma oscillations in anesthetized rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>. In <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> conditional mutants, abnormal wiring of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells leads to decreased power of low frequency oscillations in freely moving animals during exploration, with no significant changes in gamma frequency. These deficits are likely due to defects in cortical CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells, because none of the main subcortical generators of theta activity – medial septum, pedunculopontine tegmentum and raphe nuclei<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> – are targeted in <italic>CCK-Cre</italic> mice. In contrast, CA1-projecting neurons in the entorhinal cortex are strongly innervated by CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, and so it is possible that defects in entorhinal CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells may also contribute to the phenotype described here.</p>

<title>CCK+/VGlut3 basket cells and spatial coding</title>
<p id="P30">The majority of hippocampal pyramidal cells discharge at very low frequency during spatial navigation, but when the animal enters into the place field of a specific unit, this neuron increase its firing more than a hundred times<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>. It has been hypothesized that CCK+ basket cells are well suited to enhance this contrast in firing rate during theta oscillations through a form of short-term plasticity called depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>. This involves the selective suppression of inhibition specifically in the terminals of CCK+ interneurons innervating the active place cell, while CCK+ interneurons continue to release GABA only to the majority of the silent pyramidal cells. This process is mediated by the spatially restricted action of endocannabinoids released by the active place cell, which act on CCK+ interneurons through presynaptic CB1 receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>. Our analysis suggests that defective wiring of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells leads to abnormal firing fields for place cells in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants. It is tempting to speculate that these defects are caused by the failure of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells to suppress the activity of neighboring pyramidal cells outside the field of the place cell. In addition, the reduced inhibitory control over PV+ interneurons observed in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutants may also contribute to the decreased spatial coherence and stability of place cells, because modulation of PV+ activity is linked to the precision of hippocampal spatial representations by place cells and indeed perisomatic inhibition is very effective in regulating spike timing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>. Alternatively, a potential alteration of synaptic weights across different subpopulations of cells might alter the necessary temporal dynamics for a stable spatial representation and other memory processes, including spatial remapping. We cannot rule out that deficits in CCK+/ErbB4+ interneurons in the entorhinal cortex and other parahippocampal regions contribute to the stability of the place cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>. At any rate, our results reinforce the notion that CCK+ interneurons modulate spatial coding by pyramidal place cells.</p>
<p id="P31">Our conclusions are reinforced by the observation that abnormal wiring of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells leads to important hippocampal-dependent behavioral alterations. <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> conditional mutants exhibit severe deficits in the object location test, which requires fast encoding, and in the radial maze working memory task with maximized organization demand, which requires fast encoding plus updating of spatial memories<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>. At least some of these defects are due to defective hippocampal function, because bilateral lesions in the entorhinal cortex do not affect object location tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, and the function of place cells has been linked to novelty associated with an object location<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>. We cannot exclude, however, that abnormal function of CCK+/VGlut3+ basket cells in other cortical areas contributes to some extent to the deficient coding of spatial information in the hippocampus and therefore to the behavioral abnormalities observed in <italic>CCK-Cre;Erbb4<sup>F/F</sup></italic> conditional mutants. Considering the links that exist between ErbB4 signaling and psychiatric disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, it will be interesting to explore how alterations in CCK interneurons might contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

For cell density analysis, CCK and VGlut3 cells were quantified on 40 μm brain sections using Neurolucida software. CCK is also expressed in pyramidal cells, which preclude the quantification of CCK+ interneurons located in the pyramidal cell layer using this technique. To overcome this problem, and given that pyramidal cells seemed to express lower levels of CCK mRNA than interneurons, we carried out experiments with a short exposure to the colorimetric reaction. By doing that, we were able to clearly identify putative CCK+ interneurons in the stratum pyramidale, stratum radiatum and stratum oriens. To confirm that we were detecting most of the interneurons, we also carry out experiments with a longer exposure. At least in the stratum radiatum and oriens, the density of CCK+ cell was the same with short or long exposures to the reaction. For the assessment of axonal synaptic density, we first identified the Neurobiotin-positive/VGlut3 positive neurons and followed up their axons. Axons were distinguished by their small diameter, tortuosity and presence of bouton-like varicosities. We confirmed that bouton-like varicosities contained VGlut3 staining. Then, we restricted our quantification to Neurobiotin-filled varicosities, since VGlut3 staining in the varicosities decreased as the axon penetrated deeper into the tissue. Confocal images were taken using a 100X objective 1.4 NA and Neurolucida software was used for the analysis. Density of varicosities was normalized to 100 μm segment of axon length in those CCK-cells in which more than 100 μm axon could be followed in the slice.</p>

Photostimulation intensity at the slice was systematically varied between 0.05 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> and 21.2 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, with 10-20 trials recorded per stimulation intensity. Recordings were targeted to EYFP-rich areas of CA1, indicating recombination of the conditional EYFP-ChR2 vector. Optogenetically-evoked spikes were recorded in fluorescently labeled CCK interneurons in stratum radiatum under current-clamp (in mM, 130 Gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Sodium Phosphocreatine, 2 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP and 0.4 Na-GTP) in order to allow neurobiotin (1mg/ml) labeling and post-recording confirmation of CCK immunoreactivity. Current-voltage curves for ChR2 photocurrents were obtained by recording from ChR2-expressing CA1 pyramidal neurons under voltage-clamp, in the presence of 40 μM D-APV and CNQX, as well as 20 μM GABAzine (Tocris). Optogenetically-evoked IPSCs were recorded from pyramidal neurons in voltage-clamp at a holding potential (+10 mV) that resulted in exclusively negative direct photocurrents, with 10 μM AM-251 being used to prevent depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>. Evoked IPSCs were detected within a 50 ms time-window after stimulus onset and the peak amplitude of the earliest IPSC was measured. Evoked IPSCs were readily distinguishable from spontaneous events due to their predictable and reliable trial-to-trial latency after stimulus onset. For minimal stimulation experiments, photostimulation intensity was reduced until no IPSCs could be evoked. At this point, stimulation intensity was increased until a combination of failures and consistent amplitude IPSCs could be observed. Under our experimental conditions this transition was sharp, with most cells showing a change from 0 to 60-70% successful trials within a 0.03 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> increment in irradiance.</p>

Mice were trained to swim to a submerged platform (14 cm diameter, 1 cm below the water surface) using visual cues placed distally (at least 1 m from the maze walls) on black curtains surrounding the maze. Data were collected with a videocamera fixed to the room’s ceiling and connected to a computerized tracking system (Viewpoint) located in an adjacent room. To assess performance, the escape latency, distance to the target, time spent on thigmotaxis, and swim speed were analyzed as outcome measures for each session with Ethovision XT software (Noldus).</p>
<p id="P48">In the acquisition training, mice were trained for 2 daily trials with a cutoff of 60 s. Once on the platform, they were allowed to remain 10 s on it. When mice did not find the platform, the experimenter led them to it. The platform was placed in the middle of the quadrant NE and mice were released randomly from different starting points (NW, SW or SE) facing the wall.</p>
<p id="P49">In the probe testing, the probe trials were designed to examine the extent of spatial discrimination learning at the end of the last day of acquisition training. To achieve this, the platform was removed from the pool and the mice were allowed to navigate for 60 s.

<title>Classical 8-arm radial maze</title>
<p id="P51">A fully open 8-arm radial maze was used to assess for both working and reference memory using a single task. The classical 8-arm radial maze was made of a transparent Plexiglas maze with 22 cm long and 7 cm wide radial arms with 20 cm high walls. The maze was located in a sound proof room with white walls and a constant illumination of 60 LUX. Distal visual cues of different colors, shapes and volumes where placed on the walls at 1 m distance from the center maze. Mice were weighted daily and food was progressively restricted (small chow pieces of 1.5-2.5 g/mouse), to maintain 85-90% of the free-feeding body weight throughout the experiment. Habituation to the maze was performed during two days prior to the test. For assessment of spatial reference and working memory, the bait (dry milk pellets) was placed in three arms (1, 2 and 4) and the mice were allowed to freely explore until they collected all the three baits. Mice performed two trials a day and the maze was cleaned between each trial. Every day, the maze was rotated randomly 45, 90 or 180º to dissociate potential intra-maze cues from the distal cues and surrounding environment. In addition, at the end of each arm, a false bottom was filled with the bait to avoid that mice perform spatial entries guided by the bait’s odor. Following Olton’s definition, entries into an arm that has been visited previously constituted working memory errors, whereas entries into an arm that is never baited constitute a reference memory error.</p>

<title>Working memory test, memory retention and interference assessment in an automatized radial maze</title>
<p id="P52">We used 3 fully automatized 8-arm radial maze made of grey Plexiglas (Imetronic, Pessac, France), as described before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>. Mice were food deprived as previously described for the classical 8-arm radial maze, and habituated during two days prior to the working memory training, as described before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>. Working memory test started the following day. We used a working memory task designed to assess for mnemonic <italic>retention</italic> and <italic>organization/update</italic> of spatial information as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>. Mice are assigned six arms grouped into three pairs (A, B, C) and have to concomitantly store different pieces of spatial information related to three different events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>: the last visited arm in each. Each training session consisted of a pseudorandom presentation of the arm-pairs (20 trials for each session). The location of the food varied according to an alternation rule in each arm i.e., every time the arm-pair A is opened, the bait is loaded into the last non-visited arm. Mice remember which arm of a given pair is visited in the last trial until the next presentation of the same pair takes place. This task requires that mice retain the memory for the last visited arm in each pair of arms independently and update each of this stored information to alternate its choices between the two arms of each pair across repetitions. To assess for memory retention and organization, 3 sessions were performed with different inter-trial intervals (ITI) between the presentations of the pairs of arms (0 sec and 30 sec ITI). The task therefore implies to retain in memory of the last arm visited in any given trial n within one of the 3 pairs (the ‘sampling trial”) until the next trial within that same pair, n+1 (the “testing” trial). Performance under low or high retention demand was assessed by using a short (i.e. 0 sec) or long (i.e. 30sec) ITI, respectively. This task also implies <italic>organization</italic> of spatial information to overcome interference between repetitions in order not to confuse the n trial with the previous one within the same pair n-1 (the “proactively interfering” trial). Thus, the organizational difficulty of the trials depends on the proactive interference, determined by the proximity between the sampling trial n and the proactively interfering trial n-1. Within each the 0 sec ITI-testing condition, trials with low vs. high proactive interference (PI) level were distinguished. High interference occurs when a presentation of a pair of arms has been performed with one or less presentations of other pairs in between (0-1 intervening trials). This results in a more frequent presentation of the pair and requires the last spatial location visited by the animal to be updated in shorter time (high proactive interference). Low interference occurs when the presentation of the pair of arms is intervened by 2-4 trials in other pairs, therefore requiring an update more spaced in time.</p>

The reference memory task took place in a new room with an automatized 8-arm radial maze setup not explored previously (technical description described above). Animals were deprived as previously described and habituated to the new radial maze setup to collect all baits from the 8-arms. The task to assess reference memory consisted of baiting constantly 3 out of 8 arms separated by 90 and 135º (1, 3 and 6). Mice performed 2 trials/day. For each trial they were allowed to explore each arm for a single time only until the 3 baits were collected. Closing the arm automatically after the visit prevented re-entries. Learning criterion was achieved when the average of number of errors for each group was under the chance level (# error probability = 3.79 errors when for 8 arms 3 are correct and 5 counted as error). For long-term memory retrieval, mice were left in the housing room for 2 or 15 days with ad libitum rodent chow. They were food restricted 12-16 h before the beginning of the memory retrieval test.

Light sources in the room were adjusted in order to have the same light intensity in every arm of the maze (25 LUX). Chocolate milk was used as reward, which was fed in the home cages the same day of habituation to avoid hyponeophagia.

Klustakwik was used for initial discrimination of clusters and manual refinement was performed using principal components, spike amplitude and other parameters. To verify cluster quality isolation the probability of cluster overlapping was calculated as described before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). Spike trains were analyzed by generating interval time histograms and temporal auto-correlogram (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Only units with no spikes in the refractory period of the inter spike time histogram (1-2 ms), and with spike amplitudes 3-4 times above background noise, typically 20-30 μV, were included. Putative pyramidal cells and interneurons were differentiated following previous criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).</p>

<title>Firing rate maps</title>
<p id="P65">MatLab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) codes (available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM">SI</xref> and updates of scripts on reasonable request) were developed for place cell activity analysis. Firing-rate maps were assembled as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>. Pixel maps were converted to a bin matrix with a bin size of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). Firing rate in each bin was determined by a smoothing process using overlapping squares of 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm as described before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>. Firing fields were plotted as a contour map reflecting the frequency of firing; colors were interpolated from the top firing bins down to the lowest firing area by scaling them in decreasing intervals of the peak firing and giving them a color scale: red highest frequency, dark blue, lowest frequency.</p>
<p id="P66">The spatial information content was quantified using the Skaggs information index over the smoothed map<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>. This index calculates the spatial information per spike: <disp-formula id="FD4"><mml:math display="block" id="M4" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>Σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"></mml:mspace><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">log</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.1em"></mml:mspace><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> Where <italic>λ<sub>i</sub></italic> is the mean firing rate in bin <italic>i, λ</italic> is the overall mean firing rate and <italic>P<sub>i</sub></italic> is the occupancy probability of bin <italic>i.</italic></p>
<p id="P67">Spatial coherence is a spatial autocorrelation measurement from which a correlation coefficient is calculated between the rate for each bin, and the average rate of the eight surrounding bins. Firing fields were defined as a group of 6 contiguous bins, where the firing frequency was above the mean firing frequency plus the standard error of the firing matrix. The maximal firing frequency of this group of bins had to be above 1 Hz. For those units displaying more than one firing field, firing field size was computed as the sum of the existing firing fields and expressed as the percentage of the arena size occupied by the firing field calculated using the smoothed firing matrix. In-field maximum frequency was computed as the maximum firing field frequency of the smoothed firing map. Mean frequency was computed as the total number of spikes divided by the total recording time to provide the average session firing rate expressed in Hz.</p>
<p id="P68">To classify units as having spatially-related activity, a randomized distribution was calculated using the values obtained in the original unsmoothed firing map and respecting the position matrix (<italic>n</italic> =1000). Although we observed low spatial information per spike in some of the place cells selected, we verified that the spatial coherence obtained from the original map compared with the randomized distribution was the most efficient strategy to determine spatial firing on single cell basis. Thus, for a unit to be regarded as being spatially modulated, cells had to display a spatial coherence above 99% of the randomized distribution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>. This same random distribution was used to obtain stability index between the original and a random distribution. To determine the spatial stability of place cells during the intra-trial and across different trials we only compared units recorded during trials in which the at least the 70% of the arena was covered. Thus, for units to be regarded as stable they had to be above the 99% of cross-correlation between the original and the randomized distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p id="P69">SPSS software (IBM Corp) was used for statistical analysis and all data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Biological replicates (n values are different populations derived from different brains from different litters) were analyzed to assess biological variability and reproducibility of data. In general, no statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but chosen sample sizes were similar to those reported in previous publications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> or to those generally employed in the field. No randomization was used. Differences were considered significant when P &lt; 0.05. To obtain unbiased data, experimental mice from both genotypes were processed together and quantifications were performed blinded to the genotype. Data was analyzed with parametric tests, <italic>t</italic> test or ANOVA, when data sets met assumptions of normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, K-S test) and homoscedasticity (Levene test). Also non-parametric tests for independent groups, Mann-Whitney, and χ<sup>2</sup> tests were applied when normality was not met or when comparing probability distributions.</p>

<p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Representative firing-rate maps for control (<bold>a</bold>) and mutant (<bold>b</bold>) place cells. For each genotype, the first two columns illustrate firing-rate maps for the same 20 min trial, with the first column displaying the first 10 min of the trial and the second column the second 10 min of the trial. Columns three and four show firing rates for two different 20 min trials (trial 1 and trial 2) separated by 5 minutes. Values show maximum firing rate (red) and spatial coherence (black). Values under lines represent the spatial correlation between firing maps above.
