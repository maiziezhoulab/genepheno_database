<abstract>
<p>During neural development, regulation of microtubule stability is essential for proper morphogenesis of neurons. Recently, the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex was revealed to be involved in diverse cellular processes. However, there is little evidence that STRIPAK components regulate microtubule dynamics, especially <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we show that one of the core STRIPAK components, Strip, is required for microtubule organization during neuronal morphogenesis. Knockdown of Strip causes a decrease in the level of acetylated <italic>α</italic>-tubulin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, suggesting that Strip influences the stability of microtubules. We also found that Strip physically and genetically interacts with tubulin folding cofactor D (TBCD), an essential regulator of <italic>α</italic>- and <italic>β</italic>-tubulin heterodimers. Furthermore, we demonstrate the genetic interaction between <italic>strip</italic> and <italic>Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule</italic> (<italic>Dscam</italic>), a cell surface molecule that is known to work with TBCD. Thus, we propose that Strip regulates neuronal morphogenesis by affecting microtubule stability.</p>

<body>
<p>Microtubules are crucial building blocks of axons and dendrites. They provide physical support, establish polarization, and serve as ‘tracks’ for intracellular transport that enable trafficking of various molecules between cell body and neurite tips. However, microtubules are intrinsically dynamic, which means that the microtubule cytoskeleton can rapidly rearrange in response to internal or external cues. Various molecules support microtubule dynamics, which involves the proper regulation of polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules. Numerous microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) including structural MAPs, plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs), and motor proteins directly regulate microtubule assembly and depolymerization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Furthermore, post-translational modifications of microtubules are also important for their dynamics by forming a biochemical ‘tubulin code’ that can be ‘read’ by microtubule-interacting factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. For example, acetylation of <italic>α</italic>-tubulin influences the degree of kinsesin-1 interaction with the microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Acetylation of <italic>α</italic>-tubulin also influences microtubule sensitivity to be severed by katanin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, another mode of regulation of microtubule dynamics that is particularly important for branch formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Thus, the stringently regulated microtubule dynamics are crucial for both development and maintenance of neurites, and many neuronal diseases are linked to microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
<p>The striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex is an evolutionarily conserved complex that is recently revealed to have roles in various cellular processes including, signaling, cell cycle control, apoptosis, vesicular trafficking, Golgi assembly, cell polarity and cell migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Moreover, STRIPAK complexes have been linked to clinical conditions, including cardiac disease, diabetes, autism, and cerebral cavernous malformation. The core of the STRIPAK complex is the striatin family of proteins that serve as B<inline-formula id="d33e172"><inline-graphic id="d33e173" xlink:href="srep17769-m1.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> subunits (one of the subfamily of regulatory B subunits) of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex. In addition to Striatins, A and C subunits of PP2A, Mob3, Mst3, Mst4, Ysk1, Ccm3, and Strip1 and 2 are known to form the core mammalian STRIPAK complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. This core complex binds additional proteins in a mutually exclusive manner to form distinct STRIPAK complexes involved in diverse functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Although our knowledge of the composition of the striatin family complexes has increased greatly, much remains to be determined regarding the function of these complexes and the roles of the various striatin family-associated proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. There have been some indications that STRIPAK complexes might affect microtubule organization. For example, dMob4, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mob3 homolog is required for microtubule morphology at neuromuscular junctions, peripheral nerves and muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Furthermore, STRIP2 knockdown in PC3 prostate cancer cells altered microtubule organization and induced cell elongation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. It was also reported that Dynein, a minus-end directed motor, associates with the STRIPAK complex using an affinity-purification mass spectrometry analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, the precise molecular mechanism of microtubule regulation by STRIPAK complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> is unclear.</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Strip, the homolog of mammalian Strip1 and 2, regulates dendrite branching and axon elongation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory projection neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. We revealed that Strip serves as a platform for early endosome organization during axon elongation. The shorter axon phenotype caused by <italic>strip</italic> knockdown was suppressed by the expression of constitutive active form of Rab5, one of the key regulators of early endosome fusion. However, the suppression was partial, and the dendrite overbranching phenotype was not suppressed. We hypothesized that Strip might also form complexes with other molecules that affect axon elongation and dendrite branching. Thus, we speculated that Strip might affect microtubule organization, since microtubules are crucial components of axons and dendrites, and microtubule dynamics should be strictly regulated during neural development.</p>
<p>Here we show that Strip forms a complex with microtubules and affects their stabilization. Furthermore, we reveal that <italic>strip</italic> genetically interacts with <italic>tubulin folding cofactor D</italic> (<italic>TBCD</italic>), one of the tubulin-folding cofactors that assist the tubulin heterodimer formation and control the availability of tubulin subunits and microtubule stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, to regulate neuronal morphogenesis. Moreover, we show that Strip cooperates with Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam), a cell surface molecule whose intracellular domain binds to TBCD and it is likely that TBCD mediates Dscam functions by affecting microtubule dynamics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p>

<title>Strip is localized along microtubules</title>
<p>To understand the relationship between Strip and microtubule, we first examined the subcellular localization of Strip in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. It is difficult to evaluate whether Strip is localized on microtubules because endogenous Strip seems to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Therefore, we utilized the extraction method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> to remove the cytosolic components and visualize cytoskeleton-associated proteins. As we expected, Strip was localized along microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To further investigate this relationship, we performed the microtubule co-sedimentation assay. When <italic>in vitro</italic>-polymerized microtubules with no Strip were incubated with the extracts of S2 cells and pelleted by centrifugation through a glycerol cushion, S2 cell-derived Strip was associated with the microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). These data demonstrate that Strip forms a complex with microtubules.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Strip affects organization and stability of microtubule</title>
<p>We next examined the role of Strip on microtubule by treating S2 cells with <italic>strip</italic> dsRNA. Most of the microtubules showed radial projections from the cell center to the periphery in control dsRNA-treated S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). In contrast, radial projections towards cell periphery were mostly absent and overall microtubule morphology was rounded in <italic>strip</italic> dsRNA-treated S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). We further investigated the localization of microtubule plus end tracking protein, EB1 to monitor the microtubule organization and found that EB1 distribution was obviously altered in <italic>strip</italic> dsRNA-treated S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). EB1 was localized at the periphery of wild-type S2 cells in a small comet-like pattern while the number of EB1 comets was significantly reduced and sometime irregular EB1 accumulations were observed in <italic>strip</italic> dsRNA-treated S2 cells.</p>
<p>Multiple post-translational modifications in tubulins are crucial for dynamics and organization of microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and can be used to monitor different populations of microtubules. Therefore, we tried to investigate the level of acetylated and tyrosinated <italic>α</italic>-tubulin in <italic>strip</italic> dsRNA-treated S2 cells. Acetylated <italic>α</italic>-tubulins exist in stable, long-lived microtubules that are resistant to nocodazole<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Tyrosinated <italic>α</italic>-tubulins are found in newly formed microtubules since tubulin detyrosination occurs after the incorporation of tubulin subunits into the microtubule lattice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Interestingly, the level of acetylated <italic>α</italic>-tubulin was greatly reduced when cells were treated with <italic>strip</italic> dsRNA, indicating that microtubule stability was decreased when <italic>strip</italic> was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e–g</xref>). The level of tyrosinated tubulin was not drastically changed in <italic>strip</italic> dsRNA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title><italic>strip</italic> and <italic>tubulin folding cofactor D</italic> cooperatively regulate neuronal morphogenesis</title>
<p>To investigate whether Strip also influences the stability of microtubules <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed a mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM)-based analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory projection neurons (PNs), an excellent model system for studying the molecular mechanisms of neuronal morphogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. We analyzed MARCM single-cell clones of PNs whose dendrites target the DL1 glomerulus in the antennal lobe (DL1 PNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Axons of the DL1 PNs target the mushroom body and the lateral horn where the axon exhibits stereotypical L-shape branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). As we reported previously, single-cell clones of PNs homozygous for <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> (hereafter, <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PN) show defects in axon elongation and dendrite branching<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs, an additional dendrite branch appeared from the proximal side of the dendrite shaft (overbranching phenotype: 10.26%, n = 4/39, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) and two-glomerular-targeting dendrites were also observed at a low frequency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The axon of <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs did not elongate or form L-shaped branches in the lateral horn (97.2%, n = 35/36, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether Strip is involved in microtubule dynamics during neuronal morphogenesis, we examined the relationship between <italic>strip</italic> and <italic>TBCD</italic>. TBCD is one of the five tubulin-folding cofactors and assists in the formation of tubulin heterodimers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Recently, we reported that an optimum level of TBCD is crucial for neuronal morphogenesis. Interestingly, PNs homozygous for <italic>TBCD</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutation or overexpressing <italic>TBCD</italic> show similar phenotypes with <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs; both PNs exhibit dendrite overbranching phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>TBCD</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> PNs exhibits shorter axon phenotype as <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs. Based on these phenotypic similarities between <italic>strip</italic> and <italic>TBCD</italic> mutant, we hypothesized that Strip could function with TBCD to regulate neuronal morphogenesis. First, we examined the physical interaction between Strip and TBCD by performing a co-immunoprecipitation assay using S2 cell lysate, and found that Strip and TBCD can form a protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c–e</xref>). Next, we examined the subcellular localization of Strip and TBCD-myc in S2 cells and found that endogenous Strip and TBCD-myc are mostly co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). We then examined the genetic interaction between <italic>strip</italic> and <italic>TBCD</italic> by expressing short-hairpin RNA for TBCD (<italic>shRNA-TBCD)</italic> or overexpressing <italic>TBCD</italic> in <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs. Although PNs homozygous for <italic>TBCD</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutation exhibited defects in dendrite branching and axon elongation, <italic>shRNA-TBCD</italic> expression in DL1 PNs did not cause obvious phenotypes either in dendrites or axons, probably owing to its weak knockdown efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). In addition, <italic>TBCD</italic> overexpression also did not cause obvious phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>), which was different from our previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> that used different <italic>UAS-TBCD</italic> transgenic line (See Methods for more details). When <italic>shRNA-TBCD</italic> or <italic>TBCD</italic> was expressed in <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs, the phenotypes of <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs were significantly enhanced. The penetrance of two-glomeruli-targeting dendrites was increased (2.56%, n = 1/39 for <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>; 37.5% n = 9/24 for <italic>shRNA-TBCD</italic> expressing <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>; 30% n = 3/10 for <italic>TBCD</italic> expressing <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3j</xref>), and some axons showed ‘extremely short axon’ phenotype, that is, the axons did not exit the antennal lobe; this was never observed in <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup>PNs (9.52%, n = 2/21, for <italic>shRNA-TBCD</italic> expressing <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>; 20%, n = 2/10, for <italic>TBCD</italic> expressing <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> PNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3j</xref>). These results suggest that Strip interacts with TBCD during neuronal morphogenesis of PNs.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Strip cooperates with Dscam in mushroom body neurons</title>
<p>As we reported previously, TBCD forms complex with Dscam and cooperates to regulate morphology of mushroom body neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The mushroom body is an olfactory learning and memory centre<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and consists of three types of neurons, <italic>α</italic>/<italic>β</italic>, <italic>α</italic>′/<italic>β</italic>′, and γ neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. <italic>α</italic>/<italic>β</italic> neurons extend one axon into the <italic>α</italic> lobe and the other axon to the <italic>β</italic> lobe, that are labelled by anti-FasII antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Here we hypothesized that Strip, like TBCD, also acts in the downstream of Dscam. To test this hypothesis, we first generated MARCM clones of mushroom body <italic>α</italic>/<italic>β</italic> neurons homozygous for <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup>(<italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup>mushroom body neurons). We found that <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup>mushroom body neurons exhibited axon segregation phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>; 11.8% (n = 8/68) of <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup> clones exhibited less axons into the α lobes) that were similar to those in <italic>Dscam</italic> mutant mushroom body neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. We further provide the genetic evidence that <italic>Dscam</italic> and <italic>strip</italic> interact in mushroom body neurons. The ‘<italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> lobes missing’ phenotypes were observed when Dscam was overexpressed in the mushroom body neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d,f</xref>), which was suppressed in the <italic>TBCD</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> heterozygous background<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Similarly, <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup>heterozygous background could also suppress ‘<italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> lobes missing’ phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). Next we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Anti-Strip antibody could co-immunoprecipitated endogenous Strip with Dscam-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). We could further confirm this interaction by immunoprecipitating Dscam-GFP by anti-GFP antibody; endogenous Strip was co-immunoprecipitated with Dscam-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>). From these results, we concluded that Strip cooperates with Dscam in mushroom body neurons, possibly through interacting with TBCD.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To form a functional neural circuit, the morphology of each neuron should be strictly regulated to wire with the correct synaptic partners. Microtubules are fundamental structural components of axons and dendrites and their dynamics directly affect neuronal morphology. In this report, we show that Strip, one component of the STRIPAK complex, affects microtubule stability in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Furthermore, we report that Strip regulates dendrite branching and axon elongation by interacting with TBCD in the olfactory projection neurons. Moreover, we observed genetic interactions between <italic>strip</italic> and <italic>Dscam</italic> in the mushroom body neurons, suggesting that Strip and TBCD regulate microtubule stability in the downstream of Dscam.</p>
<p>We recently found that TBCD can bind to the intracellular domain of Dscam and it is likely that TBCD mediates Dscam functions by affecting microtubule dynamics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Although Dscam has been extensively studied, the downstream pathways are not well known. The Dock/Pak signaling pathway, one of the known pathways acting downstream of Dscam, does not seem to be required for dendrite targeting and axon guidance of olfactory projection neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Strip seems to act with TBCD in the downstream of Dscam during neuronal morphogenesis, and link outer cellular environment with microtubules.</p>
<p><italic>strip</italic> and <italic>TBCD</italic> mutants show similar phenotypes in axon elongation and dendrite branching, and Strip and TBCD genetically and physically interact with each other. TBCD assists in the formation of tubulin heterodimers, and affects microtubule stability by controlling the availability of tubulin subunits because concentration of free tubulin dimers can affect microtubule dynamics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Although mammalian TBCD does not bind to microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, Alp1, a homolog of TBCD in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, is colocalized with microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Furthermore, overproduction of Cin1p, the homolog of TBCD in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, resulted in an increased sensitivity to benomyl<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, an antifungal compound that weakly inhibits microtubule assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Thus, TBCD and its homologs have been shown to regulate microtubule dynamics.</p>
<p>Strip seems to affect microtubule stability by interacting with several molecules in addition to TBCD. We previously reported that Strip also forms a complex with Glued, the homolog of mammalian p150<sup>Glued,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Glued is one of the components of the dynactin complex required for dynein motor-mediated retrograde transport along microtubules. Glued has the CAP-Gly domain that is common in several +TIPs and regulates initiation of retrograde transport in neuronal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Interestingly, mammalian TBCB, another member of tubulin-folding cofactor family, also has the CAP-Gly domain and interacts with p150<sup>Glued,</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. +TIPs are a structurally and functionally diverse group of proteins that are distinguished by their specific accumulation at microtubule plus ends, or growing ends<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. +TIPs control different aspects of microtubule dynamics and form links between microtubule ends and other cellular structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Some of +TIPs also participate in microtubule-actin crosstalk, such as CLIP-170–formin interaction and EB1-RhoGEF2 interaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. There is accumulating evidence that Strip and also other STRIPAK components (Mst3, Mst4, and Ccm3) regulate the actin network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. For example, Strip1 and 2, homologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Strip, were recently identified as regulators of the actomyosin contraction that regulates cell migration in cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Taken together, Strip and STRIPAK seem to form a giant complex with TBCD and Glued at growing ends of microtubule to stabilize them and serve as a linker between microtubules and actin networks to regulate proper neurite branching and elongation.</p>
<p><italic>strip</italic> knockdown resulted in a decrease in the level of acetylated <italic>α</italic>-tubulin. Therefore, we examined the possibility that Strip directly affects the acetylated tubulin level by regulating acetylation or deacetylation enzymes. We investigated the genetic interaction between <italic>strip</italic> and <italic>HDAC6</italic>, one of the enzymes responsible for the deacetylation of <italic>α</italic>-tubulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, however, the shorter axon phenotype of <italic>strip</italic> knockdown was not suppressed when combined with a <italic>HDAC6</italic> mutation (data not shown). Thus, Strip does not seem to directly affect the acetylation of <italic>α</italic>-tubulin, but affect the stabilization of microtubule by interacting with TBCD, Glued, and other molecules. Although controversial, some reports indicate that acetylation is the result, and not the cause, of stabilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.</p>
<p>Many diseases are linked to microtubules. For example, defects in retrograde transports along microtubules cause neurodegenerative diseases, such as motor neuropathy 7B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and Perry syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Furthermore, Dscam is implicated in the cognitive disabilities in Down syndrome. Moreover, STRIPAK complexes have been linked to a number of clinical conditions and diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Cancer genome sequencing also identified frequent mutations in human <italic>STRIP2</italic>, and based on the mutation frequency and types, <italic>STRIP2</italic> was classified as an oncogene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Thus, further investigation of Strip, STRIPAK, and the microtubule complex would yield new insights into the mechanisms of various diseases.</p>

<title>Fly strains</title>
<p>Flies were maintained under standard laboratory condition (25 °C). <italic>UAS-Dscam17.2-GFP</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> was a kind gift from Tzumin Lee. We previously generated <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic> 14</sup>. <italic>UAS-TBCD</italic> used in previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> is different from the one we used in this report. They are independent transgenic lines generated from the same construct<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The former one is inserted in third chromosome, and the one we use in this study is on second chromosome (<italic>UAS-TBCD</italic><sup><italic>weak</italic></sup>). To generate <italic>UAS-shRNA-TBCD</italic><sup><italic>#1</italic></sup>, we used the protocol previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. The target sequence of the <italic>shRNA-TBCD</italic><sup><italic>#1</italic></sup> is 5′- GGAGCTGAATGAACTAATAATA -3′, which is different from the <italic>shRNA</italic> we used in the previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The fragment was subcloned into the <italic>pUAST-attB</italic> vector. Transgenic flies were raised by BestGene.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Clonal analysis</title>
<p>We used the MARCM method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Briefly, we crossed MARCM-ready flies that contain <italic>FLP</italic> recombinase, an <italic>FRT</italic> site, <italic>GAL4</italic>, tubulin 1α promoter-<italic>GAL80</italic>, and <italic>UAS-mCD8GFP</italic> to a line containing the corresponding <italic>FRT</italic> and mutation of interest for MARCM analysis. To analyze DL1 PNs, we used the <italic>GH146-Gal4</italic> driver and heat-shocked flies (37 °C, 1 h) at 0–24 h after larval hatching (ALH). The anterodorsal PN single-cell clones generated during this time period innervated the DL1 glomerulus. The penetrance of overbranching phenotype of <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup>PNs was considerably reduced in this study compared to the previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. This was because of the difference in the heat-shock timing. In the previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, we heat-shocked flies 0–30 h ALH for the phenotype analysis of <italic>strip</italic><sup><italic>dogi</italic></sup>PNs. To analyze mushroom body <italic>α</italic>/<italic>β</italic> neurons, we used the <italic>OK107-Gal4</italic> driver and heat-shocked flies (37 °C, 1h) at 0–24 h after puparium formation. Dissections were performed on both sexes of adults aged 1–10 days.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>The fixation, immunostaining, and imaging of the fly brains were carried out as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>.

<p>For <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, cells were cultured on concanavalin A-coated coverslips, fixed, and immunostained as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Briefly, S2 cells were grown for 1 h at 26 °C on concanavalin A-coated coverslips, and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (wt/vol) in 0.3% Triton X-100 (vol/vol) in phosphate-buffer saline (PBST) at RT for 10 min, and subsequently blocked in PBST with 5% normal goat serum (vol/vol) for 30 min. For investigating the colocalization of Strip and TBCD, we transfected S2 cells with <italic>Gal4-actin promoter</italic> and <italic>pUAST-TBCD-myc</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> by utilizing Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) and cultured for 24 h at 26 °C before plating on concanavalin A-coated coverslips. For clear observation of the microtubules, we performed the extraction method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. We rinsed S2 cells cultured on concanavalin A-coated coverslips with PEM buffer (100 mM PIPES[pH 6.9], 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) once, and treated them with extraction buffer (100 mM PIPES [pH 6.9], 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1% Triton X-100, 2% paraformaldehyde, 10 μM taxol). After incubation for 4 min at RT, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (wt/vol) in PEM buffer for 20 min at RT and subsequently blocked in PBST with 5% normal goat serum (vol/vol) for 30 min. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were carried out in blocking solution for 1 h at RT. We used the following antibodies: anti-Strip<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> (rat, 1:50), anti-<italic>α</italic>-tubulin (mouse, 1:2000, Sigma T6199), anti-acetylated-<italic>α</italic>-tubulin (mouse, 1:1000, Sigma T7451), anti-EB1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> (rabbit, 1:1000, a kind gift from S.
