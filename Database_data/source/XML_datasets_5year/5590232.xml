<p id="P1">Impaired learning and cognitive function often occurs during systemic infection or inflammation. Although activation of the innate immune system has been linked to the behavioral and cognitive effects that are associated with infection, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we mimicked viral immune activation with poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, and longitudinally imaged postsynaptic dendritic spines of layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse primary motor cortex using two-photon microscopy. We found that peripheral immune activation caused dendritic spine loss, impairments in learning-dependent dendritic spine formation and deficits in multiple learning tasks in mice. These observed synaptic alterations in the cortex were mediated by peripheral-monocyte-derived cells and did not require microglial function in the central nervous system. Furthermore, activation of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes impaired motor learning and learning-related dendritic spine plasticity through tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-dependent mechanisms. Taken together, our results highlight CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes and TNF-α as potential therapeutic targets for preventing infection-induced cognitive dysfunction.</p>

<p id="P2">Activation of the immune system has profound effects on the function of the central nervous system (CNS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, and it is thought to have an important role in schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, autism-spectrum disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and the neuropsychological impairment associated with infectious diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Indeed, changes in mood and cognitive function are frequently observed in people who are infected with viruses, such as influenza and HIV, or bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The similarity of behavioral effects that are associated with different infectious diseases suggests that immune responses to infectious agents, rather than a specific pathogen per se, may have a critical role in cognitive decline. Administration of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) is a widely used model to study virus-associated immune activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Double-stranded RNA is produced during viral replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and recognized by the mammalian innate immune system primarily through pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The binding of poly(I:C) to PRRs leads to the expression of a series of immune mediators (such as type 1 interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines), a process that efficiently mimics the acute phase of viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Similar to that observed in viral infection, peripheral immune stimulation through poly(I:C) has been shown to cause behavioral and cognitive impairments in both developing and adult animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.</p>
<p id="P3">Various host immune cells are involved in innate defense against infection. Monocytes are a population of leukocytes that are derived from progenitors in the bone marrow and that circulate in the bloodstream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. They develop into macrophages or dendritic cells after entering peripheral tissues. In response to infection, monocytes take part in the inflammatory response by producing and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, and chemokines in the infected areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In the CNS, microglia are the major innate immune cells that become activated during systemic infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Like monocytes, activated microglia produce a number of inflammatory molecules and have been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Despite the fact that monocytes and microglia are crucial players in innate immunity, which of these populations is involved in the alteration of CNS functions during virus-associated immune activation remains unknown. It is also unclear how activation of these cells alters neuronal circuits and leads to learning and behavioral deficits. Here we show that peripheral immune activation causes deficits in learning tasks, synapse loss and a reduction in learning-dependent synapse formation. These synaptic and behavioral changes are mediated by CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes via TNF-α-dependent mechanisms.</p>

<title>Systemic immune challenge increases dendritic spine dynamics in the cortex</title>
<p id="P4">To investigate how peripheral immune activation affects the brain, we intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered poly(I:C) to adolescent (postnatal day (P) 30) transgenic mice that expressed yellow fluorescent protein in layer V (L5) pyramidal neurons (Thy1-YFP mice) and examined structural changes in the postsynaptic dendritic spines of the primary motor cortex using transcranial two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. After a single injection with either 5 or 50 mg per kg body weight (mg/kg) poly(I:C), we observed more dendritic spine remodeling over 2 d in poly(I:C)-treated mice than in vehicle-treated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). In control mice, 8.3 ± 0.6% of dendritic spines were eliminated and 7.2 ± 0.7% were formed, whereas in mice that were treated with 5 mg/kg poly(I:C), 17.5 ± 1.1% and 14.0 ± 0.9% of dendritic spines were eliminated and formed, respectively. A significant increase in spine elimination and formation was also detected 24 h after poly(I:C) injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The rate of spine elimination after poly(I:C) injection was higher than that of spine formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), indicating a net loss of spines over 1–2 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Four days after poly(I:C) injection, no continued increase in spine remodeling was detected relative to that in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), indicating an acute effect of poly(I:C) treatment on spine dynamics. Consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we found that dendritic spine remodeling was lower in 2-month-old mice than in 1-month-old mice. However, similar to what was observed in 1-month-old mice, poly(I:C) injection (5 mg/kg) at P60 significantly increased the rates of spine elimination and formation over 2 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>).</p>

<title>Systemic immune challenge impairs dendritic spine plasticity associated with learning</title>
<p id="P5">The remodeling of synaptic connections is important for learning and memory formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that the learning of motor skills causes a learning-dependent increase in dendritic spine formation in the motor cortex and that the extent of new spine formation correlates with an improvement in the animal’s performance after learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We next investigated whether poly(I:C) injection similarly altered learning-dependent spine remodeling. We trained 1- or 2-month-old mice to run on an accelerating rotating rod (which is referred to as a rotarod) and imaged the same dendrites in the motor cortex before and after a 2-d period of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Two days after rotarod training, we observed a significant reduction in learning-dependent spine formation in poly(I:C)-treated mice as compared to that in the age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Conversely, we found a significant increase in spine elimination in poly(I:C)-treated mice as compared to that of vehicle-treated controls. Thus, in poly(I:C)-treated mice the combined result of these modifications is a net loss of spines after learning, while vehicle-treated mice exhibit a net gain in spines after learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Furthermore, although poly(I:C) treatment had no effects on the initial performance of the mice in the rotarod task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>) or on their body weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) as compared to those observed in vehicle-treated mice, poly(I:C) treatment did cause a significant reduction in motor performance improvements after a 2-d training period in both 1- and 2-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h,i</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">To evaluate the long-term effect of poly(I:C) treatment on learning-related spine remodeling and motor performance, we reimaged and tested 2-month-old mice on P67, after a 5-d period without further rotarod training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We found that of the new spines formed during the 2-d training interval (from P60 to P62), fewer persisted at P67 in the poly(I:C)-treated mice than in the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>). Furthermore, motor performance improvement continued to remain lower in the poly(I:C)-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>). There was a significant correlation between the percentage of training-related persistent new spines and rotarod performance on P67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2l</xref>). We also compared the performance of poly(I:C)- and vehicle-treated mice in a ’novel object recognition’ (NOR) test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). NOR training was performed 24 h after poly(I:C) administration. The training and test sessions were separated by either a 1-h or a 24-h interval to examine the short-term and long-term memory, respectively, of the mice. Although vehicle-treated control mice showed a preference for the novel object during the NOR test, mice that were pretreated with poly(I:C) showed no such preference at either 1 h or 24 h after training, indicating impaired recognition memory.</p>

<title>CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> cells are crucial for poly(I:C)-induced dendritic spine instability</title>
<p id="P7">The chemokine receptor CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 is widely expressed in monocytes and monocyte-derived cells in peripheral tissues, and it is exclusively expressed in microglia in the CNS parenchyma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. To determine whether the observed effects of poly(I:C) treatment on dendritic spine plasticity require the involvement of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> cells, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)-mediated cell depletion. Specifically, <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER</sup></italic> mice, which express a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER) under the control of the endogenous <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> promoter, were crossed with mice harboring the ubiquitous <italic>Rosa26-stop-DTR</italic> (<italic>R26<sup>iDTR</sup></italic>) allele, permits DTR expression where Cre is present. For <italic>in vivo</italic> cell depletion, <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;R26<sup>iDTR/+</sup></italic> mice were given tamoxifen for 3 d (P54 to 56) and subsequently treated with diphtheria toxin (DT) for 3 d (P57 to 59) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We found that the majority of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> cells, including peripheral CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells and CNS microglia, were depleted after the last DT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b–d</xref>). One day after the last DT treatment, we administered poly(I:C) and examined the rates of spine remodeling in the cortex over the next 2 d. Similarly to that seen in wild-type (WT) mice, we found a significant increase in spine elimination and formation in control mice that were not depleted for CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> cells (<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup></italic>) at 2 d after the administration of poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In contrast, in mice that were depleted of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> cells (<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;R26<sup>iDTR/+</sup></italic>), poly(I:C) treatment had no significant effects on the rates of dendritic spine elimination and formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), indicating the requirement of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> cells in dendritic spine remodeling in the cortex.</p>
<p id="P8">Although CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 is mostly expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage, a small fraction of T cells (which are cells of the lymphoid lineage) may also express CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). To determine whether T cells were involved in poly(I:C)-induced spine remodeling, we examined dendritic spine plasticity in <italic>Rag1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, which are deficient for T cells and B cells. We found that administration of poly(I:C) significantly increased the rates of spine elimination and formation in <italic>Rag1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, relative to those observed after treatment with vehicle only, and that these were comparable to the rates observed in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>), suggesting the role of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells but not of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> T cells in poly(I:C)-induced synapse alteration.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>CNS microglia are not required for poly(I:C)-induced dendritic spine instability</title>
<p id="P9">Previous studies have shown that microglia are important for synapse formation and elimination under both physiological and pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. To determine which population of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> cells (central or peripheral) regulates cortical spine plasticity during peripheral immune activation, we restricted cell depletion to that of CNS microglia by taking advantage of a previously established strategy in which <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup></italic> mice that are used ~30 d after tamoxifen administration permit Cre-dependent manipulation of gene expression almost exclusively in CNS-resident macrophages, including microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This strategy is based on the fact that yolk-sac-derived microglia are a self-renewing population with low turnover rates (months to years)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, whereas most peripheral circulating CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> populations have a high turnover rate (&lt;1 week) and are rapidly replenished through bone marrow (BM) precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, when we gave <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;R26<sup>iDTR/+</sup></italic> mice tamoxifen at P30 to P32, and then administered DT ~1 month later (P57 to P59) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), we found that CNS microglia were largely depleted, whereas the CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> population in blood was mostly intact, after the last DT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, there was no significant difference in levels of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in blood and brain (cortex) between control and microglia-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Notably, when mice depleted of microglia were challenged with poly(I:C), we found a significant increase in dendritic spine elimination and formation in the cortex after 2 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The increase in spine turnover after poly(I:C) treatment was comparable to that observed in nondepleted control mice with intact CNS microglia, indicating that systemic immune challenge alters spine dynamics in the cortex in the absence of microglia. Consistent with this finding, we found no morphological signs of microglial activation in the motor cortex at 24 h after poly(I:C) administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<title>CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> monocytes mediate poly(I:C)-induced synaptic and learning deficits</title>
<p id="P10">To further establish the function of peripheral CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> monocytes on dendritic spine remodeling during systemic immune challenge, we transplanted BM cells obtained from <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;R26<sup>iDTR/+</sup></italic> mice into irradiated WT recipients (referred to as <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;R26<sup>iDTR/+</sup></italic>→WT chimeras) to generate chimeric mice that express <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;R26<sup>iDTR/+</sup></italic> only in peripheral tissues. One month after BM reconstitution, mice were given tamoxifen and subsequently treated with DT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis revealed a substantial reduction in the number of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells in the blood and liver tissues of the <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;R26<sup>iDTR/+</sup></italic>→WT chimeras as compared to that in their control counterparts that received BM cells from <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup></italic> mice (<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup></italic>→WT chimeras), indicating a reduction of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> monocytes and monocyte-derived cells. In contrast, DT treatment had no effect on the number of CNS microglia in the cortex of the <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;R26<sup>iDTR/+</sup></italic>→WT chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Next we examined the effect of poly(I:C) treatment on the baseline and learning-induced remodeling of dendritic spines in the motor cortex. Poly(I:C) treatment significantly increased the baseline spine elimination and formation rates in nondepleted control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>), whereas poly(I:C) treatment had no significant effects on the baseline rates of spine turnover in mice that were depleted of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to control mice, which showed impaired learning-dependent spine remodeling and a reduction in the total number of spines, poly(I:C) treatment caused no changes in motor-learning-dependent spine remodeling or in total spine number in chimeras in which CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> monocytes were depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h–k</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). An improvement in performance after rotarod motor learning was also not impaired in these mice after poly(I:C) administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4l–o</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the effect of systemic immune challenge on learning and learning-dependent dendritic spine remodeling is mainly mediated by peripheral CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> monocytes.</p>
<p id="P12">To further investigate the role of monocytes in poly(I:C)-induced dendritic spine alteration, we collected leukocytes from blood and spleen tissues and magnetically sorted them on the basis of the cell surface expression of CD11b, a marker for myeloid cells (including monocytes). Mice that were depleted of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> cells (in both the CNS and periphery) were injected with various amounts of CD11b-sorted cells. We found that poly(I:C) treatment significantly increased spine elimination and formation in mice that were injected with 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD11b-sorted cells, as compared to that in vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). The rates of spine elimination and formation after poly(I:C) administration were significantly lower in mice that were adoptively transferred with a lower number (0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>) of CD11b-sorted cells than in those that were adoptively transferred with 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD11b-sorted cells. We did not find changes in spine turnover in mice that were injected with the fraction of cells that did not express CD11b.</p>

<title>CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes are required for poly(I:C)-induced synaptic and learning deficits</title>
<p id="P13">Previous work has identified that two distinct subsets of peripheral blood monocytes exist in mice, based on the level of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 expression (CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>low</sup> and CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. When we examined the expression of Ly6C, a marker for inflammatory monocytes, in CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> cells, we found that systemic or peripheral depletion of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> cells substantially reduced the number of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes in the blood, whereas CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>low</sup>Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes were not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). These results suggest that CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes, a population of monocytes that patrol blood vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, are essential for poly(I:C)-induced cortical changes.</p>
<p id="P14">To test the role of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes in poly(I:C)-induced synaptic deficits, we took advantage of the fact that CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 deficiency leads to a substantial reduction of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and generated <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>→WT chimeric mice, which have a deficiency of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 in peripheral leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>→WT mice, we found that poly(I:C) administration had no significant effects on the baseline rates of dendritic spine elimination and formation in the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). Moreover, motor learning-induced spine formation and elimination were not affected by the administration of poly(I:C) before the training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). As a result, there were no changes in total spine number after poly(I:C) administration in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>→WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f,g</xref>).

<title>CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes contribute to increased TNF-α levels in the cortex</title>
<p id="P15">CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 signaling in CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes has been linked to the production of TNF-α and chemokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. To explore the molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes on dendritic spine plasticity, we measured the protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at various time points after poly(I:C) injection. In WT mice, poly(I:C) treatment caused a transient increase in cytokine production in the peripheral circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Plasma levels of TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IFN-β were substantially increased at 3 h after poly(I:C) injection, relative to those in vehicle-injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Notably, we found a significant increase in TNF-α levels in the cortex at 3–24 h after poly(I:C) injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), whereas there were no changes in IL-6 and IL-1β levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>); the amount of IFN-β in the cortex was below that detectable by the ELISA.</p>
<p id="P16">To determine whether CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes are required for the poly(I:C)-induced increase in TNF-α levels in the cortex, we performed ELISA measurements in mice that were depleted of either CNS microglia or peripheral monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). We found that there were significantly more amounts of TNF-α in the cortex of mice that were depleted of microglia but that had an intact blood monocyte population at 24 h after poly(I:C) administration than in mice that were treated with vehicle. In contrast, in mice that were depleted of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> monocytes but that had intact CNS microglia, poly(I:C) treatment had no significant effect on the TNF-α levels in the cortex, relative to the levels observed in the vehicle-treated controls. Together with the finding that mice depleted of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> monocytes had reduced numbers of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> blood monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), these results suggest that CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes are required for the increase in brain TNF-α levels during systemic immune challenge.</p>

<title>TNFα mediates poly(I:C)-induced synaptic and learning deficits</title>
<p id="P17">Previous studies have shown that TNF-α has an important role in synapse plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Given our findings that CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes are required for poly(I:C)-induced spine remodeling and increased TNF-α levels in the cortex, we hypothesized that the effect of systemic immune challenge on learning and learning-dependent synapse plasticity are mediated by this monocyte subset through TNF-α signaling. In <italic>Tnf<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (which do not produce TNF-α), we found that poly(I:C) administration had no significant effects on the rates of dendritic spine elimination and formation over 2 d, whereas intravenous administration of exogenous TNF-α significantly increased the rates of spine elimination and formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Furthermore, administration of the dominant-negative form of TNF-α (hereafter referred to as DN-TNF), which binds to soluble TNF-α, abolished poly(I:C)-induced increase in baseline spine turnover in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Several lines of evidence have suggested that systemic inflammation or increased amounts of TNF-α may change the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. To control for the potential effects of BBB disruption on spine remodeling, we administered poly(I:C) to mice that were treated with SB-3CT, which protects the BBB by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>), and found that treatment with poly(I:C) substantially increased spine remodeling in SB-3CT-treated mice. Furthermore, there were no changes in the number of CD45<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells in the cortex 2 d after poly(I:C) administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the deleterious effects of poly (I:C) on spine remodeling are mediated by increased TNF-α production, rather than due to BBB disruption and subsequent entry of blood monocytes into the cortex.</p>
<p id="P19">To investigate whether diminishing TNF-α production by monocytes could protect the mice from synaptic and learning impairments, we generated <italic>Tnf<sup>−/−</sup></italic>→WT chimeras that were unable to produce TNF-α in leukocytes. One month after BM transplantation, we administered poly(I:C) to these mice and examined baseline spine turnover, motor-learning-dependent spine plasticity, as well as performance improvement after motor training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). We found that poly(I:C) treatment had no significant effects on the rates of spine elimination and formation under both baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>) and motor-learning conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>) in <italic>Tnf<sup>−/−</sup></italic>→WT mice.

The relative increase in spine turnover after poly(I:C) administration was comparable between <italic>Il6<sup>−/−</sup></italic>→WT chimeras and WT mice, suggesting that increased amounts of IL-6 in the serum are not required for synaptic alteration in the cortex.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P20">Despite the compelling evidence for an association between immune activation and cognitive disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we identified an important role of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> monocytes and TNF-α in the modulation of learning-dependent synapse structural plasticity during peripheral immune activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>). Specifically, we showed that the initiation of peripheral innate immunity with a viral mimetic increased postsynaptic dendritic spine turnover in the mouse motor cortex and decreased the dendritic spine formation associated with motor learning. These synaptic changes are prevented by the <italic>in vivo</italic> ablation of peripheral monocytes, but not by depletion of brain-resident microglial cells. By using BM chimeric mice and transgenic mice, we further showed that both synaptic and learning impairments require CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> blood monocytes and TNF-α production.</p>
<p id="P21">Because most dendritic spines in the adult cortex persist throughout life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, the loss of dendritic spines after immune challenge is likely detrimental to the functions of synaptic networks. Previous studies have shown that motor-learning-dependent synapse formation strongly correlates with improvements in performance after learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Consistent with these studies, we observed a marked decrease in performance improvement after a period of rotarod learning in mice with impaired spine formation. Additionally, we observed that peripheral immune activation impaired the mouse’s short- and long-term memory in NOR tasks. These results in mice resonate with clinical observations showing that patients with acute or chronic infectious diseases often have weaker performance on motor skills and experience memory decline relative to that in uninfected individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, because immune activation is involved in many neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, the synaptic abnormalities observed in our studies may also occur under these medical conditions and contribute to cognitive deficits.</p>
<p id="P22">Our findings underscore the importance of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes for synaptic deficits and learning impairment during peripheral immune activation. This was demonstrated by a series of <italic>in vivo</italic> cell-depletion experiments using <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;R26<sup>iDTR/+</sup></italic> mice. First, immune-challenge-induced synaptic alteration could be prevented by the depletion of the entire CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> population or by the ablation of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> blood monocytes, but not by the removal of CNS microglia. Second, adoptive transfer of CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells, which include monocytes, reconstituted the phenotype in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;R26<sup>iDTR/+</sup></italic> mice that were depleted of the entire CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> population. Third, consistent with the finding that CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-deficient mice have a reduced number of Gr1<sup>low</sup> (CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup>) monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, mice with CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 deficiency in peripheral leukocytes did not show synaptic and learning deficits during immune activation, further suggesting that CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes are essential for peripheral-immune-challenge-induced cortical changes.</p>
<p id="P23">CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 is also expressed by human monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, in which CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>low</sup> cells correspond to classical CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>−</sup> monocytes, whereas nonclassical human CD14<sup>low</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes resemble mouse CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> blood-resident monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. It has been shown that CD14<sup>low</sup> human monocytes patrol blood vessels in steady state and produce high amounts of TNFα and IL-1β in response to infection by the measles virus or herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). In patients with an HIV infection, the CD16<sup>+</sup> monocyte subset preferentially harbors the virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> and activation of this subset is associated with neurocognitive impairment after viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Future studies of this monocytes population in humans will help explain their contribution to the cognitive decline associated with viral infection that is observed.</p>
<p id="P24">Our study links the activation of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes to synaptic and learning deficits via TNF-α-dependent mechanisms. TNF-α can be produced by peripheral monocytes and endothelial cells, as well as by glia and neurons in the brain. Our studies strongly suggest that monocyte-dependent TNF-α production is a causative event in the initiation of dendritic spine alteration in the cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). TNF-α may affect synaptic plasticity directly through neuronally expressed TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> and/or indirectly through astrocyte–neuron signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). Future use of genetic approaches to manipulate TNF signaling in specific cell types is needed to better understand how TNFα alters dendritic spine remodeling.</p>
<p id="P25">In summary, our present findings provide an important mechanism by which innate immune responses modulate the synapse structural plasticity associated with learning, which is likely relevant to cognitive disturbances that are associated with systemic infectious states, such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, viral sepsis and meningitis. Targeting the human correlates of mouse CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes and preventing the production of TNF-α and synaptic deficits may be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent cognitive disturbances in these medical conditions.</p>

Briefly, surgical anesthesia was achieved using an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 15 mg/kg xylazine. A midline scalp incision exposed the skull. The area to be imaged was identified based on stereotaxic coordinates for the primary motor cortex (1 mm lateral from midline, 0.5 mm posterior from bregma). The head was immobilized, and a cranial window was created by thinning a circular area (~200 µm in diameter) of the skull to approximately 20 µm in thickness by using a high-speed drill and/or a microsurgical blade. Upon completion of the skull thinning, the animal was placed under a two-photon microscope while still under anesthesia. Two-photon laser was tuned to 920 nm. All experiments were performed using a 1.1 NA 60× objective immersed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid to obtain high-magnification (66.7 µm × 66.7 µm; 512 × 512 pixels; 0.75 µm step) images for dendritic spine analysis.

Briefly, for each dendritic segment, filopodia were identified as long, thin protrusions without bulbous heads and the remaining protrusions were classified as spines. Images of the same dendritic segments identified from two views were compared. Spines were considered stable if they were present in both views, eliminated if they were present in the 1<sup>st</sup> view but not in the 2<sup>nd</sup> view or newly formed if they were present in the 2<sup>nd</sup> view but not in the 1<sup>st</sup> view. The elimination and formation rates were measured as the number of spines eliminated or formed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> view divided by the number of spines existing in the 1<sup>st</sup> view. In some experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), after identification of new spines formed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> view, the persistence of new spines was determined by examining the image obtained from the 3<sup>rd</sup> view. The percentage of persistent new spines was measured as the number of new spines that were present in both 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> view, divided by the number of spines existing in the 1<sup>st</sup> view. For the analysis of spine morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), eliminated or newly formed spines were classified into three categories: mushroom spines (bulbous head; neck length ≤ head diameter), thin spines (bulbous head; neck length &gt; head diameter) and stubby spines (no visible neck).</p>

The percentage of area covered by microglia was calculated by making a binary image (Gray value 0 for background and 255 for GFP-labeled microglia) from the z-projection and counting the number of white pixels within the area.

<title>Behavioral assays</title>
<p id="P31">All behavioral experiments were performed in double-blind fashion. Rotarod motor training was performed using an EZRod system. Animals were placed on a motorized rod (30 mm in diameter) in the test chamber (44.5 cm × 14 cm × 51 cm dimensions). The rod stayed stationary for 30 sec, and then the rotation speed linearly increased from 0 to 80 r. p. m. over the course of 2 min. The latency to fall and rotation speed were recorded when the animal was unable to keep up with the increasing speed. Rotarod training/testing was conducted in three 20-trial sessions per day over two consecutive days. Mice were tested again in two 20-trial sessions after 7 days. Performance was calculated as the average speed animals achieved during each day. The first training session started 24 h after vehicle or poly(I:C) injection.</p>
<p id="P32">For novel object recognition, mice were tested in custom-built opaque plexiglass boxes (25 cm × 25 cm × 25 cm). Behavior was videotaped using standard webcams and images were analyzed with Quicktime software (Apple). Mice were handled by the same researcher 2 min per day for 3 consecutive days and then habituated to the testing environment for 30 min with no objects in the chamber. Twenty four hours after the habituation, mice were placed into testing environment with two identical sample objects (the familiar object) placed in opposite corners for 10 min. Mice were removed and returned to their home cages. One or twenty four hours later, mice were returned to the testing environment for 5 min where one of the sample objects was replaced by a novel object, which differs from the familiar object in the shape and texture. Testing session was scored by an experienced observer who was blinded to the experimental condition. Interaction with the familiar or novel object was considered to be the exploration time in which the animal spent with its head and nose oriented toward and within 2 cm of the object. Different types of interactions such as the animal accidentally touching, sitting or standing on the object were not considered exploratory activity. Discrimination ratio was calculated as the time spent exploring the novel object divided by the total time spent with both novel and familiar objects.</p>

Head protection was used in separate cohorts of recipient mice during irradiation to exclude the potential artifacts caused by cranial irradiation. Recipient mice were injected with donor BM cells (3–5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells) through the retro-orbital venous sinus 1–3 h after the second session of irradiation. Donor BM cells were extracted from the femur of donor mice and passed through a 70-µm cell strainer. Animals’ body weight was monitored every other day. For the first 2 weeks after irradiation, animals’ drinking water was supplemented with 2 mg/ml sulfamethoxazole and 0.4 mg/ml trimethoprim. Four to six weeks after BM reconstitution, most of BM chimeric mice (from all genotypes tested) were healthy (normal body weight, gait and absence of clasping reflex) and exhibited normal motor function and a preference for the novel object in the NOR test. Flow cytometry analysis from blood samples of congenic (CD45.1→CD45.2) chimeras confirmed that 75 ± 10 % (<italic>n</italic> = 2 mice) of circulating leukocytes were of donor origin 4–6 weeks after BM reconstitution.</p>

<p id="P37">Mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 20 ml Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free DPBS. The brain was removed and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. The tissue was rinsed three times with PBS and sectioned at 200 μm with a Leica vibratome (VT 1000 S). Sections were permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for at least 3 h and blocked with a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum for 1 h. Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako 019-19741, 1:300), chicken anti-GFAP (Millipore AB5541, 1:200), mouse anti-NeuN (Millipore MAB377, 1:200), or rat anti-TNF-α (Biolegend 506302, 1:50). Sections were then washed three times with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS and then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies: Alexa-Fluor-405-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Abcam 175671); Alexa-Fluor-647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit-IgG (Invitrogen A32733) or goat anti-mouse-IgG (Invitrogen A21236). Sections were washed as described before, incubated with or without DAPI (1 ng/ml) for 10 min, washed and mounted in MoWiol 4–88/glycerol for imaging. For the double staining of TNF-α and the neuronal marker NeuN, sections were pre-treated with sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH, 5.8) and heated at 100°C for 3 min before proceeding with the procedure described above. Confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss 700 confocal microscope.</p>

<title>ELISA</title>
<p id="P38">Whole blood was collected by ventricular puncture while mice were under deep anesthesia. Blood samples were centrifuged at 1400 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to generate plasma fractions. Brain samples were prepared in separate experiments, in which mice were perfused with 25 ml of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free DPBS to remove remaining blood. CNS tissues were harvested and disrupted by sonication in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH=7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Thermo Scientific). The homogenized material was centrifuged at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and the cleared supernatant was collected for analysis. Total protein levels in CNS homogenates were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β protein levels were measured using the Mouse Platinum ELISA kit (eBioscience), and IFNβ was measured using the Mouse IFNβ ELISA kit (Life Technologies). Samples were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<sec id="S22">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p id="P39">Prism software (GraphPad 6.0, La Jolla, CA) was used to conduct the statistical analysis. Summary data were presented as mean ± s.e.m. Tests for differences between two populations were performed using Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon test. Multiple group comparison was performed with nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test or one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni's <italic>post hoc</italic> test as specified in the figure legends. No data points were excluded from the statistical analysis, and variance was similar between groups being statistically compared. Significant levels were set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
