<p id="Par1">NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are crucial for excitatory synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. The number and subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs are tightly controlled by neuronal activity and sensory experience, but the molecular mechanism mediating NMDAR trafficking remains poorly understood. Here, we report that RIM1, with a well-established role in presynaptic vesicle release, also localizes postsynaptically in the mouse hippocampus. Postsynaptic RIM1 in hippocampal CA1 region is required for basal NMDAR-, but not AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-, mediated synaptic responses, and contributes to synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory. Moreover, RIM1 levels in hippocampal neurons influence both the constitutive and regulated NMDAR trafficking, without affecting constitutive AMPAR trafficking. We further demonstrate that RIM1 binds to Rab11 via its N terminus, and knockdown of RIM1 impairs membrane insertion of Rab11-positive recycling endosomes containing NMDARs. Together, these results identify a RIM1-dependent mechanism critical for modulating synaptic function by facilitating membrane delivery of recycling NMDARs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are major types of glutamate receptors that are widely distributed in the brain and play pivotal roles in synaptic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. AMPARs mediate most of the basal synaptic transmission, while NMDARs are important for triggering plastic changes. NMDAR activation initiates different signals that lead to rapid insertion of AMPARs into or internalization from the synapse, which mediate long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. It is now accepted that NMDARs are not static, but undergo constitutive cycling into and out of the postsynaptic membrane and lateral diffusion between synaptic and extrasynaptic receptor pools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Internalized NMDARs may be delivered to the late endosome, and then to the lysosome for degradation, or may be sorted to the recycling endosome for reinsertion to the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the number and subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs are dynamically regulated during development- and experience-dependent neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. NMDAR-mediated LTP or LTD responses have been induced at different synapses by different patterns of synaptic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In some pathological conditions, such as chronic pain and stroke, surface NMDARs show long-term changes in a brain region-specific and cell-specific manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These findings indicate that NMDAR trafficking is precisely regulated under both physiological and pathological conditions.</p>
<p id="Par4">Accumulating evidence shows that NMDAR trafficking within the synapse is regulated by post-translational modification of different NMDAR subunits and by complex interactions between NMDARs and a variety of proteins, including PDZ-domain proteins such as postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and synapse-associated protein 102<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, several protein families involved in vesicle trafficking have been shown to participate in the internalization and membrane insertion of NMDARs, such as clathrin and its adaptor AP2 for the internalization of NMDARs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and exocyst complex and SNARE proteins (comprising families of membrane-associated proteins, including SNAP25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein) for the insertion of NMDARs into the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Rab3-interacting molecules (RIMs) are evolutionarily conserved proteins that play critical roles in presynaptic neurotransmitter release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. RIMs participate in the docking and priming of presynaptic vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, as well as the tethering of vesicles and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In the present study, we showed that RIM1, a major RIM isoform, was located both pre- and post-synaptically in the mouse hippocampus. RIM1 knockdown in the hippocampal CA1 region not only affected NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses, leaving AMPAR-mediated synaptic responses unaltered, but also impaired LTP and hippocampus-dependent memory. In addition, the RIM1 levels in cultured hippocampal neurons determined both constitutive and regulated NMDAR trafficking, but not constitutive AMPAR trafficking. Furthermore, we found that RIM1 bound to Rab11 via its N-terminus, and knockdown of RIM1 impaired the surface localization of recycling NMDARs. Taken together, our results identify a substantial role for postsynaptic RIM1 in facilitating NMDAR recycling and suggest that this mechanism is important for synaptic function and long-term memory.</p>

<title>RIM1 is located both presynaptically and postsynaptically</title>
<p id="Par6">Previous work has shown that RIMs form the core of the active zone and mediate the docking and priming of presynaptic vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. To test whether RIMs are also involved in postsynaptic vesicle trafficking, we detected the subcellular localization of RIMs by the synaptosome fractionation of mouse cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The further digestion of synaptosomes yields an insoluble “PSD-enriched” (synaptic) membrane fraction and a “non-PSD-enriched” (extrasynaptic) membrane fraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We were able to separate PSD-enriched and non-PSD-enriched membrane as demonstrated by the distribution of the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 in the PSD fraction and that of the presynaptic markers synaptophysin and Rab3 in the non-PSD fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). The AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 was located in both the non-PSD and PSD fractions. Most of the NMDAR subunits GluN2A and GluN2B were located in the PSD fraction, whereas synapsin II, a regulator of neurotransmitter release, and RIM binding protein 2 (RBP2), which couples RIMs to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, were located in the non-PSD fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Moreover, Rab3 effector RIMs (both RIM1 and RIM2) were located in both the PSD and non-PSD fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). We also performed sucrose gradient centrifugation to obtain the synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) and postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of mouse cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, PSD-95 was enriched in the PSD fraction, while synaptophysin and Rab3 were not. GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluA1 were located in both the PSD and SPM fractions, whereas synapsin II and RBP2 were located only in the SPM but not the PSD fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). In contrast, RIM1 and RIM2 were located not only in the SPM fraction but also in the PSD fraction, though at lower levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). When 2-fold quantities of PSD fraction samples were loaded, RIM1 and PSD-95 were more abundant, while presynaptic synaptophysin, Bassoon, and Munc13 were still not detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>RIM1 is localized both presynaptically and postsynaptically. <bold>a</bold> Subcellular fractions of mouse cortex by synaptosome fractionation were probed for the presynaptic marker synaptophysin, the postsynaptic marker PSD-95, the RIM proteins RIM1 and RIM2, the RIM-related protein RBP2, the NMDAR subunits GluN2A and GluN2B, the AMPAR subunit GluA1, and other important synaptic proteins such as synapsin II, Rab3, and Rab5.

<p id="Par7">Next, we used pre-embedding immuno-electron microscopy with immunogold staining for RIM1 and observed the distribution of RIM1 in the hippocampal CA1 region. The RIM1 immunoreactivity was mainly located in asymmetric synapses, in both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites. In 410 synapses (from four mice) with nano-gold-labeled RIM1, we found gold particles on 326 (79.5%) of presynaptic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>, left panel; also see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a–c</xref>) and on 189 (46.1%) of postsynaptic sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>, middle panel; also see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1d–f</xref>). In many cases, gold particles were simultaneously located at presynaptic and postsynaptic sites (105, 25.6%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>, right panel; also see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1g–i</xref>). These results indicated that RIM1 is distributed both pre- and post-synaptically in area CA1. To test the specificity of the antibody against RIM1, we injected AAV-hSyn-Cre-GFP into the hippocampus of RIM1<sup>floxed</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Three weeks after injection, the hippocampus was sectioned and stained with antibody against RIM1. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>, GFP-positive cells showed much lower RIM1 fluorescence intensity than GFP-negative cells.</p>

<title>Postsynaptic RIM1 knockdown impairs NMDAR-mediated transmission</title>
<p id="Par8">To identify the postsynaptic role of RIM1 in regulating excitatory synaptic transmission, we generated lentivirus harboring short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) with a sequence previously demonstrated to knock down endogenous RIM1 (RIM1 KD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. RIM1 KD specifically inhibited the expression of endogenous RIM1 as determined by quantitative densitometry of immunoblots (control RNAi, 100 ± 8.7%; RIM1 RNAi, 29 ± 9.3%; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). In contrast, RIM1 KD did not alter the total expression of GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B, synaptophysin, RIM2, or RBP2 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par9">To exclude the effect of presynaptic RIM1 on synaptic transmission, we injected lentivirus into the CA1 region of 3-week-old mice to specifically reduce the expression level of RIM1 in that area, while leaving RIM1 in area CA3 unchanged, and then tested the CA3–CA1 Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from the infected CA1 pyramidal cells in acute slices 10 to 15 days after virus injection (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) is a transient form of plasticity commonly used as a measure of presynaptic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and RIM1 KD had no effect on PPF compared to neurons infected with control RNAi (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). In contrast, when we injected the lentivirus into the CA3 region and recorded PPF from the CA1 pyramidal cells, we found that presynaptic RIM1 KD in area CA3 significantly affected PPF in area CA1 (control RNAi, 2.0 ± 0.1, <italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 9, 4 mice; RIM1 RNAi, 3.1 ± 0.5, <italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 10, 4 mice; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4b and c</xref>), in accord with the previous finding that presynaptic RIM1 is critical for neurotransmitter release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that RIM1 KD occurs only postsynaptically at the synapses being studied when lentivirus is injected into the CA1 region.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Postsynaptic RIM1 KD impairs NMDAR-dependent LTP. <bold>a</bold> Diagram (upper) showing mouse on stereotaxic apparatus for injection of lentivirus.

<p id="Par10">Subsequently, we examined the effect of RIM1 KD on AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (AMPAR-mEPSCs).

To explore whether postsynaptic RIM1 KD influences basal NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission, we calculated the NMDAR/AMPAR ratio. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>, this ratio was significantly lower in the CA1 pyramidal cells with RIM1 KD than in control cells (control RNAi, 0.46 ± 0.02; RIM1 RNAi, 0.21 ± 0.03; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). RIM1 KD did not alter the current–voltage relationship of NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>), suggesting little impact on channel properties. We further assessed the role of postsynaptic RIM1 in NMDAR-dependent plasticity, and found that RIM1 KD impaired NMDAR-dependent LTP in the CA1 region (127.7 ± 20.0% of baseline, <italic>n</italic> = 8 cells, 5 mice; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>) while control RNAi had no such effect (325.9 ± 45.2%, <italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 8 cells, 5 mice; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>).</p>

<p id="Par12">Next, we conducted simultaneous dual whole-cell recordings from infected and neighboring uninfected pyramidal cells in the CA1 region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). Postsynaptic RIM1 KD resulted in a lower amplitude of NMDAR-mediated EPSCs at SC-CA1 synapses in the infected neurons than in neighboring uninfected neurons, but no change in their decay time (control RNAi, 182.6 ± 19.3 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 10 cells, 5 mice; RIM1 RNAi, 177.6 ± 16.2 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 10 cells, 5 mice; <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>).

<title>RIM1 KD in area CA1 impairs hippocampus-dependent memory</title>
<p id="Par13">We then asked whether RIM1 in the CA1 region is involved in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Lentivirus with RIM1 KD or a control sequence was injected into the CA1 region of 8-week-old mice, and their performance in cognitive tasks was assessed 2 weeks later. First, mice with RIM1 KD in the CA1 region were tested in an object location task that is specifically dependent on the hippocampus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

Given that RIM1 was specifically knocked down in the CA1 region, we used a temporal order memory task (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>) that is sensitive to area CA1 but not CA3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In the retrieval phase, control mice preferred the object explored earlier to that explored last, whereas the performance of RIM1 KD mice was impaired in this task (control RNAi, 68.4 ± 2.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 10 mice; RIM1 RNAi, 51.3 ± 3.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 10 mice; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>).

<title>RIM1 is a binding partner of the NMDAR complex</title>
<p id="Par15">We used biochemical assay to detect whether endogenous RIM1 is associated with NMDARs or AMPARs in cortical lysates from mice. We performed immunoprecipitation under non-denaturing conditions of receptor solubilization with two antibodies raised against different epitopes of RIM1 and found that both of them coimmunoprecipitated PSD-95 and the NMDAR subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B, but not the AMPAR subunits GluA1 or GluA2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>, middle and right panels). In addition, antibodies against GluN1 coimmunoprecipitated RIM1, GluN2A, GluN2B, and PSD-95, but not GluA1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>, left panel). To exclude the possibility that non-solubilized membrane fragments were present before immunoprecipitation, we cleared the tissue extracts by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 1 h).

<p id="Par16">We further examined the developmental profile of RIM1 and NMDARs in the rat cortex and hippocampus and found that the expression of RIM1 was low on postnatal day 1 (P1) and gradually increased through P20 in both hippocampus and cortex (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par17">To investigate the interaction of RIM1 with different NMDAR subunits, we cotransfected HA-tagged RIM1 (HA-RIM1) with GFP-tagged NMDAR subunits (GFP-GluN1, GFP-GluN2A, or GFP-GluN2B) into HEK293T cells. The HA antibody precipitated HA-RIM1 efficiently but was unable to coimmunoprecipitate GFP-GluN1, GFP-GluN2A, or GFP-GluN2B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Similarly, GluN1 antibody precipitated GFP-GluN1 effectively but coimmunoprecipitated no HA-RIM1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>).

<title>RIM1 levels affect the surface localization of NMDARs</title>
<p id="Par19">To further investigate the effect of RIM1 on surface NMDAR levels, we knocked down endogenous RIM1 via transfection with plasmids containing the RIM1 shRNA sequence in cultured hippocampal neurons at DIV6. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phosphate method with a transfection efficiency of ~5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> was used to minimize interference by presynaptic effects. After transduction, the effect of RIM1 KD on the surface localization of native NMDARs was assessed using immunostaining with an antibody against the extracellular N-terminus of GluN2B. We focused on the NMDAR subtype containing GluN2B (GluN2B/NMDAR), since GluN2B/NMDARs tend to recycle after internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and GluN2B plays a dominant role in the trafficking of heterotrimeric NMDARs containing both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits (GluN2A/GluN2B/NMDARs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. To confirm the specificity of the antibody against the extracellular N-terminus of GluN2B, we transfected GluN2B into HEK293T cells and detected a clear band at 170 kDa (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>). We also tested the colocalization of surface-labeled GluN2B with PSD-95 and observed that the surface GluN2B was partially colocalized with PSD-95 (31 ± 1%, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7b</xref>). Moreover, GluN2B knockdown significantly reduced the surface abundance of GluN2B in cultured hippocampal neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7c</xref>).

<title>RIM1 modulates NMDAR recycling in hippocampal neurons</title>
<p id="Par25">The above results showed that RIM1 KD decreased the surface localization of NMDARs, which could be the result of either enhanced internalization of NMDARs from the plasma membrane or impaired insertion of NMDARs into the plasma membrane. We performed endocytosis and recycling assays of GluN2B/NMDARs using an antibody against the N-terminus of GluN2B. Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with RIM1 RNAi or control RNAi plasmids at DIV5-7 and observed at DIV9-11.

To test the possibility that RIM1 functions in a similar way at the postsynaptic site, we explored the relationship of RIM1 with the Rab family of small GTPases involved in the recycling of postsynaptic receptors. Rab11 and Rab4 participate in NMDAR recycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, but previous work has shown that RIM1 has no direct interaction with Rab4 in rat brain homogenate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par27">We then tested whether the N-terminus of RIM1 containing the alpha helix and the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger domain determines the interaction between RIM1 and Rab11.

Consistent with previous findings, Rab3 bound to immobilized GST-RIM1<sub>1-399</sub>, whereas Rab5 did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>). Rab11 also bound to GST-RIM1<sub>1-399</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>), indicating that RIM1 interacts directly with Rab11 via its N-terminus.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par30">Previous studies have established a role for RIM1 in the release of synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic site. In the present study, we identified a postsynaptic role for RIM1 in mediating NMDAR trafficking and synaptic function (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par31">Evidence for RIM1 as an active zone molecule is based on the previous electron microscopic finding that RIM1 is exclusively localized presynaptically and the biochemical finding that RIM1 is one of the Rab3 effectors. Moreover, a presynaptic function of RIM1 has been confirmed across different synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Using electron microscopic imaging and biochemical analysis, we confirmed that RIM1 was enriched in the presynaptic terminal in mouse hippocampus. However, we found that a small fraction of RIM1 was located postsynaptically. The difference between these electron microscopic data may be a result of the distinct brain regions surveyed, with our research focused on the mouse hippocampus while previous research focused on spinal motor neurons and the ribbon synapses of retinal photoreceptor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. It is also possible that the postsynaptic pool is smaller and was neglected in previous work. In accord with our data, two identical proteomic analyses have identified RIM1 as a constituent of the PSD in the rat brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we performed dual whole-cell recordings in hippocampal slices and showed that postsynaptic RIM1 determines the surface NMDAR level at SC synapses, but not that of AMPARs. Interestingly, previous work has reported that mice lacking RIM1 show impaired NMDAR-dependent late-phase LTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, but normal NMDAR-dependent early-phase LTP at hippocampal CA3–CA1 synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, indicating that RIM1 is necessary for certain forms of NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p id="Par32">A numbers of active zone molecules involved in presynaptic vesicle release, including SNARE components and complexin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, have been shown to be located postsynaptically as well. However, most of these proteins mediate constitutive and/or activity-regulated AMPAR exocytosis, while only a few are involved in NMDAR exocytosis, including SNAP25, syntaxin-4, and VAMP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Here, we identified RIM1 as another molecule involved in both presynaptic vesicle release and postsynaptic receptor trafficking, supporting the idea that postsynaptic receptor recycling shares mechanisms with presynaptic neurotransmitter release. We found that RIM1 specifically participates in NMDAR trafficking, but not AMPAR trafficking. RIM1 may provide a target for treating NMDAR-related pathological conditions, while leaving AMPAR-mediated basal synaptic transmission unaffected.</p>
<p id="Par33">We found that RIM1 interacts directly with Rab11, indicating that postsynaptic RIM1, like presynaptic RIM1, binds to specific Rab proteins and modulates the trafficking of different vesicles that contain neurotransmitters or receptors. Notably, Rab11 and Rab3 are the only members of the Rab family involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced exocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. It will be interesting to determine the exact role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the modulation of NMDAR recycling.</p>
<p id="Par34">Given that postsynaptic RIM1 is a key mediator of NMDAR trafficking, a critical question is whether postsynaptic RIM1 is linked to functional and behavioral phenotypes. In this study, we found that RIM1 KD in the CA1 region reduced NMDAR-mediated responses, confirming that postsynaptic RIM1 is involved in regulating synaptic function. Moreover, mice with RIM1 KD in the CA1 region had impaired hippocampus-dependent cognitive function and fear conditioning, but not perirhinal-dependent cognitive function, suggesting that postsynaptic RIM1 in the CA1 region plays a key role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. This is consistent with previous studies showing that RIM1<sup>−/−</sup> mice display cognitive deficits, since the presynaptic roles of RIM1 do not seem sufficient to cause such behavioral alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. RIM1 appears to be particularly important for a wide variety of classic schizophrenia-like behavioral abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, while NMDAR trafficking has been implicated in neurological diseases such as schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and chronic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par35">In conclusion, we have identified an RIM1-dependent mechanism that is specifically involved in NMDAR trafficking. This mechanism may participate in the fine-tuning of excitatory synapse functions in numerous physiological processes and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recording in slices and data analysis</title>
<p id="Par42">Ten to 15 days following the injection of virus, the animals were anesthetized with diethyl ether and the brain was rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold, high-sucrose cutting solution containing (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, 4.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Slices were cut on a Leica vibratome in the high-sucrose cutting solution, and immediately transferred to an incubation chamber with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 119 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 11 glucose, and 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The slices were allowed to recover at 34 °C for 30 min before being allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for another hour. During recordings, the slices were placed in a recording chamber constantly perfused with warmed ACSF (28–30 °C) and gassed continuously with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. All recordings were made with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist picrotoxin (100 μM) in the ACSF. Whole-cell recording pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were filled with a solution containing (in mM) 122.5 CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 17.5 CsCl, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, and 5 QX-314 (pH 7.25–7.3; osmolarity 290–299). Data were collected with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier and analyzed by pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA). The initial access resistance was &lt;25 MΩ, and was monitored throughout each experiment. Data were discarded if the access resistance changed &gt;15% during an experiment. Data were filtered at 2 kHz (except for NMDAR-mEPSCs, which were filtered at 0.5 kHz), and digitized at 10 kHz.</p>
<p id="Par43">A concentric bipolar stimulating electrode was placed in the stratum radiatum to evoke EPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells. Cells were held at ‒70 mV to record AMPAR-mediated EPSCs and at + 40 mV to record NMDAR-mediated EPSCs. The AMPAR/NMDAR ratio was calculated as the peak of the averaged AMPAR-mediated EPSC (30–50 consecutive events) at ‒70 mV divided by the averaged NMDAR-mediated EPSC (20–40 consecutive events) measured at 50 ms after the onset of the dual-component EPSC at +40 mV. NMDAR-mediated EPSCs were recorded in the presence of CNQX (20 μM) and at a +40 mV holding potential. For comparison of the kinetics of the NMDAR-mediated EPSCs, 15–30 EPSCs were recorded, and the current decay was quantified as the time elapsed from 90% to 10% peak amplitude. The I–V relationship of NMDAR-mediated EPSCs was measured at holding potentials from −80 mV to +40 mV. Currents were normalized to peak responses at +40 mV. AMPAR-mEPSCs were recorded in the presence of TTX (1 μM) holding the cells at −70 mV. NMDAR-mEPSCs were recorded in the presence of TTX (1 μM) and CNQX (20 μM) and the cells were held at −70 mV in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free ACSF. Input–output curves were generated by evoking ten EPSCs every 0.1 Hz at pre-determined stimulation intensities. LTP was induced by two trains of high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s) separated by 20 s, while cells were depolarized to 0 mV. This induction protocol was applied within 10 min of achieving the whole-cell configuration to avoid “wash-out” of LTP. The magnitude of LTP was calculated based on the EPSC values 35-45 min after the end of the induction protocol.</p>

<title>Subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis</title>
<p id="Par44">Subcellular fractionation was conducted with cortical tissue from adult C57BL/6 mice using an adapted protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Briefly, the cortical samples were homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose buffer (10 mM sucrose and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to obtain the homogenate fraction, which was centrifuged (1000 × <italic>g</italic>, 10 min, 4 °C) to obtain the S1 fraction. The S1 fraction was centrifuged (12,000 g, 20 min, 4 °C) to obtain the pellet (P2, crude synaptosome) fraction and the supernatant S2 fraction. To further digest the synaptosomes and yield an insoluble “PSD-enriched” membrane fraction and a “non-PSD-enriched” membrane fraction, we resuspended the P2 pellet in 4 mM HEPES buffer (4 mM HEPES and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged again (12,000×<italic>g</italic>, 20 min, 4 °C). Resuspension and centrifugation were repeated. The resulting pellet was then resuspended with buffer A (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.2) and rotated slowly (15 min, 4 °C), followed by centrifugation (12,000×<italic>g</italic>, 20 min, 4 °C). The supernatant containing Triton X-100-soluble non-PSD membranes was retained. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (20 mM HEPES, 0.15 mM NaCl, 1% TritonX-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.5), followed by gentle rotation (1 h, 4 °C) and centrifugation (10,000×<italic>g</italic>, 15 min, 4 °C). The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant (Triton X-100-insoluble PSD fraction) was retained.</p>
<p id="Par45">The fractionation of SPM and PSDs was prepared using an adapted protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Mouse cortex was dissected in ice-cold PBS and then homogenized in 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min (4 °C) and the post-nuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000×<italic>g</italic> for 15 min (4 °C). The pellet (crude synaptosomal fraction, P2) was resuspended in 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C to ensure complete lysis. After centrifugation at 10,000×<italic>g</italic> for another 15 min, the pellet fraction (P2’) was resuspended with 4-fold ddH<sub>2</sub>O and homogenized with 3 strokes of a glass-Teflon homogenizer. Then, the solution was adjusted to 4 mM HEPES and rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 25,000×<italic>g</italic> for 20 min (4 °C), the pellet (synaptosomal membrane fraction) was resuspended with 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose and laid on a discontinuous sucrose gradient containing 0.8 to 1.0 to 1.2 M sucrose. After another centrifugation at 150,000×<italic>g</italic> for 2 h (4 °C) using an SW41Ti rotor (Beckman), the SPM was collected from a cloudy band between 1.0 M and 1.2 M sucrose. The suspension was diluted to 0.32 M and further centrifuged at 200,000×<italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C using an MLA-150 rotor (Beckman). The pellet was resuspend in 50 mM HEPES/2 mM EDTA solution with 0.54% Triton X-100, rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 32,000×<italic>g</italic> for 20 min (4 °C) to obtain the Triton X-100-insoluble PSD fraction, which was then resuspended in 50 mM HEPES/2 mM EDTA.</p>
<p id="Par46">Electrophoresis of equal amounts of total protein was placed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST (-buffered saline with Tween 20) and incubated with primary antibodies (5% BSA in TBST, 4 °C, overnight). After extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody at 1:5000 for another hour. The unbound secondary antibodies were then washed, and the membranes were assessed on an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). Or, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate HRP-coupled secondary antibody at 1:3000 for another hour, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection of the proteins with the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus. All blots were repeated independently in triplicate and all the results shown were qualitatively consistent. Uncropped images of blots are shown in Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="Par47">No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. For behavior and electrophysiological recording from brain slices, the mice with missed injections were excluded, and the investigator was blinded to the group allocation during the experiment. Data collection and processing were both randomized. Animals were selected randomly for all tests. Data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. One-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze data across multiple groups, Student’s unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test (referred to as “<italic>t</italic>-test” throughout except as noted) or the paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used for all two-group comparisons, and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used for cumulative probabilities. For all tests, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
