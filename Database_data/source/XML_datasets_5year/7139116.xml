<title>Background</title>
<p>Overriding the differentiation blockage in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most successful mode-of-action in leukemia therapy – now curing the vast majority of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-based regimens. Similar approaches in other leukemia subtypes, such as IDH1/2-mutated AML, are under active investigation. We herein present successful release of the differentiation blockage upon treatment with the natural (−)-Δ<sup>9</sup>-Tetrahydrocannabinol isomer dronabinol <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Cellular maturation and differentiation were followed in two patients employing whole genome methylation profiling, proteome analyses, NGS deep sequencing and multispectral imaging flow cytometry. For functional studies lentiviral OGT knock-down <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> cell models were created to evaluate proliferative, apoptotic and differentiating effects of OGT in acute leukemia.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Findings</title>
<p>In here, we provide molecular evidence that dronbinol is capable to override the differentiation blockage of acute leukemia blasts at the state of the leukemia-initiating clone. We further identify the O-linked β-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) to be crucial in this process. OGT is a master regulator enzyme adding O-GlcNAc to serine or threonine residues in a multitude of target proteins. Aberrant O-GlcNAc modification is implicated in pathologies of metabolic, neurodegenerative and autoimme diseases as well as cancers. We provide evidence that dronabinol induces transcription of <italic>OGT</italic> via epigenetic hypomethylation of the transcription start site (TSS). A lentiviral OGT-knock out approach proves the central role of OGT exerting antileukemic efficacy via a dual-mechanism of action: High concentrations of dronabinol result in induction of apoptosis, whereas lower concentrations drive cellular maturation. Most intriguingly, overriding of the differentiation blockage of acute leukemia blasts is validated <italic>in vivo</italic> following two patients treated with dronabinol.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>In conclusion, we provide evidence for overcoming the differentiation blockage in acute leukemia in subentities beyond promyelocytic and IDH1/2-mutated leukemia and thereby identify O-GlcNAcylation as a novel (drugable) field for future leukemia research.</p>

<title>Added value of this study</title>
<p id="para0010">This study confirms clinical efficacy of dronabinol in acute leukemia, following the course of disease of two patients with T-ALL, resp. secondary AML. Importantly, a molecular rationale is provided, following a bed-to-bench concept identifying (A) a novel mode-of-action of dronabinol as an unselective epigenetic modifier and (B) O-GlcNAcylation (in competition to phosphorylation) as an important mechanism in leukemogenesis, that may well serve as a potential therapeutic target in acute leukemia. Finally (C), we demonstrate that dronabinol overcomes the differentiation blockage in acute leukemia, which may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy in leukemia subentities similar to promyelocytic and IDH1/2-mutated leukemia as outlined.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="para0013">The current understanding of leukemogenesis is based on an evolutionary process, where stepwise acquisition of somatic mutations drives hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells to malignant transformation, impairing hematopoietic differentiation and control of cellular proliferation and viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0001">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0002">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0003">[3]</xref>. Most therapies in oncology aim to (more or less selectively) kill the malignant cells – however, the most successful mode-of-action has been demonstrated in APL via overriding the differentiation blockage of the initiating leukemic clone leading to cure of this highly aggressive malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0004">[4]</xref>. Release of the differentiation blockage is not unique for APL – but has been observed in other leukemia subentities as well, following treatment with e.g. IDH1/2- or tyrosine kinase inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0005">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0006">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0007">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0008">[8]</xref> – but efficacies and durable remissions are rather limited as a monotherapy approach.</p>
<p id="para0014">High hopes are set in these novel inhibitors – and the first FLT3 and IDH1/2 inhibitors have been approved by federal authorities (e.g. FDA, EMA) for the treatment of AML. However, the possibility to induce differentiation of leukemic blasts bears substantial risks (especially differentiation syndrome) and caution and experience are needed when treating patients with such an approach.</p>
<p id="para0015">A second problem arising from the use of differentiating inhibitors is the long latency of some agents of up to 2 months to clinically verify substantial differentiation – and compounds with potential differentiating capacities may not have been recognized in the past.</p>
<p id="para0016">We now provide evidence that the natural (−)-Δ<sup>9</sup>-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) isomer dronabinol possesses <italic>in vivo</italic> antileukemic activity – and describe a novel mode of action via epigenetic regulation of OGT-mediated release of the differentiation blockage:</p>
<p id="para0017">OGT is a master regulator enzyme adding O-GlcNAc to serine or threonine residues in a multitude of target proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0010">10</xref>]. Aberrant O-GlcNAc modification is implicated in pathologies of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases as well as cancers and autoimmunity. Interestingly, several proteins involved in hematologic malignancies have been reported to directly interact with OGT, such as MLL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0011">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0012">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0013">[13]</xref>, AKT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0014">[14]</xref>, TET2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0015">[15]</xref> or ASXL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0016">16</xref>].</p>
<p id="para0018">We now demonstrate, that dronabinol exerts epigenetic activity with hypomethylation of the 5’UTR/promoter region of <italic>OGT</italic> resulting in an increase of OGT protein expression and consecutive O-GlcNAc activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo.</italic> Importantly, we identify O-GlcNAcylation as a crucial mechanism to restore protein maturation – as evidenced e.g. by OGT-dependent externalization of CD45 to the cell surface.</p>
<p id="para0019">On the cellular level, dronabinol-driven activation of O-GlcNAcylation leads to release of the differentiation blockage of leukemic blasts <italic>in vivo</italic> in two patients treated with dronabinol – whereby the functional role of OGT is confirmed <italic>ex vivo</italic> and in <italic>in vitro</italic> models, including a lentiviral OGT-knock out approach.</p>
<p id="para0020">Together, we identify O-GlcNAcylation as a crucial mechanism involved in leukemia signal transduction - opening a novel (druggable) field for future leukemia research. Further, these findings will provide the rationale for clinical exploration of dronabinol in acute leukemia.</p>

<title>Cell lines</title>
<p id="para0021">The acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Jurkat was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ). The FLT3 ITD and MLL-AF9 fusion positive acute myelogenous leukemia cell line MOLM14 was kindly provided by Dr. Heinrich, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.</p>
<p id="para0022">Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO/Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany), 1% penicillin G (10,000 units/mL), streptomycin (10,000 μg/mg) and 2 -mmol/L l-glutamine (GIBCO/Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany or Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany). FLT3 ITD was sequence confirmed in MOLM14 cells. Additionally, MOLM14 cells were sensitivityconfirmed in response to a FLT3 inhibitor (sunitinib). Negativity for mycoplasma contamination was confirmed using the pluripotent PCR Mycoplasma test Kit for both cell lines (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany).</p>

<title>Reagents</title>
<p id="para0023">Dronabinol (i.e. (−)-Δ<sup>9</sup>-Tetrahydrocannabinol, THC), dissolved in methanol, was obtained from THC Pharm (Frankfurt/Main, Germany) with permission of the Federal Opium Agency at the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Device, Germany. Drug-carrier control assays, which did not reveal any significant antileukemic effects at the highest concentration used up to 80 μM, were provided earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0017">[17]</xref>. The selective CB1 antagonist LY320135 and the selective CB2 inverse agonist JTE-907 were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).</p>

<title>Isolation of bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells</title>
<p id="para0024">Bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood samples from patients with acute leukemia were collected in 5000 U heparin after informed consent and approval of the ethics committee of the University of Tübingen (188/2018BO2). Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll Hypaque density gradient fractionation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0018">[18]</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec0006">
<label>2.4</label>
<title>Whole genome methylation profiling</title>
<p id="para0025">Genome-wide methylation pattern analyses were performed using either the Infinium HumanMethylation27K [Array #1 (Jurkat cells)] or the HumanMethylation450K [Array #2 (native patient samples)] BeadChip probing &gt; 27,000 respective ~485,000 methylation sites at single-nucleotide resolution. Array #1 targets CpG sites covering over 14,000 genes. Array #2 covers 99% of RefSeq genes, with an average of 17 CpG sites per gene region distributed across the promoter, 5′UTR, first exon, gene body, and 3′UTR. It covers 96% of CpG islands, with additional coverage in island shores and the regions flanking them. The arrays were set up using standard protocols according to the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="para0026">In short, Jurkat leukemia cells or native leukemia cells of 5 patients were treated with dronabinol for 12–36 h. Naïve cell samples were used as negative controls. After gDNA isolation and bisulfite conversion, each sample was whole-genome amplified (WGA) and enzymatically fragmented. The bisulfite-converted WGA-DNA samples were purified and applied to the BeadChips. Allele-specific primer annealing was followed by single-base extension using DNP- and Biotin-labeled ddNTPs. DNA methylation values, described as beta values, were recorded for each locus in each sample via BeadStudio software.</p>
<p id="para0027">Differential methylation analysis can be used to generate a DiffScore that indicates whether or not average Beta values are significantly different across samples. The DiffScore can be generated utilizing an Illumina Custom Model, the Mann-Whitney model, or the <italic>T t</italic>-test model.</p>
<p id="para0028">After normalization of the data we calculated the differential expression score by the following equation:<italic>deffscore=10 sgn(β<sub>cond</sub>-β<sub>ref</sub>)<italic>log</italic> 10p</italic></p>
<p id="para0029">For a locus with multiple probes, the DiffScores across probes were averaged (and a concordance value between probes reported). In order to assess significance, we used the t-test model with the assumption of equal variance provided by illumina BeadStudio to assess variance across replicate samples.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p id="para0031">Cell pellets were lysed with 100–150 μL of protein lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.25% deoxycholate with added inhibitors aprotinin, AEBSF, leupeptin, pepstatin, sodium orthovanadate, and sodium pyruvate, respectively phosphatase inhibitor cocktails „2“ and „1“ or „3“ (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Protein from cell lysates (75–200 μg protein) after denaturing was used for whole cell protein analysis by Western immunoblot assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0018">[18]</xref> using a BioRad Criterion system (protein separation by SDS-PAGE in 3–8% or 10% polyacrylamide gels followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the blots in nonfat dry milk or BSA. Anti-human C/EBPalpha (rabbit), OGT (rabbit), CB1 (goat), CB2 (goat) or Tubulin (mouse) antibodies (Sigma, St. Louis, MO or Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) were used at a 1:500 to 1:1,000 dilution. Primary antibodies were incubated for one hour or overnight, followed by several washes of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.005% Tween 20. Infrared dye-conjugated secondary donkey anti-goat or goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies to use in a LI-COR® imaging detection system were used according to standard protocols. Secondary antibodies were applicated for 30‘, followed by several washes. Antibody-reactive proteins were visualized using a LI-COR Odyssey® fluorescence optical system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).</p>

<p id="para0034"><italic>Mass spectrometry and data processing:</italic> All samples were measured on an EASY-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were chromatographically separated using 75 μm (ID), 15 cm packed in-house with reversed-phase ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 μm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH). Peptides were then eluted using a 5–50% of solvent B (80% ACN in 0.1% formic acid) gradient over 213 min. Full-scans were recorded between 300 and 2000 Thompson at a resolution of 120,000 with a target value of 1E6. The top 20 most intense ions from each full scan were selected for fragmentation (MS/MS) by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) using a collision energy of 35% at a target value of 5000 charges. Both MS and MS/MS scans were recorded in the orbitrap. All acquired MS data was processed with the MaxQuant software suite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0019">[19]</xref> version 1.5.2.8 against the complete Human UniProt database (taxonomy ID 9606) containing 91,646 sequences and a database of 248 frequently observed contaminants. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 6 ppm and 0.5 Da for MS/MS fragment ions. A maximum of two missed cleavages resulting in a minimal length of seven amino acids and full tryptic enzyme specificity were required. OHexNAc, methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation were defined as variable modifications while carbamidomethylation of cysteines was used as fixed modification. False discovery rate was set to 1% for peptide and protein identifications.</p>

<title>Short hairpin RNA interference</title>
<p id="para0035">A short hairpin (sh)RNA approach was established to stably suppress OGT translation. Briefly, a pre-selected individual OGT shRNA construct was cloned into a mammalian GIPZ vector following the trans-lentiviral packaging kit (Dharmacon/Thermo Scientific, MA) and retrovirally transduced into the respective leukemia cell model. An empty vector was used as a negative control. Puromycin selection was performed to establish stably expressing OGTi cell strains.</p>

<title>Release of the differentiation block upon dronabinol in a patient with T-Lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia in vivo</title>
<p id="para0058">We present a 21-year old male patient, suffering from highly aggressive T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, with leukemic relapse after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and refractory disease after salvage chemotherapy.</p>
<p id="para0059">Cytoreductive therapy with dexamethasone was initiated (d−1 – d+3) (see supplemental table S1 for cell counts and therapy schedule). Supportive care treatment included dronabinol 2,5% oily solution (starting with 3° BID on day 0 and tampered to 6° TID) to comfort the patient's well-being with regard to inappetite and beginning of cachexia.</p>
<p id="para0060">Using a peripheral blood sample of this patient taken at diagnosis of relapse, potent <italic>ex vivo</italic> cytoreductive sensitivity towards dronabinol was noted (supplemental Fig. S1a). Further, surprisingly, on day 15 morphologically differentiating cells were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0001">Fig. 1</xref>a). A cell sort was set up to analyze the suspected cohorts for the presence of a CDKN2A C238T mutation, which had been described in the lymphoblastic leukemic cohort at relapse (NGS targeted multigen screen, not shown, methodology described in methods).<fig id="fig0001"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p><bold>Dronabinol induces differentiation of the leukemic clone in a patient with relapsed T-lymphoblastic leukemia <italic>in vivo.</italic></bold> (a) Course of disease (refer also to supplemental Table S1), cytomorphology: May-Gruenwald-Giemsa stain at relapse, prior to dronabinol (left panel), 15 days after start of treatment with dronabinol (mid panel) and at reoccurrence of disease after salvage chemotherapy (right panel).

<p id="para0061">Intriguingly, the mutant CDKN2A C238T isoform was detected not only in the lymphoblastoid population (cohort 1) as expected – but also in the differentiating cohorts (cohorts 2/3), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0001">Fig. 1</xref>b–d). Of note, allele frequency of mutant-CDKN2A in cohort 3 was 35% as validated by NGS, which accounts for presence of mutated CDKN2A in 70% of cells of the targeted population, ruling out contamination after cell sort and false positive detection of mutant-CDKN2A by Sanger sequencing.</p>
<p id="para0062">Thus, molecular finger printing highly suggests that dronabinol has contributed to the release of the differentiation block in this patient.</p>

<title>Dronabinol modulates gDNA methylation</title>
<p id="para0063">To mimick a potential differentiating effect of dronabinol we next used the Jurkat cell line to elaborate this hypothesis: We speculated, that cellular differentiation is driven via a so far unknown, epigenetic capacity of dronabinol. A gene-chip gDNA methylation screen was set up using our well-established dronabinol sensitive T-lymphoblastic Jurkat leukemia model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0017">[17]</xref>. Cells were exposed to dronabinol (20 μM) for 12 h and 32 h and probed for changes in methylation patterns throughout the genome (see also methods section for a more detailed description of the array).</p>
<p id="para0064">Dronabinol proved to modulate gDNA methylation in a time-dependent manner. Significant changes of methylation patterns, which were defined as a ≥10% change in methylation, affected 120 probes after 12 h and 347 probes after 32 h post treatment with dronabinol. Hypomethylation was thereby more prevalent (71 probes after 12 h / 285 probes after 32 h) compared to gain of methylation (49 probes after 12 h / 62 probes after 32 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0002">Fig. 2</xref>a/c).<fig id="fig0002"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><bold>Change of gDNA Methylation of Jurkat leukemia cells in response to dronabinol.</bold> Waterfall plots of probes demonstrating change of methylation levels in a gDNA methylation array after 12 h (a) or 32 h (c) of exposure to dronabinol (20 μM).

<title>Time-dependent hypomethylation of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) upon dronabinol exposure</title>
<p id="para0066">Next, we focused our studies on the highest altered probe, displaying a decrease in methylation of −42% with a <italic>p</italic>-value of 3,68E−38 (from a basal methylation level of 68%) 32 h after treatment: This probe (ID cg26399113, mapping on the X chromosome on position 70,669,364) locates to the transcription factor binding site of the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (<italic>OGT</italic>).

<p id="para0069">To test whether upregulation of OGT protein expression levels translates into increased transferase activity, whole cell extracts derived from Jurkats exposed to dronabinol were immunoblotted for O-GlcNAcetylation of serine/threonine residues. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0003">Fig. 3</xref>c demonstrates a significant increase of O-GlcNAcetylation affecting several proteins upon treatment with dronabinol.</p>
<p id="para0070">Following a MaxQuant-based mass spectrometry approach, we identified 125 peptides with localized O-glycosylation sites (entire list provided in supplemental Table S4). The top 20 scoring GlcNac sites involve proteins associated with signal transduction (PKCB1, PPIP5K2, PTPRC), cell repair (NBN), transcription regulation (ZMYMD8, NACC1, ZBED6, ZNF71) or iron uptake (TFR1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0003">Fig. 3</xref>d).</p>
<p id="para0071">It is utmost noteworthy, that Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C (PTPRC, i.e. CD45), is tightly linked with hematopoiesis and leukemia: The CD45 phosphatase is expressed on all nucleated hematopoietic cells and plays a central role in cell growth and differentiation, which is best studied in lymphocyte development and antigen receptor signaling (reviewed by Hermiston, Xu and Weiss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0022">[22]</xref>. Thereby, mature CD45 is heavily glycosylated, which is required for cell surface expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0023">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p id="para0072">In contrast, leukemic blasts typically display only moderate CD45 expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0025">25</xref>], indicating blockage of cellular maturation. Hypothetically, restoration of CD45 expression may contribute to release of the differentiation blockage observed in acute leukemia.</p>
<p id="para0073">Consequently, we used our Jurkat cell model – and indeed demonstrate increase of CD45 expression levels at the cell surface upon exposure towards dronabinol, as indicated by single-cell image stream flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0003">Fig. 3</xref>e–g).</p>

<title>Validation of epigenetic activity of dronabinol in an independent methylation array using native leukemia cells</title>
<p id="para0074">To validate the methylation data obtained for the Jurkat cell line <italic>in vitro</italic>, we set up an independent gDNA methylation array screen using <italic>native</italic> acute leukemia blasts. Five acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia patient samples with confirmed proapoptotic sensitivity towards dronabinol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0017">[17]</xref> and Jurkat cells serving as reference control, were treated with sub-IC50 doses of dronabinol (20 mM) for 24 h and gDNA was isolated and probed after bisulfite conversion in an independent Ilumina Infinium methylation array. Principal component analysis (PCA) comparing dronabinol-exposed with drug-naive samples revealed similarly directed shifts of methylation patterns in all cases – with high interindividual variances of absolute values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0003">Fig. 3</xref>h).</p>
<p id="para0075">However, concentrating on probes located within the <italic>OGT</italic> gene region, we verified a distinct shift towards CpG hypomethylation of two probes at the transcription start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0003">Fig. 3</xref>i), an additional heatmap is provided as supplemental Fig. S2. Statistical comparison to all other probes confirmed significance for both probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0003">Fig. 3</xref>j/k). Intriguingly, the highest altered probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0003">Fig. 3</xref>k) at TSS1500 (ID cg26399113) corresponds to the probe altered in the Jurkat methylation array – confirming the observation made for the Jurkat cell line.</p>
<p id="para0076">It has to be noted, that the hypomethylating effect (after 24 h of exposure to dronabinol) was not as pronounced compared to the initial Jurkat methylation array (measured after 32 h). However, this observation is in concordance with our Western immunoblot assays (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0003">Fig. 3</xref>a) arguing for a time-dependent increase of OGT protein expression levels peaking at 36 h after administration of dronabinol.</p>
<p id="para0077">For further validation, patient samples used in the methylation screen were treated with dronabinol for 24 h with 20 μM or 40 μM and OGT protein expression was assessed by FACS flow cytometry applying an intracellular protein staining protocol.

<title>Dronabinol induces cellular differentiation in Jurkat leukemia cells in an OGT-dependent manner</title>
<p id="para0084">As we have demonstrated, dronabinol may exert cellular differentiation of leukemia cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0001">Fig. 1</xref>a). To (a) confirm the differentiation capacity of dronabinol and (b) evaluate, whether dronabinol-mediated effects on cellular differentiation depend on OGT, we used the T-lymphoblastic OGTi-Jurkat model to assess for CD11c expression levels:</p>
<p id="para0085">Expression of CD11c, a subunit of a heterodimeric integrin receptor which is expressed in many mature leukocytes including dendritic cells, monocytes, neutrophils, B-cell subsets (summarized by Stewart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0026">[26]</xref>) – but also in activated T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0028">28</xref>], was used as a marker for maturation and assessed flow cytometrically.</p>
<p id="para0086">Whereas induction of apoptosis was predominant in the highest doses (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0004">Fig. 4</xref>c), treatment with sub-IC50 concentrations of dronabinol retained a viable population – which was followed for signs of maturation 72 h after exposure. Upregulation of CD11c was noted in the Jurkat empty vector control strains – arguing for release of the differentiation blockage and maturation of cells. In contrast, no significant increase of CD11c expression was observed in OGT-interferenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0005">Fig. 5</xref>a/b, carrier control provided with supplemental Fig. S6b).<fig id="fig0005"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p><bold>Release of the differentiation blockage upon dronabinol in Jurkat leukemia cells.</bold> (a) Representative flow cytometry histogram of relative CD11c expression of OGT-interferenced (OGTi) Jurkat cells in response to dronabinol compared to an empty vector (EV) control strain.

<p id="para0087">In addition, dronabinol had no impact on CD45 expression in <italic>OGT</italic> knocked-down Jurkat cell strains as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0005">Fig. 5</xref>c), validating O-GlcNAc-dependency of cellular maturation processes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0003">Fig. 3</xref>e–g).</p>
<p id="para0088">To further validate the role of O-GlcNAcylation as an important mechanism to induce cellular differentiation in leukemia blasts, we followed a dronabinol-independent approach: O-GlcNAcylation is physiologically reversed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA) – and inhibition of OGA results in increased GlcNAcylation of serine and threonine residues of respective target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0029">[29]</xref>. A potent OGA-selective inhibitor, Thiamet-G (TMG), was used to address whether OGA inhibition results in a release of the differentiation blockage in leukemia cells. We demonstrate that TMG is capable to increase PTPRC/CD45 protein levels in Jurkat cells as assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0005">Fig. 5</xref>d), again arguing for a substantial role of O-GlcNAcylation on cellular maturation to override the cellular differentiation blockage in leukemia cells.</p>

<title>Case report</title>
<p id="para0089">A 90 year old patient with a history of a 4-x aortocoronary bypass, was admitted to the hospital with cardiac decompensation as well as pneumonia superimposed on pulmonary edema. Rapidly rising leukocytes and bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia lead to referral to the hematology department, and acute myeloid leukemia with ~80% leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood was diagnosed. White blood cell count peaked at 103 000/μl. Due to multimorbidity, bone marrow biopsy was not performed. Immunophenotyping displayed immature CD34+/HLA-DR+/CD13+/CD33+/CDw65+/MPO positive myeloid blasts. Lymphoid markers were not expressed. A marginal subpopulation showed myelomonocytic differentiation with CD14+/CD15+ positivity. Documented patient's history of unilineary myelodysplasia with transfusion independent macrocytic anemia tracking back to 2007 argues for diagnosis of sAML with myelodysplasia-related changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0030">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p id="para0090">Initial cytoreductive treatment using hydroxyurea (HU, 2–3 × 1g) resulted in a steady decrease of the white blood cell count (WBC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0006">Fig. 6</xref> and supplemental table S5).

<p id="para0091">However, blasts rapidly recovered – and despite restart of HU (2 × 1g at WBC 8720/μl) dynamic disease with doubled leukocytes was noted the next day (WBC 19 460/μl).</p>
<p id="para0092">To comfort the patient's well-being with regard to nausea and stimulation of appetite and on the basis of our <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrating a potential effect of THC in acute leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0017">[17]</xref> a compassionate use attempt with dronabinol 2,5% oily solution was started and titrated dropwise according to tolerability to a maximum dose of 6 drops BID. Leukocytosis ceased, followed by a decrease of WBC into the subnormal range. HU was stopped, whereas dronabinol was retained at 6 drops BID. Intriguingly, blasts subsided in the peripheral blood – going along with regeneration of neutrophils and platelets into the normal range.</p>
<p id="para0093">Due to neutropenic pulmonary infection one shot of G-CSF 30 MioE was administered once (d32). No further specific antileukemic treatment or growth factor support was administered further on.</p>
<p id="para0094">The patient recovered from pneumonia and recompensated with cardial function – and was discharged to home care. Following up, convalescence of clinical conditions to a normal age-adapted ECOG performance status was reported two months after first diagnosis of AML.</p>
<p id="para0095">Remission with cytomorphologically mature granulocytes, virtual absence of blasts and normalized platelets was stably documented. Notably, an increase of granulocytes and monocytoid cells was observed around day 100 on dronabinol treatment. Due to continuing increase of leukocytes – in the absence of blasts – HU cytoreduction was initiated (d169). Platelets remained in the normal range and cytology indicated maturing cells, suggestive of differentiation of the leukemic clone.</p>

<p id="para0099">Next, <italic>ex vivo</italic> cytotoxic sensitivity towards dronabinol was determined in a Ficoll-isolated mononuclear cell sample of this patient from time of diagnosis, cultured and treated with dronabinol in serial dilutions for 48 h.

<p id="para0100">To address, whether effective concentrations of dronabinol are achievable <italic>in vivo</italic>, a plasma inhibitory assay was set up using patient's plasma harvested while on treatment with dronabinol 2,5% (6 drops BID) to culture a control cell line (Jurkat) for 48 h.

<p id="para0101">Importantly, an increasing monocyte and neutrophil population was observed the following months. Cytomorphology demonstrated dysplastic but differentiating monocytes and granulocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0007">Fig. 7</xref>d). In line, immunophenotyping revealed loss of CD34 expression while maintaining/increasing monocytic and granulocytic markers – indicating maturation of the leukemic clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0007">Fig. 7</xref>e).</p>
<p id="para0102">To validate differentiation of the leukemic blasts, we mimicked this effect <italic>ex vivo</italic>: a sample of this patient taken at diagnosis was treated with dronabinol at sub-IC50 concentrations (24 μM).

<p id="para0103">To trace back the origin of the differentiated monocytic and granulocytic populations in this patient, a molecular screen was set up: Patient samples of unseparated leukocytes taken at diagnosis and 4 months after start of treatment with dronabinol were prepared for next generation amplicon based deep sequencing (NGS) using a myeloid gene panel of 55 candidate genes. In parallel Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm gene mutations of interest.</p>
<p id="para0104">The Illumina NGS run for that sample yielded 4.3 Mio reads with a total of 1 gigabases, whereof 95.8% had a quality score exceeding Q30, resulting in an average coverage of 8025.

Additionally, a striking 90 to 10 ratio for major and minor allele at a SNP in EZH2 [rs2302427] pointed to loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which was confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0008">Fig. 8</xref>a).<fig id="fig0008"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p><bold>MLPA reveals molecular leukemic evolution over time.</bold> (a) Deletion/duplication analysis reveals deletion of EZH2 (LOH) at diagnosis.

<p id="para0105">Next, we aimed to delineate wether the detected mutations associate with specific leukocyte populations. To succeed with this aim a cell sort was set up using patient samples taken two months after start of treatment. The sorted cohorts include a granulocyte population (CD15+/CD34-; isolated from a whole cell blood sample), a mature monocytoid population (“P6”, CD14+/CD34-/CD135-/CD117-/CD133-), a lymphocyte population (“P4”, confirmed negativity for CD14/CD34/CD135/CD117/CD133 defining the leukemia clone), a residual monoblast-like progenitor cell population (“P5”, CD14+/CD34+/CD135+/CD117+/CD133+), and a residual (myeloblast-like) progenitor cell population (“P7”, CD34+/CD14-/CD135+/CD117+/CD133+); (“P4-7” were sorted from mononuclear cells) (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). Consecutively, a mutation search was performed on each cohort. Results are depicted in supplemental table S6.</p>
<p id="para0106">Taken together, the findings from the mutation screen prove that the differing phenotypes originate back to one (pre)leukemic clone evolving from an EZH2 SNP, which was also heterozygously detected in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0008">Fig. 8</xref>c). Molecular evolution then led to segregation of two major subclones: the first clone harboring a FLT3 and an additional EZH2 pointmutation – and a second clone with a monocytoid phenotype with acquired monosomy 7 and additional ASXL1 and NF1 mutations, further separating subclones. Importantly, dronabinol was capable to release the differentiation blockage of both clones – leading to granulocytic (clone 1) as well as monocytoid differentiation (clone 2). This observation strongly suggests that dronabinol has targeted the leukemia initiating clone.</p>
<p id="para0107">Cytogenetic assessment of a sample obtained at diagnosis, which revealed a normal karyotype in 44 cells, but a partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 [del(7)(q32)] in 10 mitoses (mos46,XY,del(7)(q32) [10]/46,XY [44], supplemental Fig. S5) supports this notion:</p>

<title>In vitro modeling of OGT-dependent release of the differentiation blockage of acute myeloid leukemia cells upon exposure to dronabinol</title>
<p id="para0114">Capacity of release of the differentiation blockage in response to dronabinol was confirmed in an independent well characterized leukemia model: MOLM14 cells, harboring a FLT3 ITD gain-of-function mutation, have been previously shown to block myeloid differentiation via suppression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0034">[34]</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="para0122">In recent years, the O-linked β-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (<italic>OGT</italic>) gained increasing attention as a major cellular signaling mechanism adding O-GlcNAc to serine or threonine residues, which rivals with other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. In fact, many proteins are capable of being posttranslationally modified by both, O-GlcNAc and phosphate (reviewed by Hart and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0036">[36]</xref>). Aberrant O-GlcNAc modification is implicated in pathologies of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases as well as cancers and autoimmunity (reviewed by Bond and Hanover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0009">[9]</xref>). In cancer-relevant processes, O-GlcNAcylation is involved in cell signaling, transcription, cell division, metabolism and cytoskeletal regulation (summarized by Slawson and Hart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0037">[37]</xref>). Interestingly in early hematopoiesis, recent data suggest a role of O-GlcNAc homeostasis to disrupt transcriptional programs to control cell fate decisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0038">[38]</xref>. However, little is known about specific mechanisms in malignant hematology, especially in acute leukemia – and it becomes increasingly clear that mechanisms are complex, in part contradictory and depend on the molecular background of the models studied.</p>
<p id="para0123">We provide evidence that dronabinol is a potent epigenetic modifier of gDNA methylation patterns, potentially affecting changes of expression of several genes. <italic>OGT</italic> was identified as the highest altered gene via hypomethylation of the transcription start site (TSS). This effect translates into increased mRNA and protein expression levels with consecutive propelled O-GlcNAcylation.</p>
<p id="para0124">In our models, OGT seemed to play a central role in the antileukemic efficacy observed for dronabinol. Interestingly, two different mechanisms become apparent:</p>
<p id="para0125">While higher concentrations of dronabinol lead to induction of apoptosis, a second phenomenon can be observed for sub-lethal dosing, where dronabinol mediates release of the differentiation blockage of leukemia blasts <italic>in vitro, ex vivo</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> in an OGT-dependent manner.</p>
<p id="para0126">Our observation is supported by independent reports stating a role of OGT in apoptosis as well as cellular differentiation: Shi and colleagues have demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation promotes induction of apoptosis via dephosphorylation and competitive O-GlcNAc modification of threonine and serine residues at AKT and BAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0039">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p id="para0127">Secondly, several independent reports implicate a role of O-GlcNAcylation in lymphoid (T-cell) as well as myeloid cellular maturation: Inoue and colleagues have shown that myeloid differentiation is mediated via stabilization of ASXL1 by O-GlcNAcylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0013">[13]</xref>. Another report describes an OGT-EZH2 regulatory axis, which is abrogated by mutation/LOH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0040">[40]</xref>. This is of interest as both (pre)leukemic epigenetic modifiers are known to drive leukemia-originating stem cell clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0033">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p id="para0128">Intriguingly, for the presented AML case report repetitive molecular analysis at diagnosis and during follow up allowed to denominate the putative initiating pre-leukemic lesion as a loss of one copy of <italic>EZH2</italic> (LOH), which was present at diagnosis and may have fueled acquisition of additional mutations. In this context, an ASXL1 mutation was detected in a developing subclone.</p>
<p id="para0129">While the exact mechanisms will need to be elucidated in detail, it is highly suggestive that dronabinol-mediated increase of OGT levels results in a direct interaction with O-GlcNAcylation and stabilization of these target proteins. This hypothesis is further backed by a recent report describing opposite functions of EZH2 at early and late stages of disease: While EZH2 acts as a tumor suppressor at induction of oncogenesis, oncogenic properties are found to maintain the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0041">[41]</xref>. This observation also explains the use und usefulness of EZH2 inhibitors to suppress disease maintenance – while reconstitution of EZH2 functionality at early stages, as suggested by our findings via targeting the OGT-EZH2 regulatory axis, may target the actual leukemia initiating clone.</p>
<p id="para0130">To make it even more complex, a recent report states that suppression of O-GlcNAc activity leads to differentiation of leukemic blasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0042">[42]</xref>. At first sight, this observation challenges the data presented herein – and even though we might not be able to fully explain all the discrepancies, several obvious issues need to be accounted for. Besides technical differences with regard to culture conditions and assessment of differentiation, some cell models such as HL60 used in the competing report, are well known to spontaneously differentiate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0043">[43]</xref>, which may account for false-positive results, including the knock-out models.</p>
<p id="para0131">But most importantly, we have used molecularly differing leukemia models, which most likely respond differently to modulators such as dronabinol described herein as an epigenetically active drug. Dronabinol affects the methylation status of hundreds of genes – including OGT, which again globally orchestrates hundreds of proteins via O-GlcNAcylation. Even more, O-GlcNAcylation may compete with phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues, which again depends on various factors including distinct gene mutation profiles differing in between leukemia subentities.</p>
<p id="para0132">Thus again, context specificity, as reported and discussed above for EZH2 mutations, likely plays a major role in the complex mechanisms of cellular differentiation of leukemic blasts.</p>
<p id="para0133">Consequently, pre-definition of distinct molecular subentities will be essential for future studies and clinical trials.</p>
<p id="para0134">In addition to the patient with AML described above, and further strengthening our observations, we demonstrate clinical activity of dronabinol in another patient, suffering from relapsing T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia: Molecular fingerprinting of a CDKN2A mutation, detected in an NGS mutation screen, traced back a maturing population to the leukemia blast population. In this context, it is utmost remarkable that a recent report has demonstrated glucose metabolism and O-GlcNAcylation to be essential for T-cell maturation and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0044">[44]</xref>. One might speculate that it is the combination of dexamethasone pretreatment (increasing glucose levels) plus dronabinol (increasing OGT levels), which may have lead to the observed cellular maturation effect in this patient – and this approach should further be followed in future studies.</p>
<p id="para0135">While we have stringent evidence that dronabinol has clinical activity with regard to overriding the differentiation blockage in leukemia cells – dronabinol may have exhibited additional cytoreductive potency in both reported patients as well. However this effect, as demonstrated in <italic>ex vivo</italic> assays and corresponding Jurkat (T-ALL) and MOLM14 (mutat-FLT3) leukemia cell line models, was obscured <italic>in vivo</italic> due to initial cytoreductive co-medication with hydroxyurea, respectively dexamethasone. Still, the cytoreductive property of dronabinol is backed by several previous reports, describing potent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> cytoreduction of lymphoblastic and leukemia cell lines, including Jurkat and MOLM14 cells, as well as native leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0045">45</xref>]. In addition, a recent case report described potent <italic>in vivo</italic> cytoreduction in a patient with Ph+ALL treated with cannabis extracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0046">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p id="para0136">Tantalizingly, we provide preliminary data linking hypomethylation of a distinct locus within the TSS of <italic>OGT</italic> to a putative tumor suppressor gene, which possesses far-reaching consequences for future directions of research:</p>
<p id="para0137">A database search maps this significantly altered methylation probe within the TSS of <italic>OGT</italic> to the binding site of the <italic>LIN-9 DREAM MuvB Core Complex Component (LIN9)</italic> transcription factor (LIN9 binding site at chrX 70668596–70669446) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0048">48</xref>], a suggested haploinsufficient tumor suppressor and regulator of embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0049">[49]</xref>. Furthermore, LIN9 is linked to the control of proliferation and cell cycle checkpoints in embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0050">[50]</xref>. However, virtually nothing is known about a potential role of <italic>LIN9</italic> in leukemogenesis or G-protein coupled/cannabinoid receptor signaling.</p>
<p id="para0138">Interestingly, we have preliminary evidence that LIN9 indeed modulates CD45 expression levels in acute leukemia cells as demonstrated in <italic>LIN9</italic> knock-out/knock-in Jurkat cell models (supplemental Fig. S7a–c). Systematic elaboration of expression and function of LIN9 in leukemia is warranted – and subject of ongoing systematic studies.</p>
<p id="para0139">Noteworthy, a second probe within the TSS was identified in the 27K array and confirmed in the 450 K array, which did not display any significant alterations in methylation patterns upon exposure to dronabinol (compare supplemental Tables S2 and S3).</p>
<p id="para0140">Excitingly, this second (unaffected) probe detected in both methylation arrays, links to the binding site of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα, binding site at chrx 70668524–70669748) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0051">[51]</xref>. RARα is extensively studied in leukemia research due to the high clinical efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (reviewed by de Thé and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0052">[52]</xref>). The antileukemic effect mediated via activation of RARα is thereby mainly based on overriding the differentiation blockage in acute leukemia blasts. Intriguingly, this effect has been previously linked, at least in part, to direct interaction of RARα with OGT (however, this observation needs reconfirmation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0012">[12]</xref>).</p>
<p id="para0141">It is tempting to speculate, that dronabinol exerts similar effects on maturation of leukemic blasts via epigenetic activation of an alternative transcription factor binding site, allowing initiation of <italic>OGT</italic> transcription via LIN9 instead of RARα.</p>
<p id="para0142">The consequences are far reaching, providing an approach to override the differentiation blockage in non-promyelocytic leukemia as described herein in two patients.</p>
<p id="para0143">Clinical use of cannabinoids such as dronabinol may also provide an alternative strategy to target (e.g. retinoic acid-resistant) promyelocytic leukemia. In this context, we provide preliminary data in a patient with newly diagnosed APL, showing that indeed both ATRA but also dronabinol are capable to induce differentiation of the leukemic blasts <italic>ex vivo</italic> (supplemental Fig. S7d).</p>
<p id="para0144">In fact, dronabinol possesses well established clinical activities, which lead to FDA-approval in the United States as Marinol® for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or stimulation of appetite associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS.</p>
<p id="para0145">Furthermore, antitumor efficacy of THC is increasingly recognized: Several reports have suggested growth-inhibition in a number of hematologic and solid tumor cancer models, including animal models and early phase II trials, arguing for the beneficial use of cannabinoids as low-toxic anticancer therapeutics (Short and Little on behalf of the <italic>Cannabinoid in Recurrent Glioma Study Group</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0053">[53]</xref> and review by Guzman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0054">[54]</xref>). In this context, THC together with non-psychoactive cannabidiol (CBD) has gained orphan drug status by the FDA (CBD) and EMA (THC:CBD) as an anticancer treatment of glioma.</p>
<p id="para0146">In line, and further supported by a recent case report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0046">[46]</xref>, we have demonstrated that THC exerts direct proapoptotic efficacy in a subset of native acute leukemia blasts treated <italic>ex vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0017">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p id="para0147">Dronabinol has an excellent safety profile. Due to sparse densities of cannabinoid receptors in lower brainstem areas, which control cardiovascular and respiratory functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0055">[55]</xref>, LC50s are not defined and dose-limiting side effects, if any, may be due to modest cardiovascular effects by lowering blood pressure and heart rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0056">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p id="para0148">However, based on the findings reported herein, the use of dronabinol as antitumor treatment may as well possess the potential to induce severe complications such as differentiation syndrome (also known as retinoic acid syndrome as best characterized for ATRA-treated patients with APL), which is a life threatening condition, leading to massive cellular migration of differentiating leukemic cells, endothelial activation, and release of interleukins and vascular factors responsible for tissue damage. Clinically, this results in symptoms such as unexplained fever, acute respiratory distress with interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, and/or a vascular capillary leak syndrome leading to acute renal failure (summarized by Montesinos and colleagues in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0057">[57]</xref>).</p>
<p id="para0149">Referring to the ongoing public interest and discussions about legal issues of cannabinoids – in our opinion, the medicinal use of cannabinoids as anticancer therapy should remain restricted to the hands of experienced oncologists.</p>
<p id="para0150">To summarize, our findings provide several aspects of interest for future cancer research and therapeutic strategies: (A) We provide a strong rationale for exploring dronabinol as an agent with remarkable antileukemic efficacy achievable <italic>in vivo</italic>. (B) The data sheds light on a two-step mechanism with induction of apoptosis in higher doses – and, excitingly, overriding the differentiation blockage in sublethal concentrations. Intriguingly, dronabinol thereby targets the originating leukemia clone. (C) Dronabinol acts as an unselective epigenetic modifier, potently affecting expression levels of a multitude of genes. Among the top altered genes, we have identified OGT as a major regulator of apoptosis and differentiation in leukemia cells, which provides the rationale for further investigation of O-GlcNAcylation in acute leukemia and tumorigenesis in general. O-GlcNAcylation of serine and threonine residues may thereby function as a competitive mechanism to phosphorylation and act as an important (therapeutically targetable) mechanism in tumor cell signaling. Whether other proteins, targeted by O-GlcNAcylation, or additional genes, affected by changes of methylation patterns as a response to dronabinol, contribute to the observed cellular effects is not known. Further, to date, functional roles of many of the highest altered genes in our methylation arrays are not well characterized. These topics need to be addressed in detail in defined cellular backgrounds and in specific subentities (e.g. <italic>EZH2</italic> mutated myeloid neoplasms) in future studies.</p>
<p id="para0151">To conclude, our data provide proof-of-principle for further systematic evaluation of the distinct antileukemic efficacy of cannabinoids in leukemia subentities – and clinical evaluation is warranted.</p>
