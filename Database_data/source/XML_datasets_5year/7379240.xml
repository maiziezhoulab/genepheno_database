<abstract>
<p>While social experience has been shown to significantly alter behaviors in a wide range of species, comparative studies that uniformly measure the impact of a single experience across multiple species have been lacking, limiting our understanding of how plastic traits evolve. To address this, we quantified variations in social feeding behaviors across 10 species of <italic>Drosophilids</italic>, tested the effect of altering rearing context on these behaviors (reared in groups or in isolation) and correlated observed behavioral shifts to accompanying transcriptional changes in the heads of these flies. We observed significant variability in the extent of aggressiveness, the utilization of social cues during food search, and social space preferences across species. The sensitivity of these behaviors to rearing experience also varied: socially naive flies were more aggressive than their socialized conspecifics in some species, and more reserved or identical in others. Despite these differences, the mechanism of socialization appeared to be conserved within the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup as species could cross‐socialize each other, and the transcriptional response to social exposure was significantly conserved. The expression levels of chemosensory‐perception genes often varied between species and rearing conditions, supporting a growing body of evidence that behavioral evolution is driven by the differential regulation of this class of genes. The clear differences in behavioral responses to socialization observed in <italic>Drosophilids</italic> make this an ideal system for continued studies on the genetic basis and evolution of socialization and behavioral plasticity.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Prolonged social exposure has been shown to significantly alter the behavior in species ranging from fruit flies to humans,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0005">5</xref> suggesting that the ability to modulate behavior in response to the frequency of social interactions is evolutionarily advantageous. These socially mediated behavioral shifts correlate with experience‐induced alterations in gene expression in the brain,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0008">8</xref> implying that this behavioral response is partially determined by the properties of the gene regulatory network. One of the clearest examples linking social experience, gene regulation, and behavior is in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where Wang et al. showed that the expression level of a single cytochrome P450 gene, <italic>Cyp6a20</italic>, increases with the amount of time the fly is socialized and is inversely proportional to aggressiveness in males.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0005">5</xref> Interestingly, <italic>Cyp6a20</italic> is also downregulated in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> selectively bred to be hyperaggressive,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0009">9</xref> suggesting that evolution and experience can both modulate behavior through altering the expression levels of the same target genes,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0006">6</xref> and that phenotypic evolution may occur through the canalization of an experience‐altered state.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0010">10</xref>
</p>
<p>While many studies have shown that behavior and gene expression are responsive to social experience, the conservation of these effects across multiple species has not been characterized in a controlled assay. Here, we quantified changes in social feeding behaviors across 10 species of <italic>Drosophilids</italic> reared in different contexts (in groups or in isolation), and correlated changes in behavior to gene expression levels in the heads of evolutionarily and experientially diverged flies. We use the term <italic>social feeding behaviors</italic> to encompass behaviors involved in food exploration by a group of flies and interactions among individuals at the food source. Comparisons of independently evolving systems have been extremely useful in the elucidation of biological mechanisms and evolutionary principles.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0013">13</xref> This has been especially true in <italic>Drosophilids</italic> where the genomes of more than 30 species have been sequenced allowing for phenotypic differences to be related to genetic changes.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0015">15</xref> For our behavioral comparison, we chose 10 <italic>Drosophilid</italic> species that satisfied the following criteria: (1) have sequenced genomes, (2) cover a large range of evolutionary divergences, (3) are found in contrasting ecologies, and (4) can be reared easily on the same laboratory food source. Eight of these species, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, Drosophila sechellia, Drosophila yakuba, Drosophila erecta, Drosophila ananassae, Drosophila pseudoobscura,</italic> and <italic>Drosophila willistoni</italic>, belong to the subgenus <italic>Sophophora</italic> and represent both dietary generalists and species that are specialized upon a particular fruit: <italic>D. erecta</italic> on the seasonally restricted <italic>Pandanus</italic> fruit<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0016">16</xref> and <italic>D. sechellia</italic> on the toxic <italic>Morinda</italic> fruit.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0017">17</xref> The other 2 species, <italic>Drosophila arizonae</italic> and <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic>, belong to the subgenus <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and are separated from the others by approximately 40 million years ago.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0014">14</xref> Both of these species are specialists: <italic>D. arizonae</italic> breeds in necrotic cactus,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0018">18</xref> and <italic>D. virilis</italic> breeds in the slime flux exudates of deciduous trees.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0019">19</xref> The phylogenetic relationships of all 10 species are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>E, and additional ecological information is described in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0003">S1</xref>, Supporting Information.</p>

<p>Social interactions have been shown to be important for food search in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Tinette et al. demonstrated that flies are more likely to go to a food source that already has flies accumulated on it.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0021">21</xref> This effect was decreased in their assay for vision and smell mutants, suggesting that these social aggregation cues are transmitted through both sensory modalities. Clearly pheromone detection plays an important role in food search as the social pheromone 11‐cis vaccenyl acetate (CVA) has been shown to significantly increase aggregation rates when mixed with food odors.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0023">23</xref> Interestingly, CVA by itself is not sufficient to attract freely searching <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but does trigger aggregation in <italic>D. virilis,</italic>
<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0022">22</xref> suggesting a divergence in how this social cue is processed, and potential interspecies variation in the utilization of social cues during food search.</p>
<p>Once flies aggregate on a food source, they exhibit a range of social interactions including courtship, mating, and aggression.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0026">26</xref> These behaviors have been shown to have a wide range of intraspecific variation, but studies that quantify interspecific variation have been limited to a few species, and focused on mating behaviors where large behavioral shifts are thought to drive speciation.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0029">29</xref> Interspecific variation in aggression has not been systematically characterized, despite the fact that extensive studies of aggression in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have showed that it is a highly variable trait.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0009">9</xref> These aggression studies have primarily focused on male‐male interactions, but female <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> aggression has been observed and occurs less frequently.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0030">30</xref> Social experience has been shown to alter these interactions in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>: male courtship and aggression frequencies are reduced after unsuccessful attempts at mating and fighting, respectively,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0032">32</xref> male and female aggression decreases with increased socialization,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0005">5</xref> and social space also decreases with increased socialization.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0033">33</xref> Conservation of plasticity in these behaviors has not been characterized, but 4 species of <italic>Drosophilids</italic> have been shown to similarly alter their oviposition site preference in the presence of parasitic wasps,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0034">34</xref> suggesting that specific behavioral responses to experiences can be conserved between species. Furthermore, gene expression levels have also been shown to alter with aggressive and sexual experiences in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic>
<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0037">37</xref> but again conservation of experience‐driven gene expression changes and their relationship to behavioral shifts have not been characterized.</p>

<title>Food aggregation assay</title>
<p>We adapted the flight chamber described in Tinette et al. for our food aggregation assay<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0021">21</xref> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>A). The chamber is a Plexiglass box with interior dimensions 12.75″ wide X 8.875″ deep X 10.75″ high. Two flush inset slides in the solid white base of the chamber allow food to be easily introduced and removed in the presence of flies. The box is surrounded on 3 sides by a white plastic shield, and covered by a solid black plastic lid with an access port above each food source that fits a camera lens, or may be closed if no camera is in use. This shielding prevents external visual distractions. A 17″ X 24″ LED lightbox (Artograph A950) was placed 5.75″ from the exposed side of the chamber to provide uniform light during the assay. To further eliminate external distractions, all assays were performed in an enclosed cabinet.</p>
<p>Fly stocks were reared in plastic vials (Genesee Scientific Cat. # 32‐109, El Cajon, California) at 23C on standard lab food made of dark corn syrup (30 mL/L), sucrose (15 g/L), yeast (35 g/L), and agar (10 g/L). A total of 100 virgin females of each species were collected within 20 hours after eclosion and housed in groups of 25 flies. Flies were aged 5 to 6 days, with a target ratio of 50 flies of each age. Flies were maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle, and loaded into the chamber at 1 hour after lights on through a load port in the center of the unshielded wall of the chamber (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>A). We acclimated the flies to the chamber for 2 hours prior to food introduction to allow them to recover from the transfer, and to increase their attraction to the food source after a short starvation period. After 2 hours, a white cap (Wheaton Cat. # 239207, Millville, New Jersey) filled with 3 mL of lab food was introduced into the chamber via a slide on the base, and the food source was filmed for at least 2 hours from above with a Canon Vixia HFM301, exposure +1.25, fame rate PF24 (Canon Inc, Melville, New York). Six replicates were performed for each species.</p>

<title>Testing flies reared in different social contexts</title>
<p>To rear socially naive flies, individual pupa cases were transferred to vials separated by cardboard dividers, so emerged flies could not see each other. After these flies emerged, a small dab of acrylic paint was put on the center of their thorax to be able to distinguish them from each other and from socially reared flies in the aggregation assay. These flies were painted red, green, blue, or orange. After painting, they were returned to their individual food vials and maintained in complete isolation. Additionally, a single female was painted white and mixed in with a vial of 25 females as a control to determine if painting affected behavior. A target of 4 socially naive flies, and 1 white control were included as a part of the 100 flies loaded in each assay. To rear individual flies with a different species, single pupa cases were transferred to isolated vials, flies were painted soon after eclosion, and then added to a vial of 25 flies of another species. Immediately prior to assaying, a target of 4 painted flies were aspirated from their respective vials and included in a population of 100 flies with 1 white‐painted control fly. We only tested cross‐rearing between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. erecta</italic>. Six replicates were performed for each cross‐rearing experiment.</p>

To make the cactus food, we added water to frozen necrotic <italic>Carnegiea gigantea</italic> cactus, incubated for 5 days at 37°C, and added 1 mL of rot liquid to 5 mL of melted lab food. This mixture was then added to a food dish (3 mL) to solidify. To make the noni fruit food, we dissolved 1 g of dried noni fruit leather (Hawaiian Organic Noni, Anahola, Hawaii) in 8.75 mL water at 37°C for 1.5 hours, and added 1 mL of noni juice to 5 mL of melted lab food. This mixture was then added to food dish (3 mL) to solidify. In addition, 3 replicates of the food choice assays were performed with <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, and <italic>D. arizonae</italic> against all 3 food sources. Fly density experiments were conducted using the standard aggregation assay except that 25, 50, 75, or 100 flies were loaded into the chamber. We performed 4 replicates for each density, and assays ran for at least 2 hours. We were not able to obtain a T‐40 measurement for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> at a density of 25 flies, because they did not aggregate to a level of 40% over the course of the assay.

Flies searched for a food patch by diffusing through a closed arena, successively turning randomly and moving straight with bouts of random length. Food attractiveness reduces variability of the turns toward the food, and increases as the fly gets closer to the food. When a social interaction parameter is added (cooperativity), food attractiveness increases with the number of accumulated flies on the food. About 100 simulations were performed for all increments of 25 flies between 25 and 200, for both passive diffusion and socially mediated search.</p>

All videos were scaled so that the size and position of the food dish were identical for all runs. The number of flies on and proximal to the food dish were counted for every frame over a 10 second window and averaged. This was repeated for every 45 second increment. Social space was calculated as the average minimum distance between all flies within a frame. This was performed automatically by: (1) fitting an ellipse to each fly, (2) finding the nearest neighbor for each ellipse as measured as the distance between ellipse centers, and (3) calculating the mean distance between flies. As social space varied as a function of fly density at the food (more flies trying to eat increased crowding and decreased social space, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0015">S6</xref>), these means were averaged over all frames that had a specified range of fly densities for interspecies comparison. If 2 flies were the nearest neighbors to each other, that distance was only counted once. To normalize social space to body size for each species, we calculated the mean of the major and minor axes of all fit ellipses in a single frame and subtracted it from the average minimum distance. By doing this correction, social space is a measure of the distance between ellipse edges rather than centers, and is independent of fly size. This independence is confirmed by the lack of correlation between social space measured at a fly density of 15 to 25 flies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>) and fly body size (<italic>R</italic>

<p>To quantify aggressiveness, we manually counted the number of aggressive lunges exhibited by individual flies within their first 150 seconds of arriving to the food source. A lunge is considered aggressive if it displaces another fly, is preceded by display of wing‐threat or reorientation of the fly toward its target, or is accompanied by chasing or multiple rapid contacts.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0004">4</xref> We scored aggression in all painted flies that went to the food and at least 20 random socially reared flies for each species.

<p>By thresholding on color, the position of each painted fly was automatically detected in a single frame and sampled every 40 seconds over the course of the experiment.

The distance between a painted fly and its nearest neighbor for each frame was calculated, and the number of SD of that value from the mean of the nearest‐neighbor distribution for all flies in that frame (Z‐score) was determined. A distribution of Z‐scores for all frames for each painted fly was then made to visualize the relative positioning of that fly to the population over the course of the assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0002">2</xref>A; Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0018">S9</xref>).</p>

<title>Head collection</title>
<p>Virgin females were aged 5 to 6 days in groups of 25 females, and frozen at −80°C in eppendorf tubes for storage. To extract heads, 50 to 100 flies were transferred from −80°C to approximately 50 mL of liquid nitrogen in a 125 mL glass flask. Once the liquid nitrogen evaporated, the flask was rapped forcefully on a pad of paper towels on the bench top approximately 10 times to break the connective tissue holding the fly head to body. Decapitated flies were added to a prechilled metal 0.0278″ sieve on top of a 0.0165″ sieve. This allowed heads to pass through the first sieve, but not the second. Bodies remained on the top sieve, and legs and other random fly parts could pass all the way through the second sieve. For the larger species (<italic>D. virilis</italic>, <italic>D. arizonae</italic>, and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>), we used a 0.0469″ sieve on top which would allow the larger heads to pass through.

<title>Comparative behavioral assay</title>
<p>We quantified changes in social feeding behaviors between evolutionarily and experientially diverged flies using a novel, highly automatable assay (see Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="gbb12487-sec-0002">2</xref>). Briefly, 100 virgin females were loaded into a Plexiglass chamber, given a single food source via a slide on the chamber floor, and filmed interacting on the food for at least 2 hours (schematic in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>A). We only used virgin females to limit potential behavioral variability from comparing mated to virgin females (sexual maturation times vary between species<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0045">45</xref>). Resulting video recordings were processed to determine: (1) the aggregation kinetics of the flies to the food source, (2) the average distance between each fly and their nearest neighbor (social space<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0046">46</xref>), (3) the propensity of the flies to be on or near the food, and (4) aggressiveness<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0004">4</xref> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>B). Aggressiveness was manually scored by counting the number of aggressive lunges exhibited by individual flies within the first 150 seconds of arriving at the food, all other behaviors were quantified automatically using custom image processing scripts written for R (see Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="gbb12487-sec-0002">2</xref>). To determine the effects of rearing context on these behaviors, virgins were either collected immediately after eclosion and housed in groups of 25 flies (socialized), or single flies were transferred to individual vials as pupae and raised in complete isolation (non‐socialized). Acrylic paint was placed on the center of the dorsal thorax of isolated females to enable individual tracking among their socialized conspecifics (flies 13 and 17 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>B are painted). Flies were raised in complete isolation, as opposed to a more “natural” rearing context (small group size or limited social exposure), to minimize the handling of flies prior to behavioral analysis, and to maximize the induced behavioral and transcriptional differences between rearing conditions.</p>

<label>3.2</label>
<title>Interspecific variations in group‐reared behaviors</title>
<p>Interspecific differences in social feeding behaviors among group‐reared flies were immediately apparent by examining the density and positioning of each species on the food after 2 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>E). As we only tested a single strain for each species, observed behavioral traits for that strain may not be representive of the species as a whole. Regardless, we provide ecological information for each species to support observed interspecies differences, and to identify behavioral trends across species that evolved under similar environmental pressures. Aggregation kinetics were highly variable, even among closely related species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>D). <italic>D. erecta</italic>, a dietary specialist whose primary food source (<italic>Pandanus</italic> fruit) is only available 3 months of the year,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0016">16</xref> aggregated much faster than any other species. This is consistent with previous observations that <italic>D. erecta</italic> aggregate at high densities in the wild,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0016">16</xref> which suggests that competition for the seasonally restricted <italic>Pandanus</italic> fruit may select for increased aggregation rates in this species. The generalists <italic>D. pseudoobscura, D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. willistoni</italic>, which are often found competing with other species for food in nature, also aggregated at high levels in our assay as well as in the wild,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0050">50</xref> further suggesting that selection in food competitive environments may drive aggregation levels. The remaining species, including the noncompeting dietary specialists <italic>D. arizonae</italic> and <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, aggregated poorly; unlike <italic>D. erecta</italic>, the food source for <italic>D. arizonae</italic> and <italic>D. sechellia</italic> are temporally and spatially abundant. To determine whether food preferences can account for observed differences in aggregation, we tested <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. arizonae</italic>, and <italic>D. sechellia</italic> on their preferred food source and the preferred food of the other 2 species: standard lab food, cactus rot, and noni fruit, respectively.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0018">18</xref> Species did not exhibit a significant increase in accumulation on their native food (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.1; all statistics were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test unless otherwise noted), suggesting that variations in aggregation levels are not due to differences in food affinity (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0010">S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Differences in aggregation may be explained by variability in physiological properties including sensitivity to odors, visual acuity, dehydration rates, and metabolism. Alternatively, these differences may be caused by variations in the use of social cues during food search between species.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0022">22</xref> As previously mentioned, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are more likely to go to a food source that already has flies accumulated on it, suggesting that food search kinetics show positive cooperativity.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0051">51</xref> To quantify the degree of social interaction during food search, we measured the amount of time necessary for 40% of the flies in the chamber to go to the food (T‐40) as a function of fly density<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0051">51</xref> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>C). Of the 5 species that aggregated at high levels in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>D, 4 exhibited a linear decrease in T‐40 as the number of assayed flies increased. This inverse relationship between aggregation time and fly density is predicted by a cooperative search model (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0011">S2</xref>), and has previously been observed for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0051">51</xref> Here, we use the term <italic>cooperative</italic> as it is used in binding kinetics to describe the dependency of food search rate on fly density. We are not supposing that individual flies are actively cooperating to find food. Interestingly, <italic>D. erecta</italic> exhibited no change in T‐40 as a function of fly density suggesting noncooperativity (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0011">S2</xref>). The degree of cooperativity for an individual species (cooperativity coefficient) can be quantified by taking the slope of the regressions in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>C. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic>, and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> show a similar but lesser degree of cooperativity than <italic>D. willistoni</italic>. We only used 3 densities to calculate the correlation coefficient for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, which did not aggregate at sufficiently high levels to calculate a T‐40 for 25 flies, and for <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, which did not show a decrease in T‐40 at the highest fly density. The cooperative food search simulation suggests that there is a limit to which an increase in fly number increases the attractiveness of the food (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0011">S2</xref>). This limit may be lower for <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, which is larger than the other species assayed.</p>
<p>To further assay cooperativity, we performed a food choice assay similar to the one perdomed by Tinette et al.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0021">21</xref> for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (cooperative) and <italic>D. erecta</italic> (non‐cooperative). We presented flies with 2 food sources: one containing the odorless, but taste‐aversive chemical denatonium that prevents aggregation at the food, and one without. As previously observed, the initial kinetics of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to either food source was equivalent, but the relative rate of aggregation to the non‐denatonium food increased as more flies accumulated there suggesting cooperative food search (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0012">S3</xref>).<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0021">21</xref> Like <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. erecta</italic> showed similar initial kinetics to both food sources, but remained clustered in a small group next to the food containing denatonium, suggesting that even though <italic>D. erecta</italic> may not exhibit cooperativity during food search, they may still be highly social (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0013">S4</xref>). To determine the importance of vision and smell in our assay, we placed either flies and food, or food alone under either a piece of cheesecloth (no visual cue) or a glass coverslip (no odor cue). No condition was sufficient to drive the aggregation of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> suggesting a search dependence on both smell and vision (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0014">S5</xref>), as previously observed by Tinette et al.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0021">21</xref>
<italic>D. erecta</italic> aggregated on either food, or food and flies under cheesecloth at similar rates, suggesting that food odors are the primary attractant for these flies, which is consistent with their apparent loss of cooperativity during food search. <italic>D. erecta</italic> did not accumulate on flies and food covered by a coverslip (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0014">S5</xref>).</p>
<p>Once aggregated, the species varied significantly in how they interacted on the food. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, and <italic>D. sechellia</italic> had a significantly larger social space than all other species at low fly densities (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 for all pairwise comparisons), and <italic>D. erecta, D. yakuba</italic>, and <italic>D. simulans</italic> consistently had a smaller social space across densities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>E; Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0015">S6</xref>). <italic>D. erecta</italic> was significantly more aggressive than any other species (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0002">2</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0001">Video S1</xref>), including its close relative <italic>D. yakuba</italic> which exhibited slow aggregation kinetics and minimal aggressive contact (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0002">2</xref>B). Both species exhibited a strong preference to be on the food (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0016">S7</xref>) and a tight social space suggesting that aggressiveness and social space can evolve independently. While aggression levels have been shown to be highly variable in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0009">9</xref> the hyperaggressive behavior observed in <italic>D. erecta</italic> has not been observed previously in females. <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> was significantly more aggressive than the remaining species except for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05), which in turn was significantly more aggressive than all other species except for its close relative, <italic>D. simulans</italic> (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0002">2</xref>B). As species that aggregated at higher levels in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>D tended to be more aggressive, we tested whether the proportional instance of aggression increased with fly density. It did not for any species (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0017">S8</xref>), suggesting that like higher aggregation levels, increased aggression may be selected for in food‐competitive species.</p>

Socialization did not affect aggression levels in the other species, clearly showing interspecific variation in the plasticity of this behavior. Socially naive <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> did not exhibit a larger social space as previously observed in a pyramid assay,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0033">33</xref> but <italic>D. erecta</italic> did; naive <italic>D. erecta</italic> went to the food but tended to stay on the outside of the group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0002">2</xref>A, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0018">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0001">Video S1</xref>). This spatial separation was not observed in any other species. Differences in the behavioral response to rearing context could be the result of interspecific differences in the transmission of socialization cues (pheromone profiles vary across species<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0052">52</xref>), or interspecific differences in how the received cues feed into downstream behavioral processes. To try to separate these 2 possibilities, we reared individual <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. erecta</italic> flies in vials with 25 flies of the other species, and tested them in our assay. Cross‐species reared <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. erecta</italic> were both significantly less aggressive than conspecifics raised in isolation (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.005, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0002">2</xref>C), indicating that the mechanism of socialization is conserved between these species. <italic>D. erecta</italic> reared with <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> no longer stayed on the outside of the group as seen in socially naive flies further supporting cross‐species socialization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0002">2</xref>A). Interestingly, <italic>D. erecta</italic> raised with the less aggressive <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> were themselves significantly less aggressive than <italic>D. erecta</italic> raised with conspecifics (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), suggesting socialization cues may be expressed at higher levels in the larger <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p>

<title>Interspecific differences in brain transcriptome</title>
<p>To identify potential genetic effectors of these behaviors and conserved transcriptome changes related to socialization, we measured gene expression levels in the heads of all 10 species reared in groups, and in socially naive <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. erecta</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba</italic>. We focused on experience‐driven transcriptome changes in these 4 species in the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup because they significantly varied in their behavioral response to socialization, and diverged relatively recently (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>E). Gene expression levels were fairly well conserved between species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0003">3</xref>), and clustered roughly as expected based on the previously reported genomic‐sequence derived phylogeny<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0020">20</xref> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0001">1</xref>E). As <italic>D. erecta</italic> exhibited extremes of all behaviors assayed (fast aggregation kinetics, hyperaggression, noncooperative food searching and tight social space), we determined which genes were differentially regulated in this species relative to the rest of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="gbb12487-supitem-0004">S2</xref>). Again, we limited our analysis to these species because they significantly varied in behavior and diverged relatively recently. Cytochrome P450 genes, which are involved in pheromone synthesis and degradation,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0053">53</xref> were significantly enriched among differentially express transcripts in <italic>D. erecta</italic> (<italic>p</italic> = 4.09<italic>e</italic>
<sup>−5</sup>, GO analysis<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0044">44</xref>). This included <italic>Cyp6a20</italic>, which is thought to be involved in the degradation of aggression‐triggering pheromones,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0009">9</xref> and whose expression is inversely related to aggression levels in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males as previously mentioned.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0005">5</xref> Interestingly, <italic>Cyp6a20</italic> was significantly upregulated in the hyperaggressive <italic>D. erecta</italic>, which is counter to the expression‐behavior trend observed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. An evolved upregulation in expression may be advantageous to deal with increased pheromone exposure in the densely packed <italic>D. erecta</italic>. As in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0005">5</xref>
<italic>Cyp6a20</italic> levels did increase with socialization in the 4 species where we have expression data for both rearing contexts, but these expression differences were not significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0004">4</xref>A).

<p>As the behavioral response to socialization varied across species, we were also interested in identifying non‐conserved expression changes that may account for these behavioral differences. Interestingly, the odorant‐binding protein gene <italic>Obp49a</italic> was significantly up‐regulated in <italic>D. erecta</italic> females after socialization, but not in females of any other species. This differential expression in <italic>D. erecta</italic> may contribute to the experience‐mediated change in social space only observed in this species. Social space measurements at higher densities are strongly correlated with <italic>Obp49a</italic> expression levels across species and rearing conditions, further suggesting <italic>Obp49a</italic> is an effector of this phenotype (<italic>R</italic>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>While it is clear that accumulated social experience influences behavioral output,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0062">62</xref> the conservation of this influence has not been systematically studied in a controlled assay. We have perfomed that here by exposing 10 different species of <italic>Drosophilids</italic> to 2 different rearing experiences, and by quantifying the impact of that experience on adult behavior and gene expression levels. Significant shifts in social feeding behaviors and their sensitivity to rearing context, clearly show that these behaviors and their plasticity are highly variable. Determining the mechanism of these interspecific changes is a more difficult task as these differences may be the result of interspecific variations in genic sequences,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0014">14</xref> anatomy,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0045">45</xref> pheromone profiles,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0052">52</xref> and/or neuronal circuitry. The cross‐socialization of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. erecta</italic> suggests that at least within the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup, the mechanism of socialization is conserved, but which behaviors are influenced and to what extent is not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0002">2</xref>). The lack of socially mediated plasticity in aggression and social space in the majority of the species does not mean that socialization does not affect any behaviors in these species, just not these behaviors in these contexts. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males are much more aggressive than females,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0030">30</xref> and a significant change in male aggression levels with socialization may be more conserved across these species.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is some conserved response to socialization within the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup, as there is significant overlap in differentially expressed genes after prolonged social exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gbb12487-fig-0005">5</xref>). A growing body of evidence points to evolved differences in the sequence and expression of chemosensory genes as a driving force in behavioral evolution.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="gbb12487-bib-0057">57</xref> This is likely because variations in odorant/pheromone detection at the most peripheral level of the nervous system can immediately alter the degree of influence of a given stimuli, or which neurons are responsive to that stimuli. Our observation that these genes are enriched among those differentially regulated in <italic>D. erecta</italic> and <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, the 2 species that display extremes of all behaviors assayed, supports this idea. Observed differences in the regulation of these genes in response to social experience, likely contributes to the observed differences in behavioral plasticity. Further experiments are needed to directly link expression changes observed here to behavioral shift, but our data will be instrumental in guiding those efforts.</p>
