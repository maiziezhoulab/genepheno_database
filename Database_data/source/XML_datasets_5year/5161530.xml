<title>Summary</title>
<p>In fragile X syndrome (FXS), CGG repeat expansion greater than 200 triplets is believed to trigger <italic>FMR1</italic> gene silencing and disease etiology. However, FXS siblings have been identified with more than 200 CGGs, termed unmethylated full mutation (UFM) carriers, without gene silencing and disease symptoms. Here, we show that hypomethylation of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter is maintained in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from two UFM individuals. However, a subset of iPSC clones with large CGG expansions carries silenced <italic>FMR1</italic>. Furthermore, we demonstrate de novo silencing upon expansion of the CGG repeat size. <italic>FMR1</italic> does not undergo silencing during neuronal differentiation of UFM iPSCs, and expression of large unmethylated CGG repeats has phenotypic consequences resulting in neurodegenerative features. Our data suggest that UFM individuals do not lack the cell-intrinsic ability to silence <italic>FMR1</italic> and that inter-individual variability in the CGG repeat size required for silencing exists in the FXS population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>FMR1</italic> is an X-linked gene containing an array of CGG repeats located within the 5′ UTR, which normally range from 6 to 55 and may be unstable upon transmission to the next generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biancalana et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Repeat numbers from 55 to 200, so-called premutation, result in expression of mRNA with expanded CGG repeats. Individuals carrying the premutation are at risk of developing fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS, OMIM #<ext-link ext-link-type="omim" id="intref0010" xlink:href="300623">300623</ext-link>), a late-onset neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hagerman et al., 2001</xref>). One of the hallmarks of this disease is ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies, which have been detected in postmortem brain samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greco et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A repeat expansion of more than 200 triplets (full mutation) triggers gene silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic>, causing fragile X syndrome (FXS, OMIM #<ext-link ext-link-type="omim" id="intref0015" xlink:href="300624">300624</ext-link>), the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Verkerk et al., 1991</xref>). Silencing is initiated during early embryonic development and involves establishment of heterochromatin at the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter, including DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sutcliffe et al., 1992</xref>). <italic>FMR1</italic> encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and its absence impairs synaptic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Willemsen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Mosaicism in CGG repeat length is often observed in FXS patients, who carry both premutation and full mutation alleles and therefore differ in the proportion of cells with silenced <italic>FMR1</italic>, which contributes to the clinical spectrum of FXS phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rousseau et al., 1994</xref>). Mosaicism in the methylation pattern of the expanded CGG repeats has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hagerman et al., 1994</xref>). So-called unmethylated full mutation (UFM) individuals represent an extreme case with all expanded alleles above 200 CGG repeats being unmethylated. These individuals display no signs of intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Smeets et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tabolacci et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wohrle et al., 1998</xref>) and only a handful of cases have been identified worldwide. Molecular properties of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter have been studied in lymphoblastoid cell lines and primary fibroblasts derived from UFM individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pietrobono et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tabolacci et al., 2008</xref>). Normal or slightly elevated <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription, with reduced FMRP level due to translational inefficiency, as well as euchromatic configuration of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter have been demonstrated in these lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pietrobono et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tabolacci et al., 2008</xref>). However, it is not clear whether these cells have completely lost the ability to methylate <italic>FMR1</italic>.</p>
<p>Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with more than 200 CGG repeats in the <italic>FMR1</italic> locus as well as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from FXS patients have been used to study the disease properties at a cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avitzour et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colak et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eiges et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sheridan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Telias et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Urbach et al., 2010</xref>). These human ESCs serve as a model for developmental silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic>. In a fraction of ESC lines <italic>FMR1</italic> is already repressed, whereas in some it is still active and becomes silenced during in vitro neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avitzour et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colak et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, iPSCs derived from FXS patients do not reactivate <italic>FMR1</italic>, suggesting that the gene is locked in a silenced state that is resistant to epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sheridan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Urbach et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, these cells are not used to study the mechanism of <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing, but for modeling of neurological phenotypes of FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sheridan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Telias et al., 2013</xref>). In a recent study, iPSCs have been also derived from one UFM individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Esch et al., 2014</xref>). It has been reported that the cells gained silencing of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter upon reprogramming, hindering the use of these cells for further analyses of the UFM phenotype.</p>
<p>In this study we used somatic reprogramming to dissect the relationship between repeat lengths and silencing status in iPSCs from two unrelated UFM individuals. We found that in the majority of iPSC clones <italic>FMR1</italic> remained unmethylated and active. However, in a small proportion of clones which carried more than 400 CGGs <italic>FMR1</italic> was silenced, suggesting that the CGG repeat number necessary to induce the silencing is ∼400 in UFM individuals and not ∼200 as described for FXS. Moreover, we demonstrate that upon selective pressure, unmethylated UFM clones gained methylation accompanied by an expansion of the CGG repeats above this higher threshold.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the persistence of the UFM phenotype in iPSC-derived neurons allowed us to investigate whether cells carrying the expanded CGG repeat number and active <italic>FMR1</italic> develop a neurodegenerative phenotype. Indeed, we found ubiquitin inclusion bodies in these cells, a phenotypic feature of FXTAS patients. We also observed that in UFM as well as in premutation, iPSC-derived neurons form FMRP inclusions that may contribute to the FXTAS pathology.</p>

<title>Genetic and Epigenetic Characterization of <italic>FMR1</italic> Locus in UFM Individuals</title>
<p>Here we describe one previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pietrobono et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tabolacci et al., 2008</xref>) and one new UFM individual, identified within two unrelated FXS families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A). Blood samples were obtained from both UFM individuals, from their two healthy brothers N-B1 and N-B2, and the FXS nephew of UFM1, F-N1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A). In addition, we sampled buccal swabs from the additional living members of the families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A). For all, we determined CGG repeat length by PCR amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B). The full expansion status (greater than 200 CGGs) was confirmed for UFM and FXS individuals, as well as the premutation status of their mothers. As expected, in premutation and full mutation females we detected both expanded and wild-type (WT) alleles. The CGG repeat expansion of UFM individuals did not have a discrete length but displayed a continuous spectrum of sizes. This pattern is observed for all reported UFM individuals to date and is attributed to the somatic instability of unmethylated repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biancalana et al., 2015</xref>). For UFM1 repeat sizes ranged from 200 to 500 CGGs and for UFM2 premutation bands of 50 and 150 and a smear from 200 to 370 repeats were detected, indicating a mosaic status between a premutation and full mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B). Southern blot analysis and capillary electrophoresis gave comparable results for UFM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tabolacci et al., 2008</xref>) and UFM2, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>We compared the DNA methylation status of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter in the most closely related male individuals with UFM, WT, and FXS phenotypes. We analyzed 22 CpGs within the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter using bisulfite pyrosequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) purified from blood. In cells from both UFMs the mean DNA methylation was 4% and 6% for UFM1 and UFM2, respectively, compared with 0.1% and 0.3% in two WT (N-B1 and N-B2) individuals and 79% in an FXS patient (F-N1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref>). The low level of methylation in UFM PBMCs suggests the presence of fully methylated alleles and, therefore, a low level of methylation mosaicism in these individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2.2">
<title>CGG Repeat Sizes and <italic>FMR1</italic> Expression States in UFM iPSC Clones</title>
<p>PBMCs are composed of cells with heterogeneous CGG repeat size and the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter methylation status. To dissect the relationship between repeat size, methylation status, and <italic>FMR1</italic> expression, we derived iPSCs from PBMCs and performed analyses on multiple distinct clones.</p>
<p>Activated T cells were used for somatic reprogramming by Sendai viruses harboring the SOX2, OCT4, c-MYC, and KLF4 reprogramming factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). A total of 11–12 clones were characterized from each individual. All clones expressed markers of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>A) and were analyzed for the CGG repeat size, the DNA methylation status of the promoter, and the expression level of <italic>FMR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of clones obtained from both UFM individuals had repeat sizes corresponding to the spectrum of sizes observed in the PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>A). Three clones from UFM1 displayed shorter CGG repeat sizes, with either WT (UFM1-1) or premutation (UFM1-2 and UFM1-3) size. This may represent either a contraction event or preexisting lowly abundant alleles in the original PBMC samples.</p>
<p>The majority of UFM clones with repeat sizes above 200 CGGs retained the hypomethylated <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter and expressed <italic>FMR1</italic> at levels comparable with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Most of them showed discrete repeat sizes as expected from the iPSC clonal derivation procedure. All clones were analyzed between passages 5 and 10. A representative UFM clone UFM1-5 was followed until passage 22 and showed no changes in the hypomethylated status of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter and only slight CGG repeat instability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>B). We conclude that the UFM phenotype is stable upon somatic reprogramming and is maintained in iPSCs.</p>
<p>Interestingly, 2 of 11 clones from UFM1 (UFM1-10 and UFM1-11) with the highest CGG repeat sizes (&gt;450 CGGs) were hypermethylated and did not express <italic>FMR1</italic>. In UFM2 we also identified 1 of 12 clones (UFM2-12) that was silenced, hypermethylated, and carried more than 400 CGGs. However, a second silenced clone from UFM2 (UFM2-4) carried less than 200 CGGs. These silenced clones may originate from the 5% methylated alleles in PBMC samples or represent a de novo silencing event during reprogramming.</p>
<p>We conclude that in the UFM individuals analyzed in this study, the silencing threshold lies at 450 repeats in UFM1 and 400 repeats in UFM2 (yellow lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>A). However, this threshold is less evident in UFM2 where an outlier clone, UFM2-4, has been identified.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2.3">
<title>Silencing Threshold of CGG Repeat Length in FXS iPSCs</title>
<p>The above results prompted us to investigate whether the increased silencing threshold is a property exclusive to these two UFM individuals. To this end, we analyzed iPSCs from FXS patient F-N1, a nephew of UFM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the majority of F-N1 clones the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter was fully methylated, an observation in line with the described resistance of <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing to the somatic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sheridan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Urbach et al., 2010</xref>). However, we also identified two clones with active <italic>FMR1</italic> (F-N1-1 and F-N1-2) and repeat sizes above 200 CGG, but shorter than in the silenced clones. The majority of the alleles in these clones were hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref>). We conclude that in this FXS patient the silencing threshold lies around 400 CGG (yellow line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>A). Clones carrying the same size of 420 CGG were active in UFM1 (UFM1-7, UFM1-8, UFM1-9) and silenced in F-N1 (FN1-3).</p>
<p>We also derived iPSCs from an FXS individual not related to the UFM families, from which iPSCs with the active unmethylated full mutation allele of <italic>FMR1</italic> have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avitzour et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly to the previous report, one of three analyzed clones was active and fully unmethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The repeat size of this clone ranged from 250 to 320 CGGs. A faint premutation band of 80 CGGs was also detected. Nevertheless, 98% of alleles were unmethylated. A smear indicating instability of active expanded alleles was also observed. Consistent with a shift of the repeat threshold in this individual, the two silenced clones FX97-2 and FX97-3 had repeat sizes larger than 400 CGGs. We conclude that the threshold in CGG repeat size resulting in silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic> is subject to inter-individual variation not only in UFM individuals but also in a proportion of FXS patients.</p>

<title>De Novo Methylation of <italic>FMR1</italic> in UFM iPSCs Is Coupled with an Increase in the CGG Repeat Size</title>
<p>To assess whether UFM cells have intrinsic capacity to de novo silence the <italic>FMR1</italic> locus, we evaluated whether an active allele with a given repeat size can spontaneously gain DNA methylation. Under extended cell culture up to passage 22 we did not observe a spontaneous appearance of methylated alleles for a representative clone UFM1-5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>B). Therefore, we established a genetic system to select for <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing events. Our approach was based on the fact that replicating mammalian cells expressing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) enzyme become sensitive to the prodrug ganciclovir causing cell lethality, while non-expressing cells survive and proliferate upon treatment. We deployed genome engineering to drive expression of a hygromycin-HSV-TK fusion protein from the endogenous <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A).</p>
<p>We inserted a selection cassette coding for a fusion of a P2a peptide-hygromycin-HSV-thymidine kinase (Hyg-TK) protein into exon 4 of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene in iPSC clone UFM1-5 using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S3</xref>A). This setup allowed for the direct hygromycin selection of correct insertions. After selection of clones we confirmed a single integration event and analyzed their CGG repeat length, <italic>FMR1</italic> methylation, and mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S3</xref>B–S3E). The clones were maintained in hygromycin-supplemented medium to assure the absence of cells with methylated <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter. Two clones, UFM1-5-6 and UFM1-5-7, with 250 and 320 CGG repeats, respectively, were selected for further experiments. Unlike the parental line UFM1-5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S3</xref>F), the knockin clones were ganciclovir sensitive at concentrations of 5 and 10 μM after 3 days of prodrug treatment in the absence of hygromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>B, 4C, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S3</xref>F). To allow the appearance of spontaneous <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing events, we cultured cells without hygromycin for 4 weeks (∼8 passages). Subsequent selection for silenced clones was performed using 10 μM ganciclovir for 3 days. The 4 weeks of hygromycin withdrawal was necessary to observe reproducible appearance of ganciclovir-resistant clones in UFM1-5-7, and ganciclovir selection after shorter periods of hygromycin withdrawal yielded no survivals. For the line UFM1-5-6 we did not observe any stable ganciclovir-resistant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>D).</p>
<p>Most ganciclovir selected subclones did not survive passaging, especially the ones which lost the iPSC morphology. Importantly, we identified two clones with iPSC morphology and stable ganciclovir resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>E). Both subclones UFM1-5-7-1 and UFM1-5-7-2 showed full methylation of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter and CGG repeat sizes of ∼800 CGGs, indicating that the expansion of the CGG repeat led to the silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic>. We used clone UFM1-5-7-1 in a follow-up experiment to test the reversibility of the CGG expansion and methylation by applying hygromycin selection. Interestingly, upon withdrawal of ganciclovir we observed the appearance of “revertant” hygromycin-resistant clones which coincided with contraction of CGG repeats and loss of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>F and 4G).</p>
<p>We conclude that the silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic> in UFM iPSCs directly depends on the size of the CGG repeat. Furthermore, UFM cells have not lost the capacity to silence <italic>FMR1</italic>. Consistently, we did not find any mutation common to the two UFMs that would obviously impair the silencing machinery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc4">S3</xref>). Neither did we identify a common mutation in the proximal regulatory sequences of <italic>FMR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S4</xref>B–S4D).</p>

<title><italic>FMR1</italic> Silencing Status Is Not Affected by Differentiation of UFM iPSC Clones</title>
<p>The conversion of an active UFM allele to a silenced one required an increase of the CGG repeat length. However, switching from an active to a silenced state, without changes in the repeat size, underlies the process of developmental silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic> in FXS embryos and has been modeled by neuronal differentiation of FXS human ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colak et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eiges et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sutcliffe et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Telias et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated the stability of <italic>FMR1</italic> expression during neuronal differentiation of UFM iPSCs.</p>
<p>The exact time window of <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing during in vitro differentiation of FXS human ESCs to cortical neurons has been reported at day 45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colak et al., 2014</xref>). We applied the same differentiation protocol to iPSCs from two UFM individuals with variable CGG repeat sizes and <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We used four iPSC lines with unmethylated expanded repeats, namely UFM1-5 (320 CGG), UFM1-9 (420 CGG), UFM2-5 (200 CGG), and UFM2-9 (260 CGG), as well as iPSC clone UFM1-11 with methylated expanded repeats of 480 CGG. Two WT lines, either with UFM1 background (UFM1-1) or from an unrelated healthy donor 86-14, were used as controls. All lines were efficiently differentiated into class III β-tubulin/MAP2-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S5</xref>). We analyzed the expression level of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA at four time points, up to 90 days of neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>A). At day 60 we additionally confirmed the presence of FMRP by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>B). For all the lines with active <italic>FMR1</italic> we observed a gradual increase in the expression during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>A), consistent with the described dynamics of <italic>FMR1</italic> expression during neuronal differentiation of WT human ESC lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Telias et al., 2013</xref>). We also did not detect the appearance of any methylated <italic>FMR1</italic> alleles at day 90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>A). No major changes in the size of the CGG repeats were found at this time point (data not shown). Also the methylation status of clone UFM1-9, which had 8% of its alleles methylated in the iPSC state, did not change during differentiation into neurons (7%–10% in three independent differentiations). In addition, line UFM1-11, with the longest CGG repeat size (480), retained full methylation of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter.</p>
<p>We conclude that the silencing status of <italic>FMR1</italic> is a stable feature of a given repeat size in the UFM background. Furthermore, this result shows that UFM cells are not subjected to developmental silencing induced by neuronal differentiation.</p>

<title>iPSC-Derived Neurons from UFM Subjects Show Phenotypic Properties of FXTAS</title>
<p>Ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies (IBs) are found in postmortem brain samples of FXTAS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greco et al., 2006</xref>) and in mouse models of FXTAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wenzel et al., 2010</xref>) expressing the <italic>FMR1</italic> with repeat sizes between 50 and 200 CGG. Therefore, to analyze the phenotypic consequences of the expression of <italic>FMR1</italic> with more than 200 repeats, we analyzed the numbers of ubiquitin-positive IBs in UFM iPSC-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). To enhance the maturation of neuronal precursors we used a co-culture system, whereby iPSC-derived neuronal progenitors are transiently transfected with a GFP expression vector and injected into organotypic mouse brain slices (OTBS) containing cortex, striatum, and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2014</xref>). After 6 weeks of co-culture we compared the number of ubiquitin IBs in isogenic iPSC-derived neurons only differing in the repeat size. UFM1-5 (320 CGG) and UFM1-9 (420 CGG), which expressed <italic>FMR1</italic>, were evaluated for the FXTAS phenotype whereas UFM1-1 (20 CGG), UFM1-3 (150 CGG), and UFM1-11 (480 CGG) with silenced <italic>FMR1</italic> served as WT, premutation, and FXS controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We found multiple ubiquitin inclusions throughout the cell bodies of GFP-positive human neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B). We quantified the number of inclusions in both cytoplasm and nucleus and found significantly higher numbers in the UFM clone (UFM1-5) compared with WT (UFM1-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B). This effect was not observed for premutation (UFM1-3) neurons, indicating that expression of mRNA with 150 CGG repeats is not sufficient to trigger the effect. All the quantified cells in clones UFM1-1, UFM1-3, and UFM1-5 expressed <italic>FMR1</italic> as judged from FMRP staining. For UFM clone UFM1-9 with 8% methylated alleles we observed that only a proportion of neurons expressed FMRP and found a significantly higher number of inclusions only in these cells. The proportion of neurons that did not express FMRP did not show this effect, similar to neurons from FXS clone UFM1-11 with fully methylated <italic>FMR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B). Thus, expression of <italic>FMR1</italic> with expanded repeat is required for the accumulation of ubiquitin IBs.</p>
<p>In addition, we observed a dotted, aggregate-like pattern of FMRP staining in neurons derived from premutation (UFM1-3) and both UFM clones (UFM1-5 and UFM1-9) compared with an even distribution of FMRP in WT (UFM1-1) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>A and 6C). We quantified the number of these FMRP aggregate-like structures in neuronal cell bodies and found a significant increase in premutation and UFM neurons compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>C). As expected, no FMRP staining was observed in FXS (UFM1-11) neurons.</p>
<p>These data together suggest that UFM neurons may develop FXTAS neurodegenerative pathology. Moreover, some pathological phenotypes were only present or more pronounced in UFM when being compared with premutation neurons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Genotype-phenotype correlation is greatly affected by inter-individual genetic differences and external factors. This variability is particularly relevant for the penetrance of genetic variants and may explain the spectrum of clinical phenotypes. In extreme cases, individuals who carry a pathological mutation may lack disease features. Dissecting the correlation between genotype and phenotype in these individuals may provide novel insights into the disease.</p>
<p>FXS is caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5′ UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> that leads to its developmental silencing. There is a broadly accepted consensus that 200 CGGs represent the threshold above which the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter becomes methylated and its transcription is turned off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biancalana et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Willemsen et al., 2011</xref>). An exception to this rule has been identified in rare UFM individuals who do not silence <italic>FMR1</italic> despite the expansion above this threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Smeets et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tabolacci et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wohrle et al., 1998</xref>). Whether these individuals have lost the capacity to silence <italic>FMR1</italic> locus has so far remained elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that in two unrelated UFM cases <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing is not completely impaired. However, we found that the CGG repeat number necessary to trigger silencing is around 400 CGG rather than 200 CGG described for FXS patients. Analysis of iPSC clones with a spectrum of discrete repeat sizes allowed us to dissect the relation of CGG repeats with the silencing status of <italic>FMR1</italic>, previously only evaluated in primary cells and tissues with complex mosaic patterns of CGG repeat lengths. We show that in the majority of iPSC clones derived from the two UFM subjects, the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter was unmethylated and active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, clones from FXS subject F-N1 in majority were silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, also in a fraction of UFM clones with more than 400 CGG repeats <italic>FMR1</italic> was methylated and not expressed. An exception to this was the methylated clone UFM1-4 with 180 CGG repeats. It is not fully exceptional for a high premutation to be methylated, although very infrequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rousseau et al., 1994</xref>; G.N., unpublished data). Moreover, we detected ∼5% methylated alleles in blood of both UFMs, indicating that silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic> in UFM background is not an artifact of iPSCs but occurs in vivo as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>C).</p>
<p>To test whether UFM iPSCs are capable of de novo methylation and silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic>, we applied a selection pressure paradigm to unmethylated expanded alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Indeed, we found very rare events of methylation gain that were associated with a major increase in the number of CGG repeats. This demonstrates that UFM iPSCs are capable of gaining DNA methylation at the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter when the CGG size is higher than their silencing threshold. By using a reporter knocked into the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene we monitored the silencing events in the endogenous locus that allowed us to evaluate if both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> components of silencing machinery are in place in UFM cells. This is especially relevant, as the CGG-mediated silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic> has not been recapitulated in the transient transfection or randomly integrated reporter assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Solvsten and Nielsen, 2011</xref>). The result of our experiment suggests that UFM individuals possess all the necessary components for the silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic>. Consistent with this notion, we have not identified any obvious genetic mutation common to both UFM individuals by analyzing the exome sequence of components of the epigenetic machinery and the regulatory sequences of the <italic>FMR1</italic> locus, including the sequence of the CGG repeat implicated in silencing initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colak et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Little is known about why the silencing threshold lies at 200 CGG repeats in FXS. In human ESCs carrying unmethylated CGG expansions a formation of a DNA:RNA hybrid over the CGG repeat is required for silencing initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colak et al., 2014</xref>). Recently the direct dependence of <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing maintenance on the expanded CGG repeat has been demonstrated by removal of the repeat with CRISPR/Cas9 in FXS iPSCs, which resulted in demethylation and reactivation of the <italic>FMR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Here, by using a selection strategy we demonstrate that by increasing the length of the repeat an active <italic>FMR1</italic> allele becomes silenced and furthermore that it can be reverted to an active state upon a contraction event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, the dependence of the <italic>FMR1</italic> activity on the repeat length is bidirectional. Our selection system provides a tool to further study the dynamics of <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing.</p>
<p>The <italic>FMR1</italic> gene with more than 200 CGG repeats is silenced during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sutcliffe et al., 1992</xref>). This process has been modeled in human ESCs derived from embryos carrying the <italic>FMR1</italic> full mutation. In these cells <italic>FMR1</italic> is silenced during in vitro neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colak et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eiges et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Telias et al., 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, it is not possible to obtain human ESCs from UFM individuals. However, a recent study suggests that there is genetic and epigenetic equivalence of human ESCs and iPSCs with matched genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether UFM iPSC clones with a spectrum of unmethylated repeat lengths would silence <italic>FMR1</italic> in this developmental model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We neither observed a drop in the expression nor an appearance of methylated alleles at all analyzed stages of neuronal differentiation. Additionally, the silenced methylated status of cells with more than 450 CGG repeats did not change. These data suggest that the activity status of an allele with a given repeat size is maintained in iPSC-derived neurons. Furthermore, the expanded unmethylated alleles are resistant to silencing during differentiation. If the lack of methylation in UFM was a result of a maternal effect or stochastic events, <italic>FMR1</italic> would have been silenced during in vitro differentiation as observed in human ESCs carrying the <italic>FMR1</italic> full mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colak et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eiges et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Telias et al., 2013</xref>). However, our data suggest that the UFM cells possess intrinsic properties that affect their silencing threshold causing the lack of <italic>FMR1</italic> methylation during neuronal differentiation.</p>
<p>Recently, iPSCs were derived from fibroblasts obtained from another unrelated UFM subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Esch et al., 2014</xref>). The lymphoblastoid cell line from this subject has been previously characterized and showed the same epigenetic profile of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter-like lymphoblastoid cells from UFM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pietrobono et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tabolacci et al., 2008</xref>). However, the authors reported that upon iPSC derivation the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter gained methylation and the <italic>FMR1</italic> expression was shut off in all derived clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Esch et al., 2014</xref>). Inter-individual heterogeneity of the UFM group may be the cause of different results of UFM reprogramming in our study. Alternatively, different sources of the material being fibroblasts and PBMCs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Esch et al. (2014)</xref> in their two respective studies may have led to this discrepancy. However, we reproduced the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avitzour et al. (2014)</xref> obtaining a UFM-like clone from an independent FXS fibroblast line (GM09497, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which suggest that different cell type origins alone would not result in clones with different silencing status. Furthermore, the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Esch et al. (2014)</xref> are in agreement with our observation that UFM subjects retain the ability to silence <italic>FMR1</italic>. In addition, the published data may well be interpreted in favor of an altered silencing threshold. The fibroblasts used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Esch et al. (2014)</xref> for reprogramming carried the repeat sizes of 200–230 CGGs. The CGG size disclosed for two silent iPSC clones in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Esch et al. (2014)</xref> were 330 and 380 repeats. The difference between the original repeat size of the fibroblasts and the one reported in the iPSC clones with silent <italic>FMR1</italic> is in line with our hypothesis of a shifted silencing threshold in UFM individuals.</p>
<p>Our observation of the variability in the silencing threshold is not limited to the UFM group, as we also detected this phenomenon in FXS patients. From a UFM-related FXS subject F-N1 and from an unrelated patient, FX97 (derived from GM09497 fibroblasts), we derived iPSC clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). All clones from both individuals carried <italic>FMR1</italic> alleles with more than 200 CGG repeats, most of them being silenced as previously described for FXS iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sheridan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Urbach et al., 2010</xref>). However, some of the clones were active, hypomethylated, and had lower CGG repeat sizes than the silenced ones, consistent with a shift in the <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing threshold in these cells. Interestingly, in a recent report iPSCs were derived from the same fibroblasts GM09497 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avitzour et al., 2014</xref>). Among four clones one was carrying an active <italic>FMR1</italic> allele with a fully expanded repeat, while the remaining three were silenced. The exact repeat size of the clones is not reported. Nevertheless, these data show the reproducibility of our results and indicate that the shift in the repeat threshold is an intrinsic property of the cells and not a random phenomenon. Our data support the hypothesis that the number of CGG repeats that triggers the epigenetic silencing of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter may vary between individuals.</p>
<p>In our model, the persistence of the increased silencing threshold in UFM iPSC-derived neurons prevents the development of the FXS phenotype. However, the expressed expanded CGG repeat is predicted to give rise to an additional phenotype in these neurons. Individuals that carry active <italic>FMR1</italic> alleles with 50–200 CGG repeats (permutation) are at risk of developing the late-onset neurodegenerative disease FXTAS, and there have been reports of FXTAS diagnosis in UFM individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basuta et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Loesch et al., 2012</xref>). Key hallmarks of this disease are relatively large, single per cell, intra-nuclear ubiquitin-positive IBs found in postmortem brain samples from FXTAS patients as well as in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greco et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wenzel et al., 2010</xref>). At the cellular level FXTAS phenotype has been explored in iPSCs from a premutation individual carrying an expansion of 94 CGG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). However, the authors did not report on the presence of ubiquitin IBs. In the FXTAS brain samples a correlation of the CGG repeat number and the percentage of neurons with IBs has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greco et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, iPSCs that express <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA with more than 200 CGG repeats may potentially show enhanced or accelerated FXTAS phenotypes. Indeed, we find that neurons carrying more than 200 CGG repeats showed significantly increased numbers of ubiquitin-positive IBs compared with WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>B). This effect was not present in cells with silenced <italic>FMR1</italic> as judged by FMRP staining, indicating that not the expansion per se but the expression of the expended repeat is necessary to trigger the effect.</p>
<p>We did not observe an increased number of ubiquitin IBs in neurons derived from an isogenic iPSC line with a classical premutation length. It is likely that the expression of mRNA with longer CGG repeat lengths in UFM neurons results in accelerated pathological development compared with premutation neurons. Furthermore, in contrast to a single large intra-nuclear IB observed in FXTAS mouse models or in postmortem brain samples of FXTAS patients, we found multiple IBs in both cytoplasm and nucleus. The iPSC-derived neurons represent an early developmental stage in comparison with an aging brain. Developmental progression of the number and size of the inclusions is reported in FXTAS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wenzel et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the pattern of ubiquitin inclusions observed here may reflect an early stage of the IB formation at the onset of the disease. Additionally we detected that both premutation and UFM neurons show increased numbers of FMRP aggregate-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>C). FMRP has been reported to have a tendency to aggregate and spontaneously misfold toward β-rich structures in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sjekloca et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, aggregation of FMRP may be contributing to the FXTAS pathology. Overall, our data provide evidence for an increased accumulation of ubiquitin and FMRP inclusions in UFM iPSC-derived neurons, which may be signs of an accelerated FXTAS phenotype in the UFM lines compared with the classical premutation.</p>
<p>In summary, our analyses reveal that UFM individuals have not lost the ability to silence <italic>FMR1</italic>, but the size of the CGG expansion triggering the silencing is higher than the one described in FXS patients (200 CGG). Furthermore, inter-individual variability in the CGG size requited for silencing is present not only in UFM but also in two FXS patients analyzed in this study. We propose a model in which the threshold size together with the proportion of the <italic>FMR1</italic> alleles below this threshold delineates UFM and FXS phenotypes. UFM do not silence <italic>FMR1</italic> and are spare of FXS pathology; nevertheless, our data suggest that the expression of <italic>FMR1</italic> gene with large CGG expansion may increase their risk of developing FXTAS.</p>

<title><italic>FMR1</italic> DNA Methylation, CGG Repeat Length, and Expression</title>
<p>CGG repeat number in the 5′ UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> was analyzed by PCR amplification using an AmplideX FMR1 PCR kit (Asuragen) and agarose gel electrophoresis if not stated differently. DNA methylation of 22 CpGs of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter was analyzed using bisulfite pyrosequencing by EpigenDx. Expression of <italic>FMR1</italic> was quantified using TaqMan assay Hs00924547_m1 (Thermo Fisher). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref> for the details.</p>

<sec id="sec4.3">
<title>iPSC Derivation and Neuronal Differentiation</title>
<p>iPSCs were derived from activated T cells isolated from PBMCs using a CytoTune-iPS Reprogramming Kit (Invitrogen). iPSCs were cultured on Matrigel (Corning) in mTeSR medium (Stem Cell Technologies) or Nutristem (Biological Industries). iPSCs were differentiated to neurons using the dual SMAD inhibition protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>). Neuronal precursor cells derived from iPSCs were differentiated either on Matrigel or on OTBS using a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2014</xref>). For detailed iPSC derivation and differentiation protocols, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>. The iPSC lines generated in this study are available upon request for research to study FXS and related diseases if all legal and ethical standards are met.</p>

<sec id="sec4.4">
<title>Immunostaining and Image Analysis</title>
<p>Immunostaining was performed using standard procedures explained in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>, using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-class III β-tubulin (PRB-435P, BioLegend), chicken anti-MAP2 (ab5392, Abcam), mouse anti-FMRP (Sc-101048, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-ubiquitin clone 10H4L21 (701339, Thermo Fisher). Images were acquired with a Zeiss confocal microscope. Ubiquitin and FMRP spots lying within the GFP-positive human neurons were counted manually using visualization with Imaris software as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.5">
<title>Thymidine Kinase Knockin and Positive-Negative Selection</title>
<p>A P2a peptide-hygromycin-HSV thymidine kinase-stop codon-SV40 poly(A)(Hyg-TK) cassette was inserted into exon 4 of <italic>FMR1</italic> using CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination. For the details of construct generation, validation, and selection procedure, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>. Knockin lines were maintained in Nutristem medium (Biological Industries) supplemented with 25 μg/mL hygromycin. Positive-negative selection was performed with 10 μM ganciclovir without hygromycin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.6">
<title>Exome Sequencing, <italic>FMR1</italic> Promoter, and CGG Sequencing</title>
<p>Details of exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing of <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter, and single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) of the CGG repeat tract are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Supplemental Experimental Procedures</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.7">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> was performed with Prism (Graphpad) software. The unpaired Student's t test was used to determine significant differences between groups. Random samples from each mouse were taken. No mice and data points were excluded from the analysis. OTBSs that showed a severe degeneration of both hemispheres (measured as holes in the cultures) were excluded from the analysis.</p>

<p>(A) CGG repeat size in 5′ UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> analyzed by PCR in iPSCs derived from PBMCs from UFM1 and UFM2. Background color of a clone name indicates expression of <italic>FMR1</italic> based on data in (B), expressing (blue), not expressing, or expressing below 5% of WT level (red). Circles under the clone names indicate mean percentage of DNA methylation across 22 CpGs of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter based on data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref>. Silent and fully methylated clones are observed in both UFM subjects. Yellow lines indicate the proposed approximate thresholds of CGG repeat numbers triggering <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing in a given individual. The grey line corresponds to 200 CGG repeats.

<p>UFM-Like Clones and Altered Silencing Threshold in iPSCs Derived from FXS Patients</p>
<p>(A) CGG repeat size in 5′ UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic> analyzed by PCR in iPSC clones derived from FXS patients. Background color of a clone name indicates expression of <italic>FMR1</italic> based on data in (B), expressing (blue), not expressing or expressing below 5% of WT level (red). Circles under the clone names indicate mean percentage of DNA methylation across 22 CpGs of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter based on data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref>. Active, hypomethylated clones with more than 200 CGGs are observed in both FXS patients. Yellow line indicates the proposed approximate threshold of CGG repeat numbers triggering <italic>FMR1</italic> silencing in these individuals. The grey line corresponds to 200 CGG repeats.</p>

<p>Gain in CGG Repeat Number Is Coupled with <italic>FMR1</italic> Silencing in UFM iPSC Clones</p>
<p>(A) Strategy to target a hygromycin resistance-HSV thymidine kinase (HyTK) positive/negative selection cassette into <italic>FMR1</italic>. In this setup transgene expression is driven by the endogenous <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter. See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S3</xref>.</p>
<p>(B) Experimental design to select for iPSCs that silence the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter driven HyTK. Continuous hygromycin administration selects for cells that express the transgene making them sensitive to ganciclovir. Four weeks without hygromycin allows appearance of cells that spontaneously downregulate the transgene. These cells can be selected for by ganciclovir treatment. Subsequent DNA analysis identifies clones with <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter methylation events.</p>
<p>(C and D) Crystal violet staining of surviving cells after ganciclovir treatment of two knockin iPSC clones (UFM1-5-6 and UFM1-5-7) that were maintained: (C) under hygromycin selection or (D) without hygromycin selection for 4 weeks.</p>
<p>(E) DNA methylation status and number of CGG repeats of <italic>FMR1</italic> from knockin iPSC lines before and after hygromycin withdrawal and subsequent ganciclovir selection. Lanes UFM1-5-6 and UFM1-5-7 are the original clones before hygromycin withdrawal. Subclones UFM1-5-7-1 and UFM1-5-7-2 are derived from UFM1-5-7 after 4 weeks of hygromycin withdrawal and subsequent ganciclovir selection. Circles under each lane indicate mean percentage of DNA methylation across 22 CpGs of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter for a given line based on data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref>. Two ganciclovir-resistant clones, UFM1-5-7-1 and UFM1-5-7-2, gained ∼90% methylation and have increased CGG repeats (∼800 CGG) compared with the parental UFM1-5-7 (320 CGG). See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>.</p>
<p>(F) Crystal violet staining of surviving cells after hygromycin treatment of ganciclovir-resistant subclone UFM1-5-7-1. For cells maintained with ganciclovir, no surviving colonies are observed. Upon ganciclovir withdrawal, spontaneous reactivation of <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter is possible and appearance of surviving colonies is observed.</p>
<p>(G) Analysis of two hygromycin-resistant colonies obtained from subclone UFM1-5-7-1 after withdrawal of ganciclovir as indicated in (F). Parental clone UFM1-5-7 is analyzed in the first lane for direct comparison. CGG repeat sizes 320 and 150 indicate contraction events. Black circles under each lane indicate mean percentage of DNA methylation across 22 CpGs of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter based on data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref>. No methylation is observed in the surviving colonies, indicating that contraction below the silencing threshold is associated with loss of DNA methylation.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative Features of UFM iPSC-Derived Neurons</p>
<p>(A) Representative images of staining for ubiquitin and FMRP inside GFP-labeled, isogenic, iPSC-derived neurons with spectrum of CGG repeat sizes corresponding to WT (UFM1-1), classical premutation (UFM1-3), UFM (UFM1-5 and UFM1-9), and FXS (UFM1-11). The iPSC-derived neurons were cultured within murine brain slices for 6 weeks. Ubiquitin (Ubi), red; FMRP, magenta; GFP, green; DAPI, blue. Multiple ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies (IBs) are detected in UFM lines UFM1-5 and UFM1-9. Punctuated staining of FMRP is observed in UFM1-3, UFM1-5, and UFM1-9. Scale bars, 2 μm.</p>
<p>(B) Number of ubiquitin IBs per cell body of GFP-labeled human neuron. IBs ≥0.5 μm were counted. Black and gray bars represent FMRP-positive and -negative cells, respectively. Increased number of IBs is observed in both UFM clones but only for cells expressing FMRP. n = 15–50 cells per line coming from three independent rounds of brain slice injections (three mice). Data are presented as mean ± SEM; <sup>∗∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.0001, unpaired Student's t test.</p>
<p>(C) Number of FMRP foci per cell body of GFP-labeled human neuron. FMRP foci ≥0.5 μm were counted. For UFM1-9 only cells expressing FMRP are quantified. n = 15–50 cells per line coming from three independent rounds of brain slice injections (three mice). Data are presented as mean ± SEM; <sup>∗∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.0001, unpaired Student's t test.</p>
