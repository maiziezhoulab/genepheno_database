<title>Background</title>
<p>There is considerable discordance in the curve progression of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients between monozygotic (MZ) twins, indicating that nongenetic factors must be involved in the curve progression of AIS patients. Epigenetic processes may constitute one of these factors and have not yet been investigated in relation to curve progression in AIS patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The genome and methylome of peripheral monocytes were compared between MZ twins discordant for curve progression. Sets of differentially methylated sites were validated using the MassARRAY platform of Sequenome on additional samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>In the discovery study, we found evidence suggesting a lack of differences at the genome sequence level and the presence of epigenetic differences related to the curve progression of AIS patients. The top 4 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with curve severity were tested, and only site cg01374129 (CpG site located at chr8:122583383, Hg19) was confirmed in two replication cohorts. The methylation levels of site cg01374129 were significantly lower in the progression group than in the nonprogression group. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that hypo-methylation of site cg01374129 was an independent prognostic factor for curve severity. Site cg01374129 methylation as a marker achieved a sensitivity of 76.4% and a specificity of 85.6% in differentiating between samples from patients with and without curve progression (AUC = 0.827; 95% CI: 0.780 to 0.876).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Increased curvature is associated with decreased methylation at site cg01374129. Our results indicate that methylation of site cg01374129 may therefore serve as a promising biomarker in differing between patients with and without curve progression.</p>

<title>Evidence before this study</title>
<p id="p0010">Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is believed to be a complex, multifactorial disease that results from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The etiopathogenesis of AIS curve progression still remains unknown. Considerable research has indicated that the methylation of specific genes may serve as a biomarker for disease diagnostic screening and prognostic prediction. Research on the etiopathogenesis of AIS curve progression from the standpoint of epigenetics has been scarcely reported. We mainly explored the value of DNA methylation in predicting curve progression in AIS patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s0010">
<title>Added value of this study</title>
<p id="p0015">We performed the first analysis of DNA methylation differences for the etiology of AIS curve severity using a genome-wide approach and found evidence suggesting a lack of differences at the genome sequence level and the presence of epigenetic differences related to curve progression of AIS patients. Thus, we suggest that environmental factors, not genetic factors, may lead to the etiology of AIS curve progression by epigenetic changes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s0015">
<title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
<p id="p0020">Epigenetic, but not genetic, factors play a substantial role in the progression of AIS. Hypo-methylation of site cg01374129 is an independent predictor of high-risk curve progression and is a promising marker for identifying patients with a high risk of progression. Future studies are needed to validate the capabilities of methylation in predicting curve progression.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p id="p0025">Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) affects approximately 1% to 3% of children aged 10 to 16 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0005">1</xref>]. However, compared to the overall prevalence of AIS, only up to 0.1% of this population requires surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0010">2</xref>]. In most cases, once a curve has been noticed, the patient must be closely followed for the likelihood of progression. This seems reasonable for patients who are at greatest risk of curve progression. However, for those with a low risk of progression, this would increase unnecessary physician visits, cost and radiation exposure. Therefore, the ability to identify the patients who are at greatest risk of curve progression and to customize treatment for patients has become increasingly important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0015">3</xref>].</p>
<p id="p0030">AIS is believed to be a complex, multifactorial disease that results from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0020">4</xref>]. Despite high concordance rates within pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twin diagnosed with AIS, there are often considerable curve severity differences within AIS-concordant MZ twins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0025">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0030">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0035">[7]</xref>]. Additionally, bracing can decrease the progression of curves and alter the natural history of idiopathic scoliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0040">8</xref>]. This evidence strongly implicates a role for nongenetic factors in curve severity. Therefore, during the initiation phase of AIS, genetics probably has a greater role than do environmental factors, whereas environmental factors probably make a greater contribution to curve progression than do genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0045">9</xref>].</p>
<p id="p0035">It is now widely accepted that epigenetic changes, which may reflect the interaction of genetic and environmental factors, are causal to many developmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0050">10</xref>]. Of these epigenetic changes, DNA methylation has been studied intensively. Specific DNA methylation patterns ensure proper gene expression, thereby regulating various fundamental biological processes, such as cellular differentiation and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0055">11</xref>]. Considerable literature has indicated that the methylation of specific genes may serve as a biomarker for disease diagnostic screening and prognostic prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0060">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0065">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0070">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0075">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0080">[16]</xref>]. Nevertheless, research on the etiopathogenesis of AIS curve progression from the standpoint of epigenetics has been scarcely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0085">17</xref>].</p>
<p id="p0040">In this research, we mainly focused on the value of DNA methylation in predicting curve progression in AIS patients. We first identified candidate differentially methylated loci by performing epigenomic analyses within MZ AIS twins discordant for curve severity. Then, we investigated the methylation status of these loci in sporadic AIS patients who progressed compared to those who did not. Lastly, our data demonstrated DNA methylation in blood cells was associated with significant prognostic value in the prediction of curve progression.</p>

<title>Subjects and samples</title>
<p id="p0045">Two female twin pairs diagnosed with AIS, discordant for curve progression, were recruited at the Department of Orthopedics, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University.</p>
<p id="p0050">A cohort of 92 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of AIS was nested in two groups (progression group and nonprogression group) for DNA methylation studies (Cohort 1). The progression group included 50 patients who presented with a curve over 45° on the first clinic visit, and the nonprogression group included 42 patients who reached skeletal maturity without curve progression to over 30° on the first clinic visit. Skeletal maturity was defined as a documented Risser sign of 4 or 5.</p>
<p id="p0055">Another prospective cohort of 276 unrelated subjects was retrospectively reviewed to determine the prognostic value of DNA methylation in curve progression (Cohort 2). The inclusion criteria were first presented, age 10 to 16 years, untreated, with a Risser sign of 2 or below, and a Cobb angle between 10 and 25°. These patients were regularly followed and observed or treated according to their skeletal maturity as well as the severity and progression rate of the curve. Patients who had a Cobb angle of 25° to 29° with a documented curve progression of at least 5° in two successive clinical follow-ups or who had a Cobb angle between 30° and 40° were recommended to wear a brace until skeletal maturity. Patients with a Cobb angle of over 40° were offered surgical correction.</p>

<title>Whole-genome sequencing</title>
<p id="p0070">The sequencing was performed using the Applied BiosystemSOLiD4.0 (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection) system. The primary sequencing data were analyzed by using the standard SOLiD analysis workflow. The reads were aligned for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling and subsequent analysis for prioritization of candidate genes. Detected sequence variants were removed if they were present in the dbSNP, HapMap, 1000 Genomes, ESP6500, ExAC, or in-house Chinese Exome Database (1500 Chinese Han individuals).</p>

<title>Whole-exome sequencing</title>
<p id="p0075">Approximately 10 μg of DNA from one pair of monozygotic twins was sent to Genergy Biotech (Shanghai, China) for whole-exome sequencing (WES). A Nimblegen Exome V4 Kit (Roche) was used for exon capture. Exomes were then sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq3000 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. UCSC Genome Browser build Hg19 was used as the reference sequence. Realignment and variant calling were performed as previously described. All SNVs and indels were subsequently filtered against data from the databases mentioned above. Deleterious SNVs were predicted by LRT, Polyphen-2, and MutationTaster programs.</p>

<title>Zygosity analysis</title>
<p id="p0080">We evaluate relationship between individuals from two MZ pairs by estimating the probability of identity-by-descent (IBD). A full treatment of relatedness that allows for inbreeding requires a set of nine probabilities. Here, we assumed an absence of inbreeding, and we therefore needed to estimate only the three probabilities (Z2, Z1 or Z0) that corresponded to situations wherein two, one or zero pairs of the alleles were carried by two individuals at the same SNP and were IBD. These probabilities can be estimated quickly using an approximate moment method implemented in PLINK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0090">18</xref>]. To further confirm that the twins were monozygotic, we used a short tandem repeat (STR) typing kit (AmpFLSTR™ Identifiler™ Plus PCR Amplification Kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster City), which amplifies 15 short tandem repeat loci and the amelogenin locus. DNA analysis was performed on an ABI 3730× DNA analyzer with GeneMapper5.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). Kinship analysis was not performed among patients from the two cohorts, as none of them reported a family history of scoliosis.</p>

DNA was extracted by a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Then, the DNA sample was treated with sodium bisulfite (EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit, ZYMO) for conversion, and PCR was conducted for DNA amplification. The primer pairs are shown in Table S1. For each forward primer, an additional 10-mer tag was added for balance, and a T7 prompter was added for in vitro transcription. The PCR amplification that was conducted obeyed the following parameters: hot start at 94 °C for 10 min; followed by denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 62 °C for 48 s and decreasing by 0.5 °C per cycle, extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 10 cycles; then, denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 57 °C for 48 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles; and final incubation at 72 °C for 3 min. After amplification, unincorporated dNTPs were dephosphorylated (SAP treatment) by a MassCLEAVE Kit (SEQUENOM). The reaction mixture included 1.6 μl of premix and 4.0 μl PCR products. The reaction system was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and then heat inactivated for 5 min at 85 °C. After SAP treatment, 2 μl product and 5 μl RNase system (MassCLEAVE Kit, SEQUENOM) were mixed for in vitro transcription, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After all the procedures described, we used a MassARRAY Nanodispenser RS1000 (SEQUENOM) to condition the samples and spot them on a 384-pad Spectro-Chip (SEQUENOM), followed by spectral acquisition on a MassARRAY Compact System (SEQUENOM). The SpectroCHIP was supported by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF), and the resultant methylation calls were analyzed by EpiTYPER software v1.0 (SEQUENOM).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="p0100">Data were summarized using mean ± standard deviation and proportions for continuous and categorical variables. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was applied to test for differences in DNA methylation levels between the two groups.</p>
<p id="p0105">Progression-free survival was defined as the time between the first visit and the last visit before treatment or the date of last clinical visit and was used as the primary endpoint for outcome analysis. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the survival distributions. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the prognostic values of curve magnitude at presentation, curve type (single thoracic, thoracolumbar, single lumbar, double thoracic, and double lumbar), sex, age at presentation, Risser sign, menarche status (only for females), body mass index, and DNA methylation status. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was calculated, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.

<title>Identification and recruitment of MZ AIS twins</title>
<p id="p0115">Two pairs of monozygotic twins (Pair 1 and Pair 2) from the Chinese Han population were recruited in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>). We assigned Pair 1A and Pair 2A as the older sisters from each MZ pair and Pair 1B and Pair 2B as the younger ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>). All four patients were diagnosed with AIS through history and physical examinations, including a complete neurological examination and standing full-spine posterior-anterior/lateral radiographs. AIS is defined as a lateral curvature of the spine &gt;10° with vertebral rotation and no congenital deformity. Both Pair 1A and Pair 2A had a main thoracic curve with Cobb angle over 45° and had under gone surgery at our institution. Pair 1B and Pair 2B had much smaller curves of approximate 20° and had close clinical follow-ups. Their curves were &lt;30°, even after skeletal maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>).

<title>Genetic variants</title>
<p id="p0130">For Pair 1, two genomes of blood cell-derived DNA were sequenced, resulting in 39.35× and 39.06× average coverage (Table S3). The discordant SNVs and Indels from GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit) resulted in 6317 variants. After excluding nonexonic and synonymous variants, 637 SNVs, but no indels, were obtained from the whole-genome sequencing data. We then chose variants predicted to be potentially deleterious and disease-related by SIFT and by PolyPhen2 in our dataset. No discordant SNVs or indels were detected. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many scoliosis-causing SNPs in noncoding genomic regions. We then further analyzed discordant variants in intronic and intergenic regions (Table S4). None were found to be in the list, which included previously identified genes associated with susceptibility and progression of AIS (Previous identified genetic markers shown in Table S5). From Pair 2, blood samples were exome sequenced. The exome sequencing dataset had average depths of 118.69 and 105.66 for Pair 2A and Pair 2B, respectively. Exome sequencing of both twins resulted in a total of 186,257 variants prior to the discordant analysis. After applying the stringent filtering criteria, no putative discordant SNVs or indels were detected. Another way that genomes can differ is through copy number variants (CNVs). Analysis of sequencing results did not suggest any presence of bona fide CNVs between the twins.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="p0165">Several clinical parameters, including age, sex, curve magnitude, skeletal maturity, and pubertal status at presentation, have been conventionally used for predicting AIS curve progression, and researchers have developed formulae to calculate the risk of progression in individual patients based on these parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0100">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0125">25</xref>]. However, the results are not very reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0130">26</xref>]. Additionally, several SNPs were reported to be associated with curve progression, but the results had poor repeatability. Recently, Ogura et al. conducted the first GWAS for AIS progression and identified a functional variant, rs35333564 in MIR4300HG, that was related to curve progression in silico and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0135">27</xref>]. Their results provided convincing evidence that this genetic factor is related to AIS curve progression and helped to improve the prediction method. In the present research, sequencing of the genome of the twins revealed no difference in the reported genetic marker, which led us to explore other possible mechanisms causing the discordant curve severity. In recent years, epigenetic alterations, such as aberrant DNA methylation patterns, have been extensively studied across multiple human diseases, with AIS being no exception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0140">28</xref>].</p>
<p id="p0170">To our knowledge, this research constitutes the first analysis of DNA methylation differences for the etiology of AIS curve severity using a genome-wide approach. It documents the presence of epigenetic differences (differential methylation) in MZ twin pairs discordant for curve severity, as well as between sporadic individuals with large curves and those with small curves. Thus, we suggest that environmental factors, not genetic factors, may lead to the etiology of AIS curve progression by epigenetic changes.</p>
<p id="p0175">Our study has several important findings. First, we provide evidence suggesting a lack of genetic differences and the presence of epigenetic differences in MZ pairs who were discordant for curve magnitude. The use of disease-discordant MZ twins represents a powerful strategy in epigenetic epidemiology because identical twins theoretically have identical genome sequences, and recent studies have uncovered considerable epigenetic variations between MZ twins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0145">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0150">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0155">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0160">[32]</xref>]. In the discovery study, we performed next generation sequencing in two pairs of MZ twins. A rigorous discordant screening revealed no SNVs, Indels or CNVs potentially causing the twins' discordance. These results are in line with recent genetic research demonstrating that genetic differences between MZ twins, even those with discordant phenotypes, are very rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0145">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0165">33</xref>]. Therefore, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation analyses and found considerable intra-pair variation in methylation. The following replication studies confirmed a specific association between AIS curve progression and methylation status of site cg01374129 in blood cell DNA. Second, although MZ twins are matched for population cohort effects and exposure to many shared environmental factors, the observed DNA methylation differences highlight the role of nonshared environmental and stochastic factors in AIS curve progression. These findings are consistent with mounting data suggesting that environmentally mediated effects on the epigenome may be relatively common and important for disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0160">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0170">34</xref>]. Third, we demonstrate the significant correlation between DNA methylation and AIS curve magnitude across our sample cohort and highlight the importance of using epigenetic biomarkers as a predictor for curve severity. Site cg01374129 is located near hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), which encodes putative hyaluronan synthases (HAS). Hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HA) is an important structural element distributed widely throughout all tissues of the skeletal system, and its synthesis occurs at the plasma membrane of cells via membrane-bound HAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0175">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0180">36</xref>]. Roughley analyzed the spine development in mice deficient in HAS2 gene expression and found that HA production by HAS2 was essential for normal vertebral and intervertebral disc development. Additionally, the absence of HAS2 impaired the organization of both soft and hard tissue elements within the spine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0185">37</xref>]. It has previously been reported that AIS patients exhibit altered vertebral growth and wedging of the intervertebral disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0190">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0195">39</xref>]. Several researchers have suggested that abnormal spinal bone tissue is a key determinant of curve progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0200">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0205">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0210">[42]</xref>]. In the current study, hypo-methylation was found to be significantly associated with larger curves. We speculate that hypo-methylation of site cg01374129 might deregulate the expression of HAS2, impairing normal spine development and causing scoliosis progression.</p>
<p id="p0180">This study has several strengths. First, our unique sample consisted of MZ twin pairs discordant for curve severity, as well as age-matched sporadic patients. Second, to our knowledge, this study is the first using a genome-wide approach to uncover differentially methylated loci that are associated with AIS curve progression. Third, although it was a small discovery cohort, we have excluded the possible influence of inherently infrequent genomic events.</p>
<p id="p0185">This study also has a number of limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, the sample size for the discovery cohort is small, in part because MZ twins discordant for AIS curve magnitude are rare. Although our study revealed genomic similarity and epigenetic differences between the twins, other effects could also contribute to phenotype diversity. In addition, only 92 and 276 patients were recruited in the following replication study. Therefore, replication studies with larger samples are needed. Second, in the current study, the methylation status of site cg01374129 achieved a sensitivity of approximately 70%, with 85% specificity in differentiating between blood cells DNA from patients with curve progression and patients without curve progression. The addition of other prognostic tests, such as ScoliScore (Transgenomic), could probably increase the test sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0015">3</xref>]. Third, methylation is a dynamic process influenced by environmental factors. Bracing has been proved to stop the progression of scoliosis and alter the natural history of scoliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0040">8</xref>]. For patients in Cohort 2 initiating brace treatment due to a curve progressed over 30°, we did not compare the methylation status before and after brace-wearing. This issue should be investigated in future prospective studies in order to explain the mechanism of bracing at the molecular level. Forth, somatic mosaicism may play a role in the disease development, but in this research, we used only blood cell DNA for sequencing. In the future, multiple tissues, including skin fibroblasts and intervertebral disc tissue, can be used for the genetic investigations of mosaicism. Fifth, some authors have reported that the curvature of a female is more likely to progress than that of a male. We did not find this correlation in the present research. The results showed that methylation status of site cg01374129 was slightly lower in females than in males, but the difference was not statistically significant in both cohorts (<xref ref-type="graphic" rid="f0040">Fig. S3</xref> A and B). Linear correlation showed that methylation level of the site cg01374129 was negatively correlated with curve magnitude in both females (<italic>n</italic> = 67, <italic>r</italic> = −0.840, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and males (<italic>n</italic> = 25, <italic>r</italic> = −0.716, P &lt; .0001) in Cohort 1 (<xref ref-type="graphic" rid="f0040">Fig. S3</xref> C and D). These results collectively suggested that methylation status played a similar role in curve progression for females and males. Additionally, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that sex had no relationship with curve progression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0005">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t0015">Table 3</xref>). This finding was in consistent with those of Lonstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0215">43</xref>] and Lara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0220">44</xref>] but should be interpreted with caution. It is possible that sex is not a risk factor of progression for Chinese females as it is in other populations. Therefore, the role of sex in curve progression should be further investigated in larger cohort enrolling patients with different racial background in a prospective design.</p>
<p id="p0195">In conclusion, this is the first analysis of DNA methylation differences for the etiology of AIS curve severity using a genome-wide approach. In this study, we found that the methylation status of site cg01374129, which is located near HAS2, has a significant negative correlation with AIS curve severity. In addition, our results indicate that hypo-methylation of site cg01374129 is an independent predictor of high-risk curve progression. Furthermore, we highlight the use of this promising marker in identifying patients with a high risk of progression. Future studies are needed to validate the capabilities of methylation in predicting curve progression.</p>
