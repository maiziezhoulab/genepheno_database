<abstract>
<p>Couples are delaying childbearing in recent decades. While women experience a notable decrease in oocyte production in their late thirties, the effect of advanced paternal age on reproduction is incompletely understood. Herein, we observed that numerous miRNAs, including miR-574, increased in the sperm of aging males, as indicated by high-throughput sequencing. We demonstrated that miR-574 was upregulated in the sperm of two aging mouse models and was related to inferior sperm motility as an adverse predictor. Moreover, we proved that miR-574 suppressed mitochondrial function and reduced cellular ATP production in GC2 cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that miR-574 regulated mitochondrial function by directly targeting mt-ND5. Our study revealed an important role of miR-574 in sperm function in aging males and provided a fresh view to comprehend the aging process in sperm.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>An increasing number of men are fathering children at an older age than in the past. Due to societal pressures, increased life expectancy, assisted reproduction techniques (ART) and the use of modern contraception, the average reproductive age of couples has risen visibly in recent decades, with the mean age of their first reproduction in mid- or late-thirties in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. In contrast to female reproductive physiology, male functions do not stop at a defined time such as menopause, and spermatogenesis continues throughout life. Although increasing maternal age is well established as a negative indicator of fertility, reproductive success and offspring fitness, the influence of paternal age on reproduction is incompletely understood.</p>
<p>Multiple epidemiologic studies have been conducted to examine the relationship between paternal age and semen quality, and numerous studies have reported age-related declines in semen quality, including semen volume, sperm motility and sperm morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. More recently, a systematic review using data from 90 studies (93,839 subjects) indicated that semen volume, percentage motility, progressive motility and normal morphology declined with age, while DNA fragmentation increased with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. These studies suggest that advanced paternal age tends to be associated with a decline in semen quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanisms responsible for age-dependent patterns of decline in semen traits are not fully understood, but the damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS) is thought to be an important contributor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. ROS are produced in the mitochondria and their abnormal increase usually indicates mitochondrial dysfunction. Increased ROS were correlated with decreased sperm motility and accumulated DNA fragmentation at both the nuclear and mitochondrial levels, which in turn exacerbated the sperm dysfunction and abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Sperm mitochondria are involved in many essential processes in reproduction, such as sperm motility, hyperactivation, capacitation and acrosome reaction. Mitochondrial function regulation could be an instrumental strategy to modulate the sperm function, including sperm motility.</p>
<p>In addition to possible mutagenic events, aging is associated with widespread epigenetic changes, and epigenetic alterations in sperm are increasingly implicated in beneficial or deleterious effects on the sperm function, and embryo or offspring development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. MicroRNA (miRNA) in sperm could be a typical mediator of epigenetic regulation and may participate in the modulation of sperm function. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that miRNAs, encoded by the nuclear genome or mitochondrial genome, not only regulate nuclear genome encoding mitochondria-related proteins, but also could translocate into the mitochondria and regulate mitochondrial genome expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Zeng and colleagues demonstrated that miRNAs could induce mitochondrial dysfunction, increase ROS production, activate inflammasomes and pyroptosis, and promote the process of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Ran and colleagues observed that miR-151a-5p decreased mitochondrial respiratory activity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels by targeting the mitochondrial transcription mt-Cytb in asthenozoospermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. These results suggest that miRNAs might modulate sperm function through a mitochondria-dependent pathway.</p>
<p>In order to explore the expression patterns of advanced age on reproduction, our group previously performed high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs in sperm, oocytes and embryos of aging and young mice. A mass of miRNAs differentially expressed in sperm, oocytes and embryos in aging and young mice were observed. Excluding differentially expressed miRNAs in oocytes, we found that 101 miRNAs were specifically differentially expressed in the sperm of the aging and the young mice. We considered that some of the miRNAs may participate in the modulation of sperm function.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that older males are susceptible to accumulating harmful mutations and compounds. Numerous studies have identified paternal age as a risk factor for spontaneous abortion and may contribute to adverse reproductive outcomes, such as schizophrenia, autism and several X-linked recessive and autosomal dominant disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Moreover, lots of studies have demonstrated that sperm-borne miRNAs are involved in embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Microinjection of miRNAs into pronuclei (PN) stage embryos provides direct evidence that alterations of miRNA abundance in early embryo development could even induce phenotypes in adult offspring, including cardiac hypertrophy, overgrowth, obesity and behavioral defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. The microinjection of miRNAs dysregulated in sperm by a father’s chronic stress might cause targeted degradation of stored maternal mRNAs and induce a cascade of molecular events that ultimately perturb early embryo development and transmit phenotypes to the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. We wondered that whether the differentially expressed miRNAs in sperm contribute to early embryo development. To this end, we overlapped the specific miRNAs in sperm with the differentially expressed miRNAs in the embryo, and identified 33 miRNAs that might contribute to embryo development from the sperm of aging males.</p>
<p>By comparison with the validated miRNAs enriched in mitochondria from different cell lines and tissues, we found that miR-574 was the miRNA that might be associated with mitochondria. MiR-574 is highly conserved between humans and mice and has been reported to be associated with testis development and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Pan and colleagues have demonstrated that miR-574 negatively impacts oocyte quality and meiotic progression by targeting HAS2 during in vitro maturation (IVM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. We therefore hypothesize that mitochondria-related miR-574 may play a role in sperm function or even early embryo development.</p>
<p>In the present study, we sought to investigate the role of miR-574 in sperm function and early embryo development, and address the mechanisms by which miR-574 participates in the process of semen quality decrease induced by male aging. We found that miR-574 was upregulated in the sperm of aging males and was related to poor sperm motility. Moreover, we proved that miR-574 suppressed the mitochondrial function and reduced cellular ATP production by directly targeting mt-ND5. However, we only observed a downward trend of miR-574 on embryonic development. Overall, we propose the important roles of miR-574 in the sperm function of aging males.</p>

<title>Aberrant expression of miRNAs in the sperm of aging males</title>
<p>In order to explore the expression patterns of advanced age on reproduction, our group previously performed high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs in sperm, oocytes and embryos of aged and young mice (data not shown). Numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) or piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were differentially expressed between the aged and the young. Further analysis of sperm data revealed that the expression patterns of sperm from aged and young mice were markedly different. The distribution of miRNAs was higher in the aged group, while the distribution of piRNAs was higher in the young group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). As piRNAs were expressed mainly in pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids in the testes of mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], we focused on the differentially expressed miRNAs between the aged and young groups. We found 162 miRNAs that were differentially expressed, of which 160 were upregulated in the sperm of aged males. After excluded differentially expressed miRNAs in oocytes, we found 101 miRNAs that were specifically differentially expressed in sperm. As sperm miRNAs might participate in embryo development, we overlapped the specific miRNAs in sperm with the differentially expressed miRNAs in embryos, and obtained 33 miRNAs that might contain the contributor of embryo development from the sperm of aging males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). By using the online bioinformatics tool mirPath v.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>], we found that these miRNAs were mainly involved in pathways including fatty acid metabolism, protein processing, mTOR signaling, Hippo signaling and steroid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Collectively, these results indicated that numerous microRNAs were differentially expressed in the sperm of aging males and might be involved in embryo development.</p>

<title>Mitochondria-related miR-574 was upregulated in the sperm of aging males and was related to poor sperm motility</title>
<p>As numerous studies have suggested that advanced paternal age tends to be associated with a decline in semen quality including sperm motility, and mitochondria-related miRNAs have been found to be associated with multiple diseases, including asthenozoospermia, by regulating mitochondrial functions, we wondered whether the differentially expressed miRNAs from sperm of the aged and young groups could contain a number of mitochondria-related miRNAs that regulate mitochondrial function to alter sperm motility similar to their function in asthenozoospermia. By comparison of the validated miRNAs enriched in mitochondria from different cell lines and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], we found that miR-128, miR-125a, let-7b, miR-24 and miR-574 were the miRNAs that might be associated with mitochondria. Moreover, we found that miR-574 was highly conserved between humans and mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>) and has been reported to be associated with testis development and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. We then chose miR-574 for further study.</p>
<p>To confirm the small RNA-seq results, we established two aging mouse models. In the natural aging model, the older-age mice presented characteristics of aging, such as thinning of hair, and hypoactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). The body weight of aging mice was higher than that of young mice, but no significant difference in testicular weight was found between the two groups, leading to an obvious decrease of testicular organ index in the aging group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">1E</xref>). We then analyzed the sperm parameters of the two groups by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) and found a significant decrease in sperm concentration, total motility and progressive motility (PR) in the aging group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1F</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">1H</xref>). We also observed a similar decline in serum testosterone in the aging group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1I</xref>). By using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and electron microscopy, we found that the aging mice exhibited more vacuoles in the seminiferous tubules and more malformed mitochondria in the testes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1J</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">1K</xref>). These data suggested that the aging group mice presented an evident aging phenotype. We then detected the expression of miR-574 in the sperm of the two groups and found that miR-574 was significantly upregulated in the aging group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Further analysis of the relationship between sperm parameters and the miR-574 expression revealed that miR-574 expression was inversely related to sperm motility, especially to progressive motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2C</xref>), but not to sperm concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1L</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then established a D-gal-induced aging mouse model by injecting D-gal subcutaneously into the mice daily for 42 days and found that the D-gal treated mice presented few characteristics of aging in appearance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). No significant differences in body weight, testicular weight or testicular organ index were found between the D-gal-treated mice and the control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2D</xref>). Subsequently, we analyzed the sperm parameters of the two groups by CASA and found a significant decrease in sperm concentration, total motility and PR in the D-gal-treated group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2G</xref>), which was consistent with our expectations. We also observed a similar decline in serum testosterone in the D-gal-treated group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2H</xref>). By using H&amp;E staining and electron microscopy, we found that the D-gal-treated mice exhibited more vacuoles in the seminiferous tubules and more malformed mitochondria in the testes, similar to the natural aging models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2J</xref>), suggesting that the D-gal-treated mice presented an analogous phenotype of aging. We then detected the expression of miR-574 in the sperm of the two groups and found that miR-574 was significantly upregulated in the D-gal-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). Further analysis of the relationship between sperm parameters and the miR-574 expression revealed that miR-574 expression was inversely related to sperm concentration, sperm total motility and progressive motility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, we collected clinical semen samples from the Reproductive Medicine Center of Nanjing Jinling Hospital and detected the expression of miR-574 in the sperm of patients more than or less than 40 years old. However, we only observed a trend that miR-574 was seemingly upregulated in the sperm of patients more than 40 years old (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2L</xref>). It was considered that confounding factors other than age were brought in the detection and the patient fertility status might be variable and different from that of the laboratory animals. Collectively, these experiments indicated that mitochondria-related miR-574 was upregulated in the sperm of aging males and was related to poor sperm motility.</p>

<title>MiR-574 impaired mitochondrial function and reduced cellular ATP production</title>
<p>To identify the potential function of miR-574, we overexpressed miR-574 in GC2 cells by transfection of miR-574 mimics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Then, we measured GC2 cellular ATP levels and found that miR-574 could decrease ATP production in GC2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the effect of miR-574 on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Flow cytometry results showed that miR-574 increased the ratio of Q4 district/ Q2 district compared with that in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that miR-574 might cause mitochondrial membrane potential abnormalities. Moreover, ROS and DNA damage levels (marked by 8-OHdG) were detected in GC2 cells transfected with miR-574. Our results demonstrated that miR-574 significantly increased cellular ROS and DNA damage levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3E</xref>). Together, these results indicated that miR-574 could impair mitochondrial function and reduce cellular ATP production.</p>

<title>MiR-574 depletion relieved mitochondrial dysfunction and increased cellular ATP production</title>
<p>We treated GC2 cells with D-gal and found that D-gal increased the expression of miR-574. To further explore the role of miR-574, we reduced the expression of miR-574 in GC2 cells by transfection with a miR-574 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). Then, we measured the cellular ATP levels and found that D-gal decreased the ATP production in GC2 cells and that the miR-574 inhibitor alleviated this decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, flow cytometry results showed that D-gal increased the ratio of Q4 district/ Q2 district and that the miR-574 inhibitor mitigated this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, ROS and DNA damage levels were detected in GC2 cells treated with D-gal or miR-574 inhibitor. We observed that D-gal significantly increased cellular ROS and DNA damage levels, and the miR-574 inhibitor could relieve the increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4E</xref>). Overall, these results indicated that miR-574 depletion could relieve mitochondrial dysfunction and increase cellular ATP production.</p>

<title>MiR-574 regulated mitochondrial function by directly targeting mt-ND5</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that many miRNAs and the core component of RISC, Ago2/Ago3, are found within the mitochondria and miRNAs may also translocate to the mitochondrial matrix to regulate mitochondrial gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. We then isolated the mitochondrial fraction and cytoplasmic fraction and determined the miR-574 expression. We observed that miR-574 was expressed in the mitochondrial fraction, indicating that miR-574 may translocate to the mitochondria and regulate mitochondrial gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). We predicted the target genes of miR-574 within the mitochondrial pathway by the bioinformatics tool RNA22 and found an evolutionarily conserved target site in the mt-ND5 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). We next detected the mt-ND5 expression in GC2 cells transfected with miR-574 mimics or inhibitor, and found that mt-ND5 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly lower in cells transfected with miR-574 mimic and higher in cells transfected with miR-574 inhibitor than in cells transfected with negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5E</xref>). To verify the relationship between miR-574 and mt-ND5, we constructed luciferase reporters containing either the wild-type (WT) or mutated (Mut) miR-574 binding sites (seed sequence) in mt-ND5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Overexpression of the miR-574 mimic reduced the luciferase activity of the WT reporter vector but not that of the mutated reporter vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5F</xref>). It is known that miRNAs bind to their targets and cause translational repression and/or RNA degradation in an Ago2-dependent manner. To determine whether mt-ND5 is regulated by miR-574 in this manner, we conducted anti-Ago2 RIP in GC2 cells transiently overexpressing miR-574. The mt-ND5 pulldown by Ago2 was more highly enriched in miR-574-transfected cells, suggesting that miR-574 directly targets mt-ND5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5G</xref>). Moreover, we observed that knockdown of mt-ND5 would relieve the increasing trend of cellular ATP production induced by the miR-574 inhibitor in D-gal-treated GC2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, we detected the mt-ND5 expression in the sperm of the two aging models, and found that mt-ND5 was significantly downregulated in the sperm of the aging group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Together, these results indicated that miR-574 regulated the mitochondrial function by directly targeting mt-ND5.</p>

<title>Effects of miR-574 on early embryonic development</title>
<p>A previous study proved that miRNA might play a role in early embryonic development, and aging males exerted a certain level of fertility reduction and early embryonic dysplasia. However, the role of sperm miRNAs from aging males in early embryonic development is unclear. We then collected the zygotes and overexpressed miR-574 by microinjecting a miR-574 mimic into embryos to test the effect of miR-574 on early embryonic development. Our results indicated that the group injected with miR-574 showed a downward trend in embryonic development, but no statistical significance was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). One possible explanation for this phenomenon might be that the function of a single miRNA is limited and the miRNA pools containing multiple miRNAs might be needed to observe a phenotypic effect in further investigations. We then detected the ROS of the embryos injected with miR-574 and found that miR-574 could obviously increase the ROS levels in embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<sec sec-type="discussion">
<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In modern times, couples have begun to push the limits of conception to the point that children are commonly born to parents of advanced maternal and paternal age. Advanced maternal age has long been recognized as a risk factor for adverse reproductive outcomes. Advanced paternal age is also associated with increased reproductive risks, but the contributors and origins of differential risk for paternal aging remain poorly understood. Multiple effects of aging on sperm motility, sperm morphology and concentration indicate that the quality of spermatozoa declines over time, but few studies have shed light on the molecular mechanisms that hamper sperm function in older men.</p>
<p>Mitochondria participate in various biological processes, including energy production, calcium homeostasis and apoptosis, with their predominant roles differing among mammalian species. A decrease in sperm motility is a common phenomenon in aging males, and its etiology may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction due to its irreplaceable role in ATP generation. Accumulating evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction may be associated with posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by mitochondria-related miRNAs.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that numerous miRNAs increased in the sperm of aging males, and were involved in many pathways including fatty acid metabolism, protein processing, mTOR signaling, Hippo signaling and steroid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1C</xref>). miR-574, a highly conserved miRNA reported to be associated with mitochondrial function, was selected for further study. We demonstrated that miR-574 was upregulated in the sperm of two aging mouse models and was related to inferior sperm motility as an adverse predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2F</xref>). Moreover, we proved that miR-574 suppressed mitochondrial function, reduced cellular ATP production and increased cellular ROS and DNA damage levels in GC2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that miR-574 regulated mitochondrial function by directly targeting mt-ND5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of miR-574 on early embryo development and found that microinjecting the miR-574 mimic into embryos resulted in a mild decreasing trend of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies found that miR-574 negatively regulated Qki6/7 to increase the proliferation, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], while Wang and colleagues proved that miR-574 suppressed lung metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer by targeting ZEB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. In the reproductive system, Pan and colleagues demonstrated that miR-574 negatively impacts oocyte quality and meiotic progression by targeting HAS2 during in vitro maturation (IVM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]; Zhang and colleagues found that miR-574 was associated with testis development and reproduction by targeting AURKA in white yak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. In the present study, we found an important role of miR-574 in sperm function by modulating mitochondrial function and reducing cellular ATP production through directly targeting mt-ND5. Mt-ND5 is an essential subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain I, which participates in establishing the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane that can be employed by the ATP synthase to drive ATP synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Recent reports have indicated that a mutation in mt-ND5 affects the respiratory complex and accounts for the ROS-dependent DNA damage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Our group recently found that Transplantation of the high-fat diet (HFD) gut microbes into the normal-diet (ND)-maintained (HFD-FMT) mice resulted in a significant decrease in spermatogenesis and sperm motility, and mt-ND5 was significantly decreased in the testes of HFD-FMT mice, suggesting an important role of mt-ND5 in testicular mitochondrial functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>In our study, we confirmed the increase of miR-574 in the sperm of two aging mouse models and observed a negative relationship between sperm motility and miR-574. However, no such trend was observed in the clinical semen samples, suggesting that confounding factors other than age affected the detection. The cutoff for advanced paternal age used here is over 40 years old at the time of conception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>], and further study should be conducted with more stratification by age and should be performed on extensive semen samples in addition to the men attending infertility clinics. Herein, we proved the important role of miR-574 on sperm function in aging males, but the knockout or knock-in mice should be established to test the hypothesis in further investigations. Moreover, we observed that the embryos microinjected with miR-574 mimic showed a drop trend of embryonic development, with no statistical significance. Further study is required to examine the effect of pools of multiple miRNAs on early embryonic development.</p>
<p>In summary, our study delineates a miR-574-ND5 module that regulates mitochondrial function and ATP generation with respect to functional implications in the sperm of aging males. This shows that miR-574 plays important roles in sperm function and the regulatory signaling might offer a fresh view to comprehend the aging process in sperm.</p>
