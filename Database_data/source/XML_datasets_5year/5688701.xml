<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Patterning of the telencephalic neuroepithelium is a tightly regulated process controlled by transcription factors and signalling molecules. The cortical primordium is flanked by two signalling centres, the hem medially, and the antihem laterally. The hem induces the formation of the hippocampus in adjacent neuroepithelium. Therefore, the position of the hem defines the position of the hippocampus in the brain. The antihem is positioned at the boundary between the dorsal and ventral telencephalon and proposed to provide patterning cues during development.</p>
<p id="Par2">LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription factor LHX2 suppresses both hem and antihem fate in the cortical neuroepithelium. Upon loss of <italic>Lhx2</italic>, medial cortical neuroepithelium is transformed into hem, whereas lateral cortical neuroepithelium is transformed into antihem. Here, we show that transcription factor PAX6, known to regulate patterning of the lateral telencephalon, restricts this tissue from transforming into hem upon loss of <italic>Lhx2</italic>. When <italic>Lhx2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> are both deleted, the cortical hem expands to occupy almost the complete extent of the cortical primordium, indicating that both factors act to suppress hem fate in the lateral telencephalon. Furthermore, the shift in the pallial-subpallial boundary and absence of the antihem, observed in the <italic>Pax6</italic> mutant, are both restored in the <italic>Lhx2; Pax6</italic> double mutant.</p>
<p id="Par3">Together, these results not only reveal a novel function for LHX2 in regulating dorsoventral patterning in the telencephalon, but also identify PAX6 as a fundamental regulator of where the hem can form, and therefore implicate this molecule as a determinant of hippocampal positioning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par5">In development, tissues are patterned by the action of morphogens secreted by signaling centers known as “organizers.” The WNT- and BMP- secreting cortical hem in the telencephalon is one such medial signaling center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. At the lateral edge of the cortical neuroepithelium, the EGF-expressing antihem defines the boundary between the dorsal and ventral telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par6">Previously, we demonstrated that the hem is capable of organizer function, by creating embryos with multiple hems in the telencephalon, and showing that each ectopic hem induces the formation of an ectopic hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The factors that act to restrict the hem to its position at the medial edge of the cortical neuroepithelium are therefore critical determinants of where the hippocampus will form in the brain. Transcription factor LHX2 is a critical suppressor of the cortical hem. In the <italic>Lhx2</italic> null mutant, the cortical primordium cannot retain its identity, but is transformed into two alternate fates: medial cortical neuroepithelium is transformed into hem, whereas lateral cortical neuroepithelium is transformed into antihem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In mosaic experiments, <italic>Lhx2</italic> null clones in the medial telencephalon display hem fate, and those in the lateral telencephalon display antihem fate, indicating a cell-autonomous requirement for LHX2 in cortical neuroepithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Why loss of <italic>Lhx2</italic> leads to two disparate fate transformations in the dorsal telencephalon is unclear.</p>
<p id="Par7">Paired domain containing homeobox transcription factor PAX6 is required for antihem fate, which is lost in <italic>Pax6</italic> null mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. <italic>Pax6</italic> is expressed in a lateral(high)-medial(low) gradient, opposite to that of <italic>Lhx2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We hypothesized that the presence of PAX6 may restrict the medio-lateral extent of the hem in <italic>Lhx2</italic> mutants. Supporting this hypothesis, in the mosaic experiments performed in Mangale et al. (2008), PAX6 was lost in medial <italic>Lhx2</italic> null patches that formed ectopic hems, but not in lateral <italic>Lhx2</italic> null patches that formed antihem. Here, we examined medio-lateral patterning in embryos lacking both <italic>Lhx2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic>, using null mutants as well as conditional knockout strategies. We find that the hem indeed expands to encompass almost the entire dorsal telencephalon when both <italic>Lhx2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> are lost. Concomitantly, the loss of both factors appears to partially restore dorsoventral patterning that is disrupted in the <italic>Pax6</italic> single mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, an examination of the <italic>Lhx2;Pax6</italic> double mutant uncovers novel functions for both transcription factors, not seen upon loss of either factor alone. Our results show LHX2 to be a regulator of dorsoventral patterning in the telencephalon. PAX6 emerges as a key player in controlling the medial position of the hippocampus, because it prevents the hippocampal organizer, the hem, from being formed at lateral positions.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>

<sup><italic>sey/sey</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A unique feature in the double null is the presence of cleft-lip/palate, indicating a combinatorial role for LHX2 and PAX6 in craniofacial development (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1). To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of an <italic>Lhx2;Pax6</italic> double null mutant.</p>

<sup><italic>sey/sey</italic></sup> double mutants at embryonic day (E)12.5 with markers of medial telencephalic structures and compared the results with the expression seen in the respective single null mutants.

As expected, <italic>Wnt8b</italic> expression marks the medial telencephalic primordium in the <italic>Pax6</italic>
<sup><italic>sey/sey</italic></sup> mutant. In the <italic>Lhx2</italic>
<sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutant, <italic>Wnt8b</italic> is expressed in the expanded hem, sparing some lateral tissue. In contrast, loss of both genes results in the entire dorsal telencephalon expressing medial markers, apparently sparing no lateral cortical neuroepithelium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). However, the double null mutant brains were fragile and the morphology made it difficult to analyze this apparent lateral-to-medial transition properly. Furthermore, the individual null mutants of <italic>Lhx2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> are embryonic lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and both genes lie on chromosome 2, which makes it difficult to obtain homozygous <italic>Lhx2</italic>

<sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup> and control embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a, b</xref>). In <italic>Lhx2</italic>
<sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup> embryos, <italic>Wnt8b</italic> expression appears to spare some lateral telencephalic tissue, which is presumably the antihem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the <italic>Lhx2</italic>

<title>The hem expands to a greater extent upon loss of both <italic>Lhx2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> than upon loss of <italic>Lhx2</italic> alone</title>
<p id="Par11">Since loss of <italic>Pax6</italic> alone did not expand medial fates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>), we focused only on <italic>Lhx2</italic> single and <italic>Lhx2;Pax6</italic> double conditional mutants for further analysis. We administered tamoxifen at E8.5 to <italic>CreER; Lhx2</italic>

<sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup>
<italic>;Pax6</italic>
<sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup> double conditional mutant mice and harvested the embryos at E12.5. We used a set of three markers, <italic>Wnt2b, Wnt3a</italic>, and <italic>Lmx1a</italic>, to examine the extent of the hem in these mice. All three markers reveal a greater expansion of the hem upon loss of both <italic>Lhx2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> compared with that seen upon loss of <italic>Lhx2</italic> alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). We quantified the extent of hem expansion by examining <italic>Wnt3a</italic> expression in control, <italic>Lhx2</italic> single conditional mutants, and <italic>Lhx2;Pax6</italic> double conditional mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a-d</xref>). We calculated the length of the hem as a fraction of the total dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium measured up to the ventral extent of <italic>Dbx1</italic> expression in an adjacent section (<italic>Dbx1</italic> sections are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S3). We scored rostral, medial, and caudal levels separately and found that there was no significant rostro-caudal difference in the fractional hem length in a given mutant. As is apparent from the images, the hem is longer in <italic>Lhx2</italic> single conditional mutants than in control brains. The key comparison of the <italic>Lhx2</italic> single with the <italic>Lhx2;Pax6</italic> double conditional mutants reveals that the fractional length of the hem is significantly greater when both factors are lost compared with the loss of <italic>Lhx2</italic> alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). This indicates that PAX6 functions to restrict the lateral expansion of the hem in an <italic>Lhx2</italic> mutant background.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>PAX6 restricts the lateral extent to which the hem can expand when LHX2 is lost.

<title>LHX2 suppresses hem fate at the lateral extreme of the dorsal telencephalon in a <italic>Pax6</italic> mutant background</title>
<p id="Par12">Tamoxifen-driven Cre recombination is sometimes incomplete and results in patches of tissue that escape recombination. When we examined the lateral telencephalon of embryos that displayed complete recombination of <italic>Pax6</italic> but had some unrecombined patches of <italic>Lhx2</italic>, it was apparent that hem only formed where both genes were lacking (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>). That is, the presence of <italic>Lhx2</italic> in a <italic>Pax6</italic> mutant background was enough to suppress hem fate. This demonstrates that LHX2 is a suppressor of hem fate both medially and laterally, the latter function being revealed only in a <italic>Pax6</italic> mutant background.</p>
<p id="Par13">In summary, these results demonstrate that the extreme medial fate of the cortical hem can be generated at extreme lateral positions, and that LHX2 and PAX6 each suppresses hem fate. These roles of LHX2 and PAX6 are revealed only upon analysis of the double mutants, and could not have been predicted from examining either single mutant alone.</p>

<sec id="Sec7">
<title>Absence of <italic>Lhx2 and Pax6</italic> partially restores the pallial-subpallial boundary/antihem that is disrupted upon loss of <italic>Pax6</italic> alone</title>
<p id="Par14">Finally, we examined the pallial-subpallial boundary itself, since PAX6 is known to be a regulator of the position of this border [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We administered tamoxifen at E8.5 to conditionally remove <italic>Lhx2</italic> alone, <italic>Pax6</italic> alone, or both, and harvested the embryos at E12.5. The expression of both <italic>Neurog2</italic> and <italic>Gsx2</italic> stops at the pallial-subpallial boundary, with <italic>Neurog2</italic> being expressed in the pallial side and <italic>Gsx2</italic> in the subpallial side (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). Loss of <italic>Lhx2</italic> does not appear to alter these expression boundaries, though it does appear to cause an overall reduction in the level of <italic>Gsx2</italic> expression in the subpallium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). In the absence of <italic>Pax6</italic>, the pallial-subpallial boundary is known to shift dorsally, with <italic>Gsx2</italic> expression seen in the lateral region of the pallium where <italic>Neurog2</italic> expression recedes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). This is thought to be due to cross-repression between PAX6 and GSX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, since LHX2 appears to be required for normal <italic>Gsx2</italic> expression, when <italic>Lhx2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> are both lost, the expanded <italic>Gsx2</italic> expression in the lateral neuroepithelium is no longer seen, but instead, <italic>Neurog2</italic> is expressed there. Thus, despite the absence of <italic>Pax6</italic>, the additional loss of <italic>Lhx2</italic> appears to restore the pallial-subpallial boundary.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The dorsal shift of the pallial-subpallial boundary upon loss of PAX6 is restored when LHX2 is also removed. <bold>a</bold>-<bold>d</bold> Tamoxifen was administered at E8.5 to Control (<bold>a</bold>), <italic>CreER;Lhx2</italic>

The pallial-subpallial boundary (open arrowheads, <bold>a</bold>-<bold>d</bold>) appears to be normally positioned upon loss of LHX2 alone (<bold>b</bold>), but shifts dorsally upon loss of PAX6 alone, and <italic>Dbx1</italic> expression is lost (<bold>c</bold>). Upon combined loss of both LHX2 and PAX6, the pallial-subpallial boundary appears to be restored to its normal position, together with <italic>Dbx1</italic> expression.

</p>
<p id="Par15">This regulation of the pallial-subpallial boundary has an intriguing effect on <italic>Dbx1</italic> expression. GSX2 is known to suppress <italic>Dbx1</italic> and prevent it from being expressed in the subpallium, and consistent with this, <italic>Dbx1</italic> expands into the subpallium in <italic>Gsx2</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Upon loss of <italic>Pax6</italic>, <italic>Gsx2</italic> expression occupies the region of the antihem and suppresses <italic>Dbx1</italic> expression there [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, the loss of <italic>Dbx1</italic> expression in the antihem of <italic>Pax6</italic> mutants is likely to be indirect, via GSX2. LHX2 also suppresses <italic>Dbx1</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and promotes <italic>Gsx2</italic> expression (the current study). The expansion of <italic>Gsx2</italic> into pallial territory upon loss of <italic>Pax6</italic> is reversed upon the additional loss of <italic>Lhx2</italic>.

<sup><italic>sey/sey</italic></sup> brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, in contrast to <italic>Dbx1</italic>, we find that <italic>sFrp2</italic> does not reappear in the <italic>Lhx2</italic>

<italic>;Pax6</italic>
<sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup> double mutant (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S4). Since loss of <italic>Lhx2</italic> alone does not cause loss of <italic>sFrp2</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], this suggests that <italic>sFrp2</italic> critically requires PAX6 for its expression. This indicates that different molecular features of the antihem are regulated by distinct combinations of factors, underscoring the heterogeneity of this structure.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p id="Par17">This study uncovers new roles for transcription factors LHX2 and PAX6 in patterning neuroepithelial domains in the telencephalon. LHX2 was known to suppress hem fate in the medial component of the dorsal telencephalon, but we find that PAX6 and LHX2 together suppress hem fate in the lateral component of the dorsal telencephalon as well. We discover that hem fate can indeed arise at the lateral extreme of the dorsal telencephalon, almost upto the pallial-subpallial boundary, if both PAX6 and LHX2 are removed. Therefore, this demonstrates that PAX6 plays a role in suppressing hem fate. Finally, we show that the LHX2 plays a role in regulating the pallial-subpallial boundary. This is surprising since LHX2 is expressed in a gradient in the entire telencephalic ventricular zone, and does not display an expression boundary in the lateral telencephalon. This role for LHX2 is partly due to its regulation of <italic>Gsx2</italic> in the ventral telencephalon, which is a novel genetic interaction between these two developmental control molecules.</p>
<p id="Par18">Our findings are summarized in the model in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>, which illustrates how LHX2 and PAX6 interact to regulate the positioning of the hem, the expression of the antihem marker <italic>Dbx1</italic> and also where the pallial-subpallial boundary is formed. These roles for LHX2 and PAX6 are revealed only upon analysis of the double mutants, and could not have been predicted from examining either single mutant alone, thus highlighting the importance of these “classical” epistasis studies in the developing brain. More broadly, an approach that examines the functions of specific factors in the context of different mutant backgrounds may reveal unexpected spatiotemporal interactions between genes and could raise new hypotheses for the control of developmental phenomena. This may be particularly useful in understanding disorders such as autism or other neurodevelopmental diseases in which the severity of the phenotype might depend on the combinations and levels of proteins that may not appear likely to interact with each other based on standard single gene mutation studies.</p>

<title>Sample preparation and in situ hybridization</title>
<p id="Par21">Freshly harvested brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma, MO, USA) overnight and equilibrated in 15% sucrose followed by 30% sucrose (SRL Chem, Mumbai, India). The brains were sectioned at 16 μm sections using a freezing microtome and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). Sections were post-fixed in 4% PFA, washed in Phosphate buffered Saline (PBS), and treated with proteinase K (Sigma, MO, USA) (1μg/ml) at 37° C for 10 mins. One more round of post-fixing and PBS washes was performed, and, the sections were incubated in hybridization buffer (5X SSC, 50% formamide, 1% SDS) containing different antisense RNA probes at 70° C overnight. Probes were prepared using a kit from Roche per the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The next day, after washes with solution X (2X Saline sodium citrate SSC, 50%formamide, 1%SDS) at 70° C, followed by stringent washes with 2X SSC and 0.2X SSC at room temperature, the sections were washed with TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% KCl, 0.5% Tween-20). The slides were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-Digoxigenin Fab fragments (1:5000, Roche, IN, USA) for 16 h at 4° C. The slides were then washed four times with TBST and then with developing buffer NTMT (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris, pH 9.5, 50 mM MgCl, 1% Tween-20). The color reaction was performed using Nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (NBT-BCIP, Roche, IN, USA) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The incubation was performed for 10–40 h, and terminated when the color reaction had developed satisfactorily, as assessed by the intensity of signal and low background. The reaction was stopped in Tris-EDTA (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and fixed 3.7% formaldehyde (diluted in PBS from a 37% stock, Sigma for 1 h at RT.
