<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Topoisomerase 3β (Top3β), a Type IA topoisomerase, has recently drawn increased interest because it is the only one in animals with dual-activity—capable of changing the topology of not only DNA, but also RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence shows that Top3β forms a conserved complex with TDRD3 (Tudor domain containing-3), and this complex can function in both DNA- and RNA-based transactions. For example, Top3β has been proposed to be recruited by TDRD3 to promoters of several genes, including c-myc, to reduce R-loops and stimulate transcription in cultured mammalian cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This proposal is supported by reduced transcription and/or increased R-loops in TDRD3-Knockdown cells or null mice. Because there is no similar evidence from Top3β-Knockdown or knockout cells or animals, whether Top3β is required for transcription by reducing R-loops remains unknown. In addition, Top3β-TDRD3 complex can interact with the RNA-binding protein FMRP (Fragile-X mental retardation protein) to facilitate mRNA translation and synapse formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>; and to work with the RNA-induced silencing complex to promote heterochromatin formation and silencing of genes and transposons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">The finding that Top3β interacts with FMRP suggests that Top3β mutations may cause mental disorders similar to Fragile-X syndrome, which is the known leading cause of autism. Indeed, Top3β is frequently deleted in the 22q11.2 distal deletion syndrome, whose features include mental retardation and cognitive dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, smaller genomic deletions and de novo single-nucleotide variants have been identified that specifically link Top3β mutations to schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, whether and how Top3β mutation is causal for these disorders remains unclear. Neither Top3β nor TDRD3 have yet been shown to directly affect transcription or translation of genes important for neuronal function and mental health. In contrast, two other topoisomerases, Top1 and Top2β, are required for normal transcription of genes related to autism, cognitive function, neuronal-early response (NER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and neuronal survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In particular, Top2β, a Type II topoisomerase, preferentially binds promoters of transcriptionally active genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and is critical for regulated gene activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (see review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>), including neuronal activity-dependent transcription (NADT) of several NER genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Because neuronal activity can activate transcription of thousands of mRNAs and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, this process likely produces a large increase of genome-wide topological constraints within a very short period of time. We hypothesize that resolving these constraints in a timely manner may require additional topoisomerases, including Top3β.</p>
<p id="Par5">To test this hypothesis and also to investigate whether Top3β deficiency can cause brain dysfunction, we analyzed a Top3β-knockout (KO) mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These mice display shortened life-span<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and abnormal synapse formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>; but have not been analyzed for emotional and cognitive functions, nor for transcriptional regulation. Here we show that Top3β-KO mice exhibit several behavior phenotypes related to psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment, which are associated with abnormal adult neurogenesis and synaptic transmission. Notably, the brains of the mutant mice exhibit impaired NADT, which has been observed in schizophrenia and autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>; and the affected genes include many that are critical for synaptic and behavioral neuroplasticity. Our data suggest that Top3β is crucial for normal brain function; and that disruption of NADT could be one mechanism by which Top3β deletion causes mental and cognitive disorders.</p>

<title>Top3β-KO mice exhibit abnormal anxiety and fear behaviors</title>
<p id="Par6">We subjected Top3β-KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> to a panel of behavior tests. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, in the elevated-plus maze, Top3β-KO mice spent significantly less time in the open arms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>), and had fewer entries to the center (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). In the light-dark box test, Top3β-KO mice entered the light box significantly fewer times than did WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Top3β-KO mice have greater generalized anxiety level, a phenotype prevalent in schizophrenia patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Top3β-KO mice have higher anxiety and defective hippocampus-dependent cognitive functions.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Top3β-KO mice displayed increased anxiety behavior in elevated maze test, as evidenced by reduced staying time (<bold>a</bold>) and number of entries in light arm (<bold>b</bold>) (18 mice/group). <bold>c</bold> Top3β-KO mice exhibited increased anxiety behavior in light-dark box test, as shown by fewer entries into the light box (11 mice/group). <bold>d</bold>, <bold>e</bold> Top3β-KO mice showed abnormal behavior in sociability test, as revealed by increased latency to initiate the first interaction with the other mouse in three-chamber sociability test (<bold>d</bold>), and increased nose-to-nose sniffing interaction in reciprocal social interaction test (<bold>e</bold>) (12 mice per group). <bold>f</bold>–<bold>h</bold> Top3β-KO mice displayed increased fear behaviors, as revealed by longer freezing time in training (<bold>f</bold>), context (<bold>g</bold>), and cue (<bold>h</bold>) test of the FC test (9 WT and 10 KO). The FC paradigm is in (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). <bold>i</bold>, <bold>j</bold> Top3β-KO mice exhibited impaired ability to discriminate between a shock-paired context (A) and a neutral context (B). The paradigm is in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>. During training, Top3β-KO mice exhibited a significant longer freezing time when placed in context B, unlike the WT mice that showed similar short freezing time in both contexts (<bold>i</bold>). In the test day, Top3β-KO mice exhibited reduced discrimination index (<bold>j</bold>), as defined by a ratio in difference in freezing time between context A and B vs. the total freezing time. 11 WT and 12 KO mice were used. <bold>k, l</bold> Top3β-KO mice exhibited reduced learning and memory behaviors in water maze test, as revealed by longer time in finding the hidden platform (<bold>k</bold>), and explored longer average distance to the position of the platform (<bold>l</bold>) (7 mice/group).

<p id="Par7">In the three-chamber sociability test, Top3β-KO mice showed increased latency before the first investigation with the target mouse (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). In the free social interaction test, they exhibited longer nose-to-nose sniffing time in the initial 4 min of interactions with the other mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). These data suggest that Top3β-KO mice have abnormal social interactions, a hallmark of autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par8">Next, we performed a fear conditioning (FC) test (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>), which evaluates the extent to which mice can learn and remember the context (test chamber) or an auditory cue that are associated with an aversive stimulus (electric shock) by training. During the training phase, Top3β-KO mice exhibited longer freezing times (complete absence of motion) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>), indicating increased fear behaviors. Notably, in both contextual and cue tests, Top3β-KO mice displayed significantly longer freezing times (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g, h</xref>), suggesting that they have enhanced memory to FC, which has been observed in some mouse models of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The data support the link between Top3β deletion and the disorder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Top3β-KO mice have defective hippocampus-dependent cognition</title>
<p id="Par9">Conditioned fear memory is influenced by hippocampus function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and Top3β mRNA is highly expressed in hippocampus [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org">http://mouse.brain-map.org</ext-link>]. This prompted us to perform two tests that examine hippocampus-dependent cognitive function. One is context discrimination test, measuring the ability of the mice to distinguish two contexts (A and B) that are paired and unpaired with electric shocks, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. During the initial training to electric shocks, all mice showed similar short freezing time in context A prior to the shock (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1i</xref>). Notably, when placed in context B 4 h later, Top3β-KO mice froze significantly longer than in context A, in contrast to wild-type mice that show short freezing time comparable to that of pre-shock freezing in context A, indicating that Top3β-KO mice are defective in discriminating the two contexts. In the test day, both Top3β-KO and WT mice displayed significantly shorter freezing time in context B than that in A (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). However, the discrimination index, which is defined by the difference in freezing time between A and B vs. the total freezing time, was significantly lower in Top3β-KO (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1j</xref>). The data are consistent with the results from the training day and suggest that Top3β inactivation impairs hippocampus-dependent cognitive function.

<p id="Par10">The 2nd test is Morris water maze, which measures the ability of the mice to learn and remember the location of an escape platform hidden in the water. Top3β-KO mice had a longer latency to find the platform over days of training than WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1k</xref>), indicating defective learning. Moreover, when the platform was removed for a 60-s probe trial 4 h after the last training session, the KO mice showed impaired retention of the spatial memory, because they explored in areas further away from the platform, as measured by average distance to the platform (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1l</xref>).

<p id="Par16">Similar to previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, we detected Pol II peaks at transcription start-sites (TSS) and exons of all four NER genes in WT mouse brains; and these peaks were increased when mice were treated with FC (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>).

<p id="Par18">To determine which step is defective during transcription in Top3β-KO mice, we performed ChIP-seq with phospho-specific antibodies against initiation or elongation forms of Pol II, which are marked by phosphorylation at Ser-5 (p-Ser5) or Ser-2 (p-Ser2), respectively, within the CTD repeats of the polymerase.

<title>TDRD3 and Pol II bind NER genes similarly in response to FC</title>
<p id="Par20">To determine if the Top3β-TDRD3 complex directly binds the above NER genes, we performed ChIP-seq and detected a peak of TDRD3 at TSS of these genes in WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). Notably, TDRD3 showed increased signals at both TSS and exons in WT mice treated with FC, which resemble the increased Pol II signals, suggesting that in response to FC, the Top3β-TDRD3 complex may bind TSS, and then move along with Pol II on DNA to stimulate both transcriptional initiation and elongation. In comparison, TDRD3 ChIP signals from brains of Top3β-KO mice were lower than those of WT mice under FC (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>), which is expected because TDRD3 stability is lower in the absence of Top3β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, indicating that the TDRD3 signals observed are specific.</p>

The average of Pol II signals for 45 NER genes was increased by 1.9- and 1.6-fold at TSS and exons, respectively, in WT mice; but 1.1-fold and no significant change in Top3β-KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9a</xref>). Similarly, the average of RNA-seq signals for the 45 NER genes was increased by 2.0-fold in WT, but unchanged in Top3β-KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9b</xref>). 12 of the 45 NER genes exhibited significant increase of RNA-seq signals in WT mice, whereas none did in Top3β-KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f, g</xref>). These 12 Top3β-dependent NER genes identified by RNA-seq overlapped with those by Pol II ChIP-seq (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g, h</xref>), providing additional evidence that they depend on Top3β for NADT. Notably, majority of NER genes (about 80%) that depend on Top3β for FC-induced Pol II binding or RNA induction exhibited TDRD3 binding under FC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8a, b</xref>), suggesting that these genes may be directly regulated by Top3β-TDRD3 complex during NADT. Consistent with this, 21 of 45 NER genes (47%) displayed at least 1.5-fold lower Pol II signals in exons in Top3β-KO mice compared to WT mice under FC, in contrast to the no-treatment group in which only one gene showed significantly lower signals (<italic>Jun</italic>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9c</xref>).

<title>Top3β is required for global NADT</title>
<p id="Par23">Detailed analysis of our Pol II ChIP-seq data showed that Top3β is critical for NADT of not only NER genes, but also thousands of other genes under FC. First, scatter plots revealed that in WT mice, a large fraction of genes showed higher Pol II signals at both exons and TSS in response to FC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a, b</xref>; more data points are above the equal line), indicating that FC-induced global NADT. In contrast, in Top3β-KO mice, the number of genes with increased and decreased Pol II signals are about equal, indicating defective global NADT. Second, the averages of Pol II signals at both TSS and exons of all genes were significantly increased in response to FC in WT mice, but this increase became smaller or absent in Top3β-KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). Third, the averages of Pol II signals in Top3β-KO mice were lower than those in the WT mice with FC, but they were identical without FC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). Fourth, the average intensity of the Pol II peak near TSS is higher in WT than Top3β-KO mice under FC, but not significantly different without FC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>).

<title>TDRD3 preferentially binds TSS of genes activated by FC</title>
<p id="Par25">We found that TDRD3 signals are enriched strongly at promoters, weakly in exons, but not in introns or intergenic regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). The average intensity of TDRD3 signals for all genes peaked immediately upstream of TSS, and became stronger when mice were under FC (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10a</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). This pattern mimics that of Pol II (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>), suggesting that in response to neuronal activation, Top3β-TDRD3 may be co-recruited with Pol II to the same TSS to activate their transcription. This notion is supported by the following evidence. First, TDRD3 and Pol II signals are co-localized at the same TSS of many genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>; Supplementary Figs <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">11c, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">12c</xref>).

Third, Venn analysis shows that a large number of genes (42%) with FC-induced TDRD3 binding also have FC-induced Pol II increase; and majority (70%) of genes with FC-induced Pol II signals also have TDRD3 binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>, top). Fourth, the TDRD3-bound genes have significantly higher average of intensity of Pol II signals at TSS than TDRD3-unbound genes in FC-treated WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10c</xref>, left).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>TDRD3 preferentially binds transcriptionally active genes depending on Top3β in NADT.</title><p><bold>a</bold> A graph shows genome-wide distribution of TDRD3 ChIP-seq signals in WT mice treated with FC.

<title>TDRD3-bound genes show stronger dependence on Top3β for NADT</title>
<p id="Par26">Our Venn analysis revealed that majority of genes (62%) with FC-induced TDRD3 binding also have reduced Pol II signals in FC-treated Top3β-KO mice; and even more genes (84%) with reduced Pol II signals in FC-treated Top3β-KO mice have TDRD3 binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>, bottom; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>). These strong overlaps suggest that Top3β-TDRD3 likely directly binds and promotes NADT of its target genes. In support of this, the average Pol II intensity at TSS for TDRD3-bound genes is significantly lower in Top3β-KO than WT mice under FC, in contrast to that for TDRD3-unbound genes that shows no significant difference (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>). Moreover, TDRD3 signals at TSS exhibited a negative correlation with the ratio between Pol II signals of Top3β-KO mice vs. WT mice under FC (<italic>r</italic> = −0.67) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10d</xref>, left), suggesting that Top3β-TDRD3 preferentially binds genes that show reduced NADT without Top3β. Furthermore, the correlation and slope between TDRD3 binding at TSS vs. FC-induced increase of Pol II signals was smaller in Top3β-KO than WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10b</xref>, right vs. left), providing additional evidence that Top3β-TDRD3-bound genes are more impaired in NADT in the absence than presence of Top3β.</p>
<p id="Par27">We noted that without FC, the average intensity of Pol II peak at TSS was not significantly changed in Top3β-KO mice for either TDRD3-bound or -unbound genes, in contrast to the FC-treated group, which showed significant Pol II reduction for TDRD3-bound genes in Top3β-KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10c</xref>, right vs. left). These data suggest that Top3β-TDRD3-bound genes have stronger dependence on Top3β for activated than basal transcription, which resemble the results from all genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). This conclusion is also supported by findings that the negative correlation and slope between TDRD3 signals and the ratio of Pol II signals of Top3β-KO vs. WT mice are smaller without FC than with the treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10d</xref>, right vs. left).</p>

The data suggest that synapse and neurogenesis-related genes may exhibit overall reduced transcription in Top3β-KO mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par36">Top3β mutations have been linked to several psychiatric and cognitive disorders, but whether they are causal remains unclear. Here we show that Top3β-KO mice display several abnormal behaviors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) present in schizophrenia and/or autism-spectrum disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, suggesting that Top3β deletion could be causal for these disorders in its human carriers.</p>
<p id="Par37">The abnormal behaviors displayed in Top3β-KO mice overlap but are not identical to those of known mouse models of schizophrenia and autism (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">8</xref>). For example, although Top3β interacts with FMRP, the phenotypes of Top3β-KO mice are not identical to those of the Fmr1 mice (an autism model). In the light-dark test, Top3β-KO mice spent more time in the dark than light boxes, whereas Fmr1 mice show no preference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In the FC test, Top3β-KO mice displayed an increase of contextual fear memory, whereas Fmr1 mice showed a decrease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the divergence of Top3β-KO mice in memory behaviors—enhanced fear memory in FC test but reduced spatial memory in Morris water maze and contextual discrimination tests—resemble an AD mouse model (3xTg-AD) at young age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Overall, these data argue that Top3β-KO mouse is not a simple schizophrenia or autism model, but rather, shares features with several psychiatric and cognitive disorders. This fits well with human genetic data that Top3β mutation carriers have a spectrum of behavioral alterations related to multiple psychiatric disorders. It is also consistent with our Pol II ChIP-seq data that Top3β deletion disrupts NADT of many genes, which include those from several neurological disorders.</p>
<p id="Par38">It is known that adult neurogenesis and synaptic functions in hippocampus are important for learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. We found that both processes are defective in Top3β-KO mice, which could explain the cognitive dysfunctions observed in humans and mice with Top3β deletion. Notably, the impaired synaptic plasticity phenotype in Top3β-KO mice resembles those observed in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and a mouse model (DISC1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> of schizophrenia, as well as in several autism mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Similarly, the decreased adult neurogenesis phenotype was also seen in the schizophrenia model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. We found that both LTP and LTD at hippocampal CA1 synapses were impaired in Top3β-KO mice, whereas PPF was not, suggesting a postsynaptic deficit in the Top3β-KO mice.</p>
<p id="Par39">This study shows that Top3β plays a crucial role in NADT, which is essential for developmental and adult neuroplasticity, and has been linked to multiple mental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We propose a model that neuronal activity activates transcription of thousands of genes and enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, producing a sharp increase of topological constraint in the genome within a very short period of time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>). Top3β-TDRD3 complex may bind these genes and enhancers via TDRD3-mediated interactions with arginine-methylated CTD motifs of Pol II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> to relieve the topological constraint, leading to transcription of genes important for mental health and cognitive function. In support of this model, many genes linked to mental disorders, such as dementia, AD, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders, show reduced Pol II signals in Top3β-KO mice. Moreover, a number of genes important for learning and memory, synapse function and neurogenesis also show reduction. The defective transcription of these genes may provide another explanation for the observed behavioral abnormalities in humans and mice carrying Top3β deletion.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><title>A model illustrates how Top3β-TDRD3 complex and Top2β works together to promote NADT.</title><p>The model suggests that basal transcription produces low topological stress, so that the requirement for topoisomerases is low. Neuronal activity activates transcription of thousands of genes and enhancers, and thus induces a drastic increase of topological stress, including positive and negative supercoils, within a very short period. Top3β-TDRD3 complex is then recruited to these genes through Tudor domain-mediated interactions with arginine-methylated CTD of Pol II. Top3β can create transient SSBs to relax the negative supercoils generated during transcription and reduce R-loop formation (which inhibits transcription). Top1 can also generate transient SSBs to relax the positive supercoils. Transcription can then proceed normally. For some NER genes, there exist other topological barriers that prevent interactions between transcription machinery at enhancers and promoters. These genes require participation of Top2β to produce DSBs to overcome the topological barriers and enable assembly of activated transcription complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In the Top3β-mutant mice, global neuronal activity-activated transcription is impaired, due to failure to efficiently relieve topological stress. The affected genes include many that are important for neural development, mental health, and cognitive function. The defective transcription of these genes may contribute to the mental and cognitive disorders.</p></caption><graphic id="d30e1991" xlink:href="41467_2020_16884_Fig9_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par40">It has been demonstrated that Top2β-mediated formation of DSBs is required for NADT of several NER genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We found that NADT of these NER genes also depend on Top3β (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>). The data suggest that for these genes, different types of topological constraint may have been produced, which require actions by both Type I (Top3β) and II (Top2β) topoisomerases to resolve (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>). Indeed, the two topoisomerases share several common features: enriched at promoters, preferentially binds active genes, and localizes in active chromatin marks. Moreover, the signals of these two topoisomerases at TSS showed positive correlation, and their bound genes showed co-clustering. Together, these data suggest that TDRD3-Top3β may work with Top2β to stimulate transcription of many genes in neurons.</p>

The sociability apparatus (59 cm long × 29 cm wide × 22 cm tall) constructed of clear Plexiglas was divided into 3 equal-sized chambers with small doorways (5 cm wide × 8.5 cm tall) connecting each side chamber to the central chamber. Target mice were placed in custom-built cylinders (6.5 cm diameter × 12 cm tall) with walls of 3mm-wide stainless-steel rods spaced 7.5 mm apart to permit visual and olfactory interaction between test and target mice while preventing aggressive interactions. Each test session began with a 10 min habituation of test mouse into the sociability apparatus. Test mice were briefly removed from apparatus, and then cylinders were placed in both side chambers, with one empty and one containing a 4–5-week-old male C57Bl/6 J wild-type target mouse. The test mouse was then returned to the center chamber to commence a 5-min sociability test. An overhead camera was used with ANY-Maze software to score the length of time in chambers by the test mouse. 12 WT and 12 Top3β-KO mice of all males are used in this assay.</p>
<p id="Par45"><italic>Reciprocal social interaction</italic>: Social interaction test was performed in a 25 × 25 × 20 cm opaque Plexiglas chamber under dim white lighting. After 30 min of habituation alone in the chamber, a 4–5 weeks old male juvenile mouse (C57Bl/6J albino, homozygous for Tyrc-2J gene; Jax stock 000058) was added in the chamber with the testing animal. The social interaction behavior was recorded for 10 min using a video camera. Frequency and duration of each social parameter detected in the test subject mouse were subsequently automatically analyzed using Noldus Ethovision XT (Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA). Because mice were identified by the software by different colored fur, no paint or other markings were required. Parameters scored included following, nose-to-nose sniffing, nose-to-anogenital sniffing, sniffing of other body regions, and close following. 11 WT (6 males and 5 females) and 11 Top3β-KO (5 males and 6 females) mice were examined.</p>
<p id="Par46"><italic>Fear conditioning test</italic>: Mice were tested for fear conditioned memory using a Video Fear Conditioning system (Med Associates). Conditioning chambers consist of plexiglass enclosure with stainless-steel grid rod flooring. In the conditioned training, mice were placed into the chamber for a total of 300 s. After 120 s of habituation, mice were presented with a 30 s tone that co-terminated with a 2 s, 0.5 mA electric foot shock. This was repeated for a total of three tone-shock pairings with an interval of 30 s between tone presentations. Twenty-four hours after conditioning, the mice were tested by a contextual experiment in the same chamber for 300 s without tone and electric foot shock stimuli. Three hours after the contextual test, cued testing was performed. Total time of the cued test was 600 s and the testing environment was altered by a smooth plastic floor covering the metal rods and a triangle shaped plastic insert above the inside of the chamber. After 300 s of resting time, animals were exposed to 3 tones of 30 s each with 30 s intervals. The Video Freeze software measured and recorded freezing behavior displayed by the mice during testing. 9 WT (4 males and 5 females) and 10 Top3β-KO (4 males and 6 females) mice were examined.</p>
<p id="Par47"><italic>Context discrimination test</italic>: Mice were tested for ability to distinguish between a shock-paired environment (context A) and a neutral environment (context B). The specificity of freezing response to the correct environment is impaired by lesion of dorsal hippocampal tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and enhanced following increased hippocampal neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Two distinct contexts were used (“A” and “B”) that differed in floor texture, wall shape, white vs infrared lighting, and odor. Housing rooms and transport method to and from the fear conditioning room were also different depending on which context was being used. Prior to training, mice were placed in context A for 10 min in the morning and context B in the afternoon for 10 min. 24 h later, training began and mice were put in context A for a total of 180 s. After 148 s of habituation (pre-shock period), mice were shocked by a 2 s, 0.5 mA electric foot shock. Context A chamber consists of straight 90-degree walls with stainless-steel grid rod flooring. White lighting in the box was on and 2 μl of mint extract (McCormick; Hunt Valley, MD) was put in the collection tray of the box. Four hours later, the mice were placed in context B for 180 s without shock. Context B consists of smooth plastic floor covering the metal rods and a triangle shaped plastic insert above the inside of the chamber. White lighting in the box was off and it was illuminated by near infrared lighting only. Additionally, 2 μl of orange extract (McCormick) was put on the ceiling of the chamber. Video Freeze software (MED-Associates; St Albans, Vermont) was used to measure and record freezing behavior displayed by the mice during testing. All freezing scoring was done using default settings of the software. The analysis was made on the pre-shock time between context A and Context B on training and test days. 11 WT (all males) and 12 Top3β-KO, mice of all males were examined.</p>
<p id="Par48"><italic>Morris water maze test</italic>: This test followed a previous protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. The platform was 15 × 15 cm square and the water temperature was 23 °C. We ran one trial for each mouse before moving to the next trial, resulting in inter-trial intervals of approximately 15 min. The tub was filled with water to 0.5–1.0 cm above platform. Non-toxic white paint was used to render the platform invisible to mice in the water. Each animal performed 4 trials/day, starting from each of the four compass directions. During each day, mice were tested following a pseudorandom order that was maintained for all mice on that day. ANY-Maze software recorded and measured the time required to each mouse to reach the platform. Mice that did not reach the platform within 60 s, were gently guided towards it and left there for additional 15 s. 4 h following the last training, mice were placed in water without platform for the first probe trial. ANY-Maze recorded the time in each quadrant for 60 s. 7 WT and 7 Top3β-KO mice of all males were examined.</p>
<p id="Par49"><italic>Open field test</italic>: The test mouse was placed on the square box (43 × 43 cm, height 30 cm) for open field test. Traveling distance was automatically measured by three 16-bean IR arrays for 30 min for each mouse. Time in center, number of center entries, and center distance were tracked. Recording and analysis were performed by Activity Monitor Software (Version 4.0, Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). 13 WT and 12 Top3β-KO mice of all males were used in the test.</p>
<p id="Par50"><italic>Rotarod test</italic>: Five-lane rotarod (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) was used to define motor function in Top3β-KO mice. Individual mouse was tested for 5 min per day for 3 days. After the mouse was placed on the rod for 10 s, the rod speed was accelerated from 3 to 30 rpm. We recorded the latency to the first fall and the total number of falls. 7 WT and 7 Top3β-KO mice of all males were tested.</p>
<p id="Par51">F<italic>orced swim test</italic>: A cylinder beaker (10 cm in diameter and 25 cm height) with water (24~25 °C temperature) was used for the test. Individual mouse was placed in the water for 6 min. Their behaviors were recorded by a camera. The data were analyzed for time of immobility and mobility in the last 4 min of testing. Genotype information was blinded during the analysis. 7 WT and 7 Top3β-KO mice of all males were tested.</p>
<p id="Par52"><italic>Spontaneous alternation</italic>: Y maze (each arm: 7.62 cm × 38.1 cm, height 12.7 cm) with non-visible gray color was used for spontaneous alternation test. Each mouse was placed in the center area to start the test. Their behaviors were recorded by performers. The arms that are entered and explored by the test mouse consecutively for 10 min are determined. 7 WT and 7 Top3β-KO mice of all males were tested.</p>
<p id="Par53"><italic>Prepulse inhibition</italic>: Mice were contained in plexiglas cylinders that allowed moderate movement, which were housed within sound-attenuated cubicles. After a 5 min habituation period mice were presented with 40 ms pulses of white noise at increasing amplitudes, with 20–30 s intervals between each presentation. Noises were presented in order from low to high amplitude, with the full sequence repeated a total of five times. Startle response was measured by accelerometer that measured maximal force applied (Vmax) in the 50 ms period following noise presentation (SR-Lab; San Diego Instruments). The next day mice were tested for prepulse inhibition. Following habituation, mice were presented with 105 dB, 40 ms startle noise presentations in the presence or absence of 20 ms “prepulse” noise presentations that occurred 30 or 70 ms prior to the startle presentation and were 70 or 80 dB in amplitude. Each of the five possible trial types was presented in randomized order within a block, for six blocks. Data was analyzed and graphed as percent inhibition of Vmax response during no-prepulse trials. 6 WT and 5 Top3β-KO mice of all males were tested.</p>
<p id="Par54"><italic>Buried food test:</italic> Procedures were based on a published protocol (Yang &amp; Crawley 2009; Curr Prot Neurosci). Mice were habituated for 3 days with exposure to food overnight (50 mg pieces of cheese) by introducing three pieces of cheese per mouse per cage. Mice were fasted for 16–20 h prior to testing. One hour before testing, mice were transferred to new cages containing 5 cm deep corncob bedding, where they were individually housed. Mice were temporarily removed from the cage and a single 50 mg piece of cheese was buried at the bottom of one end of the cage. The mouse was returned to the cage and the time for the mouse to find and retrieve the food was measured. 6 WT and 5 Top3β-KO (all male) mice were tested.</p>

Reads with &gt;3 matches in the genome were ignored, and the weight of other reads was set to 1/<italic>n</italic>, where <italic>n</italic> = the number of matches. No more than 5 reads with identical start and end coordinates were accepted in the calculation to avoid PCR-amplification bias. For ChIP-seq calculation, the intensity of protein binding to gene exons and TSS region (from −700 to +700 bp) was estimated in FPKM units, where total reads were counted in all transcripts, using a custom Perl program. To combine multiple replications of ChIP-seq data (5 replications under FC and 4 replications without treatment), we normalized values to wild-type mice without treatment in the same experiment. Statistical significance was evaluated using 2-way ANOVA test of log-transformed ChIP-intensity values, followed by pair-wise comparison of means using mean square error for each gene (or for each point in profiles at TSS). To select genes with FC-dependent binding of Pol II at the TSS region, we used False Discovery Rate (FDR) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.

Data were acquired when the mice were 2–3 months of age. A 72 mm diameter birdcage-design resonator was used for pulse transmission (Bruker), while signal reception was performed with a two-channel array coil designed for the mouse head (RAPID MRI International, Columbus, Ohio). Animals were anesthetized throughout using a snout mask. Induction was performed using isoflurane in oxygen in a 2.5% v/v mixture. After induction and during acquisition of MRI data, anesthesia was maintained with a 1–2% v/v mixture. Homeostasis to maintain a breathing rate of 40–60 breaths per minute was achieved by ongoing adjustment of the concentration of isoflurane. Heart rate and temperature were also monitored throughout the experiments using an SA Instruments MR-compatible model 1025 physiological monitoring system (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY), with a pneumatic respiration transducer and a fiber optic rectal temperature probe. This also permitted control of body temperature throughout the MRI scans; the temperature unit provided input to a feedback system regulating a flow of warm air (SA instruments blower) around the anesthetized animal. A set of 12 contiguous coronal slices, each of 1 mm thickness, was positioned to obtain imaging data covering the brain from the olfactory bulb to the brain stem. Imaging parameters included a 30 mm × 20 mm (left-right x anterior–posterior) field of view. Diffusion-weighted scans were acquired with voxels of size 117 × 156 × 1000 μm, with pixel resolution of 256 × 128. A spin-echo diffusion pulse sequence with fat suppression was implemented with parameters including repetition time TR = 4 s, echo time TE = 30 ms, gradient separation Δ = 14 ms, gradient duration δ = 7 ms, b value for diffusion-sensitization in the slice (H/F) direction of 200 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, with signal averaging over two acquisitions, resulting in a 17 min scan duration. Inversion-prepared spin-echo scans were also obtained. Imaging parameters included a voxel size of 313 × 156 × 1000 μm, with pixel resolution of 96 × 128 pixels. Sequence parameters of TR = 6 s, TE = 7.5 ms, and inversion time TI = 604 ms were used. Data were again averaged over two acquisitions, resulting in a scan duration of 25 min. After data acquisition, analysis of the images was performed using Bruker ParaVision 5.1 software. Regions of interest (ROI’s) defining the ventricles were drawn on all ventricle-containing slices obtained with the inversion-prepared sequence. After defining these ROIs, a calculation of the number of pixels contained in them was performed. This number was multiplied by the voxel volume, resulting in a measurement of ventricular volume. Total brain volume was determined similarly, using ROI’s that outlined the brain on each slice of the diffusion-weighted images. Brain volume was then calculated from the total number of pixels contained in these ROI’s through multiplication by voxel volume. 4 WT and 8 knockout male mice were used in the analysis.</p>
