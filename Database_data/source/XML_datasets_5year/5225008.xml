<abstract>
<p>Familial apparently balanced translocations (ABTs) segregating with discordant phenotypes are extremely challenging for interpretation and counseling due to the scarcity of publications and lack of routine techniques for quick investigation. Recently, next generation sequencing has emerged as an efficacious methodology for precise detection of translocation breakpoints. However, studies so far have mainly focused on <italic>de novo</italic> translocations. The present study focuses specifically on familial cases in order to shed some light to this diagnostic dilemma. Whole-genome mate-pair sequencing (WG-MPS) was applied to map the breakpoints in nine two-way ABT carriers from four families. Translocation breakpoints and patient-specific structural variants were validated by Sanger sequencing and quantitative Real Time PCR, respectively. Identical sequencing patterns and breakpoints were identified in affected and non-affected members carrying the same translocations. <italic>PTCD1</italic>, <italic>ATP5J2-PTCD1</italic>, <italic>CADPS2</italic>, and <italic>STPG1</italic> were disrupted by the translocations in three families, rendering them initially as possible disease candidate genes. However, subsequent mutation screening and structural variant analysis did not reveal any pathogenic mutations or unique variants in the affected individuals that could explain the phenotypic differences between carriers of the same translocations. In conclusion, we suggest that NGS-based methods, such as WG-MPS, can be successfully used for detailed mapping of translocation breakpoints, which can also be used in routine clinical investigation of ABT cases. Unlike <italic>de novo</italic> translocations, no associations were determined here between familial two-way ABTs and the phenotype of the affected members, in which the presence of cryptic imbalances and complex chromosomal rearrangements has been excluded. Future whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing will potentially reveal unidentified mutations in the patients underlying the discordant phenotypes within each family. In addition, larger studies are needed to determine the exact percentage for phenotypic risk in families with ABTs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Apparently balanced translocations (ABTs) involve the exchange of genomic regions between non-homologous chromosomes, without the gain or loss of genetic material. The majority of ABT carriers are phenotypically normal; however, an association with abnormal phenotypes, including intellectual disability (ID) and other congenital abnormalities, has been estimated in 6–9% of <italic>de novo</italic> cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref002">2</xref>]. For familial ABTs present in phenotypically normal individuals, it is generally considered that the risk of phenotypic abnormality in their balanced offspring is very low. Even though the risk is low, there are many cases reported where ABTs present in phenotypically normal carriers have been associated with abnormal phenotypes in related patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how familial ABTs can be implicated in the development of this type of clinical discordancy. Work performed by our group using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref005">5</xref>] and array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array-CGH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref007">7</xref>] showed that in a number of cases it could be explained by the presence of cryptic, submicroscopic imbalances or complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs). A second mechanism could be functional homozygosity due to gene disruption by the translocation on one allele and unmasking of a recessive gene mutation on the allele inherited from the other parent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref008">8</xref>]. Familial ABTs can also cause discordant phenotypes by disruption of imprinted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref010">10</xref>]. Another possible mechanism is “position effect” with variable expression of genes near the translocation or other identified rearrangement breakpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref012">12</xref>]. Finally, reduced penetrance is a well-known observation in many dominant traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Several cytogenetic and molecular methods such as chromosomal G-banding, FISH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref005">5</xref>], array-CGH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref016">16</xref>], and array painting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref019">19</xref>] have been applied throughout the years to characterize ABTs in individuals with an abnormal phenotype. However, molecular cytogenetic techniques have their individual limitations, and can often be technically challenging and time-consuming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref020">20</xref>]. In addition, these methods cannot define the rearrangement at nucleotide level and may fail in identifying smaller chromosomal imbalances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref021">21</xref>]. The exact characterization of translocation breakpoints and/or identification of any cryptic genomic imbalances and complex rearrangements in ABT carriers are crucial for identifying single disease candidate genes at or near the breakpoints, as well as understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying such events. This, in turn, will aid in the accurate correlation of the chromosomal rearrangement(s) with the clinical phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that next generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for characterizing and mapping translocations at the nucleotide level. Targeted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref024">24</xref>] and/or whole-genome NGS approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref027">27</xref>], have so far been aimed at the investigation of <italic>de novo</italic> translocations. To date, there is a very limited bibliography regarding familial ABTs, which consequently leads to several diagnostic dilemmas about prenatal diagnosis and phenotypic risk.</p>
<p>In the current study, we present a whole-genome next generation mate-pair sequencing (WG-MPS) investigation to rapidly and accurately map translocation breakpoints in nine familial two-way ABT carriers from four families. All samples have been previously analyzed with G-banding, FISH, and array-CGH to exclude any submicroscopic imbalances. Our main aim was to characterize the translocations in each family to the base-pair (bp) level, identify disease candidate genes, and possibly reveal additional structural rearrangements that could explain the phenotypic differences between family members carrying the same translocation. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest study applying NGS methodologies for the investigation of familial ABT cases with discordant phenotypes. We demonstrate that WG-MPS, together with PCR and Sanger sequencing, allowed successful delineation of 18 translocation breakpoints to the nucleotide level, identification of four genes disrupted at the breakpoints, as well as investigation of the possible mechanisms underlying ABT generation. As previously suggested, we also support the use of NGS-based methods for the clinical investigation of ABT carriers.</p>

<title>Mate-Pair Library Preparation and Sequencing</title>
<p>DNA samples were extracted from blood with the QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The concentration/quality of all DNA samples was quantified, prior to use, with NanoDrop. Mate-pair libraries were prepared by following the Nextera Mate-Pair Sample Preparation Guide, gel-free protocol (Part #15035209 Rev.C) obtained from Illumina’s webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.illumina.com/">http://www.illumina.com/</ext-link>) and using the Nextera Mate-Pair Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).</p>
<p>In brief, 1 μg of genomic DNA was fragmented into 2-4kb inserts and tagged with a biotinylated mate-pair junction adaptor using a mate-pair tagment enzyme. The short single-stranded sequencing gaps left from the tagmentation reaction were filled using a strand displacement polymerase. The DNA fragments were then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA) followed by DNA fragment circularization and blunt-end ligation using a circularization ligase enzyme. The large circularized molecules were digested by sonication into smaller-sized fragments of ~200-400bp. Following that, biotinylated mate-pair DNA fragments were isolated by binding to streptavidin-coated beads (Dynabeads® M-280 Streptavidin—Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and end-repaired to convert overhangs into blunt ends. A single ‘A’ nucleotide was added to the 3’ends of the fragments, which served to ligate Illumina TruSeq paired-end index adapters containing a complimentary ‘T’ nucleotide overhang. The mate-pair libraries were PCR amplified and the amplified products were purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc.). The final concentration of the mate-pair libraries was measured with Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® (Invitrogen) by following standard procedures. MPS libraries from each sample were diluted accordingly in water to 10nM and pooled into groups of four. Each pool was sequenced, as 100-bp paired-end reads, on a single flow-cell lane of the Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina) following the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Analysis of Mate-Pair Sequencing Data</title>
<p>Biotinylated adapter sequences were removed prior to alignment of high quality paired-end reads to the human reference genome GRCh37/hg19 using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-MEM with default parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref028">28</xref>]. Reads not aligning uniquely as well as PCR duplicates were not analysed further. SVDetect was then used to identify potential translocations, inversions and large deletions/insertions from discordant paired-end data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref029">29</xref>] aligning on different chromosomes, with unexpected strand orientation and at a distance deviating from the pre-defined insert length, respectively. These predicted structural variants (SVs) were also compared with in-house MPS data sets in order to identify SVs uniquely present in our familial ABT samples. Only SV predictions supported by at least five independent read-pairs were taken into consideration for further analysis. Visualization of the processed MPS data was performed using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (Broad Institute) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref030">30</xref>] and the UCSC Genome Browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref031">31</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">https://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>).</p>

<p>PCR primer pairs (Metabion, Planegg, Germany) were designed flanking the breakpoint junction of each reconstructed derivative chromosome using the Primer3 web interface tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref032">32</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/">http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169935.s002">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169935.s003">S2</xref> Figs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169935.s001">S1 Supporting Document</xref>). PCR amplification was performed in a 25μl reaction containing DNA sample, forward and reverse PCR primers (10μM) (Metabion), PCR buffer (1X) (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA), dNTPs (200μM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), AmpliTaq polymerase (0.025μM) (Applied Biosystems), and dH<sub>2</sub>0. PCR primer sequences and conditions are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169935.s006">S1 Table</xref>. Amplified products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel, which was stained in ethidium bromide (0.5μg/ml) for 30 minutes. PCR products with single, clear bands were purified using ExoSAP-IT<sup>®</sup> (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Purified DNA (8ng/μl) was then cycle sequenced using forward or reverse primer (1μM) (Metabion), BigDye® Terminator v1.1 Ready Reaction Mix (Applied Biosystems), BigDye® Terminator Sequencing Buffer (1X) (Applied Biosystems), and deionized water in a 20μl reaction (cycle sequencing conditions available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169935.s007">S2 Table</xref>). Cycle sequencing cleanup was performed using Performa® DTR Gel Filtration Cartridges (EdgeBio, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and purified sequencing reactions were run on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Translocation junction sequences were aligned to the reference genome using BLAT tool from the UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat">https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref033">33</xref>].</p>

<title>Translocation Generation and Position Effect Investigation</title>
<p>In order to get an insight into the mechanisms underlying translocation formation, the area spanning the translocation junctions was studied for the presence of any repetitive elements using the RepeatMasker track from the UCSC Genome Browser. In addition, a file containing highly conserved non-coding sequences (CNEs), found to be associated with developmental regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref034">34</xref>], was uploaded as a custom track. This was done to investigate whether the breakpoints disrupted any of these conserved sequences, and in turn, possibly disrupted the regulation of important developmental genes located within the same topological domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref035">35</xref>] as the CNEs (long-range position effect).</p>

<title>Unmasking of a Recessive Mutation Investigation</title>
<p>Intronic PCR primers (Metabion) flanking the exons and intron-exon boundaries of all disrupted genes were designed using Primer3 (PCR primer sequences and conditions are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169935.s008">S3 Table</xref>). Before ordering, primer specificity was checked using the <italic>in-silico</italic> PCR tool from the UCSC Genome Browser. Bi-directional mutation screening on the alternative allele was performed using the BigDye® Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) followed by analysis on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Cycle sequencing reactions and conditions were the same as in the validation of translocation breakpoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169935.s007">S2 Table</xref>).

<title>Uniparental Disomy (UPD) Investigation</title>
<p>Genotyping for UPD7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref036">36</xref>] in family 1 was done by mixing DNA sample from each member with a mixture of eight fluorescent chromosome (chr)7-specific repeat microsatellite markers (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169935.s009">S4 Table</xref>) and a multiplex PCR master mix (Qiagen). Following PCR amplification, amplified DNA from each sample was mixed with Hi-Di™ Formamide and GeneScan™–500 LIZ® Size Standard DNA ladder (Applied Biosystems). Finally the samples were run using a Fragment Analysis protocol on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

<title>Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) Analysis</title>
<p>In order to validate selected patient-specific structural variants, qRT-PCR was performed using SsoFast™ Evagreen® Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and Primer3-designed PCR primer pairs (0.5μM) (Metabion) spanning the SVs (qRT-PCR primer sequences are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169935.s010">S5 Table</xref>). An internal control primer-pair at 18q12.2 was selected to confirm the efficiency of the reaction and normalize the results. All reactions for each primer pair were run in triplicates on a CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System machine (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.), and results were analyzed using the Bio-Rad CFX Manager analysis software (comparative Ct method).</p>

<title>Reference Sequences</title>
<p>The GRCh37/hg19 reference genome assembly was used for annotation of the WG-MPS data, as well as primer design and data analysis for Sanger sequencing, mutation screening on the alternative allele of the disrupted genes and qRT-PCR. Annotation of variants identified after mutation screening was done according to GenBank reference sequences: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_017954.10">NM_017954.10</ext-link> for <italic>CADPS2</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_001199013.1">NM_001199013.1</ext-link> for <italic>STPG1</italic>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All nine familial ABT cases were previously found to have apparently balanced translocations using G-banding, FISH, and array-CGH at the resolution of 1Mb or 200kb. As these families still remained undiagnosed, a WG-MPS approach was employed as a next step in order to define the breakpoints to the base-pair level, detect additional SVs and make genotype-phenotype correlations. Results of the individual families are presented below:</p>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Family 1</title>
<p>At the time of the study, the patient was a 14-year old male with ID, psychomotor delay and epilepsy, carrying a t(1;7)(p36.1;q22) translocation inherited from his non-affected mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169935.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Translocation junction coordinates as predicted by MPS in the affected male and his non-affected mother are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0169935.t001">Table 1</xref>. Sequencing patterns and translocation breakpoint positions were identical in both family members.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Currently, there is very limited literature regarding the genetic causality of familial ABTs in cases where one member is clinically affected and the other(s) is/are phenotypically normal. To our knowledge, only a single study has addressed similar challenges and has investigated only one family. Specifically, large-insert paired-end tag NGS was used to investigate a t(6;8) balanced translocation shared between an asymptomatic mother and her two affected children. A disease candidate gene was disrupted at one of the two translocation breakpoint sites but no additional mutations on the other allele were detected. It was concluded that further functional studies were needed to establish pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref038">38</xref>]. The present study is the largest one conducted so far, which thoroughly investigated all possible mechanisms leading to discordant phenotypes, in nine cases with identical ABTs in each of the four families.</p>
<p>Initially, the genes disrupted by the ABT breakpoints that could potentially constitute disease candidate genes were identified through WG-MPS and subsequently Sanger sequencing. These were <italic>PTCD1</italic> and <italic>ATP5J2-PTCD1</italic> in family 1, <italic>CADSP2</italic> in family 2, and <italic>STPG1</italic> in family 4. <italic>PTCD1</italic> is a gene implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression and the negative regulation of leucine tRNA levels in the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref040">40</xref>]. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref041">41</xref>], which agrees with the phenotype of the family 1 affected case. However, so far <italic>PTCD1</italic> has not been associated with inherited diseases. Furthermore, the function of the <italic>ATP5J2-PTCD1</italic> read-through transcript is completely unknown. Currently there exists minimal information regarding the function of <italic>STPG1</italic>, the gene disrupted in family 4 examined here, besides a potential role in induced apoptosis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref042">42</xref>]. In this study, subsequent examination of <italic>PTCD1</italic>, <italic>ATP5J2-PTCD1</italic> and <italic>STPG1</italic> coding exons on the alternative allele did not identify any point mutations in the affected members that could result in complete loss-of-function of these genes.</p>
<p><italic>CADPS2</italic>, the gene disrupted by the translocation in family 2, maps within the autism susceptibility locus 1 on 7q31-q33 and has been linked in a number of studies with ID and autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref044">44</xref>]. It has been shown that knockout of <italic>CADPS2</italic> in mouse models impairs cerebellar development and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref045">45</xref>]. Knockout mice also display autistic-like behaviours, and alternative splicing of <italic>CADPS2</italic> mRNA lacking exon 3 has been observed in some autistic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref043">43</xref>]. In a recent study, it was reported that <italic>CADPS2</italic> expression is subject to a parent-of-origin effect, with only the maternal allele being expressed in blood and amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref044">44</xref>]. However, because parental genomic material was not available in family 2 we could not determine whether the translocation was inherited, and also UPD7 was not excluded. Even though <italic>CADPS2</italic> could be a possible disease candidate gene based on its function and previous studies, no pathogenic point mutations were identified on the alternative allele in the affected individual that could explain the phenotypic differences between the two siblings. As the same translocation was also present in the phenotypically normal sibling, this observation suggests that if <italic>CADPS2</italic> disruption contributes to the patient’s phenotype, it must be through incomplete penetrance, imprinting or other mechanisms.</p>
<p>As a next step, a structural variant analysis was performed by filtering WG-MPS data for common variants reported in DGV. This enabled us to reduce the WG-MPS data volume and identify patient-specific variants that could possibly account for the discordant phenotypes observed between carriers of the same translocation. Selected disease candidate variants were confirmed by qRT-PCR. For example, a family 1 patient-specific large duplication (~21kb) was investigated further as disruption of <italic>CACNA2D2</italic> (calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 2) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.omim.org/entry/607082">OMIM 607082</ext-link>), one of the genes within the duplicated region, has been previously reported in patients with epilepsy and developmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref047">47</xref>]. A relative copy number increase was detected in the affected proband, as compared with a control, by using primer-pairs C-RT1, C-RT2, and C-RT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169935.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). A normal copy number state was observed by using C-RT4, which is probably due to the fact that the amplified area falls outside the actual duplication breakpoints. The same profile was also observed in the non-affected father, suggesting that the duplication was paternally inherited. Since the same duplication was detected in both affected and non-affected individuals, it appears that the phenotypic consequence of the duplicated <italic>CACNA2D2</italic> gene (exons 36–39) is most probably non-pathogenic. However, as in the case of <italic>CADPS2</italic>, incomplete penetrance should also be considered.</p>
<p>qRT-PCR was also performed to validate a ~19.6kb deletion (chr16:49741265–49760865) disrupting <italic>ZNF423</italic> in the affected t(7;8) carrier in family 2. Reduced relative <italic>ZNF423</italic> copy number was observed in the affected sibling, as compared with a control, thus confirming the deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169935.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Normal results were identified in the non-affected sibling; however, we could not determine whether the deletion was inherited as parental genomic material was unavailable. The <italic>ZNF423</italic> gene encodes for a zinc finger transcription factor (ZFP423) that is involved in cerebellar development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref049">49</xref>]. 16q12 microdeletions encompassing <italic>ZNF423</italic> as well as other genes have been reported in patients with various developmental phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref053">53</xref>]. The <italic>ZNF423</italic> deletion reported here is the smallest and covers <italic>ZNF423</italic> intron 2. Based on the amplicon positions showing a reduced relative <italic>ZNF423</italic> copy number, the deletion breakpoints can be refined between 49746990 and 49758761 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169935.g003">Fig 3A</xref>); however, the actual breakpoints may extend beyond these positions. Since <italic>ZNF423</italic> is highly expressed in the brain and <italic>ZNF423</italic> disruption results in phenotypes resembling those seen in our patient, we tested next whether there were any pathogenic mutations unmasked on the other allele. Sequencing though of all <italic>ZNF423</italic> exons did not detect any sequence variations in the affected translocation carrier as compared to the reference sequence (GRCh37/hg19).</p>
<p>To summarize, based on the results from a thorough investigation of the mechanisms that could possibly underlie the phenotypic differences between carriers of the same translocations, unmasking of recessive gene mutations by the translocations has been excluded, and wherever applicable, the possibility of uniparental disomy (family 1). Furthermore, none of the identified rearrangement breakpoints occurred within obvious candidate regions for long-range position effects. In families 1, 3, and 4, presence of cryptic imbalances or complex chromosomal rearrangements that could be causative for the discordant phenotypes observed within each family has also been excluded. The <italic>ZNF423</italic> deletion detected in the affected individual in family 2 may have a causative link to the patient’s phenotype; however, possible inheritance of the deletion has to be excluded, and functional studies are required in order to verify possible haploinsufficiency mechanisms underlying such positive association.</p>
<p>WG-MPS with long-insert libraries used in the current study proved highly successful in identifying familial ABT breakpoints. In total, eighteen translocation breakpoint junctions (two from each of the nine cases) were mapped down to a region ranging between 56bp and 1.3kb. This allowed further delineation to the nucleotide level with the use of a single-primer pair flanking each derivative chromosome breakpoint, per family, and by following standard PCR and Sanger sequencing procedures. In each family, identical breakpoint positions and sequencing patterns were identified in both affected and non-affected members carrying the same translocation. Similar to our study, the effective application of whole-genome NGS-based methods in identifying familial balanced translocation breakpoints was demonstrated in a recent study by Liang et al., 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref054">54</xref>]. In their parental study, eight families were investigated that could potentially carry balanced translocations based on prenatal cases with unbalanced karyotypes. G-banding and FISH analyses detected three balanced translocations and two submicroscopic balanced translocations, respectively, while low coverage whole-genome paired-end sequencing (WG-PES) detected all five translocations. It was concluded that WG-PES may replace conventional cytogenetic methods for the clinical identification of balanced translocation carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref054">54</xref>], and results from our study using a similar NGS-based method further support this.</p>
<p>Apart from breakpoint mapping, sequencing to the base-pair level can also offer insights into possible mechanisms involved in ABT generation. In our study, molecular characterization of the breakpoints showed that they occurred in repetitive sequences in three out of four families. However, absence of homologous regions on both chromosomes involved in each translocation argues against non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Instead, the presence of microhomology and/or small imbalances around the breakpoint sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0169935.t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169935.g002">Fig 2</xref>) suggests that the translocations were likely generated by microhomology-mediated repair (MHMR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref055">55</xref>] or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref056">56</xref>] of double-strand breaks. These results come in agreement with previous studies reporting that following double-strand breaks, NHEJ is the predominant repair mechanism leading to translocations rather than NAHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0169935.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data has demonstrated that WG-MPS is a highly powerful tool that allows rapid and accurate mapping of familial ABT breakpoints as well as identification of single genes disrupted at the breakpoints and detection of additional patient-specific variants. A number of studies have identified genes disrupted by <italic>de novo</italic> translocations that are plausibly linked to the patient’s phenotype. However, based on the results presented here, it appears that in the majority of familial two-way ABT cases, in which the presence of cryptic imbalances or complex chromosomal rearrangements has been excluded, translocations are unrelated to the phenotype, unlike <italic>de novo</italic> translocations. Future analysis of our ABT families with whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing can potentially reveal the presence of unidentified pathogenic mutations in the affected individuals and provide additional evidence that the phenotype in the patients occurred independent of the detected ABTs. In addition, the exact frequency of the phenotypic risk in ABT families can be clarified in the future through the examination of larger cohorts of familial ABT cases, which will be of great importance for genetic counseling.</p>
