<abstract>
<p id="P1">Because ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder and patients typically display symptoms before the age of three<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, one of the key questions in autism research is whether the pathology is reversible in adults. Here we investigated the developmental requirement of <italic>Shank3</italic>, one of the most prominent monogenic ASD genes that is estimated to contribute to ~1% of all ASD cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. SHANK3 is a postsynaptic scaffold protein that regulates synaptic development, function and plasticity by orchestrating the assembly of postsynaptic density (PSD) macromolecular signaling complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Disruptions of the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene in mouse models have resulted in synaptic defects and autistic-like behaviors including anxiety, social interaction deficits, and repetitive behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. We generated a novel <italic>Shank3</italic> conditional knock-in mouse model and used it to demonstrate that re-expression of the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene in adult led to improvements in synaptic protein composition, spine density and neural function in the striatum. We also provided behavioral evidence that certain behavioral abnormalities including social interaction deficit and repetitive grooming behavior could be rescued, while anxiety and motor coordination deficit could not be recovered in adulthood. Together, these results elucidate the profound impact of post-developmental activation of <italic>Shank3</italic> expression on neural function and demonstrate certain degree of continued plasticity in the adult diseased brain.</p>

<body>
<p id="P2">The SHANK3 (ProSAP2) protein is a major scaffolding protein at the excitatory synapse, coordinating the recruitment of many postsynaptic signaling molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Previous work shows that <italic>Shank3</italic> germline deletion in mice disrupts the protein composition at the postsynaptic density (PSD), reduces neurotransmission efficiency and leads to autistic-like behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">To address whether adult reversal of physiological and behavioral abnormalities in <italic>Shank3</italic> mutant mice is possible, we adopted a genetic method that allows for inducible <italic>Shank3</italic> expression. Because <italic>Shank3</italic> duplication is linked to ADHD and bipolar disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, it is critical to keep <italic>Shank3</italic> expression within its physiological concentrations to avoid potential confounds. Thus, we generated a novel <italic>Shank3</italic> conditional knock-in mouse by using the Cre-dependent genetic switch (FLEx) strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, which enables the conditional manipulation of the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene at its endogenous genomic locus.</p>
<p id="P4">We genetically targeted the PDZ domain due to its role in assembling the scaffold complex in the PSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). In the absence of Cre, the <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> mice function as <italic>Shank3</italic> knockout (KO), and result in the deletion of most major isoforms of SHANK3 including the putative alpha, beta, and gamma bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Similar to abnormalities previously reported on <italic>Shank3</italic> KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, these <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> mice showed significant deficits in exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), motor deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), and displayed open wound lesions which suggest repetitive grooming behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, they showed impaired neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f–g</xref>). These novel <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> mice thus recapitulate autistic-like phenotypes, enabling us to investigate the possibility of reversing those deficits in adulthood.</p>
<p id="P5">To achieve temporal control of <italic>Shank3</italic> expression, we crossed the <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> mice to an inducible CAGGS-CreER mouse line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> that activates global Cre function upon tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1d, e</xref>). When the <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup>:CreER<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice reached 2–4.5 months, we used oral gavage to deliver tamoxifen to ensure efficient Cre-mediated gene restoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). All experiments were performed on the following three groups: <italic>Shank3<sup>+/+</sup>:CreER<sup>+/−</sup></italic> treated with tamoxifen (WT), <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup>:CreER<sup>+/−</sup></italic> treated with tamoxifen (TM), and <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup>:CreER<sup>+/−</sup></italic> treated with corn oil vehicle (KO). Synaptosomal preparations showed that tamoxifen treatment restored the expression of most major SHANK3 isoforms including the alpha and beta isoforms to the wildtype level at synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Because SHANK3 is the only SHANK protein family member highly enriched in the striatum, a region strongly implicated in certain behaviors associated with autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, mechanistic characterizations were primarily carried out on striatal neurons. We found that the synaptic concentrations of scaffold proteins SAPAP3, Homer1b/c and glutamate receptor subunits NR2A, NR2B and GluA2 were significantly reduced in KO striatal synaptosomal preparations. However, in the TM condition, the synaptic levels of these postsynaptic proteins were significantly increased compared to those in the KO, reaching comparable levels of the WT(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This molecular alteration shows for the first time that restoring <italic>Shank3</italic> expression in the adult brain can efficiently recruit major scaffolding and signaling proteins to the synapse and assemble the PSD protein network even after the developmental period.</p>
<p id="P7">To investigate whether there were functional changes parallel to molecular repair at synapses, we examined striatal physiology. As expected, the KO showed significantly reduced field population spikes. However, the reduced field responses were rescued to WT levels in the TM condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d–e</xref>). We then performed whole-cell recordings and found that KO mice had reduced mEPSC frequency compared to WT mice. Interestingly, mEPSC frequency was rescued in TM to comparable level of WT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). We further measured paired pulse ratio (PPR), AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">3</xref>), and NR2B/total NMDAR ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). We found no differences across genotypes. Overall, these results suggest that a primary defect of striatal physiology in KO mice is the reduced mEPSC frequency, and this defect can be improved by restoring Shank3 expression in adulthood.</p>
<p id="P8">Previous studies have shown that <italic>Shank3</italic> manipulation can lead to significant changes in the total spine density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. It is, however, unclear whether post-developmental <italic>Shank3</italic> expression can also affect spine structure. To address this, we used systemic viral injection to sparsely label neurons with GFP in the WT, KO, and TM mice and analyzed their dendritic spines in the dorsal striatum. Similar to our previous report on <italic>Shank3B</italic> KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, we observed a significant reduction of MSN spine density in the KO compared to the WT. Surprisingly, the total spine density was significantly increased in the TM treated mice compared to the KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first indication that the ability of <italic>Shank3</italic> to promote spine formation or maintenance is not restricted to any developmental critical period, highlighting the continued structural plasticity in the adult striatum. Interestingly, the spine density in the TM condition is significantly higher than that of the WT. One possibility for this phenomenon is that adult <italic>Shank3</italic> expression induces dendritic spines that may not be pruned and regulated by the same processes that occur in development.</p>
<p id="P9">We next tested how adult Shank3 expression may affect behavioral abnormalities. Since striatal defects have been strongly linked to repetitive/compulsive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and <italic>Shank3</italic> KO mice show overgrooming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, we videotaped WT, TM, and KO mice after treatment, and quantified their grooming time. The results indicated that while there was a significant increase in the percentage of time spent grooming in the KO mice compared to WT mice, TM mice exhibited significantly reduced grooming time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). In addition, during the tamoxifen treatment, we noticed that some <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup>:CreER<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice that initially developed lesions began to heal and regrow their lost fur, providing further support that repetitive/excessive grooming phenotype is reversible in the <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p id="P10">One of the defining features of autism is the impairment in social interaction. Thus, we used a modified three-chamber assay to probe voluntary social interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. After habituating to the three-chamber box, the test mice were given a choice of either interacting with a novel object or a stranger mouse. We found that while WT mice demonstrated strong preference for the stranger mouse over the novel object, KO mice displayed no such preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, d</xref>). Interestingly, we found that TM mice behaved similarly to their WT controls in that they show strong preference for the stranger mouse in both duration and frequency of interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, d</xref>). These data show that, similar to repetitive grooming behavior, social interaction deficit can also be rescued in adulthood. Currently, the neurobiological mechanisms of social deficits of ASD are not well understood. Although ventral striatum has been associated with social interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, we did not observe differences in measurements of mEPSCs, AMPAR/NMDAR ratio, and PPR in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Encouraged by the rescue of repetitive grooming and social deficits, we ran a battery of other tests to assess the extent of behavioral rescue. In contrast to the social and grooming behaviors, adult <italic>Shank3</italic> re-expression has minimal impact on reduced locomotion, anxiety-like behavior and motor coordination deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In the open field, TM mice showed no significant difference from the KO mice in exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and anxiety-like behavior including rearing time and rearing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This result was further corroborated by our observations from the elevated zero maze test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In addition, we found no significant recovery in motor coordination deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Because the cortex and cerebellum have been linked to anxiety and motor coordination, we assessed the mechanistic changes in these brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In both regions, SHANK3 expression was restored to WT level in TM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">6</xref>). However, we found minimal differences across the genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">7</xref>). Thus, the circuit mechanisms of anxiety and motor coordination deficits in the <italic>Shank3</italic> KO mice may involve other brain regions or could be the collective consequence of connectivity deficits across many brain regions.</p>
<p id="P13">To address whether the lack of rescue in these behavior phenotypes is indeed due to missing SHANK3 expression during development, we crossed <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> mice to β-actin-Cre mice, enabling germline restoration of <italic>Shank3</italic>. The germline rescue (GR) mice showed no significant differences in striatal physiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">8</xref>), exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f, g</xref>), and motor coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>) from their wildtype littermates, indicating that restoring <italic>Shank3</italic> expression at the germ cell stage can restore all behavioral phenotypes. Together, these data strongly suggest that there are certain developmental defects that are irreversible by adult re-expression of <italic>Shank3</italic>.</p>
<p id="P14">To test whether there is a developmental window for rescuing anxiety and motor deficits, we treated P20–21 mice with tamoxifen to efficiently induce <italic>Shank3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>), and assayed their behaviors in adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">10</xref>). As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, we observed that treatment of young mice with tamoxifen leads to some toxicity including reduced body weights in the WT mice and affected their motor coordination compared to the KO fed with corn oil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10d</xref>). However, even with the TM toxicity, we found that on the rotarod, the developmentally treated TM mice performed significantly better than their KO counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10a, b</xref>). The P20–21 treated TM mice also showed significantly reduced anxiety on the elevated zero maze compared to the KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9f</xref>). Overall, these behavioral results showed that earlier intervention yields more behavioral improvement than adult treatment, further supporting the developmental origin of the behavioral abnormalities that are irreversible in adults.</p>
<p id="P15">In the current study, we showed for the first time that in the adult mouse brain, <italic>Shank3</italic> expression can increase dendritic spine density, restore the PSD protein composition, and improve striatal neurotransmission. Though adult gene rescue characterizations have been performed on other autism genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, this is the first report to show selective rescue in specifically autism-related behavioral phenotypes. Importantly, we also demonstrated that the behavioral deficits that are irreversible in the adult can be improved with early postnatal intervention. Our results highlight the unique behavioral impact of Shank3 expression after development, and underscore the surprising extent of continued neural plasticity in the adult brain.</p>

<sec id="S2">
<title>Generation of <italic>Shank3CKI</italic></title>
<p id="P16">The <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> targeting vector was designed by inverting the PDZ domain (exons 13 to 16) and flanking it with the FLEx cassette, which is composed of one pair of LoxP sites staggered with one pair of Lox2722 sites. <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> conditional knock-in mice were generated by homologous recombination in R1 embryonic stem cells and implanting the correctly targeted cells in C57 blastocysts using standard procedures. Correct locus insertion of the targeting construct into the genomic DNA was determined by PCR genotyping using two primers End_F (5′-GGCAGACTCCACACAGTTCCTG-3′) and LoxR (5′-GTATCCTATACGAAGTTATTCCGGGTCGAC-3′). Subsequent mouse genotyping was determined by PCR of mouse tail or ear DNA using three primers. For the wildtype (WT) allele, primer FuncF2 (5′-CGTTTGACACACATAAGCACC-3′) and primer FuncFlipR4 (5′-CTCCACCTAGCTGAATTTCCC-3′) were used to produce a band of 340 bp. For the knockout (Fx) allele, primer FuncF2 (5′-CGTTTGACACACATAAGCACC-3′) and primer Gen_Flx_R1 (5′-GCTGACATCACATTGCTGCC-3′) were used to produce a band of 481 bp. For the rescue allele, primer FuncF2 (5′-CGTTTGACACACATAAGCACC-3′) and primer FuncFlipR4 (5′-CTCCACCTAGCTGAATTTCCC-3′) were used to produce a band of 408 bp.</p>
<p id="P17">Chimeric males were crossed to C57BL/6J females from Jackson Labs. The F1 hybrids were crossed with C57BL/6J β-Actin Flp to remove the Neomycin cassette. All progeny were bred onto the pure C57BL/6J (Jackson Labs) for at least two generations before being bred onto a mixed background with 129S1/SvlmJ (Jackson Labs). Heterozygotes were initially bred with heterozygotes to produce experimental animals. All germline <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> (KO) and germline rescue (GR) mice along with their respective wildtype littermates were produced by breeding heterozygotes with heterozygotes. For the adult <italic>Shank3</italic> rescue experiments, the <italic>Shank3</italic> conditional knock-in line was crossed with CAGGS-CreER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In order to produce enough animals for all necessary experiments, breeding strategy was switched to heterozygotes crossed with homozygotes and homozygotes crossed with homozygotes for all conditions (<italic>Shank3<sup>fx/+</sup>:CreER<sup>+/−</sup></italic> bred with <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup>:CreER<sup>−/−</sup></italic>; <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup>:CreER<sup>+/−</sup></italic> bred with <italic>Shank3<sup>fx/fx</sup>:CreER<sup>−/−</sup></italic>; <italic>Shank3<sup>+/+</sup>:CreER<sup>+/−</sup></italic> bred with <italic>Shank3<sup>+/+</sup>:CreER<sup>−/−</sup></italic>; <italic>Shank3<sup>+/−</sup>:CreER<sup>+/−</sup></italic> bred with <italic>Shank3<sup>+/+</sup>:CreER<sup>−/−</sup></italic>). It should be noted that all animals in the rescue condition were produced from the same litters as the animals in the knockout condition. The animals were randomly assigned to different conditions. No computerized randomization program was used.</p>
<p id="P18">Animals were housed by genotype at a constant 23°C in a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 07:00, lights dark at 19:00) with ad libitum food and water. Rescue treatment i.e. tamoxifen feeding was initiated on mice at 2–4.5 months. All electrophysiological and behavioral experiments were done at least 6 weeks after treatment in adult mice with the experimenter being blinded to the genotypes. Only age-matched male mice were used for behavioral assays. All experimental procedures were inspected and approved by the MIT Committee on Animal Care.</p>

<title>Open Field</title>
<p id="P19">An automated Omnitech Digiscan apparatus (AccuScan Instruments) was used to assess spontaneous locomotion as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed by the following parameters: time spent rearing and frequency of rearing. Locomotion was evaluated by the total distance traveled. The first 30 minutes were evaluated for all parameters. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Zero Maze</title>
<p id="P20">An elevated zero maze was illuminated such that the open arm was lit by 60 lux, and the dark arm was lit by 10–20 lux. Animals were habituated with 10–20 lux for at least one hour before test. The animal was introduced into the closed arm and allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 minutes, which was videotaped. An observer blinded to the genotype performed analysis using an automated tracking software Noldus Ethovision. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed by the percentage of time spent by the animal in the open arm during the 5-min interval. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Rotarod</title>
<p id="P21">Animals were placed on a rotarod apparatus (Med Associates) that accelerates 4–40 rpm for 5 minutes. Each animal was tested for three trials with 1–2 hours between trials in a single day. All trials were videotaped. Latency to fall was manually analyzed for each trial on Noldus Observer by an observer blinded to genotypes. The change in the latency to fall over the course of three trails indicates the quality of motor coordination. Statistical analysis was done using two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Grooming</title>
<p id="P22">Animals were individually placed into a new cage and allowed to habituate. Grooming behavior was videotaped for 2 hours from 19:00 to 21:00 with red light (2 lux). An observer blinded to the genotype manually quantified grooming behavior using Noldus Observer. All instances of face-wiping, scratching/rubbing of head and ears, and full-body grooming were counted as grooming behavior. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison tests.</p>

<title>Social Interaction</title>
<p id="P23">A modified version of the three-chamber social interaction assay was used as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Only age-matched males were used for all tests. S129 males were used as stranger mice and were habituated to the test chamber for 3 sessions (20 minutes each) one or two days prior to the behavioral assay. On the day of the test, both test and stranger animals were habituated to the test room for at least one hour before the start of the assay. The left and right chamber of the three-chamber apparatus were both lit by 4–6 lux during the test session. Each test animal was first placed into the center chamber with open access to both the left and right chamber, each of which contained an empty wired cup placed upside down. This allowed the animal to habituate to not only the social apparatus, but also the cups that will eventually contain the stranger mice. After 15 minutes of habituation, the test animal was moved back to the center chamber briefly before the next session. During the social phase, an age-matched stranger mouse was placed randomly into one of the two side chambers while a novel object was placed into the other side chamber. The test animal was allowed to freely explore the social apparatus and demonstrate whether it prefers to interact with the novel object or the novel mouse. This social phase was also 15 minutes. The placement of the stranger mouse and the object was alternated between test mice to eliminate any confounds due to chamber bias. Time spent by the test animal in close proximity (~5 cm) to the cup containing either the stranger or the object was calculated. Analysis was done by an observer blinded to the genotype on Noldus Ethovision. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> test was used for statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Tamoxifen Preparation and Feeding</title>
<p id="P24">Tamoxifen (Sigma #T5648) was dissolved in corn oil at 20 mg/ml through vortexing. Freshly prepared tamoxifen was protected from light by aluminum foil and kept for 2–3 days at room temperature. Animal feeding needles from Harvard Apparatus (cat #52-4025) were used for oral gavage. To avoid toxicity of tamoxifen, the following dosages were used for adult animals:</p>

The pAAV-hSyn1-EGFP-P2A-EGFPf-WPRE-HGHpA construct was cloned and sent for commercial viral packaging by Upenn Viral Core with serotype 2/9. Farnesylated GFP (GFPf) was previously shown to target the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. To achieve sparse labeling, ~8–30 μL of this virus with titre of 4.04X10<sup>13</sup> (GC/ml) was injected through the retro-orbital route into each mouse. Three weeks after viral injection, the mice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned into 200 micron slices. Immunohistochemistry was performed by staining the slices with anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen A11122) for 48 hours and 24 hours of secondary antibody incubation. The stained slices were then surrounded by a 240-um depth spacer (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and mounted with Vectashield Mounting Media.</p>

Following decapitation, brains were removed for sectioning in the same ice-cold cutting aCSF using a Vibratome 1000 Plus (Leica Microsystems, USA). For all dorsal striatal recordings, 300 μm coronal slices were prepared, unless otherwise stated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). For all NAc core recordings, 300 μm parasagittal slices were prepared and NAc core was identified by the presence of anterior commissure. Slices were recovered in the same cutting aCSF solution at 32°C for 12 min and transferred to room-temperature carbogenated regular aCSF(mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 12.5 glucose, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H2O, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O (~300mOsm, 7.2–7.4 pH). Slices were allowed to recover at least 1h and transferred to a recording chamber (RC-27L, Warner Instruments) prior to recordings. Stimulations were performed using a platinum iridium concentric bipolar electrode (CBAPC75, FHC). For dorsolateral striatum coronal slices, electrode was placed at the corpus callosum to mainly stimulate corticostriatal axons. For dorsolateral striatum parasagittal slices, stimulating electrode was placed at the cortex between layer V and VI. For ventral striatum parasagittal slices, electrode was placed dorsally to the anterior commissure at the border between NAc core and the cortex. Afferents were stimulated with 0.1ms stimulation step (Isoflex, AMPI) delivered at 0.05 Hz frequency (unless otherwise stated).

Borosilicate glass recording microelectrodes (King Precision Glass) were pulled on a P-97 horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments) and backfilled with 2 M NaCl. Recording electrode was placed ~400 μm away from stimulating electrode and field population-spike was evoked by a 0.1ms stimulation step (Isoflex, AMPI) delivered at 0.05Hz frequency. Input-output functions were generated through consecutive rounds from 0.1–1.0 mA in 0.1 mA increments (triplicate measurements <italic>per</italic> stimulation intensity). Three components were resolved in the recording traces: stimulation artifact, negative peak 1 (NP1, presynaptic fiber volley) and field population spike. Amplitude for each component was determined by the average peak amplitude from triplicated measurements <italic>per</italic> stimulation intensity. Data was amplified using a MultiClamp 700B and sampled at 10 KHz using a Digidata 1440A acquisition system.

An average EPSC was obtained (~10 traces) at −70 mV and then at +40 mV. AMPAR/NMDAR ratio was calculated as the ratio of the average EPSC peak amplitude at −70 mV (AMPAR EPSC) to the average amplitude of the EPSC recorded at +40 mV, 50 ms after afferent stimulation. For pharmacologically isolated AMPAR/NMDAR ratios, dual-component evoked EPSC at +40 mV was recorded before and after DL-APV bath application (50 μM, Abcam). NMDAR EPSC was obtained by digitally subtracting the average EPSC amplitude after APV application (AMPAR EPSC). For NR2B/total NMDAR ratio, dual-component evoked EPSC at +40 mV was recorded before and after ifenprodil bath application (3 μM, NR2B antagonist, Tocris) and ifenprodil blockable fraction was defined as NR2B EPSCs. DL-APV (50 μM) was then applied to block all NMDARs for measuring total NMDAR EPSCs. The fraction of NR2B containing NMDAR EPSCs is presented as the percentage of the total NMDAR EPSCs (NR2B/total NMDAR ratio = ifenprodil sensitive current divided by DL-APV sensitive current).</p>
