<p id="Par1">Metabolic diseases harm brain health and cognitive functions, but whether maternal metabolic unbalance may affect brain plasticity of next generations is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that maternal high fat diet (HFD)-dependent insulin resistance multigenerationally impairs synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. HFD downregulates BDNF and insulin signaling in maternal tissues and epigenetically inhibits BDNF expression in both germline and hippocampus of progeny. Notably, exposure of the HFD offspring to novel enriched environment restores <italic>Bdnf</italic> epigenetic activation in the male germline and counteracts the transmission of cognitive impairment to the next generations. BDNF administration to HFD-fed mothers or preserved insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed p66Shc KO mice also prevents the intergenerational transmission of brain damage to the progeny. Collectively, our data suggest that maternal diet multigenerationally impacts on descendants’ brain health via gametic mechanisms susceptible to lifestyle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">In the past years, growing attention has been devoted to the impact of overnutrition and metabolic diseases on brain health and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Epidemiological evidence indicate a higher risk of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases in patients affected by obesity and type 2 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, maternal obesity and consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) are associated with anxiety-like behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Strikingly, in experimental models HFD has been reported to transgenerationally predispose to obesity and metabolic syndrome until the third generation via an epigenetic inheritance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This probably occurs because genes can retain memory of the early-life metabolic stress via epigenetic changes that include posttranslational modifications of histone proteins and DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In this regard, early-life stress may induce long-term neurobiological modifications affecting synaptic function and structural plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Hippocampus is a brain area playing a critical role in learning and memory via changes in synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> that is targeted by nutrient- and metabolic disease-related signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We recently reported that increased GluA1 S-palmitoylation underlies hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairment and cognitive decline observed in experimental models of metabolic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, whether maternal diet or metabolic alterations around the gestational age may multigenerationally affect learning and memory is not yet known. Here we demonstrate that maternal HFD affects synaptic plasticity and memory of descendants until the third generation and reduces exon-specific brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<italic>Bdnf</italic>) expression. Accordingly, the early-life metabolic stress alters epigenetic markers on the promoters of <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene in both germline and hippocampus of HFD progeny. Exposure to novel enriched environment (NEE), a paradigm of physical and mental training, counteracts the multigenerational transmission of HFD detrimental effects by restoring both epigenetic modifications and BDNF levels in the hippocampus of progeny. Finally, our findings suggest that the intergenerational inhibition of neurotrophic factor expression and memory is triggered by alteration of both BDNF and insulin signaling in insulin-resistant mothers. Accordingly, BDNF administration or lack of pro-insulin resistance gene <italic>p66Shc</italic> in mothers abolishes the HFD-dependent transmission of cognitive impairment to the offspring.</p>

<title>Maternal HFD impairs learning and memory in the offspring</title>
<p id="Par5">Previous studies reported that maternal HFD affected hippocampal plasticity of the offspring by impairing adult neurogenesis, dendritic spine formation, and cognitive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, it is unknown whether brain function of the next generations may be impaired and/or epigenetically influenced by the dysmetabolic environment of the ancestor. To test this hypothesis, we fed female mice (named F0) with HFD for 4 weeks before mating, during the pregnancy, and until the second week of lactation (hereinafter referred as F0 HFD mother) and evaluated hippocampal-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory of the male descendants, hereinafter named F1<sub>HFD</sub>, F2<sub>HFD</sub>, and F3<sub>HFD</sub> indicating the first, the second, and the third generations, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Remarkably, in our experimental model the offspring of HFD mothers were consistently fed with standard diet (SD) and they were never exposed to HFD.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Experimental model. <bold>a</bold> Female mice (F0) were fed with either standard or high-fat diet (F0 SD and F0 HFD, respectively) for 4 weeks before mating with control males fed with SD. Unless otherwise specified, HFD was maintained during the pregnancy and until the second week of lactation. The offspring (F1<sub>HFD</sub>) and descendants (F2<sub>HFD</sub> and F3<sub>HFD</sub>) were always fed with SD. F1<sub>HFD</sub> and F2<sub>HFD</sub> male mice were mated with control females to generate F2<sub>HFD</sub> and F3<sub>HFD</sub> mice, respectively. A subgroup of F1<sub>HFD</sub> mice was exposed to novel enriched environment (NEE) for 4 weeks after the weaning. Subsequently, they were mated with control females to generate F2<sub>HFD</sub> NEE mice. F2<sub>HFD</sub> NEE male mice were mated with control females to generate F3<sub>HFD</sub> NEE mice. <bold>b</bold> Weight, <bold>c</bold> fasting glucose plasma levels, <bold>d</bold> fasting insulin plasma levels, and <bold>e</bold> HOMA-IR score of SD and HFD female mice after 4 weeks of dietary regimen (<italic>n</italic> = 10 for each group; statistics by unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test).

<p id="Par6">We started studying the diet-dependent metabolic alterations in overfed female mice before mating. After 4 weeks of HFD, mice showed a moderate increase in both weight (32.5 ± 0.7 vs. 26.8 ± 0.3 g; <italic>n</italic> = 10, unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 8.9 × 10<sup>−7</sup>) and fasting plasma glucose levels (7.7 ± 0.2 vs. 6.6 ± 0.5 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>; <italic>p</italic> = 4.3 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) compared to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>). More importantly, they had higher levels of fasting plasma insulin (234.0 ± 4.9 vs. 118.7 ± 3.3 pmol L<sup>−1</sup>; unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 6.1 × 10<sup>−14</sup>) causing a significant increase of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score (80.0 ± 2.1 vs. 34.9 ± 1.6; <italic>p</italic> = 8.4 × 10<sup>−13</sup>) resembling a model of peripheral insulin resistance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d, e</xref>). Next, we investigated hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in the offspring of insulin-resistant mothers. In the Morris water maze (MWM), F1<sub>HFD</sub> mice showed higher latency to reach the hidden platform starting from the second day of training (30.9 ± 1.8 vs. 19.0 ± 2.2 s for day 2; 23.3 ± 2.0 vs. 11.3 ± 1.9 s for day 3; 19.1 ± 2.6 vs. 8.3 ± 1.1 s for day 4; <italic>n</italic> = 10, unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for each day; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Maternal HFD impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. <bold>a</bold> Latency to reach the hidden platform in the MWM test for SD and F1<sub>HFD</sub> mice (<italic>n</italic> = 10 mice derived from 6 to 7 litters for each group; statistics by unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test). <bold>b</bold> Time spent in the four quadrants during the probe test performed on day 5 of MWM.

<p id="Par7">During the probe test, they also spent less time than controls (i.e., mice born to SD-fed mice) in the target quadrant (time in the target quadrant: 24.6 ± 1.7 vs. 39.6 ± 1.8 s, unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 7.27 × 10<sup>−6</sup>; time in the four quadrants: North–East (NE) vs. South–East (SE), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) <italic>p</italic> = 0.078 for F1<sub>HFD</sub>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). The F1<sub>HFD</sub> mice also showed less preference than controls for the novel object in the novel object recognition (NOR) test (69.2 ± 0.4% vs. 56.5 ± 0.8%; <italic>n</italic> = 10, unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 3.55 × 10<sup>−11</sup>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). Accordingly, we found a significant reduction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at the CA3–CA1 hippocampal synapses in slices from F1<sub>HFD</sub> mice (field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitude potentiation: 57.9 ± 6.7% vs. 91.9 ± 7.2%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0016; fEPSP slope: 52.6 ± 9.8% vs. 102.2 ± 9.2%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0008; <italic>n</italic> = 14 for SD and <italic>n</italic> = 12 for HFD; unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). Notably, weight, food consumption, glucose and insulin plasma levels, and insulin sensitivity were not significantly different between F1<sub>HFD</sub> and SD mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e–h</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>).</p>

Finally, to test whether the mothers’ overnutrition during lactation played a critical role in the intergenerational transmission of HFD detrimental effects, we set up another experimental model in which mothers were fed with HFD until the birth of pups, then they were switched to SD during lactation. The F1<sub>HFD</sub> male mice were then mated with control females and their descendants, named F2<sub>HFD NL</sub> (i.e., no lactation) and F3<sub>HFD NL</sub> mice, were subjected to the NOR test. The cognitive impairment exhibited by the descendants of HFD mothers undergoing this shortened overnutrition protocol was not significantly different from what observed in our typical experimental model, thus suggesting that the detrimental effects of HFD are primarily exerted during pregnancy with no significant contribution of the lactation period (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>). Collectively, our findings suggest that maternal insulin resistance occurring in the critical phase of embryo development multigenerationally impairs brain functions in the adulthood.</p>

<p id="Par14">Later we tested the intriguing hypothesis that the multigenerational reduction of <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression depended on epigenetic inhibition occurring in both germline and hippocampus of all descendants.

Specifically, lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) and lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) on histone 3 tail promote exon transcription. Therefore, we studied these epigenetic markers on the promoter of exons I, IV, and IXa in the male gonads of F0 HFD progeny. H3K9ac and H3K4me3 on the <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoters were critically reduced in the germline of F0 HFD descendants (promoter I: <italic>F</italic><sub>3.09</sub> = 31.83 for H3K9ac and <italic>F</italic><sub>3.09</sub> = 22.73 for H3K4me3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for SD vs. all HFD generations; promoter IV: <italic>F</italic><sub>3.09</sub> = 31.64 for H3K9ac, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for SD vs. all HFD generations and <italic>F</italic><sub>3.09</sub> = 15.85 for H3K4me3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 for SD vs. all HFD generations; promoter IX: <italic>F</italic><sub>3.09</sub> = 23.52 for H3K9ac, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for SD vs. all HFD generations and <italic>F</italic><sub>3.09</sub> = 13.19 for H3K4me3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 for SD vs. all HFD generations; <italic>n</italic> = 6; one-way ANOVA; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>).

<p id="Par16">Moreover, to investigate whether the intergenerational effects of HFD were mediated by changes in maternal behavior and to differentiate between gametic and somatic transmission of the phenotype, we performed cross-fostering (CF) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) experiments.

Since FOXO3a dephosphorylation promotes nuclear translocation of this transcription factor and may affect its interaction with chromatin remodelers, we investigated its binding with HDAC2 and SIRT2 in the ovaries.

<title>BDNF counteracts the intergenerational effects of HFD</title>
<p id="Par20">To dip inside the critical role of BDNF signaling alteration in HFD-dependent mother to offspring transmission of cognitive impairment, we intraperitoneally (IP) injected HFD-fed female mice with BDNF (3 times per week for 4 weeks) as long as they fed HFD until the breeding (hereinafter named F0 HFD BDNF). As expected, ovarian TrkB<sup>Tyr816</sup> phosphorylation in F0 HFD BDNF mothers was similar to control females and significantly higher than that observed in F0 HFD dams (<italic>F</italic><sub>6.94</sub> = 10.03, F0 HFD BDNF vs. F0 HFD <italic>p</italic> = 0.032, F0 HFD BDNF vs. SD <italic>p</italic> = 0.51; <italic>n</italic> = 3; two-way ANOVA; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>).

<title>p66Shc deficiency abolishes HFD intergenerational effects</title>
<p id="Par21">To investigate the causative role of maternal insulin resistance in the intergenerational transmission of HFD-related changes of brain function, we used <italic>p66Shc</italic> knockout (KO) mice. p66Shc is one of the three isoforms of the adaptor protein family ShcA mediating insulin sensitivity in tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Ranieri et al. found that <italic>p66Shc</italic> deficiency induced a protective effect in lepOb/Ob mice, an established genetic model of obesity and insulin resistance without affecting (hyper)insulinemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. More importantly, their findings demonstrated that p66Shc interacted with IRS1 and promoted its inhibitory phosphorylation in white fat. Given this background, we hypothesized that <italic>p66Shc</italic> deficiency might preserve the insulin sensitivity in maternal tissues and counteract the intergenerational transmission of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p id="Par22">First, we confirmed that p66Shc was expressed in the ovaries of wild-type females and deleted in KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>). HFD-fed <italic>p66Shc</italic> KO females showed increases of weight and plasma insulin levels resembling the insulin resistance phenotype observed in wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7b, c</xref>). Nevertheless, no significant changes of IRS1<sup>Ser612</sup> phosphorylation were detected in their ovaries after 4 weeks of HFD dietary regimen compared to SD mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>). Strikingly, the offspring generated from HFD-fed <italic>p66Shc</italic> KO females (hereinafter named F1<sub>HFD</sub>
<italic>p66Shc</italic> KO) showed learning and memory comparable to those of mice born from SD-fed females (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b, c</xref>). Accordingly, LTP was not significantly different between F1<sub>HFD</sub> and SD <italic>p66Shc</italic> KO mice (fEPSP amplitude: 55.6 ± 13.1% vs. 46 ± 5.4%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.46; fEPSP slope: 59.7 ± 12.2% vs. 45.2 ± 4.8%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.23, <italic>n</italic> = 10–12 slices for each group; unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test). Remarkably, BDNF levels were comparable in the hippocampus of both experimental groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>). Finally, we did not find significant changes of epigenetic markers H3K9ac and H3K4me3 on <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoters I, IV, and IX between F1<sub>HFD</sub>
<italic>p66Shc</italic> KO and SD mice in both hippocampus and germline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8e, f</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par23">HFD-induced insulin resistance affects synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Nutrient availability also impacts on the developing brain and it is now recognized that early-life dietary experience influences brain function in adult offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, whether metabolic factors may transgenerationally affect the cognitive function and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown.</p>
<p id="Par24">It is now clearly emerging that some epigenetic modifications can be inherited over generations and have a role in mediating the susceptibility to various diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Here we show that maternal HFD multigenerationally impairs synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory via gametic mechanisms involving epigenetic inhibition of exon-specific <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression in the hippocampus of descendants.</p>
<p id="Par25">We set up a model of HFD-fed female mice showing a metabolic profile resembling the human insulin resistance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c–e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Analysis of the offspring revealed significant deficits in LTP at CA3–CA1 synapses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>) and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a–c</xref>). Surprisingly, in the second and the third generations of HFD descendants we found behavioral and electrophysiological alterations similar to those observed in F1<sub>HFD</sub> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a–h</xref>). The unbiased analysis of synaptic plasticity gene expression also revealed altered expression of several targets in the hippocampus of F0 HFD mother’s descendants (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>) including decreased amounts of neuronal activity-related <italic>Bdnf</italic> exons (I, IV, IXa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>) and BDNF protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). The first set of our data demonstrated that maternal diet multigenerationally affects gene expression, hippocampal plasticity, and cognitive functions similarly to adverse environments and psychological stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par26">The intergenerational epigenetic transmission may be the consequence of behavioral and/or germline transfer of a phenotype. The first condition occurs when environmental factors persist across the generations as, for example, in case of the transmission of maternal care behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In our experimental model, the descendants of HFD mothers did not exhibit significant changes of metabolic profile resembling those observed in their ancestor (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e–h</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2d–g</xref> with Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b–e</xref>). However, we found low BDNF plasma levels in HFD progeny (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3e</xref>), which might contribute to the multi-organ downregulation of <italic>Bdnf</italic> observed in HFD descendants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c–e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3d</xref>). Moreover, we cannot exclude that other metabolic changes or unmeasured alterations might occur in our experimental model and influence the phenotype of next generations (e.g., cryptic maternal effects, transfer of parental microbiota to offspring, or effects of seminal fluid on maternal behavior or physiology)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. CF experiments keep out the involvement of maternal behavior in HFD-induced intergenerational cognitive effects (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a–d</xref>), and IVF data point out the male sperm as vehicle of epigenetic phenotype (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4e–h</xref>). A common characteristic of intergenerational phenotype transmitted via the germline is to find an epigenetic mark in both somatic and gametic tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. We found lower levels of gene activation-related molecular marks such as H3K9ac and H3K4me3 in both germline and hippocampus of HFD mother’s male descendants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c, e</xref>). Diet-dependent epigenetic modifications may be then inheritable but they should also be editable in response to environmental factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Indeed, exposure of F1<sub>HFD</sub> male mice to NEE counteracted the multigenerational transmission of HFD detrimental effects on brain functions, leading to almost complete rescue of learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity in F2<sub>HFD NEE</sub> and F3<sub>HFD NEE</sub> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a–d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>). Of note, we found a rescue of epigenetic activation markers on the <italic>Bdnf</italic> regulatory sequences in the germline of mice exposed to NEE (i.e., F1<sub>HFD</sub> NEE; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>). NEE may affect germ cell epigenome of F1<sub>HFD</sub> mice by multiple mechanisms, including changes in circulating neuroendocrine hormones and neurotrophins (e.g., BDNF), action of non-coding RNAs, or paternally induced alterations in maternal behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The discrepancy between our data and those from previous works investigating the intergenerational effects of NEE in SD condition may be due to the type of parental exposure (maternal vs. paternal), the critical phase of exposure (pre or post weaning), and/or the studied brain area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par27">Our findings suggest that the multigenerational opposite effects of HFD and NEE on learning and memory may be mediated by epigenetic changes targeting the same molecular machinery (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>). However, how nutrient-related signals can trigger the intergenerational transmission of HFD effects remains largely unexplored.</p>
<p id="Par28">An intriguing hypothesis is that both systemic HFD-dependent insulin resistance and BDNF deficit are involved in the mother to offspring transmission of HFD-dependent cognitive impairment by changing the chromatin remodelers’ recruitment on <italic>Bdnf</italic> regulatory sequences. In F0 HFD mothers, we found lower plasma levels of BDNF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>) and hypophosphorylation of ovarian TrkB receptor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>), which can account for the reduced CREB activation. Moreover, F0 HFD mother’s gonads constitutively showed higher inhibition of IRS1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>), a molecular marker of insulin resistance, which leads to increased nuclear translocation of FOXO3a. Both CREB and FOXO3a are able to bind HAT/HDAC enzymes and regulate their recruitment on chromatin. Accordingly, FOXO3a was more bound to both HDAC2 and SIRT2 in the ovaries of F0 HFD mothers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>). More importantly, in HFD gonads the binding of both HDAC enzymes was increased, whereas the recruitment of CBP was inhibited on the <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene <italic>loci</italic> showing reduced H3K9 acetylation in the offspring of HFD mothers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>). We hypothesize that BDNF intergenerationally auto-regulates its expression through a positive feedback mechanism aimed to prime next generation to the environmental conditions (i.e., parental imprinting)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Accordingly, BDNF administration to HFD-fed mothers counteracted the intergenerational transmission of both cognitive impairment and <italic>Bdnf</italic> downregulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e–h</xref>). It is worth mentioning that BDNF administration exerted anorectic effects on HFD-fed mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>) but without significantly interfering with peripheral insulin resistance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>) nor counteracting IRS1 inhibition in the ovaries (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d</xref>). However, the critical role of insulin resistance as trigger of HFD-dependent intergenerational effects on hippocampal plasticity was highlighted by the results we obtained in <italic>p66Shc</italic> KO mouse model. F1<sub>HFD</sub>
<italic>p66Shc</italic> mice did not show any significant changes in learning, memory, and BDNF levels compared to SD mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b–d</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par29">It is still debated whether the mouse embryo can retain histone modifications acquired during oocyte maturation or they are completely erased during embryo development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In addition to BDNF and insulin signaling, alteration of other metabolic signaling pathways affecting chromatin structure, such as phosphorylation of histone H3 by the nutrient sensor AMPK, modulation of flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone demethylase LSD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, or HFD-dependent change of microRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, might be involved in the intergenerational modifications of epigenetic marks. Finally, epigenetic changes identified on the <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoters might primarily occur in the developing F1 embryos and lead to multi-organ inhibition of <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression.</p>
<p id="Par30">Our findings demonstrate a multigenerational effect of maternal high-fat feeding on the cognitive function and reveal epigenetic markers of early-life environmental exposure. More genes critically involved in synaptic plasticity regulation and other epigenetic mechanisms (including DNA methylation or microRNA expression) may play a role in the HFD-dependent multigenerational effects on cognitive function. However, alteration of both BDNF and insulin signaling during the embryo development appear to be primarily responsible for the transmission of brain vulnerability to the next generations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>). Importantly, these modifications are transmittable across the generations and represent a sort of molecular switch for the vulnerability to the lifestyle-related diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Identifying the genes most susceptible to disease-related epigenetic changes and the molecular mechanisms that ensures locus-specific targeting are great challenges for personalized medicine in the near future.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Flow chart of findings. Maternal (F0) HFD causes molecular and behavior changes in the offspring (F1) via gametic mechanisms involving epigenetic inhibition of <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression. Both low BDNF plasma levels and insulin resistance in mothers lead to alterations of BDNF and insulin signaling in the ovaries and change the recruitment of histone acetyl-transferases (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC) on the <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoters. These epigenetic modifications may be transferred from oocytes to embryo. Additional mechanisms including maternal microbiota transfer, microRNA, and cryptic maternal effects may be involved in the HFD-related intergenerational modification of <italic>Bdnf</italic> epigenetic marks. The outcome is a multi-organ inhibition of <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression leading to LTP and memory deficits. The propagation of the same epigenetic changes via male sperm is responsible for the transmission of HFD-dependent brain damage to the next generations (F2 and F3)</p></caption><graphic id="d29e3047" xlink:href="41467_2019_12793_Fig9_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>

<p id="Par31">Female C57BL/6 mice (30 days old), derived from the Animal Facility of Catholic University, were used and randomly assigned to two feeding regimens: (i) SD (control) and (ii) HFD until they were ready for mating and they were weighed weekly. Female mice (F0) were paired for breeding at the end of the fourth week of dietary regimen. Male mice are removed from the female’s cage after 1–2 days of mating and are exposed to HFD only during this time lapse. The same male mouse was paired, at different times, with both a F0 SD female and a F0 HFD female mouse. A subset of F0 female mice was sacrificed prior to mating for blood and tissue collection. F0 pregnant females were usually fed with HFD until the second week of lactation; a subgroup of them switched, instead, to SD after delivery (generating SD and F1<sub>HFD NL</sub> mice). Male mice were always fed with standard chow. A subset of male C57BL/6 offspring (F1<sub>HFD</sub>) was paired for breeding with control females giving rise to the second generation (F2<sub>HFD</sub>). Similarly, male mice of the second generation were weaned onto standard chow and a subset of them was paired for breeding with control, SD-fed females to produce the third generation (F3<sub>HFD</sub>). Different subsets of male and female pups weaned onto standard chow underwent behavioral testing or were euthanized at 10–12 weeks for electrophysiological analyses or tissue collection. A maximum of two male offspring was taken from each litter for each experimental set to remove any litter effects. The c129/sv F0 female mice harboring the homozygous deletion of p66Shc, derived from the Animal Facility of Catholic University, were fed with SD or HFD and the offspring were generated resembling the experimental model set up for wild-type mice.</p>

<title>Ethics and animal use statement</title>
<p id="Par32">All animal procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University and were fully compliant with Italian (Ministry of Health guidelines, Legislative Decree No. 116/1992) and European Union (Directive No. 86/609/EEC) legislations on animal research. The methods were carried out in strict accordance with the approved guidelines.</p>

<sec id="Sec14">
<title>IP glucose tolerance test and HOMA-IR</title>
<p id="Par33">Animals are fasted for approximately 16 h, and fasted blood glucose levels are determined before a solution of glucose (2 g of glucose kg<sup>−1</sup> weight) is administered by IP injection (volume of IP glucose injection = 10 μL g<sup>−1</sup> body weight). Subsequently, the blood glucose level is measured through a glucometer at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after glucose injection by placing a small drop of blood tail on test strip. HOMA-IR was calculated as fasting plasma insulin (in picomoles L<sup>−1</sup>) × fasting plasma glucose (in millimoles L<sup>−1</sup>)/22.5.</p>

<sec id="Sec15">
<title>Diet, housing conditions, and drug administration</title>
<p id="Par34">Diets were from Mucedola (Italy). Chows were stored at 4 °C and diet in cages was replaced weekly to prevent degradation. Mice were housed in cages 25 cm × 20 cm × 15 cm. For the NEE protocol, larger cages (60 cm × 35 cm × 20 cm) were used containing a small house and a running wheel for voluntary exercise along with a number of toys that were changed three times a week with new ones of different shape and color. A group of F1<sub>SD</sub> and F1<sub>HFD</sub> male mice were exposed after weaning to NEE for 4 weeks before mating with control females to obtain F2<sub>SD NEE</sub> and F2<sub>HFD NEE</sub> mice. F2<sub>SD NEE</sub> and F2<sub>HFD NEE</sub> male mice were then crossed with control females to generate F3<sub>SD NEE</sub> and F3<sub>HFD NEE</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="Par35">A group of F0 SD-fed and F0 HFD-fed female mice were IP injected with vehicle or 20 ng BDNF 3 times per week for 4 weeks before mating. Different cohorts were sacrificed at the end of treatment for molecular analyses. The animals were housed under a 12-h light–dark cycle at room temperature (RT; 19–22 °C), fed with their respective diets and received water ad libitum. Weight and food consumption were weekly monitored.</p>

<sec id="Sec16">
<title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title>
<p id="Par36">Blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital plexus with sterile glass Pasteur pipettes. After centrifugation, plasma was separated and stored at −80 °C until further use. Plasma insulin and plasma/hippocampus BDNF concentrations were determined by using commercially available ELISA kits (Immunological Sciences). The assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec17">
<title>Behavioral experiments</title>
<p id="Par37">Behavioral tests were carried out from 9 a.m.to 4 p.m. and data were analyzed in blind using an automated video tracking system (Any-Maze™). Recognition memory was evaluated by NOR test. On the first day, animals were familiarized for 10 min to the test arena (45 cm × 45 cm). On the second day (training session), they were allowed to explore two identical objects placed symmetrically in the arena for 10 min. On the third day (test session), a new object replaced one of the old objects. Animals were allowed to explore for 10 min and a preference index, calculated as the ratio between time spent exploring the novel object and time spent exploring both objects, was used to measure recognition memory.</p>
<p id="Par38">Spatial learning and memory were assessed using the MWM test. A circular plastic pool (127 cm in diameter) filled with water colored with nontoxic white paint to obscure the location of an hidden platform was used as experimental apparatus. The pool was ideally separated into four equal quadrants (NE, corresponding to the target quadrant, SE, NW, and SW) and the platform (10 cm × 10 cm) was placed at the center of the target quadrant. Visual cues were placed on the walls around the pool to orient the mice. Animals were trained for 4 days, six times a day and the probe test was administered 24 h after the last training day. Starting positions were varied daily and latencies to reach the platform were recorded. In the probe test, the platform was removed and time spent in each quadrant was measured (60 s of test duration).</p>
<p id="Par39">Locomotor activity was assessed using the Open Field test. Briefly, the apparatus consisted of a square arena (45 cm × 45 cm) with no visible extra-maze cues aside for the video recording camera. Animal were introduced in the center of the arena and were allowed to explore for 10 min while being monitored with a video-tracking system. Total distance traveled was measured and reported minute by minute.</p>

<title>Ex vivo electrophysiology on hippocampal slices</title>
<p id="Par40">fEPSPs were elicited in the CA1 area of hippocampus by placing a bipolar concentric stimulating electrode (FHC) in the Schaffer collateral pathway. The electrode was connected to a constant current isolated stimulator (Digitimer). A low impedance glass pipette (1–2 MΩ) was filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid and placed immediately below the CA1 stratum pyramidale. Recordings were performed in current clamp I = 0 mode, using a Multiclamp 700 A/Digidata 1440 A system (Molecular Devices). First, the input–output relationship was constructed and the stimulus intensity resulting in 30% of maximal response amplitude was found. After achieving a stable baseline response, LTP was induced by using the high-frequency stimulation protocol (1 train of stimuli at 100 Hz, lasting 500 ms, repeated four times with an inter-train interval of 20 s). After LTP induction, fEPSP amplitude and slope were monitored for at least 60 min and data were analyzed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Tissue and germ cell collection</title>
<p id="Par41">Epididymides were removed and separated from fat. Radial slits were made in each of the cauda epididymides. Later, epididymides were placed in microcentrifuge tubes containing 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and shook on an orbital shaker for 10 min to facilitate the swim out of the sperm. The epididymal tissues were allowed to settle for 15 min and the sperm suspension was then separated and pelleted at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic> in a new microcentrifuge tube. The pellet was frozen at −80 °C until RNA extraction. Whole ovaries were collected from the ovarian bursa and transferred in M2 medium (Sigma). Ovaries were mechanically punctured using a 30-gauge syringe needle in medium consisting of 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in PBS. Isolated follicles were washed with media to eliminate debris. For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses, mice were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (80 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, intramuscular (i.m.)) and medetomidine (1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, i.m.) and transcardially perfused with an oxygenated Ringer’s solution (pH: 7.3), followed by 4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH:7.4). The brain, epididymides, and ovaries were isolated and post-fixed overnight at 4 °C and then transferred to a solution of 30% sucrose in PBS for 2 days. Coronal brain sections (45-μm thick) containing hippocampi were then cut with a vibratome (VT1000S) and floated in ice-cold PBS.</p>
<p id="Par42">Hippocampi were isolated under optic microscope and minced through a 10-mL syringe with decreasing needle size (18–22 gauge). To separate germ cells and follicles, both epididymides and ovaries were isolated and handled as above mentioned.</p>

<title>Real-time PCR</title>
<p id="Par43">Quantitative RT-PCR amplifications were performed using SYBR GREEN qPCR Master Mix (Fisher Molecular Biology) on AB7500 instrument (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The thermal cycling profile featured a pre-incubation step of 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s), and elongation (72 °C, 20 s). Melting curves were subsequently generated (94 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 30 s, slow heating to 94 °C in increments of 0.5 °C).</p>
<p id="Par44">Melting curve analyses confirmed that only single products had been amplified. The primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>. All data were normalized by reference to the amplification levels of the actin gene; a reference dye was included in the SYBR master mix. The thresholds calculated by the software were used to calculate specific mRNA expression levels using the cycle-at-threshold (Ct) method, and all results are expressed as fold changes (compared to control) for each transcript, employing the 2−ΔΔCt approach.</p>
<p id="Par45">For PCR array experiments, an RT2 Profiler Custom PCR Array (PAMM-126Z) was used to simultaneously examine the mRNA levels of 89 genes, including 5 housekeeping genes in 96-well plates according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen). Each reaction included 40 ng of total RNA and the proper negative controls (no reverse transcription, no template). RNA of all samples was analyzed in triplicate, and data were normalized for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels by the ΔΔCt method. All results are shown in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>.</p>

<title>Single-cell droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)</title>
<p id="Par46">BDNF gene expression in CA1 hippocampal neurons from brain slices was assessed by single-cell ddPCR. Briefly, whole-cell recording pipettes (3–4 MΩ) were presterilized and filled with a Rnase-free intracellular solution containing (in mM): 123 K-gluconate, 12 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 4 Mg2ATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, 1 U μL<sup>−1</sup> recombinant Rnase inhibitor (Ambion), pH 7.25–7.30 (osmolarity 300 mOsm). The intraneuronal contents (∼1–2 μL) were collected into the tip of the patch pipette by applying negative pressure and transferred in RNase/DNase-free tubes. In addition, each experiment included at least one negative control consisting of a recording pipette used without achieving the whole-cell configuration. The negative controls were processed in the same manner as the rest of the samples to determine the amount of contamination during sample collection and amplification. Final volume was brought up to 11–12 μL by adding Single Cell DNase I/Single Cell Lysis solution of Ambion Single Cell-to-CT kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cell lysates were incubated at RT for 5 min and subjected to cDNA synthesis according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Ambion Single Cell-to-CT Kit). Preamplification reaction, performed with BDNF and mAldolase primer mix, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (SsoAdvanced<sup>TM</sup> PreAmp Supermix), was diluted 1:5 or 1:10 and used for quantification by ddPCR on QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 59 °C using EvaGreen ddPCR Supermix (Bio-Rad), 200 nM primer concentration, and 2 μL of diluted cDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>.

<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title>
<p id="Par47">Hippocampi or germ cells were resuspended in 200 μL lysis buffer containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 10 mM EDTA and sonicated on ice with six 10-s pulses with a 20-s interpulse interval. Sample debris was removed by centrifugation and supernatants were precleared with protein-G Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 4 °C. Two micrograms of specific antibody or control IgG were added overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein-G Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After seven sequential washes, immune complexes were eluted from beads by vortexing in elution buffer (1% SDS and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 0.1 M; pH 8.0). NaCl was added (final concentration 0.33 M), and cross-linking was reversed by incubation overnight at 65 °C. DNA fragments were purified by using the PCR DNA Fragments Purification Kit (Geneaid)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. The primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>.</p>
<p id="Par48">PCR conditions and cycle numbers were determined empirically and each PCR reaction was performed in triplicate. Data are expressed as the percentage of input calculated by the Adjusted input value method according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific ChIP Analysis). To calculate the Adjusted input, the Ct value of input was subtracted by 6.644 (i.e., log2 of 100). Next, the percentage of input of samples was calculated using the formula: 100 × 2^(Adjusted input − Ct(ChIP). The percentage of input of IgG samples was calculated using the formula 100 × 2^(Adjusted input − Ct(IgG).</p>

<p id="Par49">Tissues were lysed in IP buffer (KCl 50 mM, Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 8, EDTA 10 mM, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and part of the lysate was used for total input. The lysates were precleared for 30 min with empty protein G-sepharose 4B beads (Sigma Aldrich) before being incubated with 1–2 μg of specific antibody or IgG (negative control) and fresh protein G matrix. After 6 h of incubation at 4 °C with rotating mixer, protein G bound immune complexes were collected by centrifugation (22,000 × <italic>g</italic>, 1 min) and washed six times with IP buffer.

<title>CF and IVF</title>
<p id="Par51">For CF experiments, breeding pairs made by male SD mice and female F0 SD or F0 HFD mice were simultaneously set up. After the birth of both SD and F1<sub>HFD</sub> litters, the whole litters were removed and put with two different F0 SD-fed mothers. At weaning, pups were separated based on sex and tested both at a molecular and behavioral level.</p>
<p id="Par52">IVF was performed in collaboration with the European Mouse Mutant Archive in Monterotondo (Rome, Italy). Briefly, the sperm from SD or F1<sub>HFD</sub> mice was extracted from cauda epididymides and vasa deferentia of male mice and preserved in cryoprotective medium (18% raffinose 3% skim milk and 477 mM monothioglycerol). The pooled sperm was loaded into French straws and placed onto a polystyrene raft floating on LN2 before being plunged into LN2 and stored in a LN2 tank until used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Cryopreserved sperm was thawed by moving the straw from the cassette in the LN2 tank into a water bath at 37 °C for 30 s. SD females were previously superovulated by an IP injection of 5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Intervet, Milan, Italy) followed by 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Intervet) 48 h later. At 12–14 h post-hCG injection, females were euthanized by cervical dislocation and their oviducts were removed aseptically. After an overnight incubation of ovocytes with sperm of SD or F1<sub>HFD</sub> mice, two-cell embryos were collected and transferred into recipient psuedopregnant females. All females were always fed with SD.</p>
