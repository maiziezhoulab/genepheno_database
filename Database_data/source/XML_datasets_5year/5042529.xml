<abstract>
<p>Cognitive defects in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include socialization and communication: key behavioral capacities that separate humans from other species. Here, we analyze gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of 63 autism patients and control individuals, as well as 62 chimpanzees and macaques, from natal to adult age. We show that among all aberrant expression changes seen in ASD brains, a single aberrant expression pattern overrepresented in genes involved synaptic-related pathways is enriched in nucleotide variants linked to autism. Furthermore, only this pattern contains an excess of developmental expression features unique to humans, thus resulting in the disruption of human-specific developmental programs in autism. Several members of the early growth response (EGR) transcription factor family can be implicated in regulation of this aberrant developmental change. Our study draws a connection between the genetic risk architecture of autism and molecular features of cortical development unique to humans.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves disruptions in cognitive functions related to socialization and communication, which are also among the key behavioral capacities that separate humans from other species. This suggests that ASD may involve alterations in evolutionarily novel, human-specific developmental processes. To test this, we measured developmental gene expression trajectories in the cerebral cortex of autism cases, matched controls, and non-human primates: chimpanzees and macaques. Among a large number of disrupted developmental patterns that we detected in autism, only one, mainly including synaptic genes, was enriched in autism-linked mutations. This suggests that changes in expression of these genes in ASD brains may play a causal role in disease etiology. The same gene set exhibited more developmental expression changes unique to the human brain than any other developmental pattern disrupted in autism, reflecting extension of the synaptic maturation period in humans. Taken together, we show that a recently evolved developmental expression pattern of synaptic genes altered in autism might be associated with intense social learning abilities unique to humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterized by the disruption of cognitive functions involved in socialization and communication and inclination toward restricted interests and repetitive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref004">4</xref>]. The global median prevalence of ASD is estimated at around 0.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref005">5</xref>], though three to four times higher estimates have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>In infants and children, autism can manifest itself within the first 2 y of age as delays or deficits in joint attention, imitation, and communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref004">4</xref>]. Adult ASD individuals can have difficulties in understanding the emotions of others, show low social interaction, display repetitive motor movements, and display different levels of executive dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref008">8</xref>]. ASD frequently co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including language and motor deficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref004">4</xref>]. Based on the affected behaviors, a number of central nervous system structures have been implicated to be altered in autism, including the frontal and temporal cortices and the amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Imaging studies have shown multiple deviations from average brain development in the brains of ASD individuals. These include increased deficiency in long-range connectivity and low activity in integrative regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref010">10</xref>], which could underlie extremely focused interests in ASD individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref004">4</xref>]. Another theme is early postnatal brain overgrowth, including excess cortical white and gray matter volumes, that can lead to “megacephalic”-like brain volumes at 2–3 y in boys diagnosed with ASD, which disappear with age due to subsequent brain undergrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref011">11</xref>]. A similar early overgrowth and later undergrowth pattern was reported for the amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref012">12</xref>]. Another observation is aberrant development of white matter fiber tracts in the ASD neocortex, with early acceleration and subsequent deceleration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref013">13</xref>]. Stereological work reported &gt;60% higher neuron numbers in ASD children compared to unaffected children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref014">14</xref>]. Studies of synapse numbers have also reported an excess of synapse densities; specifically, greater dendritic spine densities were reported for the temporal cortex in ASD brains during postnatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref015">15</xref>], and in both frontal and temporal cortices in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref016">16</xref>]. The excess of spines in postnatal development appears to increase toward adolescence and has been correlated with reduced developmental spine pruning as a result of high mTOR activity and impaired autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Twin and family studies suggest that cognitive changes observed in autism are more than 50% heritable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref018">18</xref>]. However, autism has been found to be genetically highly heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref020">20</xref>]. A large number of genetic markers, including segregating and de novo mutations in coding and regulatory regions, copy number variations, and chromosomal mutations, have been linked to ASD by a sum of genetic linkage and genome-wide association studies, while each of the identified genetic variants explains only a minute fraction of disease prevalence, no larger than 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref021">21</xref>]. Genes associated with autism in these genetic scans are enriched in two major biological processes: synaptic processes and transcription/chromatin modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref022">22</xref>]. Some variants are notable for association with other neurodevelopmental conditions, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, and intellectual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref021">21</xref>] (which can be concurrent with autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref004">4</xref>]). Interestingly, genes carrying de novo ASD risk mutations were reported to show peak expression in fetal cortical development and in cortical projection neurons in the unaffected brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref024">24</xref>]; such genes’ altered activity may thus contribute to abnormal connectivity patterns observed in ASD. Meanwhile, genes carrying segregating (i.e., relatively common) ASD risk alleles were reported to be highly expressed in early postnatal development and have roles in synaptic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref024">24</xref>], consistent with atypical synaptogenesis in ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to genetic analyses, transcriptome comparisons of postmortem neocortex tissue from individuals diagnosed with ASD and from unaffected individuals have revealed a number of phenomena. First, there is massive and consistent downregulation of genes predominantly involved in synaptic functions (despite the spine density excess reported in histological work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref016">16</xref>]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref028">28</xref>]. Second, there is strong upregulation of immune and inflammation-related response genes. Third, synaptic genes, but not immune genes, overlap with putatively causal markers identified in genetic linkage or association studies, indicating that immune upregulation and microglial activation occur downstream of earlier developmental aberrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref028">28</xref>] (although immune upregulation and inflammation could also explain important phenomena, such as neuron overgrowth in the ASD brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref028">28</xref>]). Fourth, genes involved in cortical patterning appear dysregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref027">27</xref>], such that expression differences between temporal and frontal cerebral cortices observed in unaffected brains were obscured in ASD brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>One limitation of these transcriptome studies has been their focus on fixed gene expression differences across all ages. Given the transient nature of multiple ASD-related phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref014">14</xref>], studying molecular differences between unaffected and ASD brains across postnatal brain development could provide additional insight into ASD etiology. A second limitation pertains to linking the observed molecular changes with the two major behavioral characteristics of ASD-impaired social interaction and restricted behavior. Animal models can help overcome this hindrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref029">29</xref>], but here we propose an alternative approach, leveraging upon the notion that the cognitive functions disrupted in autism are among the key behavioral capacities that separate humans from other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref030">30</xref>]. Indeed, the niche that has allowed ratchet-like cultural accumulation in the human lineage was founded upon the evolution of a powerful set of social skills, including theory of mind, imitation, empathy, and cooperation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref035">35</xref>]. This suggests that some ASD phenotypes may represent disruption of evolutionarily novel, human-specific developmental processes. Accordingly, developmental shift in expression of synaptic genes in the frontal cortex has been shown to be one of the most prominent human-specific changes in postnatal brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate the developmental mechanisms underlying ASD, employing transcriptome-wide analysis of expression variation throughout postnatal cortical development, starting from the earliest ages at which autism can be diagnosed. We report a group of co-expressed genes involved in synaptic function and development, which show divergent expression between ASD and unaffected brains from childhood onward. We further show this gene set’s connection to evolutionarily novel developmental features characteristic of the human neocortex.</p>

<title>Gene Expression in Autistic and Control PFC Development</title>
<p>To determine the developmental dynamics of gene expression changes in autism, we measured transcript levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 34 autism cases (2–60 y old) and 40 controls (0–62 y old) using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s026">S1 Table</xref>). Based on more than 700 million sequence reads, we quantified the expression of 12,557 protein-coding genes in 63 individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s026">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s027">S2</xref> Tables and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s001">S1 Data</xref>). The age of the individuals explained 23.8%, and autism diagnosis 6.6%, of the of the total expression variation. By contrast, other factors, such as gender and RNA quality and sample preparation batch as confounds, collectively explained 4.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>A total of 1,775 genes were differently expressed between autism cases and unaffected controls in our data (ANCOVA, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.078). These genes overlapped significantly with expression differences determined using an alternative statistical procedure, the likelihood ratio test implemented in the DESeq2 package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref030">30</xref>], set to the same FDR level (Fisher's exact test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, odds ratio = 38.7), as well as differentially expressed genes reported in the autistic frontal cortex via microarray-based study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>] (Fisher's exact test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, odds ratio = 2.46) and with genes identified by reanalysis of published microarray data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>] (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, odds ratio = 1.54). Furthermore, the direction of expression change in autism determined in our study was concordant with results obtained using microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>], even though 50 of the 63 individuals did not overlap between studies (Pearson correlation, <italic>r</italic> = 0.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s006">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Unsupervised clustering of the 1,775 genes resulted in six major patterns of developmental expression profiles separating autism and control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s007">S2 Fig</xref>). In agreement with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref027">27</xref>], transcripts upregulated in autism (cluster 4) were preferentially involved in immune functions, while transcripts downregulated in autism (cluster 2) were involved in neural functions, including calcium signaling and long-term potentiation pathways, as well as Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with synaptic transmission and cell–cell signaling (one-sided hypergeometric test, corrected <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s028">S3 Table</xref>). In addition to these previously reported functions, we found expression changes enriched in cellular metabolic and biosynthetic processes (cluster 1), generation of precursor metabolites and energy and catabolic process (cluster 3), regulation of transcription (cluster 5), and regulation of cellular process (cluster 6). Clustering based on log2-transformed expression values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s008">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s009">S4</xref> Figs), as well as expression values of all detected genes, demonstrated robustness of clustering results, especially for cluster 2 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s010">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s011">S6</xref> Figs). Cluster 2 genes also overlapped significantly with genes reported by other studies of transcriptome changes in autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref028">28</xref>] (Fisher's exact test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0043 and odds ratio = 1.68 for genes in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref028">28</xref>]; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0004 and odds ratio = 2.89 for genes in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>]). Notably, the extent of the expression difference between autism and control cases positively correlated with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) scores (Pearson correlation, <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s029">S4 Table</xref>). Patterns of age-related expression divergence were not, however, driven by these extreme cases, as re-plotting clusters based only on autism samples with moderate ADI-R scores confirmed all cluster profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s012">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Frequency of Autism-Associated Genetic Variants in Gene Expression Clusters</title>
<p>To test whether any of the detected expression changes might be linked with the cause of disease, we assessed the occurrence of genes with DNA sequence polymorphisms and mutations associated with ASD in each of the six clusters. Notably, genes in cluster 2, but not in the other five clusters, contained a significant excess of genes with genetic variants associated with ASD, based on analysis of all genes extracted from SFARI AutDB (791 genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref038">38</xref>], category 1–4 genes from SFARI AutDB (375 genes), genes from AutismKB database (977 genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref039">39</xref>], as well as genes with de novo mutations associated with autism collected from four exome sequencing studies (permutation test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all tests; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s013">S8 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref012">12</xref>].

<title>Localization of Genes Affected in Autism in Cell Types and Cortical Layers</title>
<p>To further investigate the functional roles of genes showing significant expression changes in autistic brains, we assessed the distribution of genes in each of the six clusters among brain cell types and cortical layers. Based on mouse brain cell type makers reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref016">16</xref>], we found that cluster 2 were significantly over-represented among genes highly expressed in three types of neurons assessed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref016">16</xref>], CA1 pyramidal cells, interneurons, and S1 pyramidal cells, but not in non-neuronal cells. Cluster 5 genes were over-represented among S1 pyramidal cell markers, and cluster 3 genes tended to overlap with interneuron markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s016">S11 Fig</xref>). These observations were generally consistent with results based on mouse neuronal marker genes reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref040">40</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s017">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Given enrichment of cluster 2, 3, and 5 genes in neuronal markers, as well as enrichment of cluster 2 genes in GO terms “synaptic transmission” and “cell–cell signaling,” we further collected genes annotated to be predominantly localized in the presynapse, postsynapse, synaptic vesicle, axon, dendrite, and remaining neuron locations based on GO. Genes in cluster 2 were significantly over-represented among genes located in synaptic vesicles and dendrites, but not in other neuron locations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s018">S13 Fig</xref>). By contrast, genes in the other clusters showed no significant over-representation in any of the subcellular structures of neurons. Taken together, these observations further support the notion that cluster 2 genes are linked to synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling.</p>
<p>Using marker genes of cortical layers 2–6 identified in rhesus macaque brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref014">14</xref>], we further found that genes in cluster 4 show significant over-representation among cortical layer 5 markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s019">S14 Fig</xref>). This observation agrees with the notion implicating genes expressed in deep cortical layers during mid-fetal embryonic development as pertinent to ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref035">35</xref>]. Intriguingly, genes in clusters 2 and, to a lesser extent, cluster 3 were significantly over-represented among cortical layer 2 markers, which is also in line with observations of gene expression dysregulation in adult ASD patients in cortical layers 2/3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s019">S14 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref024">24</xref>].</p>

To test whether genes whose ontogenetic expression patterns are changed in autism display human-specific properties, we measured gene expression levels in the PFC of 39 chimpanzees (0–43 y old) and 36 rhesus monkeys (0–21 y old), using the same RNA-seq procedure as for the human samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s026">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s027">S2</xref> Tables).

<p>Remarkably, among six clusters of genes differentially expressed between autism and control groups, only cluster 2 contained a substantial and significant excess of genes showing human-specific expression profiles during PFC development detected in either RNA-seq or microarray datasets (permutation test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), with 82% of them converging on the same common human-specific developmental expression pattern in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Among these genes, the functional categories synaptic transmission, calcium signaling pathways, cell communication, as well as 14 other pathways associated with synaptic functions are highly overrepresented (one-sided hypergeometric test, corrected <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s030">S5 Table</xref>). Although based on a small number of samples spanning the critical age interval, previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref043">43</xref>], as well as the current data, indicate that peak expression of synaptic genes is substantially delayed and extended in human PFC development compared to both chimpanzees and macaques: from 0–2 years in non-human primates to 4–10 years in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s021">S16 Fig</xref>). In the autistic brain, expression of synaptic genes starts decreasing from the earliest measured time point, 2 years of age, much earlier than in the control individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). This might imply that the timing of expression of synaptic genes in PFC is accelerated in autism, which resonates with premature PFC development described for ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref044">44</xref>]. Furthermore, the average profile of all synapse-related genes follows the expression trajectory closely resembling the trajectory of cluster 2 genes with human-specific expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s022">S17 Fig</xref>). This observation further implies an accelerated dynamic of synaptic maturation during the first years of postnatal development in autism, suggesting a potential mechanism for the resulting disruption of cognitive functions.</p>

<title>Regulation of Aberrant Expression of Synaptic Genes in Autism</title>
<p>To assess which regulatory mechanisms might drive the aberrant expression of cluster 2 genes in autism, we first examined reported changes in the density of trimethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me3, an epigenetic mark that on a genome-wide scale broadly correlates with active promoters) in neurons isolated from PFC of autism and control cases of different ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref045">45</xref>]. We found a significant excess of positive correlations between gene expression and H3K4me3 density changes in autism for genes in clusters 3 and 5 (one-sided Wilcoxon test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s023">S18 Fig</xref>).

Thus, H3K4me3 density changes might be associated with gene expression dysregulation in neuronal cells in the autistic brain and are not specific to the aberrant regulation of synaptic maturation.</p>
<p>We next tested the roles of transcription factors (TFs) in the regulation of expression changes found in autism using target site predictions from Transfac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref046">46</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Though multiple studies have considered aberrant gene expression changes in ASD, associating these with behavioral phenotypes has continued to be a challenge. The evidence to date has pointed towards a causal role for down-regulation of synapse-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref027">27</xref>]. Our results, based on time-series analysis of postnatal brain development in ASD, provide further insight into this observation. First, among all expression changes detected in autism, we find that only one major cluster is functionally linked to cognition-related physiological processes: cluster 2 genes, but not genes in the other clusters, show significant localization preference towards synaptic vesicles and dendrites of neurons and are significantly enriched among genes annotated to be involved in synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Second, we demonstrate that genes in cluster 2, albeit representing less than a quarter of genes with expression changes in autism, are enriched in genetic mutations linked to the disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Third, our data shows that down-regulation of synaptic genes in autism is already present by early childhood and likely arises from altered synaptic development dynamics at earlier postnatal phases in ASD (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g003">3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, even though autism clearly involves a highly heterogeneous set of etiologies and genetic conditions, aberrant developmental expression of synaptic genes might represent one of its causes. This notion largely concurs with observations of greater neuron numbers, pruning deficits, and rapid brain growth in children diagnosed with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref053">53</xref>] and has the potential to provide a mechanistic basis for the short-range synaptic hyper-connectivity and long-range hypo-connectivity characteristic of the neocortex observed in ASD individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref057">57</xref>]. How atypical synaptic gene expression influences these diverse characteristics, how much atypical expression is influenced by atypical environmental input, and whether synaptogenesis in different brain regions are similarly affected, remain to be resolved.</p>
<p>Fourth, we find indication that the EGR family of zinc-finger transcription factors functions as regulators of atypical synaptic expression in ASD, identified in cluster 2. A number of observations support the role of EGRs in ASD etiology: (a) as reported earlier, EGR1 displays an excess of de novo mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s025">S20 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref050">50</xref>]; (b) variants disrupting EGR binding sites in the Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (<italic>CNTNAP2</italic>) promoter were reported as risk factors for ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref058">58</xref>]; (c) MECP2, in which mutations cause Rett syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref059">59</xref>], was found to be regulated by EGR2 in a positive feedback loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref060">60</xref>]; (d) compared to controls, <italic>EGR2</italic> expression is significantly lower in Rett syndrome and ASD brain samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref060">60</xref>], as well as in ASD lymphoblastoid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref061">61</xref>]. Multiple studies indicate the role of EGR family TFs in learning and synaptic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref062">62</xref>], and recent work showed that EGR1 directly regulates GABA receptor subunits in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref063">63</xref>]. It is therefore tempting to propose that the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance, suggested to underlie ASD, could be directly EGR-driven.</p>
<p>Finally, our measurements taken at different points of cortical development allow us to compare the transcriptome dynamics of brain development in ASD with evolutionary differences between humans and other primates. Comparative psychology has made two distinct observations regarding ASD cognition and human evolution: (a) impaired social cognition, which could be evolutionarily deleterious in hominin societies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref030">30</xref>], and (b) hyper-systemizing and attention to detail, a skill that could be beneficial and therefore positively selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref064">64</xref>]. In our data, the dynamics of synaptic expression changes seen in autism in the PFC represent a disruption of one of the most prominent human-specific developmental changes detected in neurotypical brains: delayed expression of synaptic genes and extended period of synaptic maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>], a trait thought to be critical for human social and linguistic learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref044">44</xref>]. This observation might explain the impairment of cognitive aspects suggested to be uniquely human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref030">30</xref>] in ASD.</p>

After fragmentation, first-strand cDNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamer-primers, followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis, end repair, adenylation of 3′ ends, and ligation of the adapters. Fragments were then enriched by PCR and sequenced on the Illumina Hi-seq 2000 system in seven lanes of one flow cell, using the 100-bp single-end sequencing protocol. All samples were randomized prior to library preparation and RNA sequencing.</p>

<title>RNA-seq Data Processing</title>
<p>In total, we obtained 1,495,421,886 RNA-seq reads, with an average sample coverage of approximately 10 million reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s027">S2 Table</xref>). The procedures for data processing were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>]. Briefly, the raw sequencing reads were mapped to each specie’s reference genome (hg19, panTro3, and rheMac2) and the splice junctions using Bowtie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref065">65</xref>]. The splice junction annotation was constructed using UCSC LiftOver tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver">http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver</ext-link>) by combining annotated conserved exons within a gene. Allowing up to three mismatches, 86% of the reads could be mapped to the corresponding genome, 92% of them uniquely (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s027">S2 Table</xref>). Only uniquely mapped reads were used in the downstream analysis. Human gene annotation was downloaded from Ensembl (v66; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org">http://www.ensembl.org</ext-link>). Chimpanzee and rhesus monkey gene annotations were constructed from human gene annotation using the LiftOver tool. Gene annotations were filtered to exclude transcripts with large size differences among the three species; the difference in transcript length between species should be smaller than the length of the shortest transcript. Gene expression levels of transcripts were measured as RPKM values (reads per kilobase per million; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s001">S1 Data</xref>). If a gene contained multiple transcripts, the expression level of the longest transcript was chosen. The expression levels were standardized to mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1 before plotting. It should be noted that the expression profiles of autism and control samples were normalized together.</p>

<title>Identifying the Differentially Expressed Genes in Autism</title>
<p>We identified differential expression between autistic samples and unaffected controls using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref066">66</xref>] as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref068">68</xref>]. The detailed description of the test applied is provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s032">S1 Text</xref>. Briefly, for each gene, we chose the best polynomial regression model with age as predictor and RPKM values as response, using a family of polynomial regression models and the “adjusted r2” criterion. ANCOVA was then used to test whether the regression model with disease-status parameters was significantly better than the model with common parameters for both disease and control groups. The F-test was used to compare the null model (with no disease-status parameters) with the alternative model (with disease-status parameters). The permutations were performed by dividing samples into eight age intervals and permuting disease-status identifiers within each interval in order to preserve the age structure of the data. The FDR was calculated by 1,000 random permutations of sample labels. One thousand, seven hundred seventy-five genes under F-test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and FDR = 0.078 were selected as differentially expressed genes in autism.</p>
<p>To test the robustness of the differential expression in autism calculated by ANCOVA, the likelihood ratio test in the nbinomLRT function in R package “DESeq2” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref030">30</xref>], with counts of reads per gene as inputs, was used to test the significance of changes in deviance between a full mode (~ age + group) and reduced mode (~age), where age is in days and group is the disease status. <italic>P</italic>-values in the likelihood ratio test were adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjustment. One thousand, seven hundred thirty-two genes were identified with adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.078, under the same cutoff in ANCOVA analysis.</p>
<p>To further evaluate the differential expression in autism, we estimated its overlap with the differentially expressed genes in autistic brains reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>], as well as the differentially expressed genes, by reanalyzing the published microarray data by ANCOVA, in which we re-normalized the expression profiles from a primates microarray dataset and an autism microarray dataset measured in two different studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s032">S1 Text</xref>; there were 1,274 genes under F-test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>].</p>

<title>Clustering of Autism-Related Expression Changes</title>
<p>Genes sharing expression pattern difference in autism were identified using hierarchical clustering with (1-<italic>r</italic>), where <italic>r</italic> is the Pearson correlation coefficient, as the distance measure. The correlations were calculated based on expression profiles of control and autistic samples. We used the “complete” method of hierarchical clustering and cut the tree at a height from 2 to 0.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g002">Fig 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s007">S2 Fig</xref>). We discarded groups containing fewer than 40 genes. For each observed gene group under each height cutoff, the KEGG and GO functional enriched terms were calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s032">S1 Text</xref>). The height cutoff = 1.4 yielded the highest enrichment of genes within clusters in functional GO terms and KEGG pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s007">S2 Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s003">S3 Data</xref>). To evaluate the robustness of autism-related expression patterns determined by the abovementioned procedure, we used the log2-transformation of RPKM values as gene expression level measurement or determined gene clusters based on all detected genes. These procedures resulted in 7 and 48 gene clusters, respectively, under the uniform tree height cutoff of 1.4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s008">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s009">S4</xref> Figs). The clustering pattern enriched in synaptic genes, defined in our main analysis as cluster 2, remained robust using all described clustering procedures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s010">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s011">S6</xref> Figs).</p>

<title>Identifying Genes with Species-Specific Expression</title>
<p>Genes with species-specific expression were identified as described in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref037">37</xref>]. Briefly, the differential expression test, described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref067">67</xref>], was performed on each species pair twice, using either species as a reference. For each gene, if either of the two tests was significant at a defined cutoff, we considered this gene as differentially expressed between the two species. If a gene showed no significant expression differences between chimpanzees and macaques, but showed significant differences between humans and the other two primate species, this gene was assigned to the human-specific gene set. Chimpanzee-specific genes were defined using the analogous criteria. The FDR of the differential expression test was estimated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>]. Briefly, samples were divided into six age intervals, and the species’ identifiers were permuted within each group to preserve the age structure of the data. FDR was calculated by 1,000 random permutations of species identifiers.</p>
<p>The human-specific genes identified in this RNA-seq dataset overlapped significantly with the human-specific genes identified in the published microarray data (one-sided Fisher’s exact test, <underline>p</underline> &lt; 0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>]. To identify human-specific expression changes supported by the current RNA-seq data as well as the published microarray data, we calculated the Pearson correlation between RNA-seq and microarray expression curves. The correlations were calculated based on expression levels of all three species interpolated at equal number of time points in each species, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref037">37</xref>], to ensure equal power across species. Specifically, for each species, we interpolated expression values at 15 equally distributed points along the species’ age range shared between RNA-seq and microarray data at the (age)1/4 scale. We used cubic spline regression for interpolation, restricting the fit to three degrees of freedom. Human-specific genes identified in RNA-seq or microarray datasets with Pearson correlation coefficient between RNA-seq and microarray measurements greater than 0.5 were used as a consensus of human-specific expression gene set in the following analysis.</p>

<title>Testing the Excess of Autism-Associated Genetic Mutations</title>
<p>To compare genes differentially expressed in autism with genes showing autism-associated genetic mutations, we used the following data: (1) 791 genes in SFARI AutDB database, which were extracted from studies on the molecular genetics and biology of ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref038">38</xref>] (Updated in December, 2015; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gene.sfari.org/autdb/Welcome.do">https://gene.sfari.org/autdb/Welcome.do</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s012">S7 Fig</xref>); (2) 375 scored genes with strong genetic evidence in the categories 1–4 in SFARI AutDB database (1 = high confidence, 2 = strong candidate, 3 = suggestive evidence, 4 = minimal evidence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g002">Fig 2A</xref>); (3) 977 genes collected from the AutismKB database, which were restricted to genes exacted from the genome-wide association, linkage association, or low-scale association studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref039">39</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://autismkb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/">http://autismkb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s012">S7 Fig</xref>); (4) 1500 genes with de novo mutations associated with autism collected from four published whole-exome sequencing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref012">12</xref>]. To test the excess of overlap between genes differentially expressed in autism with genes showing autism-associated genetic mutations, we calculated the expected-by-chance overlap by randomly sampling the same number of genes expressed in PFC as within the tested cluster, repeating the permutation 1,000 times.</p>
<p>To test the excess of autism-associated mutations in the potential regulators identified in cluster 2, we used the autism germline mutation index of genes calculated by whole-genome sequencing of monozygotic twins concordant for ASD and their parents from the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref050">50</xref>].

<title>TF Binding Site Enrichment Analysis</title>
<p>The identification of putative TF binding sites (TFBSs) was conducted as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref068">68</xref>]. Briefly, we identified the TFs showing enrichment of binding sites (TFBSs), in the regulatory region around the transcription start site of genes within one of the six clusters, and used hypergeometric test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 as nominal cutoff. We used genes in the other five clusters as background. We further estimated the empirical significance of this result, and the randomly expected number of TFs showing the same level of TFBS enrichment, by repeating analysis on 1,000 random sets containing the same number of differentially expressed genes, sampled from all genes differentially expressed between autism patients and unaffected controls. The putative TFBSs were predicted using the Match algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref046">46</xref>] by scanning the TF consensus binding sequences from the TRANSFAC database in the promoter regions of each human Ensembl gene, defined as +/- 2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS). The predicted TFBSs were further restricted to those with ≥80% of nucleotides having defined phastCon score with the average ≥0.6 in the UCSC Genome Browser 17-way vertebrate Conserved Element table [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref069">69</xref>]. We thus defined 156 TFBSs and 192 corresponding TFs (TFBS-TF mapping was done based on the TRANSFAC binding site database). The correlated TFs and their potential targets were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s005">S5 Data</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec018">
<title>TF-Target Correlation Analysis</title>
<p>We tested coexpression of TFs with enriched TFBS with their targets in the corresponding cluster as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref068">68</xref>]. Briefly, based on each TF with enriched targets within a cluster, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficients (PCCs) based on expression levels of TF and its targets within a cluster, and compared them with PCCs based on expression levels of TF and its targets in the other five clusters. We then compared the two PCC distributions using the Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test. The correlated TFs were defined as having BH corrected MWU test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for tests based on expression levels in autism and in control samples. To test whether positive correlations found between TFs and their predicted targets exceeded expectation, the expected-by-chance numbers of correlated TFs were calculated by randomly sampling the same number of autism differentially expressed genes within the tested cluster and repeating the enrichment test 1,000 times.</p>
<p>In total, there were four TFs, EGR1–4, showing significant binding site enrichment in cluster 2 genes, as well as significant expression profiles correlated with the expression of their predicted targets under <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 via BH corrected MWU test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002558.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We have since tested the authenticity of the EGR target predictions using data of EGR1–2 ChIP-seq peaks from the ENCODE project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref022">22</xref>] and two other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002558.ref029">29</xref>]. We downloaded data from NCBI GEO, where the ChIP-seq experiments were done in ECC-1, GM12878, H1-hESC, HCT-116, K562, MCF-7, MAC, and LoVo cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s031">S6 Table</xref>). Data position coordinates of ChIP-seq peaks were converted to hg19 genome builds using UCSC LiftOver when necessary. The annotatePeak function in the R package “ChIPseeker” was used to link peaks with the nearest gene and genic region. For each ChIP-seq experiment, genes with peaks located within the promoter regions (+/- 2 kb of the TSSs) were considered as potential targets of the TF. Fisher’s exact test followed by BH correction for multiple testing was used to test the overlap of EGR targets predicted by searching TFBS sequence matrices from the TRANSFAC database in the promoter regions using Match algorithm and the targets predicted by ChIP-Seq experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002558.s019">S14 Fig</xref>).</p>
