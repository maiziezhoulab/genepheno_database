<abstract>
<p>Tetraspanins (Tspan) are transmembrane proteins with important scaffold and signalling functions. Deletions of <italic>Tetraspanin 6</italic> (<italic>Tspan6)</italic> gene, a member of the tetraspanin family, have been reported in patients with Epilepsy Female-restricted with Mental Retardation (EFMR). Interestingly, mutations in <italic>Tspan7</italic>, highly homologous to <italic>Tspan6</italic>, are associated with X-linked intellectual disability, suggesting that these two proteins are important for cognition. Considering recent evidences showing that Tspan7 plays a key role in synapse development and AMPAR trafficking, we initiated the study of Tspan6 in synaptic function using a <italic>Tspan6</italic> knock out mouse model. Here we report that hippocampal field recordings from <italic>Tspan6</italic> knock out mice show an enhanced basal synaptic transmission and impaired long term potentiation (LTP). A normal paired-pulse facilitation response suggests that Tspan6 affects the properties of the postsynaptic rather than the presynaptic terminal. However, no changes in spine morphology or postsynaptic markers could be detected in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice compared with wild types. In addition, <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice show normal locomotor behaviour and no defects in hippocampus-dependent memory tests.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epilepsy Female-restricted with Mental Retardation (EFMR) is a neurological disorder characterized by its remarkable X-linked inheritance: only females carrying heterozygous mutations in one of their X chromosomal alleles have the disorder, while hemizygous males are unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref001">1</xref>]. Patients show epileptic seizures that vary in type and severity and are usually accompanied by behavioral problems including autistic, obsessive and aggressive features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref002">2</xref>]. <italic>PCDH19</italic> gene, encoding protocadherin 19, is the best candidate responsible for the disease with several mutations and deletions associated with the disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref003">3</xref>]. However, there are still many female patients with the clinical alterations and no mutations in <italic>PCDH19</italic>, suggesting that other genes can also be involved in the pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Two of the EFMR patients screened presented wide genomic deletions that spanned for <italic>PCDH19</italic> and six other neighboring genes: <italic>TNMD</italic>, <italic>SRPX2</italic>, <italic>TSPAN6</italic>, <italic>STYL4</italic>, <italic>CSTF2</italic>, <italic>NOX1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref005">5</xref>]. Given the necessity for the identification of new genes associated with the disorder, we analyzed the deleted genes as potential candidates. One of these genes was <italic>Tetraspanin 6</italic> (<italic>Tspan6</italic>), a member of a large family of evolutionary conserved transmembrane proteins called tetraspanins. In mammals there are 33 members expressed in different cell types with diverse biological functions including cell migration and morphology, motility, cell fusion and signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Tetraspanins are mainly expressed at the plasma membrane, which is a dynamic cellular organelle with a highly specific lipid and protein organization. It is generally accepted that the plasma membrane is compartmentalized in functional microdomains that are essential for signal transduction, membrane trafficking and cell to cell communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref007">7</xref>]. Particularly, synaptic membranes are characterized by a thickening of the postsynaptic membrane forming an electron-dense domain known as postsynaptic density (PSD). This is a specialized structure that contains all the critical proteins for synaptic transmission and plasticity and it is essential for receptors trafficking and postsynaptic signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref008">8</xref>]. Alterations in the composition of the PSD are associated with several synaptic defects and cognitive impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref009">9</xref>]. Importantly, tetraspanins also play a role in membrane compartmentalization, associating with each other and other partners in highly ordered protein complexes called tetraspanins-enriched microdomains (TEM). These microdomains constitute a dynamic scaffold platform important for cell signal transduction and cell to cell communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref011">11</xref>]. The highly organized microdomains and the molecular processes occurring there could be easily compared with the PSD. In fact, Tspan7, another member from the tetraspanin family, have been previously described to form part of the PSD scaffold complex and interestingly, mutations in <italic>Tspan7</italic> gene have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref012">12</xref>]. In the latter paper, the authors showed that Tspan7 interacts with PICK1 in the PSD complex, regulating AMPA receptors trafficking and hippocampal spine development <italic>in vitro</italic>. Given that Tspan6 and Tspan7 are highly homologous members from the Tspan family, sharing 59% of aminoacid identity, we hypothetized that both proteins could be playing similar roles regulating synaptic function.</p>
<p>In order to determine the role of Tspan6 in the brain and to investigate the functional consequences of its deletion, we obtained a constitutive <italic>Tspan6</italic> knock out mouse model and we performed an electrophysiological, behavioral, biochemical and morphological characterization of the adult Tspan6 KO mice compared with wild type littermates.</p>

<title>Tspan6 knock out mice and genotyping</title>
<p>This work have been approved by the ethical committee from the animal research center from the KU Leuven with a project number: P066/2014. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation for the collection of the tissue, and in case of signs of suffering. The <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO was generated by the Velocigene pharmaceutical company by the insertion of a Neomycin cassette in exon 2 of <italic>Tspan6</italic> gene. ES cells derived from the 129/OlaHsd mouse sub-strain were used to generate chimeric mice. F1 mice were generated by breeding with C57BL/6 females. F2 homozygous mutant mice were produced by intercrossing F1 heterozygous males and females. The KO line has subsequently been backcrossed several times to C57BL/6. For genotyping, tails were lysed with KAPA2G Fast HotStart Genotyping Mix (Sopachem) following the instructions from the company. For the PCR amplification 3 different primers were used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Primers sequence listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0171968.t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

After the addition of 200 μl of chloroform, samples were centrifuged and the aqueous phase was mixed with 1.25 volumes of ethanol 100%. Solution was transferred to miRVana spin columns (Ambion, Life Technologies Corporation) and washing and elution steps were done following the protocol described by manufactures. Reverse transcription of 200 ng RNA was performed using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Corporation). Real time semi-quantitative PCR was performed using the LightCycler 480 Sybr Green (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd). Cp (crossing points) were determined by using the second derivative method, and were normalized by two housekeeping genes (Actin and GAPDH). Fold changes were calculated with the ΔΔCt method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref013">13</xref>].

Behavioral freezing was quantified as reliable readout for innate and acquired fear in rodents. Briefly, on the first day, mice were placed for 5 minutes in the StartFear cage (Panlab, Spain) in a specific context (dark environment, grid floor, ethanol odor) for acclimation. On the second day, mice were replaced in the same context and after 2 minutes of exploration (baseline), twice a 30s tone (4 kHZ, 80 dB) was delivered that co-terminated with a 2 s shock delivered through the grid floor (0.3 mA). Inter-stimulus interval was 60 s. After the second tone-shock presentation, mice were returned to their home cage. Later, animals were returned to the testing chamber (same context) for 5 minutes (context trial). After 90 minutes spent in their home cage, mice were tested again for cue-dependent memory in a novel context (illuminated environment, different odor, white plastic covering the grid floor) for 6 minutes.

<title><italic>Tspan6</italic> KO generation and expression in the brain</title>
<p><italic>Tspan6</italic> constitutive KO mouse was generated by insertion of a Neomycin cassette in the exon 2 of the <italic>Tspan6</italic> gene. To validate the KO model, we first purified DNA from <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice and wild-type controls and we amplified it by PCR using a common primer upstream the insertion, a WT-specific primer against exon 2, and a KO-specific primer against the Neomycin cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), demonstrating the specificity of the insertion in exon 2. To further validate the KO model we extracted RNA from <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO brains, we retrotranscribed it into cDNA and we run a real time semi-quantitative PCR. For the cDNA amplification we used primers against exon 1 and 3, flanking the insertion site in exon 2. The Neomycin cassette is more than 6000 base pairs long and the amplification cycle is only 40 seconds, so if the cassette is inserted at the RNA level, we should not see any amplification in the tissue from KO animals. Indeed, this is the case as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g001">Fig 1C</xref>. When we amplified cDNA using primers downstream the insertion (in exon 4 and 5), we could detect some expression of Tspan6 RNA in KO animals, but this expression was reduced more than 60% compared with wild-type controls (0.35±0.01 relative expression normalized to WT) showing that in the KO tissue, Tspan6 RNA is being degraded due to the insertion of the cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). We also analyzed the levels of Tspan6 protein by western blot in neuronal lysates from cortical primary cultures confirming a decreased amount of Tspan6 protein in the heterozygous mice and a total absence of protein in the KO condition.</p>
<p>We then studied the expression pattern of Tspan6 in the brain. Mouse brain atlas showed expression of Tspan6 mRNA predominantly in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla and cerebellum. To confirm the expression of Tspan6 in the hippocampus, we performed a RNA scope experiment using specific probes against Tspan6 (white dots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and synaptophysin (red dots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) RNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, we could confirm expression of Tspan6 in the hippocampal pyramidal layer (CA1-CA3) and in the granule cells from the dentate gyrus.</p>

<title><italic>Tspan6</italic> deletion does not affect hippocampal spine number and maturation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in situ</italic></title>
<p>Spine formation and maturation are essential processes for a correct brain function, and deficits in spine development have been linked to several cognitive diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref022">22</xref>].

<p>We next evaluated the consequence of <italic>Tspan6</italic> knockout <italic>in situ</italic> in the brain. To this end, we performed Golgi staining in adult brains from 10 months-old <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO and control littermates. We focused the study on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons as Tspan6 is highly expressed here, and changes in spine density in this brain region have been associated with cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref023">23</xref>] and Rett syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref024">24</xref>]. Basal secondary dendrites from CA1 pyramidal neurons were analyzed with IMARIS software, allowing 2D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Similarly to what was observed in the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, both <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice and WT littermates show comparable number of spines per 10μm dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether the lack of <italic>Tspan6</italic> could have an effect on the maturations of dendritic spines. Longer and thinner spines (filopodia-like) are considered less mature, and an increased proportion of these type of spines and average length has been associated with neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref025">25</xref>]. Analysis of spine length and head width in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO and WT pyramidal neurons revealed similar values in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether these first series of results suggest that the lack of Tspan6 does not result in major adverse changes in morphological synapse formation and maturation.</p>

<title>Tspan6 regulates basal synaptic transmission and LTP</title>
<p>To study the potential role of Tspan6 in synaptic transmission we performed electrophysiological recordings in acute slices from adult <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO and control littermate mice. First, input-output experiments were carried out to evaluate a possible effect on basal synaptic transmission. We measured the slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) recorded from the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> of CA1 as a function of stimulation intensity applied to the presynaptic Schaffer collaterals fibers from CA3. The input-output curve from <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO acute slices (<italic>n</italic> = 25) was significantly larger compared to the WT littermates (<italic>n =</italic> 30) at any given stimulus intensity (F <sub>(11,583)</sub> = 9.447; p&lt;0.0001, repeated measures ANOVA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), implying that Tspan6 plays an important role in synaptic functionality that is not associated to overt structural alterations of the synapse (see above). To restrict the locus of the observed changes, all the recordings were done in the presence of picrotoxin, an inhibitor of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated currents. In this manner we can conclude that the enhanced basal synaptic transmission shown in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice is not due to a reduced inhibition, but a true increased in excitatory transmission.</p>

<p>In order to substantiate the functional relevance of Tspan6, we next investigated the effect of its deletion in a long-term synaptic plasticity paradigm: long term potentiation (LTP). We induced LTP by presynaptic theta-burst stimulation of the Schaffer collateral fibers. WT slices (<italic>n =</italic> 9) yielded significantly more potentiation than <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO slices (<italic>n =</italic> 14) 60 minutes after stimulation (WT: 1.4±0.07 versus KO: 1.18±0.06 times over the baseline, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, T test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These data confirm that Tspan6 is an important regulator of synaptic function, both at basal conditions and during synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, long-term depression (LTD) was not affected in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO slices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the alterations in plasticity are specific for LTP. To determine whether the observed effects in basal synaptic transmission and LTP were due to changes in the presynaptic terminals of the <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO neurons, we performed paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g003">Fig 3C</xref> shows that PPF ratios are similar between WT and KO slices, suggesting that the increase of basal synaptic transmission and impaired LTP in Tspan6-deficient neurons are not due to alterations in presynaptic function.</p>

<title>Levels of hippocampal synaptic proteins are not changed in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO brains</title>
<p>The previous data show that <italic>Tspan6</italic> deletion affects synaptic transmission possibly at the postsynaptic compartment.

To explore this question, we homogenized hippocampi from 11 months-old <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO and control littermates and we quantified the levels of postsynaptic markers by western blotting.

<p>Changes in synaptic transmission can also be explained by an increased response to glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. The normal PPF showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g002">Fig 2C</xref> suggests no alterations in the presynaptic release probability in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO hippocampus, therefore we hypothesized that the increased glutamate response could be a consequence of an increase number of glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic terminal. To test this hypothesis, we isolated hippocampal synaptosomes from 11 months-old <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO and WT littermates and compared the synaptic levels of different subunits of AMPA, NMDA and mGluR receptors. No significant differences were observed between <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO synaptosomes compared WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). To test whether differences in glutamate receptors could be restricted to the postsynaptic region, we analyzed the levels of the same subunits on purified postsynaptic densities (PSD) from hippocampal synaptosomes. This analysis did not reveal significant differences in the postsynaptic levels of AMPA or NMDA receptors in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice compared to wild types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to mention that none of the previous assays discriminate between intracellular and cell-surface localization of the receptors. To address this question, hippocampal neurons in culture from <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO and WT animals were incubated with a GluA1-specific antibody that recognizes the extracellular N-terminal domain of the subunit before fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref015">15</xref>]. We focused specifically on the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors because induction of LTP is thought to involve the transient incorporation of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref026">26</xref>]. For this reason, an increase in the cell surface expression of GluA1 in the KO condition would explain the observed impaired LTP and the enhanced basal transmission. However, neither the density of surface GluA1 particles (WT: 32.23± 1.93; KO: 32.81± 1.3 particles/10μm; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, T-test) nor the area (WT: 0.059±0.004; KO: 0.058±0.003 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, T-test) were significantly changed in the <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We also analyzed the co-localization of surface GluA1 with the synaptic marker VGlut1, to discriminate between synaptic versus non-synaptic GluA1 population. Again, the density (WT: 11.07 ± 0.95; KO: 11.6 ± 0.96 particles/10μm, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, T-test) and the area (WT: 0.058 ± 0.006; KO: 0.045 ± 0.004 μm<sup>2</sup>

<p>To explore the possibility of a defect in glutamate uptake by astrocytes, we evaluated the levels of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in hippocampus homogenates, however, no significant differences were found between <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO and wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s003">S3E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>As synaptic plasticity was affected upon <italic>Tspan6</italic> deletion, we also investigated whether basic molecular mechanisms associated to LTP were affected in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice. Phosphorylation of AMPA receptors in the brain plays a key role in the regulation of their function and trafficking and it is important for the expression of synaptic plasticity. Particularly, phosphorylation of Serines 831 and 845 of the GluA1 subunit, are believed to regulate single-channel conductance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref027">27</xref>] and open channel probability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref028">28</xref>], respectively, and both are important for LTP induction. We therefore analyzed the levels of phosphorylation of GluA1 in these residues under basal conditions. These experiments did not reveal significant differences in the phosphorylation state of GluA1 Ser831 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) or GluA1 Ser845 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s003">S3B Fig</xref>) in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO synaptosomes compared to WT controls. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (αCamKII) activation by phosphorylation is also essential for LTP induction and it is one of the kinases responsible for GluA1 phosphorylation on Ser831 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref029">29</xref>]. We also examined the synaptic levels of phosphorylated CamKII (pCamKII) and we found similar values in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO and control synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s003">S3C Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Adult <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice show normal locomotor behavior and normal hippocampus-dependent memory performance</title>
<p>To evaluate whether the changes in synaptic transmission have a functional effect in adult mice, we performed a number of behavioral studies in 11 months-old <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice (n = 8) and control (n = 6) littermates. We first analyzed the spontaneous cage activity by the number of beam-crossings during 24 hours. This test allows to assess general changes in activity, and circadian rhythms. Both genotypes showed similar activity profile during the dark and the light phase (Before night: F<sub>(6,72)</sub> = 0.53; During the night: F<sub>(24,288)</sub> = 1.09; Repeated measurements ANOVA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s004">S4A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We also investigated the exploratory behavior in the open field and tracked the trajectories over 10 minutes. We observed no difference in path length but a trend in increased walking speed in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice compared to controls (WT: 0.044±0.004 versus KO: 0.053±0.003m/s; <italic>p</italic> = 0.07, T test). The number of entries to center and periphery were also comparable in both groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Similarly, the elevated plus maze, another test evaluating anxiety-like behavior, did not show differences in open arm time between the genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s004">S4C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Long term synaptic plasticity is considered an essential molecular mechanism for learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref030">30</xref>]. As <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice showed impairments in LTP, we investigated whether the electrophysiological impairment had a true functional counterpart, reflected in hippocampal-dependent memory processes. To address this possibility we first performed a contextual fear conditioning test. Both groups learned to associate a cue (tone) and a context with an aversive event (electric shocks), without significant differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Next, we analyzed spatial cognition in the Morris water maze. All mice learned to locate the hidden platform after 10 days of acquisition training, reflected by a decrease in escape latency (F<sub>(9, 279)</sub> = 74.81; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001 RM-ANOVA, factor time) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

Two probe trials were performed after 5 and 10 days of training (probe trial 1 and 2, respectively), when the platform was removed and swim trajectories were tracked for 100s. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, after 5 and 10 days of training, both groups showed a similar swimming preference for the quadrant where the platform was located. We also evaluated the accuracy of spatial reference memory by quantifying the time spent swimming at the defined platform position, finding no significant differences between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171968.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we have identified Tspan6 as a modulator of the synaptic transmission and plasticity machinery. <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO hippocampal slices showed an enhanced basal synaptic transmission in CA3-CA1 synapses and an impaired LTP. Although at first sight increased basal synaptic transmission and reduced LTP appear paradoxical, it is possible that in fact the impaired LTP is the consequence of potentiated post-synaptic membrane due to long-lasting (lifelong) enhanced basal transmission. In this scenario of constitutively potentiated post-synaptic membrane it is then natural that theta burst stimulation cannot induce further potentiation. This type of “occluded” LTP has been previously reported in conditions of overexpression of proteins that enhance synaptic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref032">32</xref>]. In addition, our results suggest that Tspan6-dependent potentiation of transmission share the same molecular mechanisms required for LTP. However, it still remains to be stablished how the absence of Tspan6 leads to an enhaced synaptic transmission without changes in the AMPA receptor surface expression or accumilations at PSD franction. One possibility may be linked to changes in biophysical properties of the AMPA receptor independent from GluA1 phosphorylation. For example, AMPA receptor association with transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) has been shown to modulate gating properties of the AMPA receptor ion channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref033">33</xref>]. However, most TARPs also modulate AMPA receptor surface expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref034">34</xref>] which we have not observed here.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, genomic deletions including the <italic>Tspan6</italic> gene have been described in two female patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref005">5</xref>]. Both publications concluded that the pathology was due to deletions in the <italic>PCDH19</italic> gene, located in the same genomic region than <italic>Tspan6</italic>. However, deletions spanned more than 4 other genes including <italic>Tspan6</italic> and the possibility that these genes also contribute to the pathology has not been ruled out. Interestingly, increased CA1 excitability has been associated with epileptic activity in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref035">35</xref>]. Our observation that the lack of Tspan6 enhances CA1 excitability raises the possibility that the epileptic phenotype of the patients is partially due to <italic>Tspan6</italic> gene deletion. In addition, the impaired LTP observed in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice could also support the cognitive defects shown in the patients.</p>
<p>However, in this study, despite the impaired LTP observed in the hippocampus from <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice, we found no significant deficits in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks (Morris water maze and contextual fear conditioning). While a functional link between <italic>ex vivo</italic> hippocampal LTP and hippocampus dependent behavior is often stipulated, there are several examples in the literature that do not support such an absolute correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref039">39</xref>]. This suggests that learning and memory defects might be a consequence of a whole neuronal network dysfunction not limited to the hippocampus alone.</p>
<p>Some members of the tetraspanin family, including Tspan6, contain in the C-terminal domain, tyrosine-based sorting sequences that are putative PDZ bindings motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref040">40</xref>]. Interestingly, the first PDZ-containing protein identified was the postsynaptic protein 95 (PSD95) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref041">41</xref>] and PDZ-dependent interactions are essential for NMDA and AMPA receptors trafficking in the synapses and are the bases for synaptic transmission and plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref008">8</xref>]. In fact, Tspan7 forms part of the PSD scaffold complex interacting with the PDZ domain of PICK1 and regulating the trafficking of AMPAR through this interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref012">12</xref>]. In the latter paper, authors suggested a positive role of Tspan7 in synaptic transmission, showing that Tspan7 downregulation in hippocampal primary cultures reduced excitatory synaptic function. Intriguingly, <italic>Tspan6</italic> deletion produce the opposite effect in hippocampal acute slices, enhancing basal transmission. These indications suggest that despite the high amino acid residue identity shared between Tspan6 and Tspan7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref042">42</xref>], both proteins may play opposite roles. We also considered that the enhanced synaptic transmission in the Tspan6 KO condition could be due to an increased expression of Tspan7 as a compensatory mechanism. Although we did not observe a significant upregulation of Tspan7 in hippocampal homogenates from <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice to explain the reported changes in synaptic transmission (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), we cannot rule out the possibility that the lack of molecular or behavioral phenotype showed in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice might be due to a Tspan7 increase in discrete, functionally relevant, areas of the neuron.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the recent years, several new proteins have been described to form part of the PSD complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref044">44</xref>] that were not previously identified in AMPA receptor interactome studies. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref045">45</xref>] In addition, it has been recently shown that AMPA receptors are localized at nanodomains within the synaptic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref047">47</xref>], and these structures are rapidly reorganized in response to synaptic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref049">49</xref>]. Given that tetraspanins are known to associate with each other in membrane domains regulating different trafficking and transduction processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0171968.ref010">10</xref>], it is tempting to speculate that Tspan6 and Tspan7 are both new components of the PSD scaffold machinery playing an important role in the rearrangement of subsynaptic structures such as AMPA receptors, even within the postsynaptic density. Certainly more experiments, particularly superresolution imaging, may be needed to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Further investigation is required to understand the molecular mechanism underlying Tspan6-dependent effect on synaptic transmission and whether this effect is partially responsible for the seizures and intellectual disability described in patients. In addition, in this paper we also showed an effect of Tspan6 deletion in motor learning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171968.s005">S5B Fig</xref>) suggesting that Tspan6 is not only playing a role in hippocampal synaptic function but it is also important for other brain regions such as cortex or cerebellum.</p>

Histograms compare mean (±S.E.M) number of beam crosses between WT and KO mice. <bold>(B)</bold> In the open field test <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO and control littermates have similar exploratory and locomotor behavior with no changes in distance travelled and number of entries to the center and periphery. Average speed was slightly increased in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07, T-test). <italic>n</italic> = 6 WT, 8 KO mice. <bold>(C)</bold> Elevated plus maze show no difference in the percent of time spent in open arms between <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO (<italic>n</italic> = 19) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 18) mice. Error bars indicate SEM.</p>

<title><italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice show no differences in contextual fear conditioning test but impaired motor learning in the rotarod test.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold>Contextual fear conditioning in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and control littermates (<italic>n</italic> = 6). All mice learned to associate the context (increased % of freezing in the context phase) and the tone (increased freezing in the tone phase) with the shocks with no differences between genotypes. <bold>(B)</bold> Rotarod test show impaired motor learning in <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice. Latency to fall in the rotating drum is plotted for the different trials (mean ±S.E.M). Test was done after 2 days of training 4 trials a day with 30 and 60 minutes inter-trial interval. <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO mice have a decreased latency to fall during the first trials (F<sub>(3,114)</sub> = 4.4, p&lt;0.05, Repeated measurements ANOVA). The fact that in the last trial both groups have similar latency values show that <italic>Tspan6</italic> KO do not show any motor deficits and only an effect in learning. <italic>n</italic> = 20 WT and KO mice.</p>
