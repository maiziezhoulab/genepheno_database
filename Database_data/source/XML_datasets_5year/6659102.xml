<abstract>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) comprise a heterogeneous group of neuro-developmental abnormalities with a strong genetic component, characterized by deficits in verbal and non-verbal communication, impaired social interactions, and stereotyped behaviors. In a small percentage of cases, ASDs are associated with alterations of genes involved in synaptic function. Among these, relatively frequent are mutations/deletions of genes encoding for neuroligins (NLGs). NLGs are postsynaptic adhesion molecules that, interacting with their presynaptic partners neurexins, ensure the cross talk between pre- and postsynaptic specializations and synaptic stabilization, a condition needed for maintaining a proper excitatory/inhibitory balance within local neuronal circuits. We have focused on mice lacking NLG3 (NLG3 knock-out mice), animal models of a non-syndromic form of autism, which exhibit deficits in social behavior reminiscent of those found in ASDs. Among different brain areas involved in social cognition, the CA2 region of the hippocampus has recently emerged as a central structure for social memory processing. Here, <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings from anesthetized animals and <italic>ex vivo</italic> recordings from hippocampal slices have been used to assess the dynamics of neuronal signaling in the CA2 hippocampal area. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments from NLG3-deficient mice revealed a selective impairment of spike-related slow wave activity in the CA2 area and a significant reduction in oscillatory activity in the theta and gamma frequencies range in both CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. These network effects were associated with an increased neuronal excitability in the CA2 hippocampal area. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> recordings from CA2 principal cells in slices obtained from NLG3 knock-out animals unveiled a strong excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in this region accompanied by a strong reduction of perisomatic inhibition mediated by CCK-containing GABAergic interneurons. These data clearly suggest that the selective alterations in network dynamics and GABAergic signaling observed in the CA2 hippocampal region of NLG3 knock-out mice may account for deficits in social memory reminiscent of those observed in autistic patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) comprise a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders with a strong genetic component, characterized by deficits in verbal and non-verbal communication, impaired social interactions, restricted interests, and stereotyped behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The high incidence of these disorders in recent years (1/100 children with males affected four to six times more than females) can be attributed to the improvement of the diagnostic criteria in general, to the increased attention of the medical community, and to environmental and epigenetic factors acting upon a genetically vulnerable background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Most of the genes implicated in ASDs encode proteins relevant for synapse formation, transcriptional regulation, and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Although mutations or deletions in genes encoding for synaptic proteins are relatively rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), nevertheless they are important since they point to synapses as possible sites of origin of ASDs, which can be considered synaptopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). One class of non-syndromic forms of ASDs has been found to be associated with mutations or deletions in neuroligin genes (Nlgn1-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Neuroligins (NLGs) are postsynaptic adhesion molecules which bind to their presynaptic partners neurexins to functionally couple the postsynaptic densities with the transmitter release machinery, thus contributing to synapses formation and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). To study the mechanisms by which these mutations/deletions contribute to ASD, animal models have been generated that recapitulate important aspects of the human disorder.</p>
<p>Previous studies from NLG3<sup>R451C</sup> knock-in and NLG3-knock-out mice have revealed the presence of circuit-specific and cell-specific synaptic dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Interestingly, both NLG3<sup>R451C</sup> knock-in and NLG3-knock-out mice exhibit deficits in social interaction/memory reminiscent of those found in autistic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>Among brain areas comprising the “social brain” the CA2 region of the hippocampus, characterized by peculiar molecular, morphological, and physiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), has recently emerged as a central structure for social memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). This region is responsible not only for encoding social memory, namely, the capacity of an animal to recognize a conspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), but also for social aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Previous data from mice lacking the Nlgn3 gene have focused on the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and on the CA1 hippocampal synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, the CA2 hippocampal circuit, selectively related to social cognition, whose impairment constitutes one of the core symptoms of ASDs, has never been explored.</p>
<p>Here, behavioral, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings from NLG3 knock-out mice have allowed identifying alterations of the CA2 hippocampal circuit probably related to deficits in social memory.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2_1">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the Italian Animal Welfare legislation (D.L. 26/2014) that implemented the European Committee Council Directive (2010/63 EEC) and were approved by local veterinary authorities, the EBRI ethical committee, and the Italian Ministry of Health (1084/PR15). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. NLG3 KO mice were obtained from Prof. P. Scheiffele (Biozentrum, Basel). Experiments were performed on offspring male derived from heterozygous mating after 10 backcrossing with C57BL6/J. The experiments were performed and the results were analyzed blindly before genotyping. Control experiments were performed on wild‐type littermates (controls). Genotyping was carried out on tail biopsy DNA by PCR using a standard protocol. At least five male mice for each genotype were used in a given experiment. Western blot analysis from hippocampal lysates confirmed the lack of NLG3 protein in KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
<bold>Figure S1</bold>
</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2_2">
<title>Western Blot</title>
<p>Hippocampi from controls and NLG3 KO mice were homogenized using a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% CHAPS, 1  mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Equal amounts of total protein extracts were run on a 10% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel (SDS-PAGE). Western blot analysis was performed with the following primary antibodies: an anti-NLG3 polyclonal antibody (1:1,000, Synaptic System, #129 311) and an anti-actin-HRP (1:5,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-NLG3 Primary antibody was revealed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).</p>

<sec id="s2_3">
<title>Slice Preparation</title>
<p>Transverse hippocampal slices (320 μm thick) were obtained from postnatal (P) day P30–P40 old animals, using a standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Briefly, after being anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of tiletamine/zolazepam (80 mg/kg) and xilazine (10 mg/kg), mice were decapitated. The brain was quickly removed from the skull, placed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 75 sucrose, 87 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 25 glucose. After recovery, an individual slice was transferred to a submerged recording chamber and continuously perfused at 33–34°C with oxygenated ACSF at a rate of 3 ml/min. ACSF saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> containing the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 25 glucose. The osmolarity was 310–320 mOsm.</p>

<sec id="s2_4">
<title>Electrophysiological Recordings in Slices</title>
<p>Cells were visualized with a 60× water immersed objective mounted on an upright microscope (Nikon, eclipse FN1) equipped with a CCD camera (Scientifica, UK). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in voltage-clamp mode were performed with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Patch electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI, Florida, USA); they had a resistance of 3–4 MΩ when filled with an intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 70 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 70 CsCl, 10 Hepes, 0.2 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgATP, 0.3 MgGTP, and 5 Na-phosphocreatine; the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH; the osmolarity was 290–300 mOsm. The holding membrane potential value was not corrected for the liquid junction potential of 10 mV (calculated with the Clampex software; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The stability of the patch was checked by repetitively monitoring the input and series resistance during the experiments. Series resistance (10–20 MΩ) was not compensated. Cells exhibiting 15% changes were excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>Spontaneous GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and AMPA-mediated postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded in the CA2 region of the hippocampus from a holding potential of −70 mV in the presence of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10 μM) and picrotoxin (100 μM), respectively. GABAergic currents (IPSCs) were evoked in CA2 principal cells by stimulation of GABAergic inputs with a glass pipette (filled with ACSF) positioned in stratum pyramidale (at 100–200 µM from the patched cell). Cells were recorded from a holding potential of −50 mV, in the presence of CNQX (10 µM) and DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (DL-APV, 100 µM), to block α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ဂAMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, respectively. The intensity of stimulation (delivered at 0.1 Hz) was set at around 60% of the maximum response. Synaptic currents mediated by cholecystokinin-positive interneurons were obtained by subtracting from the total current that sensitive to ω-conotoxin GVIA (ω-CTx-GVIA, 1 µM), known to block N type of voltage-dependent calcium channels, responsible for triggering the release of GABA from CCK+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Synaptic currents mediated by parvalbumin-positive interneurons were obtained by subtracting from the total current that sensitive to ω-Agatoxin (ω-Agtx-IVA, 300 nM), known to block the P/Q types of voltage-dependent calcium channel responsible for triggering the release of GABA from PV+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Drugs were applied in the bath, and the ratio of flow rate to bath volume ensured complete exchange within 2–3 min.</p>

<italic>In Vivo</italic> Electrophysiological Recordings From Anesthetized Animals</title>
<p>Mice (P50–70) were anesthetized with i.p. injection of a mixture of tiletamine/zolazepam (Zoletil; 80 mg/kg) and xilazine (10 mg/kg) to induce anesthesia before surgery and during recordings. A craniotomy for recording sites was drilled between −1.6 and −1.7 mm posterior from bregma, and lateral coordinates were adjusted after extracellular mapping to locate the CA2 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers. Temperature was maintained between 36°C and 37°C using a feedback-controlled heating pad (FHC). Recordings were obtained with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier connected to the Digidata 1550 system. Data were acquired with pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices) and analyzed off-line with Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices).</p>
<p>Extracellular recordings of field potentials were obtained with glass electrodes (Hingelberg, Malsfeld, Germany) prepared with a vertical puller PP-830 (Narishige), and the tip was broken to obtain a resistance of 1–2 MΩ. Electrodes were filled with a standard Ringer’s solution containing the following (in mM): 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 5 HEPES, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Juxtacellular recordings of spontaneous neuronal firing were obtained using glass electrodes (7–10 MΩ) filled with Ringer solution. Bursts behavior (a burst was defined as a sequence of two or more action potentials occurring at frequency ≥20 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) was assessed using the features of spike firing pattern illustrated by plots of interspike interval (ISI) distributions. Bursting behavior showed a distribution of ISI skewed on the left. A clampfit algorithm was used to detect bursts from the total events found setting a threshold. The interval for burst detections ranged from 20 to 50 ms.</p>

<sec id="s2_6">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were transferred to a computer hard disk after digitization with an A/D converter (Digidata 1550, Molecular Devices). Data acquisition (digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 3 kHz) was performed with pClamp 10.4 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Input resistance and cells capacitance were measured online with the membrane test feature of the pClamp software. Spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs were analyzed with pClamp 10.4 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). This program uses a detection algorithm based on a sliding template. The template did not induce any bias in the sampling of events because it was moved along the data trace by one point at a time and was optimally scaled to fit the data at each position.</p>
<p>The rise time of the evoked IPSC was estimated as the time needed for 20–80% increase of the peak current response. The decay time was fitted with first order exponential function in the following form:</p>

<title>LFP analysis</title>
<sec id="s2_7_1">
<title>Unsupervised Decomposition of Local Field Potentials (LFPs)</title>
<p>Raw LFPs data were sampled at 10 kHz and decomposed into their elementary signals or intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using the “Complete Empirical Ensemble Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise “CEEMDAN” algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). One of the main advantages of this algorithm is that it deals well with non-stationary signals, thus diminishing filtering artifacts (such as harmonics and side band-related distortions) caused by convolution filters for cross-frequency coupling analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). We extracted theta (5–14 Hz), low (25–55 Hz), and high gamma (56–120 Hz) signals by combining IMFs with mean instantaneous frequencies [see Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>)].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2_7_2">
<title>Power Spectral Density (PSD) Analysis</title>
<p>Welch’s PSD was computed using MATLAB <italic>pwelch</italic> function. The Hanning (2048) window was chosen in order to achieve frequency resolution of 5 Hz with overlap of 50%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2_7_3">
<title>Average Relative Power of Individual Bands</title>
<p>Average relative amplitude of LFP bands was calculated as <italic>z</italic>-score of individual bands, with standard deviation of raw LFP. This gives us the relative amplitude of each band. Average relative power was obtained by taking the square of relative amplitude and dividing it by the length of the signal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2_7_4">
<title>Band Occurrence Frequency</title>
<p>To obtain band occurrence frequency, we used <italic>z</italic>-scored amplitude of individual LFP bands. This was obtained using MATLAB function <italic>z-</italic>score. We then counted the number of cycles (<italic>cycle count</italic>) where amplitude exceeded the <italic>threshold</italic> of 2 standard deviations. Dividing the <italic>cycle count</italic> by total duration gives us the band occurrence frequency for a given LFP band in a given recording file. The choice <italic>threshold = 2 standard deviations</italic> was motivated by the observation that amplitudes in a given LFP band is distributed normally and we wanted to include only those cycles in <italic>cycle count</italic> which takes the amplitude beyond the 95th percentile.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2_7_5">
<title>Spike Time Extraction</title>
<p>To extract spikes from LFPs we used “wave clus,” a MATLAB tool developed by Chaure et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) that filters raw signals using band-pass filter in the range 300 to 4,500 Hz. Spike detection threshold was set at 5 standard deviations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2_7_6">
<title>Power During Spikes</title>
<p>We studied variation in power in LFPs preceding and following 1 s of spike time. This time (1 s) was divided into 10 bins of 100 ms each. We then computed the average relative power as described above for each bin. This allows evaluating how LFP power varies before and after a spike.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2_7_7">
<title>Spike-Triggered Average LFP Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of the temporal relationship between multi-unit-activity and ongoing activity was analyzed using custom written scripts in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States). Briefly, spikes were extracted using a threshold on the high-passed version of the recorded membrane potential (cut frequency was set at 500 Hz). The threshold was set at 5 times the standard deviation of this signal. To compute the spike-triggered average, we cut 1 s time segment around the occurrence of each spike using a band-pass-filtered LFP signal (cut frequencies were set at 0.2 and 50 Hz). Experiments where multi-unit-activity were either absent or very sparse (below 1 Hz) were excluded from the analysis.</p>

<p>Drugs were applied in the bath by gravity by changing the superfusion solution to one differing only in its content of drug(s). Drugs used were the following: CNQX, DL-APV, ω-CTx-GVIA, and picrotoxin purchased from Tocris (UK) and ω-Agtx-IVA from SIGMA (Italy). Stock solutions were made in distilled water and then aliquoted and frozen at −20°C. Picrotoxin and CNQX were dissolved in DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in the bathing solution was 0.1%. At this concentration, DMSO alone did not modify the membrane potential, input resistance, or the firing properties of CA2 neurons.</p>

<title>Three Chamber</title>
<p>In order to evaluate sociability and interest in social novelty, we tested animals by using the three-chamber test, adapted from Moy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The social testing area was a homemade rectangular, three-chambered box (each chamber was 20 × 40 × 21 cm in size). Dividing walls were made from clear Plexiglas, with rectangular openings (6 × 8.5 cm) allowing access to each chamber. The light intensity was distributed equally in different parts of the apparatus (6 lux). Between trials, the chambers of the arena were cleaned with 70% ethanol to eliminate any lingering smells.</p>
<p>Mice were habituated to handling 5 min a day for 5 days before the test. The day before the test, mice were placed in the empty chamber and allowed to explore for 30 min. On the test day, a 10 min habituation phase in the empty apparatus took place prior to the test phase. The test phase consisted of three consecutive trials. In the first two trials, sociability was assessed. An unfamiliar C57BL7/6J male mouse (stranger 1) was placed in a wire cup (ø 10.5 cm × 10.5 cm h) in one of the side chambers. In the other side chamber, an identical wire cup was placed to ensure that the test mouse had a choice between a novel object and a novel social context. The position of “stranger 1” was alternated between the first and second trials, to prevent side preference. The test mouse was placed in the middle compartment and allowed to explore the entire social test arena for 10 min. The interaction time with the stranger mouse was recorded by the video-tracking system (ANY-maze, Stoelting Co, IL, US). The score for sociability was calculated as the difference between the investigation time for the compartment containing the novel mouse and that for the compartment with the novel object. After a 1 h inter-session interval a second unfamiliar C57BL7/6J male mouse (stranger 2 or novel) was placed into the previously empty wire cage, while “stranger 1” (familiar) remained inside its cup. The subject mouse was given 10 min to explore all three chambers. “Strangers mice” were 4–5 weeks old (juvenile) to exclude any effect due to mutual aggression. The score for social novelty was calculated as the difference between the investigation time for the compartment containing the novel mouse and that for the compartment with the familiar mouse.</p>

<title>Open Field</title>
<p>Mice were also tested in the open field for general locomotor activity, anxiety, and willingness to explore. The experimental apparatus consisted of a black rectangular open field (60 cm × 60 cm × 30 cm; Panlab, US). Mice were allowed to acclimate in their home cage to the procedure room for 30 min before the test. The arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to eliminate any lingering smells. During the test, each animal was placed in the center of the arena and allowed to freely move for 10 min while being recorded with an overhead camera. Mouse activity was then analyzed by an automated tracking system (ANY-maze, Stoelting Co, IL, US) for the following parameters: total ambulatory distance and velocity. A series of 12 × 12 cm zones were identified and used to evaluate the time spent in the center (inner zone) or peripheral zones (outer zone). The outer zone consisted of 12 blocks close to walls, while the inner zone consisted of 9 blocks in the center. Greater time spent in the outer zones of the maze was indicative of amplified anxiety-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p>

<title>NLG3 KO Mice Exhibit Deficits in Social Behavior</title>
<p>One of the core symptoms of autism is the impairment in social cognition. Previous studies from NLG3 KO mice have revealed altered social memory, probably related to olfactory deficiency with no alterations in time spent in social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, when tested in the three-chamber apparatus, while control mice exhibited normal levels of sociability, spending more time in exploring the mouse cage with respect to the empty one (object), NLG3 KO mice did not show any preference for the mouse cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">

<title>Impairment of Spike-Related Slow Wave Activity in the CA2 Region of the Hippocampus of NLG3 KO Mice</title>
<p>In order to understand whether defects in social behavior observed in NLG3 KO mice depend on alterations in network dynamics, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded in <italic>in vivo</italic> anesthetized animals from the CA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
<bold>Figure 2A</bold>
</xref>) and CA3 hippocampal regions. Firstly, we analyzed the relation between LFPs and multi-unit activity (MUA) recorded in stratum pyramidale. In the presence of anesthetics, LFPs were characterized by slow waves, occurring at the frequency of about 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
<bold>Figures 2B, C</bold>
</xref>). By filtering the LFP signals for frequencies above 500 Hz, we could clearly see the signatures of MUA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">

<bold>Figures 2D, E</bold>

<title>Reduced Power of Theta and Gamma Oscillations in Hippocampal Subfields of NLG3 KO Mice</title>
<p>To dissect out possible alterations in neural oscillations, observed in several neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), raw LFP data were used to extract various bands occurring in the theta (5–14 Hz), low gamma (25–55 Hz), and high gamma (56–120 Hz) frequencies with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition algorithm. While high-gamma oscillations are thought to contribute to memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), low-gamma ones are believed to promote memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). To assess the average network activity, we measured power using the Welch Power Spectrum method and analyzed average relative power in individual LFP bands. In order to normalize for variations in raw LFP across animals and genotypes, we considered the relative power in each LFP band with respect to its corresponding raw LFP. This allowed us to compare normalized power across genotypes. We found a significant reduction in the average relative power of both low gamma and high gamma bands in the CA2 region of NLG3 KO mice as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">

Interestingly, also the CA3 region of NLG3 KO mice showed a reduced power in gamma as well as in theta bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">

To assess whether the reduction in power relied on alterations in band occurrence frequency, the latter was quantified for each LFP bands in both CA2 and CA3 hippocampal regions. We found a significant increase in band occurrence frequency of high gamma band in both CA2 and CA3 regions of NLG3 KO mice as compared to controls. No significant alterations in band occurrence frequency of theta and low gamma rhythms of either regions were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">

These data suggest that the occurrence frequency of theta and low gamma are not responsible for reduction in power in theta and low gamma bands observed in NLG3 KO mice. To understand how theta and gamma power vary in CA3 and CA2 regions before and after a spike, we extracted spikes from raw LFP using the WaveClus, an unsupervised spike-sorting algorithm. Spike times were extracted, and LFP power, in and between theta and gamma bands, were analyzed 1 s before and after a spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">

<title>Increased Bursting Activity in <italic>In Vivo</italic> Recordings From CA2 Principal Cells of NLG3 KO Mice</title>
<p>To understand whether alterations of network activity observed in the CA2 and CA3 hippocampal regions of NLG3 KO mice were associated to changes in their output, single neurons firing was recorded in <italic>in vivo</italic> anesthetized animals. Based on spontaneous firing frequency, firing mode and spike waveform, two populations of neurons could be clearly recognized in juxtacellular recordings from single CA2 neurons, corresponding to putative interneurons and pyramidal cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). While interneurons preferentially fire narrow action potentials at high rate, principal cells fire single action potentials intermixed with short duration bursts. Since interneurons are highly heterogeneous, we restricted the comparison between NLG3 KO and control mice to bursting neurons. The spontaneous firing [monitored for 5–10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">

<title>Impairment of Perisomatic Inhibition Mediated by GABAergic Interneurons Expressing CCK in NLG3 KO Mice</title>
<p>To determine whether alterations in network oscillations observed in <italic>in vivo</italic> and in <italic>ex vivo</italic> recordings from NLG3 KO mice are due to impairments of perisomatic inhibition, which efficiently suppresses repetitive sodium-dependent action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) and entrains network oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), inhibitory synaptic currents evoked in CA2 pyramidal cells by stimulation of GABAergic inputs were analyzed. Stimulation of GABAergic inputs, with an intensity equal to 60% of that necessary to evoke a maximal response, induced monosynaptic IPSCs. IPSCs showed similar rise (controls: 4.89 ± 2 ms, NLG3 KO: 3.3 ± 1.6 ms; <italic>p</italic> = 0.6, Mann–Whitney test) and decay times (controls: 31.1 ± 2.4 ms, NLG3 KO: 26.2 ± 3.7 ms; <italic>p</italic> = 0.2, Mann–Whitney test) in both genotypes.</p>
<p>GABAergic terminals present in the pyramidal layer belong mainly to CCK+ and PV+ GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Interestingly, GABA release from these two interneuron subtypes is triggered by calcium entry <italic>via</italic> different voltage-gated calcium channels, N types, and P/Q, respectively, sensitive to different toxins.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we provide evidence that the NLG3 KO mouse, an animal model of non-syndromic form of autism, exhibits clear alterations in network dynamics in the CA2 region of the hippocampus, probably at the origin of social memory defects reminiscent of those found in autistic patients. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), NLG3-deficient mice did not show any preference for the novel mouse in the social novelty test, suggesting an impairment in the capacity to remember a conspecific, an effect associated to an enhanced exploratory behavior in the open field. However, in contrast with Radyushkin et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), NLG3 KO mice exhibited clear sociability deficits as assessed by the reduced time in exploring the animal as compared to their control littermates and by the lack of preference for the animal <italic>versus</italic> the object. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that in contrast with Radyushkin et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), who have used as controls age-matched C57Bl/6 male, we have employed littermates reared, as NLG3 KO, in the same cage, a condition known to critically affect, through peers interactions, the acquisition of social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the circuitry responsible for social deficits in ASDs represents a key step for understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders. Several brain areas encode social behavior, including the medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), and the CA2 region of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments from NLG3 KO mice clearly demonstrate selective changes in the amplitude of slow waves preceding or following the occurrence of spikes (spike-triggered average or STA). These modifications reflect alterations in electrophysiological signals produced by large neuronal ensembles in that specific region of that particular genotype and therefore cannot be attributed to the anesthetic used. LFPs represent summed synaptic activity located in small volume around the recording site, related to the strength of functional connectivity between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Consistent with STA data, the observed modifications in theta and gamma power probably reflect aberrant functional connectivity between the hippocampus and associated networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). However, while STA defects were confined to the CA2 region of the hippocampus, changes in theta and gamma power occurred in both CA2 and CA3 hippocampal areas. This is in accord with the recent observation that both CA2 and CA3 hippocampal regions contribute to generate gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Changes in theta and gamma power have been often found in the EEG/MEG of autistic children during their resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>) or during sustained attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). Interestingly, as in the present experiments, a strong reduction in gamma power associated with a dysfunction of GABAergic signaling was detected in the CA3 region of the hippocampus of mice lacking the adhesion molecule NLG4, exhibiting behavioral deficits reminiscent of those found in ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). However, unlike the present experiments, in NLG4 knock-out mice the oscillatory activity pharmacologically induced by kainate <italic>in vitro</italic> was highly dependent on perisomatic inhibition generated by PV+ interneurons.</p>
<p>As in the present experiments, abnormal oscillatory activity may arise from elevation in the cellular balance of excitation and inhibition, <italic>via</italic> an increased excitatory and a decreased inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). The E/I balance represents a critical condition for the correct functioning of neuronal networks, and it is essential for nearly all brain functions, including representation of sensory information and cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). In the present study, the E/I imbalance accounts for the selective enhancement of cell excitability recorded in <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments from the CA2 hippocampal region. It is commonly accepted that network oscillations generated by the interplay between excitation and inhibition involve the activity of PV+ interneurons mediating the feedforward and feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). Unexpectedly, a more detailed analysis into perisomatic inhibition, using toxins known to affect presynaptic calcium rise <italic>via</italic> VDCC, has unveiled a clear reduction in the probability of GABA release from CCK+ interneurons in the CA2 hippocampal region. Interestingly, in contrast with the present data, a detailed analysis of unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents between CCK+ interneurons and principal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus revealed an increased probability of GABA release probably consequent to impairment of a tonic endocannabinoid signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), suggesting that, in mice lacking NLG3, changes in GABAergic signaling are cell and circuit specific. Although PV+ and CCK+ interneurons target the same domains of pyramidal cells, the functional role of the latter in network synchronization is still unclear. By comparing, in anesthetized rats, spike time during oscillations, Klausberger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>) suggest that these interneuron subtypes contribute differently to network activity. While PV expressing interneurons provide more stereotyped oscillatory entrainment of the entire network, CCK+ interneurons might shape the activity of subgroups of principal cells forming neuronal assemblies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data from NLG3 mice strongly suggest that alterations in CA2 network dynamics may account for the behavioral deficits, similar to those observed in autistic children. It should be stressed however that, while social memory is likely to be processed by the CA2 region of the hippocampus, sociability might involve other brain structures including the basolateral complex of the amygdala, which projects to the ventral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>).</p>
<p>Whatever the origin of behavioral deficits reported here, our results further highlight the crucial role of an altered GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated neurotransmission in neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). Thus, interfering with GABAergic signaling may be considered as a key strategy for the treatment of some forms of ASDs that involve genetic modification/deletions of synaptic proteins.</p>
