<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p id="P1">The development of the nervous system involves a coordinated succession
of events including the migration of GABAergic neurons from ventral to dorsal
forebrain and their integration into cortical circuits. However, these
interregional interactions have not yet been modelled with human cells. Here, we
generate from human pluripotent cells three-dimensional spheroids resembling
either the dorsal or ventral forebrain and containing cortical glutamatergic or
GABAergic neurons. These subdomain-specific forebrain spheroids can be assembled
to recapitulate the saltatory migration of interneurons similar to migration in
fetal forebrain. Using this system, we find that in Timothy syndrome– a
neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2
calcium channel, interneurons display abnormal migratory saltations. We also
show that after migration, interneurons functionally integrate with
glutamatergic neurons to form a microphysiological system. We anticipate that
this approach will be useful for studying development and disease, and for
deriving spheroids that resemble other brain regions to assemble circuits
<italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P2">The formation of the human cerebral cortex involves the assembly of circuits
composed of glutamatergic neurons, which are generated in the dorsal forebrain
(pallium), and GABAergic interneurons, which are born in the ventral forebrain
(subpallium)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. After specification, interneurons
migrate long distances over several months during human fetal development and
subsequently undergo activity-dependent maturation and integration into cortical
circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Genetic or environmental perturbations of
this process can lead to an imbalance of cortical excitation and inhibition and are
thought to contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy and autism
spectrum disorders (ASD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. These key developmental processes, which
occur mostly in mid-to-late gestation, have been largely inaccessible for functional
studies in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, the directed differentiation, and
particularly the functional maturation of cortical interneurons from human
pluripotent stem cells (induced pluripotent stem cells, hiPSC, or embryonic stem
cells, hESCs), has been challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. To date, no
reliable, personalized models exist to study the migration of human interneurons and
their functional integration into cortical ensembles.</p>
<p id="P3">Here, we leverage a 3D differentiation approach using hPSCs to specify neural
spheroids resembling the pallium (human cortical spheroids, hCS) or the subpallium
(human subpallium spheroids, hSS), and we subsequently assemble them <italic>in
vitro</italic> to model for the first time the saltatory migration of human
interneurons towards the cerebral cortex and their functional integration into
microcircuits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>GENERATION OF SUBDOMAIN-SPECIFIC FOREBRAIN SPHEROIDS</title>
<p id="P4">We have previously described the generation of floating, 3D neural cultures
from hPSCs resembling the pallium (hCS) that contain deep and superficial layer
cortical glutamatergic neurons, as well as astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To specify spheroids resembling the ventral
forebrain or the subpallium (hSS), we exposed early spheroids that were patterned by
double SMAD inhibition to small molecules modulating the WNT and SHH pathways in the
presence of the growth factors FGF2 and EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig.
1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table
1</xref>). At day 25 of hSS <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation, we
observed a strong induction of the transcription factor <italic>NKX2-1</italic> in
hSS accompanied by high levels of <italic>FOXG1</italic> expression and
down-regulation of the pallial marker <italic>EMX1</italic>, suggestive of a
subpallial fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We
next examined the hSS cytoarchitecture in cryosections and noticed that NKX2-1 was
expressed in ventricular zone (VZ)-like structures at day 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1c</xref>) but was distributed more broadly at later stages
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1d</xref>). At day 60, we observed strong
expression of GABA and the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD67 in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1e, f</xref>). Of the known markers that identify
GABAergic subtypes, somatostatin (SST), calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) were the
most strongly expressed; at later stages (&gt; 200 days), and consistent its
expression later in development <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, parvalbumin (PV) was also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1g, h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">To comprehensively characterize hSS and hCS, we performed single cell
transcriptional profiling at day 105 of differentiation using stochastic
barcoding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (n=
11,838 cells from hCS and hSS; BD™ Resolve system; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1i</xref>). Clustering of cells isolated from either hCS or
hSS using the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t–SNE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> revealed a separation of the two
conditions. Neurons expressing <italic>STMN2</italic> were localized on the upper
left of the t–SNE space, whereas progenitors and mitotically active cells
were distributed in the lower right (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data
Fig. 2a–c</xref>). Further examination identified several subdomains in
hCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>), including a group of glutamatergic neurons
(<italic>VGLUT1<sup>+</sup></italic>) expressing the cortical layer
markers <italic>TBR1</italic>, <italic>FEZF2</italic>, <italic>CTIP2</italic>; two
groups of intermediate progenitors expressing <italic>TBR2</italic>,
<italic>INSM1</italic>, <italic>HES6</italic>; and a group of dorsal progenitors
expressing <italic>LHX2</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic> and <italic>GLAST1</italic>
that also encompass <italic>HOPX<sup>+</sup></italic> outer radial glia-like
cells. In contrast, hSS included a cluster of ventral neural progenitors, a group of
GABAergic cells expressing <italic>DLX1, GAD1</italic>, <italic>SLC32A1</italic>,
<italic>SCG2</italic>, <italic>SST</italic>, and a small group of
oligodendrocyte progenitors (<italic>OLIG2</italic>, <italic>SOX10</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2e–m</xref>). Astroglia from
both hCS and hSS clustered together and close to a small group of cells that
resemble the choroid plexus (<italic>TTR<sup>+</sup></italic>,
<italic>SLC13A4<sup>+</sup></italic>). No cells with mesodermal or
endodermal identity were found.</p>
<p id="P6">We next explored the functional properties of hSS. We found that 7 days of
exposure to the neurosteroid and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist allopregnanolone
(AlloP) combined with a 3-day exposure to retinoic acid (RA), significantly
increased the frequency of spontaneous calcium spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3a–c</xref>). Notably, exposure to AlloP with or
without RA did not alter subpallial fate, neurotransmitter identity or the GABAergic
subtypes in hSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig.
3d–l</xref>). As a result, these two conditions were used for subsequent
experiments. Considering the presence of spontaneous calcium activity and astrocytes
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1j</xref>), we investigated synaptogenesis
in hSS using array tomography (AT). We found expression of the presynaptic protein
synapsin-1 (SYN1) and the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1k</xref>). Lastly, we used whole-cell patch clamping to
record from neurons in sections of hSS and found that ~75% of
neurons generated action potentials in response to depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1l</xref>). At the same time, ~60% of
neurons exhibit spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) that reverse in
direction around the chloride reversal potential and are abolished by the
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist gabazine (10 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 1m, n</xref>; in contrast to synaptic currents in hCS, as
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>ASSEMBLY OF FOREBRAIN SPHEROIDS</title>
<p id="P7">To develop a model for the migration of interneurons into the cerebral
cortex, we placed hCS and hSS adjacent to each other inside a conical tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 2a</xref>). We used day 60 hCS that resembled the
mid-gestation pallium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, a
developmental stage characterized by extensive migration of interneurons. After 3
days, the two spheroids fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 2b</xref>). we
used viral labeling of spheroids before assembly to monitor cell migration, and used
a previously described DNA element near the <italic>Dlx1</italic> and
<italic>Dlx2</italic> locus (Dlxi1/2b) that labels medial ganglionic eminences
(MGE) and derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Approximately 65% of
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in hSS expressed GAD67 and contained
GABA and markers for GABAergic neuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 5a–d</xref>). We then used live imaging to monitor
the position of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in fused hSS-hCS over
multiple weeks. We observed a progressive movement of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells
from hSS into hCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). This
movement was specific to fused hSS-hCS and unidirectional: we observed minimal
movement either from hCS into hSS in fused hSS-hCS or from hSS into hSS in fused
hSS-hSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 2d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 5e, f</xref>). The same pattern of migration could
be observed for hSS-hCS assembled at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 5g</xref>). When hSS were plated on a coverslip, the
migration was inefficient or absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data
Fig. 5h–j</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Video 2</xref>) similar to rodent cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In the first 10 days after assembly, the
vast majority of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells that migrated away from
hSS had the leading process positioned towards hCS at either a 45° or
90° angle relative to the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended
Data Fig. 5k</xref>). At 30–50 days after asssembly, 60% of the
migrated cells were localized within the outer 100 μm of hCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 5l</xref>), and a large population of
interneurons migrated into hCS as shown by optical clearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 2e</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed processes of
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells that briefly touched VZ-like regions,
reminiscent of rodent ventricle-directed migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Video 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended
Data Fig. 5m–o</xref>). We next investigated the fate of
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in hSS after 2 weeks of migration from
hSS into hCS by isolating single cells and performing transcriptome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). We found that the
majority of migrated cells expressed subpallial markers (<italic>DLX1</italic>,
<italic>DLX2</italic>, <italic>DLX5</italic>, <italic>DLX6</italic>) and
cortical interneuron markers (<italic>GAD1</italic>, <italic>GAD2</italic>,
<italic>VGAT</italic>, <italic>CELF4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig.
7a–d</xref>). We found few cells expressing <italic>PAX6</italic> or
<italic>TH</italic>, which are indicative of olfactory interneurons, or
<italic>SP8</italic>, <italic>GSX2</italic> or <italic>CHAT</italic>, which are
indicative of striatal neurons, suggesting that the Dlxi1/2b reporter is primarily
labelling cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig.
6b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">We next used confocal imaging to capture the movement of
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP-labelled cells in fused hSS-hCS. Interneurons moved in a saltatory
pattern followed by extensive pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig.
2f</xref>). This characteristic, cyclical movement involved an extension of the
leading process in one direction followed by a transient swelling of the soma and
nuclear translocation (nucleokinesis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 2g,
h</xref>). This pattern of migration is similar to that observed in
rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, although the ratio between the length of
the leading process and the diameter of the soma in hSS-derived interneurons is
almost double the ratio in mouse interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). To validate the biological relevance of
interneuron migration in hSS-hCS, we performed live imaging of cells labelled with
the Dlxi1/2b::eGFP reporter in human forebrain tissue (gestational weeks, GW18 and
GW20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 2i</xref>). Dlxi1/2b::eGFP-labeled cells
in fetal tissue co-expressed GABA and NKX2–1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 8a–f</xref>) and displayed a similar morphology and
pattern of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 2j, k</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 8g–l</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Videos 4</xref>
&amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We tested pharmacological manipulation of interneuron migration in fused
hSS-hCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref>). We imaged the
movement of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP cells before and after exposure to a CXCR4 receptor
antagonist (AMD3100). This receptor is expressed in hSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3l</xref>) and plays a key role in the
migration of cortical interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. AMD3100 treatment resulted in a significant reduction in
saltation frequency, saltation length, speed when mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 7f–h</xref>) and a change in the path
directness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 7i, j</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Video 6</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>USING ASSEMBLED SPHEROIDS TO MODEL TIMOTHY SYNDROME</title>
<p id="P10">We next investigated whether assembled hSS-hCS could be used to model
migration defects. Previous work in rodents has indicated that L-type calcium
channels (LTCCs) play a critical role in interneuron migration by regulating
saltation frequency and migration termination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. LTCCs have been repeatedly associated with
neuropsychiatric disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and gain-of-function mutations in
the LTCCs-encoding <italic>CACNA1C</italic> gene lead to Timothy syndrome
(TS)– a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autism spectrum
disorder and epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We generated hSS and hCS from hiPSCs from 3
patients with TS carrying the recurrent p.G406R substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 3a</xref>) and compared them to 4 control subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9a, b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We
did not observe defects in the differentiation of TS hiPSC lines into hSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9c–g</xref>). Calcium imaging
showed increased residual calcium following depolarization in hSS-derived TS

three TS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 3d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9k</xref>) in agreement with the role
of calcium in interneuron motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the saltation length and the speed when mobile
were reduced in TS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 3d, e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9l, m</xref>) resulting in a less
efficient migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 3f</xref>). Moreover, this
effect was cell-autonomous because migration of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup>
cells from TS-hSS into control-hCS did not influence the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 3d, e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data
Fig. 9k–m</xref>). To further validate these results, we electroporated
cDNA encoding TS– and wild type (WT)– Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 into slices
of mouse E14 ganglionic eminences and performed live imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9n, o</xref>). We observed a defect in mouse
TS-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 electroporated neurons displaying more frequent but shorter
saltations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9p, q</xref>). To
determine if the TS migratory phenotype was a result of LTCCs activity and could be
reversed, we treated fused hSS-hCS with LTCCs blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 3g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig.
9r–u</xref>). We found that application of the LTCCs blocker nimodipine
significantly reduced saltation length and speed when mobile in control
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells. However, the deficit in these
parameters was rescued in TS Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells following
exposure to nimodipine. Moreover, roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
that increases voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, also rescued saltation length in TS
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells. These results indicate that the
migration defect in interneurons carrying the TS gain-of-function mutation can be
restored by reducing the activity of LTCCs.</p>

<title>INTEGRATION OF INTERNEURONS IN ASSEMBLED SPHEROIDS</title>
<p id="P11">To investigate the hSS-derived neurons that migrated into hCS, we examined
their single cell transcriptome at 4 weeks after assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 4a</xref>). t-SNE analysis indicated 3 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 4b</xref>), with

A, while Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells migrated into hCS primarily
distributed in clusters B and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 4c</xref>).

<italic>GRIP2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and

examined dendrites of Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in hSS and in fused
hSS-hCS. We found that hSS-derived cells that moved into hCS increased the
complexity of their branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 4e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10a, b</xref>). We then measured
their electrical properties in hSS before and after assembly. We found that
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells that had migrated into hCS had double
the maximum action potential generation rate as compared to
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in unfused hSS or to non-migrated cells
in fused hSS-hCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 4f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10c</xref>). We then assessed the
integration of migrated neurons by using AT and observed the presence of gephyrin
(GPHN), a postsynaptic protein localized to GABAergic synapses, in hCS fused to hSS
but not in unfused hCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 4d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10d</xref>). We constructed
‘synaptograms’ consisting of a series of high-resolution sections
through a single synapse, and found colocalization of eGFP from Dlxi1/2b-labeled
cells with the presynaptic proteins SYN1 and VGAT and adjacent to the postsynaptic
protein GPHN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10e</xref>). To
investigate the presence of functional synapses in migrated
Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> neurons, we performed whole-cell voltage
clamp recordings in sliced hSS-hCS. We found that Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup>
that migrated into hCS display both excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs,
downward deflecting) and IPSCs (upward deflecting) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 4h</xref>). Moreover, after migration into hCS, these cells primarily
receive EPSCs rather than IPSCs and their synaptic input increases approximately
3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 4i</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). In parallel, glutamatergic neurons from
hCS, which exhibit only EPSCs before assembly, also begin receiving IPSCs and show
an overall increase in synaptic input following the migration of interneurons from
hSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 4j</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10g</xref>). Lastly, to assess the functional integration of
hCS and hSS neurons into neural networks, we applied electrical stimulation to the
hCS side of assembled hSS-hCS to trigger glutamate release from excitatory neurons
in the vicinity of the stimulation electrode while simultaneously recording EPSCs
and IPSCs in Dlxi1/2b::eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells that migrated into hCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10h, i</xref>). We found that
electrical simulation evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) immediately following simulation
(&gt; 5 ms); this was followed by presumed multisynaptic IPSCs (&lt; 15
ms) that were sensitive to gabazine. Together, these data demonstrate that hSS
integrate with hCS to assemble functional human microcircuits in 3D cultures.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P12">We demonstrate the generation of a human 3D microphysiological system that
includes functionally-integrated glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. This platform
has several advantages in comparison to previous adherent or 3D methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. First, it involves the directed differentiation of subdomains
of the forebrain that functionally interact in development. In contrast to
whole-brain organoids and organoids resembling broader brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, this approach allows for modularity by combining
separately patterned spheroids into multi-region neural 3D cultures. Second, this
system captures <italic>in vitro</italic> more elaborate developmental processes,
including the saltatory migration of interneurons towards the cerebral cortex. Using
live imaging of the human forebrain, we demonstrate that this migration is
accurately recapitulated with our assembled 3D platform. Third, by enabling their
migration into an active neural network, interneurons integrate into a
synaptically-connected microphysiological system without the requirement of seeding
onto rodent cortical cultures or brain slices. Assembling networks using this
modular system may facilitate the study of excitation to inhibition interplay during
cortical development.</p>
<p id="P13">We also demonstrate that forebrain subdomains derived from hiPSCs and fused
<italic>in vitro</italic> can be used to identify the transcriptional changes
associated with interneuron migration and to model disease processes that are
otherwise inaccessible. We find that cortical interneurons derived from TS subjects
display a cell-autonomous migration defect whereby they move more frequently but
less efficiently. Moreover, the TS interneuron defect is rescued by
pharmacologically manipulating LTCC. This aberrant interneuron migration, taken
together with our previous studies in cortical glutamatergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, suggest the
presence of abnormal cortical development and function in TS.</p>
<p id="P14">Lastly, the <italic>in vitro</italic> specification of various subdomains of
the developing human brain from hPSC and their assembly into 3D cultures opens the
opportunity for studying the interaction of specific neuronal cell types and for
generating and probing neural circuits within personalized human microphysiological
systems.</p>

30–60 min prior to imaging. During a given recording session, up to 8
fused hSS-hCS were imaged at a depth of 50–150 μm and at a rate
of 15–20 min/frame. For pharmacological manipulation, cells were imaged
for 12 hrs to record a baseline. Then, the media was carefully removed and new
media with small molecules (AMD3100 at 100 nM; nimodipine at 5 μM; or
roscovitine at 15 μM) was gently added to the well. The field of view

were identified, and distance (in μm) to the new position of the soma
following nucleokinesis was recorded manually. The time necessary for this
movement was used to calculate the speed when mobile. To estimate directness of
movement, the x and y coordinates of each cell per frame and time were extracted
with the Manual Tracking plugin (ImageJ) and the Chemotaxis &amp; Migration

previously reported with modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Multiple hCS or hSS at day 105 of differentiation were
combined and dissociated enzymatically into single cells, and processed in one
batch. Single cell capture was achieved by random distribution of a single cell
suspension across &gt;200,000 microwells via a limited dilution approach.
Beads with oligonucleotide barcodes were added to saturation such that a bead
was paired with a cell in a microwell. Cell lysis buffer was added such that
poly-adenylated RNA molecules hybridize to the beads. Beads were collected into
a single tube for reverse transcription. Upon cDNA synthesis, each cDNA molecule
was tagged on the 5′ end (i.e., 3′ end of mRNA transcript) with
a molecular index and cell label indicating its cell of origin. Whole
transcriptome libraries were prepared using the BD Resolve single cell whole
transcriptome amplification workflow. Briefly, second strand cDNA was
synthesized, followed by ligation of adaptor for universal amplification.
Eighteen cycles of PCR were used to amplify the adaptor ligated cDNA products.
Sequencing libraries were prepared using random priming PCR of the whole
transcriptome amplification products to enrich the 3′ end of the
transcripts linked with the cell label and molecular indices.</p>
<p id="P38">Sequencing libraries were quantified using a High Sensitivity DNA Chip

Briefly, spheroids were incubated in bicarbonate buffered artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 23°C and equilibrated with a mixture of

Immediately after sectioning, slices were moved to a circulation chamber
containing oxygenated aCSF at 32°C. For patch-clamp recording, cells
were identified by the presence of a fluorescent reporter using an upright
Axoscop II microscope (Zeiss). Recording electrodes of borosilicate glass had a
resistance of 4–6 MΩ when filled with internal solution. A low

EPSCs and IPSCs containing: 145 mM K<sup>+</sup> gluconate, 0.1 mM
CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 4 mM
Na<sup>+</sup> phosphocreatine. Cl<sup>−</sup> reversal was
calculated to be at −91 mV according to the Nernst equation. A high
Cl<sup>−</sup> internal solution was used to measure EPSCs in a
subset of unfused hSS containing: 135 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 3 mM
MgATP, 0.3 mM GTP. The Cl<sup>−</sup> reversal potential was calculated
to be 0 mV according to the Nernst equation. IPSCs were blocked by application
of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist gabazine (10 μM, Abcam),
which was added to superfused aCSF. EPSCs were blocked by application of the
glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (1 mM, Abcam), which was added to
