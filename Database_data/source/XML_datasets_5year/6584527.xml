<p id="Par1">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by glia over-proliferation, neuro-inflammation, perturbed neural circuitry, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The role of gut dys-biosis in ASD is intriguing and should be elucidated. We investigated the effect of Propionic acid (PPA), a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and a product of dys-biotic ASD gut, on human neural stem cells (hNSCs) proliferation, differentiation and inflammation. hNSCs proliferated to 66 neuropsheres when exposed to PPA <italic>versus</italic> 45 in control. The neurosphere diameter also increased at day 10 post PPA treatment to (Mean: 193.47 um ± SEM: 6.673 um) <italic>versus</italic> (154.16 um ± 9.95 um) in control, p &lt; 0.001. Pre-treatment with β-HB, SCFA receptor inhibitor, hindered neurosphere expansion (p &lt; 0.001). While hNSCs spontaneously differentiated to (48.38% ± 6.08%) neurons (Tubulin-IIIβ positive) and (46.63% ± 2.5%) glia (GFAP positive), PPA treatment drastically shifted differentiation to 80% GFAP cells (p &lt; 0.05). Following 2 mM PPA exposure, <italic>TNF-α</italic> transcription increased 4.98 fold and the cytokine increased 3.29 fold compared to control (P &lt; 0.001). Likewise, GPR41 (PPA receptor) and pro-survival p-Akt protein were elevated (p &lt; 0.001). PTEN (Akt inhibitor) level decreased to (0.42 ug/ul ± 0.04 ug/ul) at 2 mM PPA compared to (0.83 ug/ul ± 0.09 ug/ul) in control (p &lt; 0.001). PPA at 2 mM decreased neurite outgrowth to (80.70 um ± 5.5 um) compared to (194.93 um ± 19.7 um) in control. Clearly, the data supports a significant role for PPA in modulating hNSC patterning leading to gliosis, disturbed neuro-circuitry, and inflammatory response as seen in ASD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a childhood onset, lifelong debilitating condition characterized by impaired social communication, stereotyped or repetitive behaviors, and spectrum-wide stages of mental retardation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The prevalence of ASD in the United States has alarmingly increased in the last two decades. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ASD rose from 1 out of 150 children in 2000, 1 in 68 in 2012, to a striking 1 in 59 children in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Currently, Management of ASD is limited to aggressive behavioral therapies focused on increasing independence and reducing major ASD characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, more research is urgently needed to understand the genetics and possible environmental cofactors, which may play a role in ASD development.</p>
<p id="Par3">According to the Simmons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) gene database, thousands of genes have been associated with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, the effect of these genetic alternations in ASD individuals remain unknown. ASD is believed to be the result of an interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental insults, and maternal immune system abnormalities during the early gestational period <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Emerging clinical studies suggest a possible role for gut dys-biosis in ASD development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A shift in the microbiome in autistic individuals compared with that of neurotypical peers was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This included elevated <italic>Clostridia spp</italic>., <italic>Bacteriodetes</italic>, and <italic>Desulfovibrio spp</italic>. in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Interestingly, these micro-organisms are known to be active fermenters of dietary carbohydrates and fibers leading to production of energy metabolism byproducts such as acetate (AC), propionate (PPA), and butyrate (BA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Propionate is seemingly the SCFAs most produced by ASD prevalent micro-organisms and is universally used as a preservative in processed food due to its anti-fungal characteristic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. PPA in the gut illustrates the interplay between the microbiome identity and dietary habits (nature <italic>versus</italic> nurture).</p>
<p id="Par4">In circulation, PPA passes through the blood brain barrier to modulate multiple cell signaling processes including energy metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis and release, and lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, excessive PPA level might be toxic. In neonatal Propionic Acidemia (PA), Propionyl CoA Carboxylase (PCC), involved in the metabolism of amino and fatty acids, is not functional due to a mutation in one of the two genes that code for its Alpha and Beta subunits; PCCA and PCCB. As a result, PPA accumulates in the blood causing severe seizures, movement disorders, gastrointestinal issues, aloofness, and overall developmental delays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Interestingly, PA and ASD share most of their core symptoms with multiple case studies reporting ASD as a comorbidity to PA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, high levels of PPA, but not BA, acetate, or other SCFAs, have been reported in the stools of ASD individuals; however, how PPA is involved in the development of ASD remains largely unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">PPA is believed to cause systematic mitochondrial dysfunction (MD), as evidenced by increased free acyl-carnitine (cofactor used to transport long-chain and very-long-chain fatty-acids into the mitochondria) in rats exposed to PPA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, more than 30% of ASD patients were also reported to have MD, and elevations in carnitine-bound unprocessed long-chain and very-long-chain fatty-acids; thus providing further evidence for the association between PPA and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear how MD and/or disturbed fatty acid metabolism may cause autistic phenotype.</p>
<p id="Par6">Attempts to resume autistic-like behavior in rodents by exposure to PPA at different developmental stages have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For instance, intracerebroventricular delivery of PPA in rats resulted in increased IL-6, TNF-α, and interferon-γ cytokine levels, disturbed fatty acid metabolism, and marked microglia (neuro- inflammatory macrophages) over-proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how PPA may affect the other neuronal cell types (Neurons and glia) particularly during the most sensitive stages of neural development.</p>
<p id="Par7">Neural stem cells give rise to neuroepithelial progenitor cells (NPCs) which then differentiate into neuronal or glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Glial cells including oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, play a role in neurons development, connectivity, and protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. During traumatic brain injury, reactive glial cells proliferate and release fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to inhibit damaged axonal regeneration causing gliosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, glial and microglial cells release inflammatory cytokines to clean up damaged cells and toxins, therefore causing neuro-inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Some investigators regard gliosis as a protective process as it clears up damaged cells and blocks regrowth of damaged axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, it is safe assuming that if gliosis occurs during the earliest stages of brain development it will greatly affect neural architecture and connectivity. In the ASD brain, disturbed neuronal circuitry with increased regional cell density in cortical, limbic, and cerebellar regions were reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In the meantime, glial cell count far exceeded that of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if premature gliosis may play a role in ASD.</p>
<p id="Par8">Concurring evidence suggests that ASD may stem from a disorder in glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Specifically, GFAP was shown to be highly expressed in the ASD brain compared to age matched healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Other studies reported that anti-tumoral, pro-apoptotic Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), was elevated in autistic astroglial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. This suggests an over-proliferation of glial cells in ASD. <italic>Wen Yi, et al.</italic> reported that transgenic mice with astroglial specific deletion of PTEN, demonstrated altered radial glia cell proliferation and disturbed neuronal patterning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Most intriguingly, reduced microbiota complexity was directly linked with impaired microglial proliferation and maturation in germ free mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In contrast, upon re-introduction of <italic>Clostridium cluster XIV, Bacteroides distasonis, and Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> strains to the GI tract, microglial phenotype was partially restored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. It was further established that such effect is facilitated by SCFA produced by these bacteria. Nevertheless, the paper does not provide cues on the proliferation state of the main brain cells; neurons and glia.</p>
<p id="Par9">PPA interacts with brain cells <italic>via</italic> G-protein-coupled SCFA receptors including GPR41<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Since PPA (3 carbons) is the most potent activator of GPR41, and due to the prevalence of <italic>Clostridia spp</italic>., <italic>Bacteriodetes</italic>, and <italic>Desulfovibrio spp</italic>. in ASD microbiome and its association with elevated PPA and gliosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, we hypothesize that elevated PPA may tamper with neural cell plasticity and differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> leading to gliosis, increased inflammatory profile, and disturbed neural connectivity, similar to ASD.</p>

<title>Culture of hNSCs <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p id="Par10">StemPro Neural Stem Cells (Cryopreserved human fetal-derived neural stem cells (NSCs); Thermo Fisher Scientific, A15654), were cultured in T-25 suspension flask containing 15 mL of KnockOut™ DMEM⁄F-12 Basal Medium (BM), GlutaMAX-I and StemPro® neural supplements, Heparin (6 units/ml), and Ascorbic acid (200 uM). Initially, cells were cultured as neurospheres in FGF Basic (b-FGF) and EGF recombinant proteins (20 ng/ml) media until they reached 80% confluency. They were passaged up to three times using StemPro Accutase® cell dissociation reagent (ThermoFisher; Cat#A11105) and then re-plated for further proliferation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Treatment with PPA, BA and GPR41 inhibitor</title>
<p id="Par11">NSCs were treated with sodium propionate (PPA), and sodium butyrate (BA) (Sigma) at 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM, and 2 mM final concentration. Control cells were treated with 1X PBS. Another set of NSCs were pre-treated for 24 h with 2 mM ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB), a potent inhibitor of GPR41 receptor, prior to PPA and BA treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. All treatments were done in triplicates (n = 3). Cells were then incubated for up to 10 days to form neurospheres. For differentiation purposes, intact neurospheres from each set were further plated on Geltrex (Cat# A14133; Fisher Scientific) pre-coated 24 well plates or 8 well chambers for an additional 7 to 10 days in a humidified 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Differentiation media consisted of the regular StemPro® complete media without growth factors.</p>
<p id="Par12">(n = 3) repetitions per treatment setting were used for differentiation experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Neurosphere count and diameter measurements</title>
<p id="Par13">Neurospheres were imaged using a digital camera (Amscope MU130, USB 2.0 DC 5V, 250 mA) mounted on an inverted tissue culture microscope (40X–800x Amscope, Japan) at 10x magnification every other day for 4 time points post plating (Days 2, 4, 8, and 10). The total number of neurospheres with a minimum diameter of 25 um were counted. The diameter of at least 15 Neurosphere per condition was measured using Amscope software version x64, 3.7.7303. The average diameter of neurospheres per condition was reported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">
<title>Neurosphere plating, differentiation, and immunostaining</title>
<p id="Par14">Pre-treated neurospheres were sub-plated on 8-well chambers pre-coated with 1:100 Geltrex diluted in DMEM/F-12 media. Duplicate repetitions per treatment setting were used for differentiation experiments. Cells were allowed to differentiate for 7 to 10 days and then washed and fixed with 10% formalin and 3% Triton-X for 10 min before incubation in 10% normal goat serum (NGS; Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. To determine the ratio of glial <italic>versus</italic> neural cells in SCFA treated NSCs, cells were double immune-stained for GFAP (Glial cell marker) and Tubulin-IIIβ (Neural cell marker) markers. Briefly, slides were incubated at 4 °C over night with mouse anti-human-GFAP antibody (1:20 in 10% NGS; Sigma; Cat# SAB4100002) or rabbit anti-human Tubulin-IIIβ antibody (1:50; in 10% NGS Sigma; Cat# T5076). Cells were next washed and incubated for 1 hr with goat anti-rabbit FITC (Tubulin-IIIβ) or goat anti-mouse TRITC (GFAP); Sigma] diluted in 1:50 in PBS. For detection of GPR41 expression on neuronal cells, anti-GFAP and Tubulin-IIIβ stained cells were double-stained with rabbit anti-FFAR3 (GPR41; 5 ug/ml, Abcam; Cat# ab103718). Antifade Vectashield medium containing 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories) was used to co-stain nuclei. Amscope IN480TC-FL-MF603 Fluorescent Microscope and Leica confocal microscopes were used to visualize and image GFAP and Tubulin-IIIβ positive cells as well as GFAP/GPR41 and Tubulin-IIIβ/GPR41 double positive cells. Multiple channels were merged using ImageJ 1.39o software.</p>

<sec id="Sec7">
<title>Neurite outgrowth measurements</title>
<p id="Par15">To evaluate the effect of PPA on neurite outgrowth, three 25X fluorescent images of Tubulin-IIIβ positive neurons were obtained using Amscope IN480TC-FL-MF603 fluorescent microscope mounted with an MF603C-CCD digital camera. Each experiment was repeated 3 times for accuracy and neurite outgrowth length (µm) from 15 random neurons per treatment setting were measured using Amscope software version x64, 3.7.7303. and averaged.</p>

<title>PPA and BA enhance neural stem cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p id="Par22">To understand the effect of PPA on hNSCs proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we treated the cells with PPA (2 mM), BA (2 mM), or PBS (1x) and monitored neurosphere formation for 10 days. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>, at day 2 following treatments, neurosphere diameter averaged (Mean: 58.45 um ± SEM: 4.1 um) across all treatments and the diameter differentially increased by day 10. When cells were pre-treated with 2 mM of β-HB (GPR41 inhibitor) before exposure to PPA or BA, the neurosphere diameter on day 10 averaged (56.53 um ± 4.74 um) for β-HB + PPA, (78.41 um ± 4.51 um) for β-HB + BA, and (56.26 um ± 5.73 um) for β-HB alone. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref> illustrates the progress of the neurosphere expansion at 4 intervals within 10 days treatment. In absence of β-HB pre-treatment, PPA and BA increased neurosphere diameter significantly when compared to untreated cells (One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. p &lt; 0.0001, F (6, 286) = 48.71).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par33">Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are among the most prevalent comorbidities associated with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. A shift in gut microbiome and their by-products in autistic individuals has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Specifically, autistic gut seems to have an increase in <italic>Clostridia spp</italic>., <italic>Bacteriodetes</italic>, and <italic>Desulfovibrio spp</italic>. which are known to be active fermenters and producers of SCFAs including PPA and BA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We were intrigued by MacFade et al finding that intracerebroventricular injection of PPA in rat’s brains induced reactive gliosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In the current study, we are linking maternal PPA exposure to disturbed neural patterning during early stages of embryonic neural development leading to over proliferation of glial cells, abnormal neural architecture, and increased inflammatory profile; possible precursors for autism. We employed a three-dimensional neurosphere assay to evaluate how SCFAs affect hNSC proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Neurospheres are 3D progenitor cell conglomerates, representing a valuable <italic>in vitro</italic> model as they mirror the earliest stages of neural development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. They are useful to study cell proliferation, migration and differentiation making them a neurotoxic test of choice for plethora of agents and chemicals, particularly hormones, pesticides, or to study chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Our data unequivocally show that both PPA and BA promote hNSC self-renewal and proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>, as evidenced by increased neurosphere number and diameter following exposure to either PPA or BA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). These results support earlier reports suggesting gut microbiota promote proliferation and maturation of enteric progenitor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Our study provided additional evidence to support the proliferative role of gut by-products such as SCFAs on enteric progenitor cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that such proliferative role is mediated through GPR41 receptor since its inactivation with β-HB voided SCFAs effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par34">Although disturbance in neuro/glia ratio in the autistic brain has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, it was not clear how, when and why this dys-balance occurs. In this study, exposing differentiating hNSCs to 2 mM PPA induced a shift towards glial phenotype (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). This is an intriguing finding and a first in the field. Surprisingly, exposing differentiating hNSCs to BA favored the opposite, with increased neural proliferation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). The SCFAs effect was confirmed following blocking GPR41 receptor with β-HB. This indicates that such effect is triggered by the specific binding of PPA and BA to GPR41 followed by a downstream molecular machinery leading to either glial or neural proliferation. Of importance here, the ratio of glia/neuron in BA treated cells is not as significant as that of PPA, possibly because PPA is the most potent activator of GPR41<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Over expression of <italic>GPR41</italic> in PPA-treated hNSCs confirmed differentiation shift to gliosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par35">PTEN was reported to regulate radial glia cell proliferation in the early stages of neural development through inhibition of Akt pro-survival pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Recent studies reported that PTEN is downregulated in autistic glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, however, what triggers PTEN inhibition in ASD remains uncertain. In this study, data suggest that PPA binding to its receptor may lead to GPR41-induced PTEN inhibition, thereof allowing Akt survival pathway to proceed. As we demonstrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>, PPA seems to tamper with both PTEN and activated p-Akt levels. <italic>PTEN</italic> expression decreased with increased PPA concentration and <italic>vice versa</italic> for p-Akt. Noteworthy, PPA interfered with the amount of activated p-Akt but not <italic>Akt</italic> expression. This result further validates that PPA has no direct effect on <italic>Akt</italic> expression but rather downregulates <italic>PTEN</italic> expression. Consequently, this allows p-Akt to remain active which results in over-proliferation of glia-committed neural progenitor cells.</p>
<p id="Par36">To understand the inflammatory response and GI disorder in individuals with ASD, we studied the effect of PPA on gliosis and inflammatory cytokines in differentiated hNSCs. Our data showed that PPA seems to upregulate <italic>TNF-α</italic> and <italic>IL-10</italic> and increase the level of the cytokines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>). Since PPA induced glial cell differentiation and increase in TNF-α and IL-10 transcription and translation, we propose that exposure to PPA during gestation may be related to gliosis and inflammation as reported in multiple neuro-developmental diseases including ASD. Specifically, exposure to high dose of PPA during early stages of neural stem cell development promotes proliferation and activation of glial cells, recapitulating the state of neuro-inflammation as reported in the post-partum autistic brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par37">In the developing brain, neurons are produced in the ventricular zone (VZ) and migrate into the developing neocortex guided by adjacent glial cells along the way<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Once settled, they undergo terminal differentiation in which long axons and dendrites extend to connect with adjacent neurons to form the final brain network, supported by glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. It is therefore of outmost importance that the number and positioning of supporting glial cells be at chirurgical precision in order to achieve this delicate neuro-architecture. In the autistic brain, reports indicate that short and long distance inter-neuronal communication is disturbed, causing delays in information processing, increased repetitive behaviors and idiosyncrasies, as well as distortion in brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), associated with higher functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However and as of latest data, it remained unclear what maybe causing neuronal circuitry disruption in ASD. We here stipulate that glial cells outnumbering neurons may constitute a physical barrier to the extending neurites, therefore accounting for a decrease in overall axonal growth. This phenomenon was clearly reflected in our data showing that PPA increased glial cell count and resulted in decreased neurite growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>). PPA may also block the molecular machinery involved in axonal expansion, nevertheless, further studies are needed in this area.</p>
<p id="Par38">Overall, the data in this study suggest that microbiome shift in maternal gut leads to formation of by-product such as PPA which then interferes with neural patterning during the early stages of the fetus’ neural development. This favors glial progenitor cells proliferation and survival leading to increased inflammatory profile and perturbed neural architecture. The data further suggests that such process is achieved through modulation of PTEN/Akt pathway within the growing glial cells but not neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Overall Diagram for Hypothesized PPA Effect on hNSC <italic>in vitro</italic>. During the early stages of pregnancy, increased consumption of PPA-rich processed foods combined with pre-existent dysbiosis may lead to accumulation of PPA in the maternal GI, travel through general circulation, cross the placental barrier, and interfere with neural differentiation through binding to GPR41 receptor preferably expressed on glial progenitor cells. This will activate a downstream molecular pathway resulting in PTEN inhibition and activation of pro-survival Akt pathway, therefore favoring glial progenitor cells proliferation and differentiation. Mature glial cells will move on to produce inflammatory cytokines and release GFAP, all of which mimic gliosis and neuro-inflammation observed in ASD. Some illustrations used in this figure were originated from leased Motifolio (Scientific Illustration Toolkits for Presentations and Publications) materials.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e1092" xlink:href="41598_2019_45348_Fig8_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par39">Unexpectedly, BA, another SCFA used in this study as a control, seems to play a potential pro-neural role by virtue of increased neural cell count upon BA treatment (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). Interestingly, excess neural proliferation and macrocephaly were also linked to ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. However, what may be causing this shift remains largely debatable. We might be tempted to speculate that excess BA could be the culprit for the macrocephaly observed in ASD; however, more studies are warranted to make a better guided guess. Instead, it is safe assuming that the normal developing brain comes equipped with a set of neurons and supportive glial cells and any stirring away from this homeostatic ratio, towards glial overgrowth or neuronal over-proliferation, may disrupt the brain architecture potentially causing ASD. Therefore, and in light of these preliminary BA data, exploratory studies are more than warranted to elucidate BA role, if any, in ASD.</p>
<p id="Par40">Solving the conundrical etiology of ASD is critical for any future prevention or treatment strategies. There is no doubt that genetic polymorphisms and environmental triggers are both involved in ASD development or at least in ASD complications. Because of the fact that autistic individuals who undergo antibiotic treatment seem to demonstrate a provisory yet noticeable relief from GI symptoms and some ASD behavior amelioration, and they may benefit from fecal replacement as a method to restore their microbiota pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, there are good reasons to suggest that gut-brain axis is a potential culprit in ASD pathogenesis. This study is the first to link PPA and ASD-microbiome by-product to gliosis, disturbed neural architecture, and increase in inflammatory response, all of which may translate into dramatic neuro-complications including ASD.</p>
