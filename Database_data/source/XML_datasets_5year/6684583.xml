<p id="Par1">Neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, have complex polygenic etiologies. Single-gene mutations in patients can help define genetic factors and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we describe individuals with monogenic heterozygous microdeletions in <italic>ANKS1B</italic>, a predicted risk gene for autism and neuropsychiatric diseases. Affected individuals present with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and speech and motor deficits. Neurons generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells demonstrate loss of the <italic>ANKS1B</italic>-encoded protein AIDA-1, a brain-specific protein highly enriched at neuronal synapses. A transgenic mouse model of <italic>Anks1b</italic> haploinsufficiency recapitulates a range of patient phenotypes, including social deficits, hyperactivity, and sensorimotor dysfunction. Identification of the AIDA-1 interactome using quantitative proteomics reveals protein networks involved in synaptic function and the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Our findings formalize a link between the synaptic protein AIDA-1 and a rare, previously undefined genetic disease we term <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and communication and motor disorders, have complex polygenic etiologies. These disorders are highly comorbid and share hereditary risk factors, suggesting that perturbations in pathways regulating brain development can result in a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In current models of autism heritability, common and rare variants interact with environmental factors to confer genetic risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although de novo variants are often used to causally link individual genes to autism, inherited mutations in highly conserved genes also appear at higher rates in neurodevelopmental disorders and are noted to display variable penetrance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Ultra-rare copy-number variations (CNVs) covering &gt;1 kilobase are predicted to make a sizable contribution to risk for neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Recent analyses of genetic risk for autism identified <italic>ANKS1B</italic> as a target gene due to rare genetic variants found in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, predicted participation in gene networks dysregulated in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and salience in bioinformatic analyses of mouse phenomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Genomic and transcriptomic association studies of neuropsychiatric disorders implicate <italic>ANKS1B</italic> in obsessive-compulsive disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, mood disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>ANKS1B</italic> is a large ~1.3 megabase gene located on human chromosome 12q23.1 that encodes AIDA-1 (APP intracellular domain associated 1), a protein initially suggested to regulate γ-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We have shown that AIDA-1 is highly expressed in the brain, where it is enriched in hippocampal and cerebellar regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and is one of the most abundant proteins at neuronal synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. AIDA-1 is specifically enriched at postsynaptic densities (PSDs), where it binds to N-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and the adaptor protein PSD95<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Neuronal activity causes rapid translocation of AIDA-1 into the nucleus, resulting in changes in Cajal body stability and nucleolar morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recently, we found that postnatal deletion of AIDA-1 from the forebrain led to reduced synaptic expression of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B and impaired NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation and long-term depression in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Despite the literature suggesting an association between <italic>ANKS1B</italic> and neurodevelopmental disease, no patients with confirmed loss of function in <italic>ANKS1B</italic> have been previously identified. Here, we describe monogenic CNVs in <italic>ANKS1B</italic> in individuals that display a spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including ASD, ADHD, and speech and motor deficits. A newly generated mouse model of <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome exhibits behavioral correlates of the phenotypes observed in probands. Along with new evidence that AIDA-1 interacts with multiple regulators of neural development, our findings demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of <italic>ANKS1B</italic> leads to a previously uncharacterized neurodevelopmental syndrome.</p>

<p id="Par6">We identified two families (EIN-1 and EIN-2) harboring monogenic microdeletions in <italic>ANKS1B</italic> who had been referred for medical genetic evaluation due to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, ADHD, speech apraxia, and motor delays (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). We performed extensive neuropsychological testing and clinical interviews on all affected individuals from families EIN-1 and EIN-2 (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">1</xref>). Affected individuals displayed a pattern of developmental delays, oculomotor and oromotor irregularities, dysmetria, impaired fine-motor dexterity, and problems with balance and gait. Subjects had a normal Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ standard score 85–115), except for a female proband with speech apraxia (EIN-2-1) whose composite FSIQ (standard score = 81) was reduced by a verbal comprehension index (VCI) standard score of 73. Verbal impairments were more severe in female children (EIN-1-2 and EIN-2-1), consistent with their prior diagnosis of speech apraxia, and manifested in lower scores in VCI, expressive language, receptive language, and verbal memory compared to males. On a test of fine-motor dexterity and psychomotor speed, all children performed at least two standard deviations below the mean with their dominant hand (<italic>z</italic>-score –2.22 to –2.89), whereas performance with the non-dominant hand was relatively spared. Deficits in oculomotor and fine-motor coordination contributed to poor or borderline performance in tasks requiring visual-motor integration. Consistent problems with speech and motor control contributed to variable performance on tests of attention and executive function (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><italic>ANKS1B</italic> microdeletion probands display a spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>ID</th><th>EIN-1-1</th><th>EIN-1-2</th><th>EIN-1-3</th><th>EIN-2-1</th><th>TOR-1</th><th>TOR-2</th><th>GEN-1</th><th>DEC-1</th><th>DEC-2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sex</td><td>46XY</td><td>46XX</td><td>46XY</td><td>46XX</td><td>46XY</td><td>46XY</td><td>46XX</td><td>46XY</td><td>46XX</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>11</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Variant/deletion (GRCh37/hg19)</td><td>12:99609297-99986120</td><td>12:99609297-99986120</td><td>12:99609297-99986120</td><td>12:99930346-100284065</td><td>12:100099666-100230043</td><td>12:100112323-100192972</td><td>12:99945859-100303670</td><td>12:99727586-100152135</td><td>12:99994978-100105971</td></tr><tr><td>Variant detection</td><td>CMA/WES</td><td>CMA</td><td>CMA</td><td>CMA/WES</td><td>WGS</td><td>WGS</td><td>CMA/WES</td><td>CMA</td><td>CMA</td></tr><tr><td>Inheritance</td><td>Paternal</td><td>Paternal</td><td>Paternal</td><td>Paternal</td><td>Paternal</td><td>Maternal</td><td>Unknown</td><td>Maternal</td><td>Paternal</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>Caucasian</td><td>Caucasian</td><td>Caucasian</td><td>Caucasian</td><td>Caucasian</td><td>South Asian</td><td>Caucasian</td><td>Caucasian</td><td>Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td>Variant size</td><td>377 kb</td><td>377 kb</td><td>377 kb</td><td>354 kb</td><td>130 kb</td><td>80 kb</td><td>358 kb</td><td>425 kb</td><td>111 kb</td></tr><tr><td>Allele</td><td>Heterozygous</td><td>Heterozygous</td><td>Heterozygous</td><td>Heterozygous</td><td>Heterozygous</td><td>Heterozygous</td><td>Heterozygous</td><td>Heterozygous</td><td>Heterozygous</td></tr><tr><td>Craniofacial dysmorphism</td><td>Brachycephalic, round facies, prominent brow;

Affected children inherited the <italic>ANKS1B</italic> microdeletion from a parent previously reported to have a mild (EIN-1-4) or normal (EIN 2-2) phenotype. However, we found that the affected parent in EIN-1, who had reported childhood motor delays, also displayed oculomotor, fine motor, visual motor, and gross motor deficits. The affected father in EIN-2, who had a previous diagnosis of ADHD, displayed impaired oculomotor control, visual-motor integration, and gross motor coordination (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">1</xref>).

<p id="Par8"><italic>ANKS1B</italic> copy-number variations have not previously been associated with a genetic syndrome. We therefore searched genotype-phenotype databases for individuals harboring similar CNVs.

We obtained clinical evaluations for five probands with monogenic deletions, as well as for four probands with CNVs in additional genes (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">2</xref>). Deletions in all individuals were identified during clinical testing through chromosomal microarray except for EIN-1-4 and EIN-2-2, which were confirmed by FISH, and TOR-1 and TOR-2, which were identified through whole-genome sequencing. All affected individuals were heterozygous for the <italic>ANKS1B</italic> microdeletion, and most deletions were inherited (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">2</xref>).

<p id="Par9"><italic>ANKS1B</italic> deletion in these additional probands resulted in neurodevelopmental phenotypes consistent with our findings in the first two families (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>).

Although intellectual disability was a variable finding, low IQ and global developmental delay were noted in a few patients. Several patients showed abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, including T2 hyperintensities in various regions and dysgenesis or thinning of the corpus callosum. Craniofacial dysmorphisms were also reported in several families, although specific features were not consistent among probands. Additional individuals harboring monogenic deletions in <italic>ANKS1B</italic>, as well as those with multiple CNVs affecting other genes (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">2</xref>), displayed similar neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

<p id="Par12">To determine how human <italic>ANKS1B</italic> microdeletions affect AIDA-1 expression, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using peripheral mononucleated blood cells from probands and unaffected mothers in families EIN-1 and EIN-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>) through forced expression of transcription factors using Sendai virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Human-derived iPSCs were positive for pluripotency markers Oct-4 and Sox-2 by immunostaining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). As AIDA-1 is enriched in neuronal synapses, we generated neurons by overexpressing the neuronal transcription factor neurogenin-2 (<italic>NGN2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Differentiation of induced neurons (iNs) was confirmed by observed morphology and by immunostaining for the neuronal marker MAP2.

Similar results were obtained for the EIN-1 family (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">4</xref>). While we had expected a selective reduction in the full-length AIDA-1B isoform, our results show that deletions upstream of AIDA-1D and AIDA-1C transcripts similarly reduce expression of these shorter isoforms. Loss of major protein products suggests a model of genetic haploinsufficiency, but microdeletions could also result in abnormal RNAs and truncated polypeptides that contribute to disease. To address this possibility, we performed reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for exons along the <italic>ANKS1B</italic> gene to identify abnormally generated transcripts. In both EIN-1 and EIN-2, families that contain distinct microdeletions, exons in N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal regions were downregulated in proband iNs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>). In addition, we performed western blots of iNs using AIDA-1 antibodies to other regions of the protein and observed similar changes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Altogether, these results strongly implicate genetic haploinsufficiency in disease etiology.</p>

No deficits or delays were observed for Nestin-Het mice in these developmental milestones compared to Nestin-WT and other littermate control groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3f</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">5</xref>). To test for social communication deficits, we analyzed ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) recorded from maternally separated pups at P8 and P10.

<title>AIDA-1 interactome reveals novel cellular roles for <italic>ANKS1B</italic></title>
<p id="Par18">Our findings demonstrate that loss of AIDA-1 expression leads to neurobehavioral phenotypes in both human and mouse. To obtain insight into the molecular mechanisms that link AIDA-1 to disease, we identified the AIDA-1 interactome in mouse brain using quantitative proteomic methods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). We performed ten unique immunoprecipitations (IPs) from mouse brain lysates using control IgGs, AIDA-1 IgGs, and antibodies to unrelated synaptic proteins crosslinked to protein G-agarose or magnetic beads. Each eluted IP sample was labeled with a unique isobaric tag within a 10-plex set of tandem mass tags<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. This approach allowed us to accurately quantify identified peptides, simultaneously analyze all samples to reduce variability associated with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, and rigorously control for nonspecific binding by normalizing to control IgG samples and comparing to unrelated protein interactomes (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">6a</xref>). We used a commercially available antibody (C-10, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), as well as in-house antibodies known to immunoprecipitate AIDA-1 (1A11 and 2B22) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). We defined the AIDA-1 interactome as proteins co-immunoprecipitated by AIDA-1 antibodies that were identified and quantified by ≥3 peptides and enriched &gt;1.4-fold over background in agarose experiments, or &gt;3.0-fold in magnetic bead experiments (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">6b</xref>). Determination of these cutoff values is explained in Methods. To gauge the specificity of the AIDA-1 interactome, we analyzed the overlap between AIDA-1 and unrelated interactomes using two-sided Fisher’s exact test. Since co-IP for synaptic proteins X and Y are likely to yield similar protein populations, we used a stringent statistical background for the hypergeometric distribution limited to proteins enriched in any co-IP sample (255 total proteins). As expected, the interactors obtained using a mixture of AIDA-1 antibodies (AIDA-1 Mix Agarose) showed significant overlap only with those from other AIDA-1 samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Identification of the AIDA-1 interactome by mass spectrometry reveals novel cellular roles. <bold>a</bold> Ten immunoprecipitations (IPs), including four IPs using different AIDA-1 antibodies (C-10, 2B22, or Mix) and beads (agarose or magnetic), two control IPs using mouse IgG, and four control IPs of unrelated synaptic proteins.

The interactome contained proteins from cellular components where AIDA-1 is known to localize, including the synaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neuronal projections. However, the most significant enrichment was in components of membrane-bound vesicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). In line with this localization, our previous work demonstrated impaired NMDAR subunit trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in <italic>Anks1b</italic> conditional knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Although the mechanism of this regulation is unknown, we had previously shown that AIDA-1 is associated with intracellular vesicles in the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. To confirm the vesicular distribution of <italic>ANKS1B</italic>-encoded proteins, we performed full subcellular fractionation of postmortem human brain and mouse brain tissue. Western blots show that AIDA-1 isoforms are enriched in microsomes derived from light membrane fractions, as well as PSD fractions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).

<title>AIDA-1 interactome links <italic>ANKS1B</italic> to development and disease</title>
<p id="Par20">We identified the most significantly regulated diseases and functions in the AIDA-1 interactome (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">8a</xref>), then performed higher-order analyses to categorize these annotations using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Bioinformatics) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Consistent with clinical findings in <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome, Neurological Disease and Developmental Disorder were among the top hits in the category of Diseases and Disorders (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">8b</xref>). In the category of Physiological Systems, the most significant effects were found on development, including nervous system development and function. Top molecular functions of the interactome converged on cellular processes, including cell morphology and cellular development. Advanced pathway construction in IPA identified a functional network with predicted functions in cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cell morphology, and nervous system development and function as the top-scoring network (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">8c</xref>). Inspection of individual proteins in this network revealed known AIDA-1 interactors, including PSD95<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, SynGAP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, and SNX27<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. These and other molecules converge on the NMDA receptor as a major node in the pathway. Based on this network analysis, the interaction of AIDA-1 with proteins that regulate vesicle transport (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e, f</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">4</xref>), and our work linking AIDA-1 to NMDAR function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we measured surface expression of the NMDAR subunits GluN2B and GluN2A in iPSC-derived neurons using immunofluorescence. Contrary to our findings in forebrain <italic>Anks1b</italic> knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we found no reduction in surface GluN2B levels in proband neurons. However, we found that GluN2A subunits showed a significant increase in surface expression, which is consistent with our previous findings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). No changes in overall GluN2B and GluN2A levels were detected by western blot, suggesting that <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency leads to aberrant trafficking of NMDAR subunits in patient-derived neurons. These results indicate that altered NMDAR localization is a possible mechanism of disease in <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par21">In this study, we discovered that microdeletions in the <italic>ANKS1B</italic> gene encoding AIDA-1 lead to a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by autism, ADHD, and speech and motor impairment. Ours is the first to report patients with monogenic deletions in <italic>ANKS1B</italic> and establish the contributions of these rare CNVs to disease. None of the variants we report have been identified in control populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, most <italic>ANKS1B</italic> deletions were inherited from parents reported to have normal or mild phenotypes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">2</xref>). Variable penetrance is a common feature of CNVs in neurodevelopmental disorders and could be explained by inherited risk factors unmasked by deletions, or by compensation strategies employed throughout development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Through comprehensive clinical interviews and testing, we found previously undiagnosed neurodevelopmental phenotypes in affected fathers from families EIN-1 and EIN-2. In both cases, fathers showed impairments in similar domains as their affected children and other probands, demonstrating that the phenotype segregated with the <italic>ANKS1B</italic> deletion. The degree to which the deletion impaired adaptive function was related to developmental age: parents rated younger affected children as having more difficulty with daily function compared to older children. Our results highlight the need for deep clinical phenotyping in addition to genomic sequencing to identify links between CNVs and phenotypes, especially in spectrum disorders with variable presentations and developmental compensation. Despite the range of phenotypes and the rarity of <italic>ANKS1B</italic> mutations, we identified 12 families with shared features, supporting a causal link between <italic>ANKS1B</italic> deletion and the clinical syndrome. We also identified <italic>ANKS1B</italic> deletions in patients with CNVs overlapping other genes. Similarities between the neurodevelopmental disorders in these individuals and those with monogenic <italic>ANKS1B</italic> deletions suggests that <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency contributes to clinical presentation in these patients.</p>
<p id="Par22"><italic>ANKS1B</italic> encodes the protein AIDA-1, which is highly enriched in the brain and specifically expressed in neurons. We induced differentiation of iPSCs into excitatory neurons to enable further investigation of synaptic dysfunction and aberrant neuronal development, which are proposed mechanisms for neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Using neurons from different families, we correlated microdeletions overlapping distinct <italic>ANKS1B</italic> exons with similar reductions in encoded AIDA-1 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">4</xref>). Expression of all major AIDA-1 isoforms and <italic>ANKS1B</italic> transcripts are reduced, including those with putative transcription start sites downstream of microdeletions. Reduced AIDA-1D and AIDA-1C protein isoforms may reflect the loss of unidentified <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements in the deleted N-terminal regions of the <italic>ANKS1B</italic> gene. Alternatively, AIDA-1 isoforms may stabilize each other, such that loss of the larger protein leads to the degradation of smaller isoforms. Additional work will be needed to elucidate this potential isoform-dependent regulation of <italic>ANKS1B</italic> expression.</p>
<p id="Par23">Patient-derived iNs and Nestin-Het mice both demonstrate reduction in all major isoforms and transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g, h</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2c, d</xref>). This suggests broad dysfunction in AIDA-1-regulated processes across brain regions: <italic>ANKS1B</italic> transcripts are differentially spliced in Wernicke’s area, important for language development, and the prefrontal cortex, implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. AIDA-1 is strongly expressed in the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, especially the large isoform AIDA-1B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). <italic>Anks1b</italic> transcripts are present in Purkinje cells of the developing cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, consistent with the striking motor phenotypes in patients and the emerging role of the cerebellum in language and social development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Although gross characterization of cerebellar size revealed no significant changes in <italic>Anks1b</italic> Nestin-Het mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2e</xref>), our gene expression and behavioral data demonstrate that <italic>ANKS1B</italic> deletions could affect development and function in brain regions crucial for motor coordination and social communication.</p>
<p id="Par24">Heterozygous <italic>Anks1b</italic> deletion in mice produced impaired social interactions, altered activity patterns, and sensorimotor deficits reminiscent of <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome. We did not observe the impairment in hippocampus-dependent spatial memory that would be expected after loss of a gene required for hippocampal synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Heterozygous knockdown of <italic>Anks1b</italic> may not have been sufficient to produce changes in plasticity, since our previous work used a homozygous forebrain knockout model. Moreover, intellectual disability is an inconsistent feature in patients. Motor deficits in speech production and fine-motor control are prominent features of the syndrome, reflected in reduced dexterity in Nestin-Het mice. Gross motor coordination was not significantly impaired in the balance beam test, although a trend was observed toward increased slips. Impaired sociability, altered approach-avoidance behaviors, hyperactivity, increased startle sensitivity, and reduced prepulse inhibition have all been described in mouse models of autism, including <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout and the BTBR strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Our findings of neurobehavioral abnormalities are largely consistent with a previous evaluation of ketamine sensitivity in a homozygous <italic>Anks1b</italic> deletion model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Notably, we found that heterozygous deletion with ~50% residual AIDA-1 expression is sufficient to observe these behavioral effects, supporting an <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency model in the etiology of the clinical syndrome. In contrast to <italic>ANKS1B</italic> deletion probands, <italic>Anks1b</italic> Nestin-Het mice did not demonstrate social, sensory, or motor impairments in early development (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3f–i</xref>). However, developmental stages in mice correlate imperfectly with the timing of human development, and an initial period of normal development has been described in other mouse models of syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Since the Nestin-Het model essentially reproduces a heterozygous <italic>Anks1b</italic> microdeletion on an isogenic background, our results strengthen the causal link between <italic>ANKS1B</italic> deletion and neurodevelopmental disorders in probands.</p>
<p id="Par25">Through co-immunoprecipitation and quantitative mass spectrometry, we defined the AIDA-1 interactome with significant reproducibility. The novel methodology we present here, involving simultaneous analysis of multiple internal controls, increases our confidence in the AIDA-1 interactors identified. An unbiased approach using whole brain homogenate enabled us to identify novel interactors and striking enrichment in components of membrane-bound vesicles, including Rab family regulators of recycling and contents of the AP-2 endocytic complex. Fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation with key regulators of vesicle transport validated this approach. Higher-order analysis of the AIDA-1 interactome in IPA traced converging functions of <italic>ANKS1B</italic> in normal development and disease-related processes (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">8b</xref>). Comparing our proteomic data to transcriptomic and genomic studies identifying <italic>ANKS1B</italic> as a gene of interest leads to several intriguing parallels. In diseases and disorders, neurological disease is the top category: aside from the neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders in <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome, literature also suggests a role in dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> and epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. In physiological systems, major roles for the AIDA-1 interactome in organismal and embryonic development is consistent with <italic>ANKS1B</italic> influence on body size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, gestational development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, and our current findings of reduced body mass and perinatal lethality in <italic>Anks1b</italic> knockout mice. For nervous system development and function, the annotation of highest significance is neuritogenesis (IPA, one-sided Fisher’s exact test, <italic>p</italic> = 1.56e-15), which is represented in all top molecular functions of the AIDA-1 interactome. Finally, top canonical pathways regulated by the AIDA-1 interactome include axon guidance signaling and endocytic pathways, which are supported by our co-IP and fractionation results. These results place <italic>ANKS1B</italic> among genes that link endosomal trafficking to neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par26">Analysis of the top network in the AIDA-1 interactome reconciles known and novel roles for AIDA-1: postsynaptic scaffolds (PSD95, DLGAP3), vesicle components (Snx27, AP-2), enzymatic switches (SynGAP1, AAK1), and membrane proteins (NMDAR, Contactin-1) are all major players. The pathway features prominent regulators of synaptic function implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including NMDARs (autism)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, SynGAP1 (autism and ID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, and Snx27 (Down Syndrome)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Given that AIDA-1 participates in the localization of GluN2A and GluN2B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we tested the hypothesis that changes in NMDAR expression underlie <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome. Although surface GluN2A was significantly increased in proband-derived neurons, we did not observe changes in GluN2B. This discrepancy may reflect dose-dependent or synapse-specific effects: in contrast to homozygous AIDA-1 forebrain knockout mice, all human microdeletions are heterozygous, proband neurons retain ~50% of AIDA-1, and total surface expression was measured (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>). Moreover, GluN2B is the primary subunit expressed in iPSC-derived neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>: regulatory mechanisms maintaining GluN2B expression could compensate for partial loss of AIDA-1. Divergent mechanisms may regulate NMDAR subunit composition in humans and mice, highlighting the importance of developing this human-based model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> of <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome. Overall, we showed that <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency leads to changes in NMDAR subunit localization, validating the functions predicted by our previous work and our current analysis of the AIDA-1 interactome.</p>
<p id="Par27">We identified <italic>ANKS1B</italic> as a crucial gene for human development in which rare loss-of-function variants cause neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, ADHD, and deficits in speech and motor function. Through proteomic analysis, we defined a network of molecular pathways through which AIDA-1 interactors regulate neuronal function and identified a specific deficit in NMDAR subunit localization as a possible mechanism of disease. By generating neurons from patients with <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome and the <italic>Anks1b</italic> Nestin-Het mouse model, we have developed tools to further probe the mechanisms by which AIDA-1 enables normal brain development and <italic>ANKS1B</italic> haploinsufficiency contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

Families EIN-1 and EIN-2 were enrolled in a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Clinical interviews and exams, neuropsychological tests, and family questionnaires were administered at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Human Clinical Phenotyping Core by licensed neuropsychologists. Evaluation of children was conducted in the morning, while evaluation of adults was conducted from morning until afternoon. All subjects were given a lunch break at noon, and additional breaks were provided when requested. Subjects completed a neuropsychological battery consisting of tests appropriate to developmental age. Tests generated a standard score (mean = 100, standard deviation = 15), <italic>T</italic>-score (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10), scaled score (mean = 10, standard deviation = 3), <italic>z-</italic>score (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1), or percentile normed for age. To test cognitive function, the Wechsler Primary Preschool Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV); Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V); or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) was used. Verbal reasoning was assessed by the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) of the Wechsler system. Depending on age, perceptual reasoning and visual spatial reasoning skills were either subsumed by a single Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) or separated into the Visual Spatial Index (VSI, the ability to synthesize visual information) and Fluid Reasoning Index (FRI, the ability to identify a solution based on patterns). Working Memory Index (WMI) and Processing Speed Index (PSI) were measured in the Wechsler system if age-appropriate.

Each sample was analyzed using NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome Library v3.0 64 Mb (300 bp average insert size) to capture the exome. Paired end sequencing was completed using Illumina platforms. Before mapping reads to GRCh37/hg19 (Genome Reference Consortium), fastq data reads were trimmed of sequencing adapters and filtered for sequence quality using trimGalore against the standard Trueseq adaptor. Reads were aligned to GRCh37/hg19 using BWA, then SAMtools commands were used to clean up paired read information and sort bam files. SAMtools fixmate was used to ensure consistent information display for both reads in a pair, then SAMtools sort to order the output file according to genomic sort order. After mapping, the Picard MarkDuplicates command was used to remove or mark PCR duplicates. BEDtools intersect was used to calculate the number of reads, which overlap a target BED file by at least 1 bp, yielding an output of the number of on-target reads. Dividing this number by the total number of mapped, non-duplicate reads yielded the percentage of on-target reads. The GATK function DepthOfCoverage was used to calculate depth of coverage metrics over enrichment targets, including mean, median, and percent of target bases covered at a depth of at least 30 × .

<p id="Par32">IPSC generation received ethical approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in IRB protocol #2017-8311 to B.A.J. Informed consent was obtained from all blood donors. Peripheral blood samples were collected from families EIN-1 and EIN-2, and peripheral blood mononuclear CD34 + cells (PBMCs) were used to generate human-induced pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> (iPSCs) at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Stem Cell Core. Three iPSC clones from each individual were generated from CD34 + cells using CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, frozen PBMCs were thawed 2 days before reprogramming (Day -2) and cultured in STIF medium. On Day 0, CD34 + cells were flow-sorted by FACSAria II (BD) and transduced with Sendai virus vector of KOS (<italic>hKlf4</italic>, <italic>hOct3/4</italic>, and <italic>hSox2</italic>) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 5, 5, and 3, respectively, in the presence of Polybrene 4 μg/mL. Three days after transduction, transduced cells were plated on Matrigel-coated 24-well plates in StemSpan SFEM medium (STEMCELL Technologies). Essential 8 (E8) medium (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher) replaced half of StemSpan SFEM medium on Day 7 and replaced it completely on Day 8. Culture medium was changed every 2 days from Day 2 to Day 7 and changed daily from Day 8. The iPS-like clones were picked and passaged by mechanical dissection from Day 21 to Day 28. FACS analysis of pluripotency markers SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81; in vitro differentiation and immunohistochemical detection of germ-layer markers α-fetoprotein, α-smooth muscle actin, and β-III tubulin; RT-PCR assay for virus gene integration; and karyotyping were performed on each iPSC clone to ensure the quality of integration-free iPSCs. Clones were maintained in E8 as described by the manufacturer with occasional removal of differentiated cells. IPSC identity was periodically confirmed by immunocytochemistry using pluripotency markers Oct-4 and Sox-2.</p>

Mice were housed and handled at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and behavioral phenotyping was performed as five independent cohorts in the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Animal Behavior Core under the supervision of Dr. Maria Gulinello. In the Behavioral Spectrometer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, mice were recorded for 9 min in an open field with a center area of 18.0 × 18.0 cm. Elevated plus maze (5 min), forced swim test (9 min in 25 °C water bath), and three-chamber test (5 min with ovariectomized C57BL/6J mouse) were performed using standard procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par38">All behavioral testing in adult mice aged 3–4 months and in pups aged P8-P16 was performed with experimenter blind to genotype. Feeding, mixed-genotype group housing, light-dark cycles, and time of testing were controlled across all five cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Sample sizes were estimated in JMP (version 14, SAS) to be of sufficient power to show effects independently in either sex if main effect of genotype-sex interaction (<italic>α</italic> = 0.05) were detected in two-way ANOVA (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">5</xref>). For all behavioral tests, post hoc two-sided Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was performed for tests in which genotype was a significant main effect in two-way ANOVA. For the three-chamber test, likelihood ratio tests were additionally performed for effects of Genotype and Sex on passing (&gt;50% social preference) or failing (&lt;50% social preference). Post hoc contingency testing included chi-squared analyses and two-sided Fisher’s exact test. To assess differences between social and object sniffing times, repeated-measures ANOVA was also performed using a within-subjects design with Social time and Object time as responses and Genotype and Sex as factors. Sniffing times were separated by Social/Object and genotype, and post hoc testing was conducted using Tukey Kramer Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test for multiple comparisons. Since no main effect of sex or genotype-sex interaction was observed in any behavioral test, males and females of each genotype were combined for all post hoc testing, and samples of <italic>N</italic> &gt; 20 were used to satisfy the Central Limit Theorem in lieu of testing for normality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>.

ANOVA was performed to detect main effects and interactions of age, genotype, and sex: since age was an expected main effect and did not interact with any other factors, no post hoc testing was conducted. Ultrasonic vocalizations from maternally isolated pups were recorded at P8 and P10 using Avisoft Bioacoustics software for 6 min and analyzed using MUPET, an unsupervised machine-learning-based algorithm that analyzes vocalization parameters, classifies syllables into repertoires, and compares between test groups to generate a similarity score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Multiplexed large-scale immunoprecipitations</title>
<p id="Par39">To perform immunoprecipitations (IPs), we incubated 300 µg of antibodies with 200 µl of agarose (Protein G Sepharose) beads for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS, washed 2x with 0.2 M triethanolamine pH 8.2 (TEA), and then crosslinked using freshly made 30 mM dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) in TEA for 25 min at room temperature (RT). Beads were washed for 5 min with TEA, crosslinked again using a fresh DMP solution, washed 3x with TEA, and quenched using two 10-min washes of 100 mM ethanolamine. Unbound antibodies were stripped off beads 3x using 100 mM glycine pH 3.1 for 5 min, and beads were then washed 2x with PBS and stored in PBS/NaN<sub>3</sub>. For crosslinking antibodies to magnetic beads, we coupled 90 µg of antibodies to 6 mg of Epoxy Dynabeads (Dynal) according to the manufacturer instructions. Antibodies used were: mouse IgG, AIDA-1 C-10 (Santa Cruz), AIDA-1 2B22, or AIDA-1 Mix (C-10 + 1A11 + 2B22). Each individual IP was split into two reactions: one IP consisted of 40 µg coupled antibodies incubated with 5 mg of total mouse brains (whole brain, including olfactory bulb, cortices, midbrain, and cerebellum dissected from 3-month-old C57BL/6J mice) lysed in a gentle dodecyl-β-maltoside buffer (DBM: 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 190 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1% dodecyl-β-maltoside), and the second IP consisted of 40 µg incubated with 5 mg of lysate in a harsher RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA). This approach allowed for the capture of detergent-sensitive interactions (DBM) and additional interactions in detergent-resistant synaptic and nuclear structures (RIPA). We incubated IPs for 2 h at RT with rocking, added two volumes of either 10 mM HEPES (DBM lysates) or 25 mM Tris (RIPA lysates) to dilute salts and detergents, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed 5x with TBS/Tween-20, DBM and RIPA IPs for each antibody sample were mixed together, and bound proteins were eluted in 2x non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer at 70 °C for 30 min.</p>

<title>Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling of peptides</title>
<p id="Par40">Ten micrograms of each immunoprecipitation sample was electrophoresed briefly (dye front 5 mm) into a 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The gel was washed 3x in ddH<sub>2</sub>O for 15 min each and visualized by staining overnight with GelCode® Coomassie blue reagent (Pierce). Stacked protein bands were excised from the gel, reduced with dithiothreitol, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. In-gel digestion was performed using 5 ng/μL mass spectrometry-grade trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Promega) in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> digestion buffer. The resulting peptides were desalted using a Stage Tip manually packed with Empora C18 High-Performance Extraction Disks (3 M)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup> and eluted peptide solutions were dried under vacuum. Peptides were then resuspended in 18 μL acetonitrile, and 57 μL of 0.2 M HEPES pH 8.5 was added to each sample. TMT10-plex amine reactive reagents (Thermo Fisher, 5 mg per vial) were resuspended in 1024 μL anhydrous acetonitrile and 25 μL of reagent was added to each sample (TMT label: peptide [<italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic>] = 12:1) and mixed briefly by vortexing. The mixture was incubated at RT for 1 h, quenched by the addition of 10 μL 5% hydroxylamine for 15 min, and acidified by the addition of 10 μL 10% formic acid. A 5-µL aliquot from each reaction was desalted on a StageTip, analyzed by liquid-chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with a Q Exactive Orbitrap HF (high field), and the resulting spectra searched with MaxQuant using its corresponding TMT label as variable modifications on N-terminus and lysine. The percentage of peptides with either N-terminal or lysine TMT labels was calculated, indicating the labeling efficiency for each channel. Labeling efficiency was 96% or greater for each channel. To ensure that equal amounts of labeled peptides from each channel were mixed together, a two-step mixing strategy was employed: in the first step, an identical ~1 μL volume of peptides from each channel was mixed and analyzed, and the value of the median ratio (median of the ratios of all peptide intensities of one channel over their corresponding peptide average intensities of all channels) for each channel is determined as the correction factor. In the second step, the rest of the peptides were mixed by adjusting their volume using the correction factors. In this way, median ratios ranging from 0.97 to 1.02 were achieved as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. The final mixture of reaction products from ten TMT channels were desalted on a Sep-Pak tC18 1 mL Vac Cartridge (Waters, #WAT03820).
