<article-title>Osteocalcin promotes bone mineralization but is not a hormone</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Osteocalcin (OCN), the most abundant noncollagenous protein in the bone matrix, is reported to be a bone-derived endocrine hormone with wide-ranging effects on many aspects of physiology, including glucose metabolism and male fertility. Many of these observations were made using an OCN-deficient mouse allele (Osc<sup>–</sup>) in which the 2 OCN-encoding genes in mice, <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic>, were deleted in ES cells by homologous recombination. Here we describe mice with a new <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> double-knockout (dko) allele (<italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>p.Pro25fs17Ter</sup>) that was generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Mice homozygous for this new allele do not express full-length <italic>Bglap</italic> or <italic>Bglap2</italic> mRNA and have no immunodetectable OCN in their serum. FTIR imaging of cortical bone in these homozygous knockout animals finds alterations in the collagen maturity and carbonate to phosphate ratio in the cortical bone, compared with wild-type littermates. However, μCT and 3-point bending tests do not find differences from wild-type littermates with respect to bone mass and strength. In contrast to the previously reported OCN-deficient mice with the Osc<sup>−</sup>allele, serum glucose levels and male fertility in the OCN-deficient mice with the <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>pPro25fs17Ter</sup> allele did not have significant differences from wild-type littermates. We cannot explain the absence of endocrine effects in mice with this new knockout allele. Possible explanations include the effects of each mutated allele on the transcription of neighboring genes, or differences in genetic background and environment. So that our findings can be confirmed and extended by other interested investigators, we are donating this new <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> double-knockout strain to the Jackson Laboratories for academic distribution.</p>

The former proteins, such as type 1 collagen, affect the material properties of the skeleton, while the latter, such as fibroblast growth factor 23, enable the skeleton to communicate with other organ systems. Mutations that affect the functions of most bone-cell-expressed proteins cause diseases that have similar features in humans and other mammals such as mice, for example, brittle bone diseases for type 1 collagen mutations and hypophosphatemic rickets for mutations in fibroblast growth factor 23. Our study focuses on another bone-cell-expressed protein, osteocalcin, which has been suggested to function locally to affect bone strength <underline>and</underline> systemically as a hormone. Studies using osteocalcin knockout mice led other investigators to suggest endocrine roles for osteocalcin in regulating blood glucose, male fertility, muscle mass, brain development, behavior, and cognition. We therefore decided to generate a new strain of osteocalcin knockout mice that could also be used to investigate these nonskeletal effects. To our surprise, the osteocalcin knockout mice we created did not significantly differ from wild-type mice for the three phenotypes we examined: bone strength, blood glucose, and male fertility. Our data are consistent with findings from osteocalcin knockout rats but are inconsistent with data from the original osteocalcin knockout mice. Because we do not know why our new strain fails to recapitulate the phenotypes previously reported for another knockout mouse stain, we have donated our mice to a public repository so that they can be easily obtained and studied in other academic laboratories.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteocalcin (OCN) is a protein almost exclusively expressed by osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref001">1</xref>]. Once transcribed and translated, the 95 amino acid OCN prepromolecule is cleaved to produce a biologically active 46-amino-acid, carboxyl-terminal fragment that contains three γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues (residues 62, 66, 69 in the mouse prepromolecule) which are made post-translationally via a vitamin K–dependent process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref002">2</xref>]. The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to these γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues causes conformational changes that increase OCN binding to the bone mineral calcium hydroxyapatite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref003">3</xref>]. Various states of undercarboxylated osteocalcin have been reported in bovine samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref004">4</xref>]; in humans, this results from limited vitamin K in the diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>In humans, OCN is encoded by a single gene (<italic>BGLAP</italic>). In mice, OCN in encoded within a 25-kb interval on chromosome 3 that contains <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic>, (a.k.a., <italic>Og1</italic> and <italic>Og2</italic>), which are highly expressed in bone, and <italic>Bglap3</italic>, (a.k.a., <italic>Org</italic>), which has minimal expression in bone. The 46-residue carboxyl-terminal domains encoded by <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> are 100% identical, and they differ by 4 amino acid residues from that encoded by <italic>Bglap3</italic>.</p>
<p>Mice homozygous for a large genomic deletion encompassing <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> (<italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup>) were generated by ES-cell-mediated germline modification and described in 1996 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref006">6</xref>]. By 6 months of age, these OCN-deficient mice had qualitatively increased cortical thickness and increased bone density relative to their control littermates. These qualitative differences were associated with significantly increased biomechanical measures of bone strength. Furthermore, OCN-deficient female mice were resistant to oophorectomy-induced bone loss. These data suggested that therapeutic reduction of OCN expression could prevent osteoporosis in humans.</p>
<p>Subsequent studies using <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>mice broadened the biologic role for OCN by identifying wide-ranging physiologic changes when OCN is deficient. The first such report observed that <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>mice had increased visceral fat and displayed elevated blood glucose associated with decreased pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref007">7</xref>]. Subsequent work indicated OCN can enhance male fertility by inducing testosterone production and promoting germ cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref008">8</xref>]. Other observed endocrine roles for OCN include influencing fetal brain development and adult animal behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref009">9</xref>], promoting adaptation of myofibers to exercise and maintaining muscle mass with ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref011">11</xref>], and mediating the acute stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref012">12</xref>]. Cumulatively, the reports outlined above with the <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>mice and, subsequently, a conditional knockout strain (Ocn-flox) made by the same investigative team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref008">8</xref>] coupled with associated work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref020">20</xref>], suggest that therapies which increase uncarboxylated osteocalcin levels may improve glucose intolerance, increase beta islet cell number, reduce insulin resistance, increase testosterone, improve male fertility, enhance muscle mass, and reduce declines in cognition.</p>
<p>Given the potential importance of OCN, we created new strains of OCN-deficient mice using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref021">21</xref>]. Specifically, we created mice with mutations that disrupt either <italic>Bglap</italic> or <italic>Bglap2</italic> individually or in combination. Here we report our observations regarding homozygous <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> double-knockout (<italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup>) mice, which we anticipated would recapitulate the previously reported OCN-deficient phenotypes in the <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>mice of increased bone mass and strength, elevated blood glucose, and decreased male fertility. We confirmed that we successfully knocked out <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> by performing RNA sequencing and by measuring immunoreactive OCN in mouse serum. Consistent with previous studies, homozygous offspring with this new OCN-deficient allele (<italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup>) were born at the expected Mendelian frequency and exhibited no overt clinical phenotype. However, inconsistent with previous studies, we did not observe significantly increased bone mass or strength, significantly elevated blood glucose, significantly decreased testosterone levels, or significantly impaired male fertility.</p>

<title>Generation of mice with <italic>Bglap and Bglap2</italic> double-knockout alleles and OCN deficiency</title>
<p>By simultaneously injecting Cas9 protein and guide RNAs that recognize sequences within <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic>, but not within <italic>Bglap3</italic>, we generated several founders that harbored large deletions involving <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic>. One founder allele, termed <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Pro25fsTer17</italic>, is a 6.8-kb deletion that joins exon 2 of <italic>Bglap</italic> to exon 4 of <italic>Bglap2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This allele is predicted to produce a chimeric <italic>Bglap/Bglap2</italic> transcript with a reading frame shift after the 25<sup>th</sup> amino acid residue and a termination codon 17 residues further downstream. The predicted signal peptide encompasses 23 of these 25 amino acids. Because only two amino acids would remain after signal peptidase cleavage and because p.Pro25 is on the amino-terminal side of the biologically active domain of OCN, mice homozygous for this allele (<italic>Bglap</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup>) should be OCN-deficient.</p>

<p>(A)Top: Schematic (not to scale) showing the 25-kb interval on mouse chromosome 3 containing <italic>Bglap</italic>, <italic>Bglap2</italic>, and <italic>Bglap3</italic>. The locations of the guide RNAs used to produce founders with <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> intragenic or intergenic knockout alleles are indicated (arrows). Bottom, left: The <italic>Bglap/2</italic> double-knockout (dko) allele (<italic>p</italic>.<italic>Pro25fs17Ter</italic>) deletes a 6.8-kb DNA fragment extending from <italic>Bglap</italic> exon 2 to <italic>Bglap2</italic> exon 4. Bottom, right: A 5-bp insertion (5 bp ins) at the DNA ligation site creates a chimeric exon with a reading frame shift. The frame shift occurs after p.25 and terminates the protein 17 residues downstream (orange residues indicate wild-type sequence; blue indicates the first 4 frame-shifted residues). (B) Integrated Genomics Viewer screenshots of RNA sequencing data from wild-type and homozygous <italic>Bglap</italic>/<italic>Bglap2</italic> double-knockout mice (<italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup>). Note the absence of sequencing reads mapping to <italic>Bglap</italic> exons 2, 3, and 4, and <italic>Bglap2</italic> exons 1, 2, and 3 in the double-knockout mice; the mapping algorithm fails to map reads to the <italic>Bglap2</italic> chimeric exon 2 because the chimera has a short seed length and a 5-bp insertion. (C) Serum ELISA assays for male and female 6-month-old <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> (green) and their control (black) littermates for the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) and uncarboxylated (Glu) forms of OCN as well as osteopontin (OPN). In the box and whisker plots, each box extends from the 25th to 75th percentiles, the line represents the median, and the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values. The following sample sizes were used: male wild-type (n = 5), male <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> (n = 5), female wild-type (n = 7), and female <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> (n = 8).</p>

<p><italic>Bglap</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> offspring were born from heterozygote crosses at the expected Mendelian frequency and appeared phenotypically indistinguishable from their wild-type and carrier littermates. We confirmed that <italic>Bglap</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> homozygous mutants produced the frame-shifted chimeric <italic>Bglap</italic>/<italic>Bglap2</italic> mRNA transcript, as predicted, by RNA sequencing of freshly isolated mouse cortical bone mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We showed that homozygous mutants were OCN-deficient by measuring carboxylated and uncarboxylated OCN in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Thus, the <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Pro25fs17</italic> allele eliminated the production of immunodetectable OCN from <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic>, and, in this respect, was identical to the <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref006">6</xref>] and the Cre-excised Ocn-floxed allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref008">8</xref>]. Because a recent report had found that loss of both OCN and osteopontin was synergistic in terms of effects on bone morphology and mechanical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref022">22</xref>], we evaluated the serum levels of osteopontin. There were no significant differences in osteopontin between <italic>Bglap</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice and their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>The second reported endocrinologic role for OCN involved male fertility. <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>male mice had smaller testes, lower testosterone levels, and produced fewer and smaller litters than control mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref019">19</xref>].

We found no significant differences in any of these measures between the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g005">Fig 5</xref>), although we did note an estimated, but not statistically smaller, testicular size in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We carried out an independent analysis of testosterone levels in a cohort of 10- to 15-week-old male mice. For this work, virgin male mice were singly housed for 7 d prior to blood collection from the submandibular vein. Three days later, a second blood sample was collected from each singly housed mouse and sera from both samples were sent to the P30-supported University of Virginia Ligand Assay &amp; Analysis Core of the Center for Research in Reproduction for analysis. These analyses revealed wide variation in testosterone levels, even in the same animal taken three days apart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008361.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<title>Few differences in cortical bone mRNA expression between <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> and control mice</title>
<p>RNA sequencing of cortical bone samples from <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice and their wild-type littermates confirmed the absence of wild-type <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Although we sequenced a limited number of specimens from each group, we also performed a transcriptome-wide differential expression analysis, searching for large transcriptional changes in bone tissue. We generated RNA sequencing libraries from 4-month-old male mice that on average yielded 46 million reads and 82% uniquely mapping reads. After performing <italic>in silico</italic> filtering to remove contaminating blood, marrow, and muscle transcripts, we identified 14 transcripts that differed significantly between the OCN-deficient and wild-type mice (after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing) and that had an average FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments greater than 3 in mice with either or both genotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008361.t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008361.s005">S4 Table</xref>). As expected, the mean FPKM for <italic>Bglap</italic> was reduced from 2157 in wild-type mice to 158 in <italic>Bglap</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice. The mean FPKM for <italic>Bglap2</italic> did not significantly differ between wild-type and <italic>Bglap</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice (1070 versus 1310 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008361.s005">S4 Table</xref>), with most reads in the mutant mice mapping to exon 4. Thus, despite the chimeric <italic>Bglap/2</italic> mRNA containing a frame-shift and premature truncation codon, it is not subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The low level of the <italic>Bglap3</italic> transcript (mean FPKM 10) seen in wild-type cortical bone increased 8-fold (mean FPKM 79, corrected p &lt; 0.001) in <italic>Bglap</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> bone is less than 2.5% of the combined FPKMs for <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> in wild-type bone. It is also notable that 6 of the remaining 12 transcripts in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008361.t002">Table 2</xref> are encoded on chromosome 3, raising the possibility that CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing altered regulatory elements that directly affect these genes. Similar off-target mechanisms could explain the altered expression of transcripts encoded by other chromosomes. Alternatively, these gene expression changes could be the result of OCN deficiency. Although our RNA sequencing data might be underpowered to detect small changes of 2-fold or less in transcript abundance, we found no significant differences in the expression of osteoblast and osteocyte transcripts, including those of <italic>Alpl</italic>, <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Col1a2</italic>, <italic>Runx2</italic>, <italic>Opn</italic>, <italic>Sost</italic>, <italic>Dmp1</italic>, and <italic>Fgf23</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We created a double-knockout allele for <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> (<italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko</sup>) and then evaluated bone properties, glucose levels, and male fertility in homozygous mutant mice and their wild-type littermate controls. We found no significant effect of OCN deficiency on bone mass and strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g002">Fig 2</xref>). However, using FTIR, we did find skeletal differences between <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> and wild-type littermates. <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice had significantly higher collagen maturity and carbonate-to-mineral ratio, suggesting osteocalcin could be involved in mineral maturation and bone remodeling. This was previously proposed for the original osteocalcin knock-out mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref023">23</xref>]. The increased carbonate to mineral ratio in cortical bone is also in agreement with recent assessments of samples from the <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>mice maintained on a purebred C57Bl/6J background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast to prior reports that utilized global double-knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref006">6</xref>] or conditional double-knockout alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref008">8</xref>], we did not observe any significant effect of OCN deficiency on blood glucose or body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref007">7</xref>] observed that OCN-deficient <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>mice had significantly increased random-fed blood glucose levels at 1, 3, and 6 months of age and significantly increased overnight-fasted blood glucose levels at 6 months of age. We powered our study to have &gt;80% power to detect increases of a similar magnitude, but we found no difference in blood glucose between <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice and their wild-type littermates. It remains possible that the effect of osteocalcin deficiency on mouse glucose levels is much lower than previously reported, so that much larger cohort sizes or much more sensitive methods for measuring glucose utilization will be needed to identify any metabolic defect. The <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice are publicly available and can be easily obtained by an interested investigator.</p>
<p>Oury et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref008">8</xref>] observed male <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>mice had significantly lower litter frequencies and sizes, testicular weights and volumes, and serum testosterone levels. We did not find significant effects in the <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice for these variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g005">Fig 5</xref>), although we did note an estimated, but not statistically significant, smaller testicular size in <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice. While we found no differences in fertility, it is possible that this is associated with more subtle perturbations in testicular development and/or function that detailed follow-up studies could evaluate. We found large variation in mouse blood testosterone in mice even when individual animals were sampled 3 d apart. This variability is consistent with previous studies and is due to mouse hepatocytes producing little sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG), the principal carrier of testosterone in the blood, in contrast to the abundant production of SHBG in human liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>We do not know why <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice did not replicate the endocrinologic phenotypes that were attributed to other <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> double-knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref026">26</xref>]. Our RNA sequencing indicates we disrupted both the <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008361.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), and our serum ELISA data indicate that OCN is undetectable in <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice. We cannot preclude the possibility that increased <italic>Bglap3</italic> mRNA expression compensated for the absence of <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> in the <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice. Although we could not detect OCN by ELISA in <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> animals, the <italic>Bglap3</italic> protein may not be detected with this assay because it differs by 4 amino acid residues from that produced by <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic>. However, we think compensation by <italic>Bglap3</italic> is unlikely, since its cortical bone transcript abundance in the <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> is less than 2.5% of the cumulative <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> transcript abundance in wild-type mice.</p>
<p>At present we do not know whether the increase in <italic>Bglap3</italic> mRNA expression is compensatory or an artifact of moving the <italic>Bglap</italic> promoter 6.8 kb nearer to <italic>Bglap3</italic>. The <italic>Bglap</italic> promoter appears to have been deleted along with <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> in the <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref006">6</xref>], but not in the <italic>Ocn</italic><sup>flox</sup> conditional knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref008">8</xref>]. Therefore, comparing RNA sequencing data across all three strains could identify allele-specific effects on gene expression that account for phenotype differences between the <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice and the mice in previous publications. Other explanations for differences in phenotype could include genetic background, vivarium environment, genetic and epigenetic changes across generations, and assay design.</p>
<p>Although we did not find the phenotypes previously ascribed to OCN deficiency in mice, our data do align with those reported for the OCN knockout rat. Rats, like humans, have only a single <italic>Bglap</italic> locus. <italic>Bglap</italic> knockout rats do not have elevated glucose levels, insulin resistance, or decreased male fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref027">27</xref>]. To date, genetic studies in humans have not identified a role for OCN in these aspects of physiology either. No human Mendelian genetic disease has yet been attributed to loss-of-function mutations in BGLAP, in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man or MatchMaker exchange databases ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref029">29</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://omim.org/">https://omim.org</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.matchmakerexchange.org/">https://www.matchmakerexchange.org</ext-link>, each accessed on December 5, 2019), and there seems to be tolerance for heterozygous loss-of-function mutations at the population level (pLI = 0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref030">30</xref>] in the gnomAD database [https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org]. Two putative loss-of-function mutations (p.Gly27Ter19/rs1251034119 and p.Tyr52Ter/rs201282254) have carrier frequencies in the genome aggregation database (gnomAD) of 1-in-120 in African and about 1-in-150 in Ashkenazi Jewish participants, respectively. Also, one African participant and one Ashkenazi Jewish participant was homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in gnomAD. There is also no evidence from genome-wide association studies that common variants near <italic>BGLAP</italic> influence bone mineral density, blood glucose levels, body mass index, or risks for developing diabetes, autism, or psychiatric disease [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gwascentral.org/">https://www.gwascentral.org</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pheweb.sph.umich.edu/">http://pheweb.sph.umich.edu</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/">http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org</ext-link>]. Mutations in <italic>BGLAP</italic> do not appear to be enriched among children with autism or severe intellectual disability who have undergone research based sequencing [BioRvix: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/484113">https://doi.org/10.1101/484113</ext-link>].</p>
<p>Because we did not find in the <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice the abnormalities that have been reported for the <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>mice, we chose not to perform studies interrogating the role of OCN on muscle mass, central nervous system development, behavior, or the acute stress response. Instead, are donating our mice to The Jackson Laboratory (JAX stock # 032497, allele symbol Del(3Bglap2-Bglap)1Vari). We suggest the <italic>Osc</italic><sup><italic>–</italic></sup><italic>/Osc</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>and Ocn-flox mice also be donated to a resource that facilitates public distribution, so that interested investigators can identify why different <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Bglap2</italic> double-knockout alleles produce different phenotypes.</p>

<p>Mice were maintained in accordance with institutional animal care and use guidelines, and experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Van Andel Institute.

<title>Generation of <italic>Bglap/Bglap2</italic> deletion mice using CRISPR/Cas9</title>
<p>Alterations in the mouse <italic>Bglap and Bglap2</italic> alleles were created using a modified CRISPR/Cas9 protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref031">31</xref>]. Briefly, two sgRNAs targeting exon 2 of OG1(AGACTCAGGGCCGCTGGGCT) and exon 4 of OG2 (GGGATCTGGGCTGGGGACTG) were designed using MIT’s guide sequence generator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu">crispr.mit.edu</ext-link>.). The guide sequence was then cloned into vector pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9, which was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 42230; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:42230">http://n2t.net/addgene:42230</ext-link>; RRID:Addgene_42230). The T7 promoter was added to the sgRNA template, and the sequence was synthetized by IDT. The PCR-amplified T7-sgRNA product was used as template for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription using the MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The injection mix consisted of Cas9 mRNA (Sigma Aldrich) (final concentration of 50 ng/μl) and sgRNA’s (20 ng/μl) in injection buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) injected into the pronucleus of C57BL/6;C3H zygotes. After identifying founders, we backcrossed the line to C57BL/6 twice before intercrossing to generate animals for our study.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>Genotypic identification</title>
<p>To genotype the <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko</sup> we used the following primers: OG1-E1-Fwd (ACACCATGAGGACCATCTTTC) and OG1-E4-Rev (AGGTCATAGAGACCACTCCAGC) to amplify a 517-bp wild-type product, and in a separate reaction we used OG1-E1-Fwd and OG1(E2)-OG2(E4)-Rev (AAGCTCACACACAGAGGCTTGG) to amplify a 238-bp knockout product. These animals are available from Jackson Laboratories (stock number 032497).</p>

<title>Blood chemistry analysis</title>
<p>Blood was harvested into an EDTA-treated tube at the time of euthanasia via intracardiac puncture, spun down at 8,000 rpm for 6 min, and plasma collected and stored at –80°C until use. Enzyme immunoassays were used to measure plasma concentrations of mouse Glu-osteocalcin (MK129;Takara), mouse Gla-osteocalcin (MK127; Takara), mouse osteopontin (MOST00; R&amp;D Systems), and mouse testosterone (55-TESMS-E01; Alpco), according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. Statistical analysis was performed used a linear regression model to test for differences between genotypes via R. We also collected blood (see below) from 10- to 15-week-old males for testosterone measurements analyzed independently by the P30-supported University of Virginia Ligand Assay and Analysis Core Laboratory.</p>

<title>Collection of samples for skeletal analysis</title>
<p>Femurs were collected at 26 weeks of age; the right hindlimb was fixed in neutral buffered formalin for μCT analysis, and the left hindlimb was frozen in saline-saturated gauze for biomechanical testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>μCT and mechanical testing</title>
<p>Formalin-fixed femora were scanned, reconstructed, and analyzed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref032">32</xref>]. Briefly, 10 μm resolution, 50-kV peak tube potential, 151-ms integration time, and 180° projection area were used to collect scans on a Scanco μCT-35 desktop tomographer. The distal 60% of each femur was scanned, thresholded, and reconstructed to the 3<sup>rd</sup> dimension using Scanco software. Standard parameters related to cancellous and cortical bone mass, geometry, and architecture were measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>For evaluation of bone mechanical properties, frozen femur samples were brought to room temperature over a 4-h period, then mounted across the lower supports (8 mm span) of a 3-point bending platen and mounted in a TestResources R100 small force testing machine. The samples were tested in monotonic bending to failure using a crosshead speed of 0.05 mm/s. Parameters related to whole bone strength were measured from force/displacement curves as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

<title>Fourier-transform infrared imaging (FTIR) analysis</title>
<p>Femora from female, 6-month-old wild-type and <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> mice were cleaned of soft tissue, processed, and embedded in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref036">36</xref>]. Longitudinal sections, 2 μm thick, were mounted on infrared windows where spectral images were collected at a 4 cm<sup>–1</sup> spectral resolution and approximately 7 μm spatial resolution from a Spotlight 400 Imaging system (Perkin Elmer Instruments, Shelton, CT USA). Background spectra were collected under identical conditions from clear Ba<sub>2</sub>F windows and subtracted from sample data by instrumental software. IR spectra were collected from three areas (approximately 500 μm x 500 μm) of cortical bone per sample. The spectra were baseline-corrected, normalized to the PMMA peak at 1728 cm<sup>—</sup>, and the spectral contribution of PMMA embedding media was subtracted using ISYS Chemical Imaging Software (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). Spectroscopic parameters of carbonate-to-mineral ratio, crystallinity, mineral-to-matrix ratio, collagen maturity, and acid phosphate were calculated. The carbonate-to-mineral ratio is the integrated area ratio of the carbonate peak (850–890)/ν<sub>1</sub> ν<sub>3</sub> PO<sub>4</sub> band (900–1200 cm<sup>–1</sup>), while the mineral-to-(collagen)-matrix ratio is the integrated area ratio of the ν<sub>1</sub> ν<sub>3</sub> PO<sub>4</sub> band (900–1200 cm<sup>–1</sup>) / amide I band (1590–1712 cm<sup>–1</sup>). The mineral crystallinity parameter corresponds to the crystallite size and perfection as determined by X-ray diffraction and is calculated from the intensity ratios of subbands at 1030 cm<sup>–1</sup> (stoichiometric apatite) and 1020 cm<sup>–1</sup> (nonstoichiometric apatite). The collagen maturity parameter is the ratio of nonreducible (mature) to reducible (immature) collagen cross-links, which is expressed as the intensity ratio of 1660 cm<sup>–1</sup>/1690 cm<sup>–1</sup>. The acid phosphate content in the mineral is measured from the peak height ratio of 1128/1096. The result for each parameter was reported as a histogram, describing the pixel distribution in the image. The mean value of the distribution was reported and associated color-coded images were generated at the same time by ISYS. Data for each measured parameter are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean for each group. The data for all measured parameters were found to be normally distributed as analyzed by the Shapiro-Wilk tests did not find enough evidence to conclude any measured parameters were non-normally distributed. The average values were compared by the Student’s independent <italic>t</italic>-test for significant differences between groups. Differences for each measured parameter were considered statistically significant when p ≤ 0.05.</p>

<title>Baseline and random glucose measurements</title>
<p>Cohorts of 5- to 6-month-old female mice, wild-type (n = 5) and <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> (n = 5), were subjected to four random glucose measurements taken 6 h into their light cycle by tail nick using a glucose meter (AlphaTRAK; Zoetis) on four consecutive days. These same cohorts had glucose measurements obtained by tail nick after an overnight fast during which the animals had access to water on two occasions one week apart.</p>
<p>Additional cohorts of mice were fasted overnight, but with access to water, prior to euthanasia by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. Glucose levels were measured immediately after euthanasia. Animals were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation and glucose levels were immediately measured from blood collected by tail nick using a glucose meter.</p>
<p>Glucose data were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model via the R package <italic>lme4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref037">37</xref>] to account for repeated sampling. Normality of the residuals was verified visually using a qq-plot.</p>

<sec id="sec019">
<title>Measurement of testis size and weight</title>
<p>Testes were removed from 6-month-old males after euthanasia and fixation. Fatty tissue was carefully removed from each testis and the sample dried prior to weighing on an analytical scale to determine dry weight. Testis weights was normalized to body weight (mg/g BW). Each testis was imaged and the length and width calculated using Nikon’s NIS-Elements documentation software. Testis volume was normalized to body weight (mm<sup>3</sup>/g BW). Statistical analysis was performed used a linear regression model to test for differences between genotypes via R.</p>

<sec id="sec020">
<title>Assessment of fertility</title>
<p>Male mice of mating age (7–16 weeks of age) were singly housed for 1 week before mating. Males were mated to C57BL/6J females in the evening and vaginal plugs checked the following morning. Number of pups per litter were compared between genotypes, and the percentage of vaginal plugs resulting in delivery and the number of pups per delivery were noted. Logistic mixed-effects regression with a random intercept for paternal mouse was used to determine if the rate of conception differed significantly between the two genotypes. A Poisson mixed-effects model with a random intercept for paternal mouse was used to determine if the number of pups per delivery differed significantly between the two genotypes. Both models were analyzed via the R v 3.5.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>) package <italic>lme4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Methods for testosterone measurement are provided in the previous section on blood chemistry analysis. We performed two independent testosterone measurements. One cohort was collected from 6-month-old virgin males that were singly housed for 3 d prior to sample collection. Plasma was isolated from whole blood and used to perform the mouse testosterone ELISA (ALPCO) in-house following the manufacturer’s protocol. The second cohort of 10- to 15-week-old virgin males were singly housed for 7 d prior to blood collection from the submandibular vein. Three days later, we collected a second sample from each male using the contralateral submandibular vein. The samples were collected in the morning each day and mice were sampled in the same order. Single cages were removed from the housing unit and the mouse removed for sampling. Serum was isolated from whole blood and sent to the University of Virginia Ligand Assay and Analysis Core to measure testosterone values independently.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed in R v3.6.0 using a linear mixed-effects model with random intercepts for each mouse and litter. Linear contrasts with a Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing were used to test specific hypotheses.</p>

<title>Cortical bone RNA sequencing and data analysis</title>
<p>Tibial cortical bone was recovered from 4-month-old male wild-type (n = 3) and <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> (n = 5) mice immediately following euthanasia by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref038">38</xref>]. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized, and suspended in TRIZol. Total RNA was recovered using the PureLink<sup>™</sup> RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including on-column DNAse digestion (PureLink<sup>™</sup> DNase Set, Invitrogen). RNA quality was assessed using a Bioanalyzer (2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent). RNA abundance was quantified based on the height of the 28S ribosomal peak since co-purifying contaminants confounded RNA abundance determinations based on RINs.</p>
<p>Twenty-five ng of total RNA was used to construct an RNA-seq library for each sample. RNA was converted to cDNA using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit. The cDNA was fragmented using a sonication device (Covaris, E200). Library construction was completed using the ThruPLEX DNA-seq Kit (Rubicon Genomics). Size selection was performed with AMPure XP Beads (Beckmann Coulter) as per the manufacturer’s directions. Quality and mean fragment size of library samples were assessed with the Bioanalyzer prior to sequencing. Libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 550 deep sequencing unit (150 cycles, paired-end, Illumina) at the Biopolymers Facility at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Reads were mapped using STAR aligner to the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome (mm10, Ensembl release 89) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref039">39</xref>]. Sequencing and alignment quality was analyzed with FastQC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref040">40</xref>], RSeQC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref041">41</xref>], and Picard (broadinstitute.github.io/picard). Read counts were calculated using the Subread package.</p>
<p>Because blood, bone marrow, and muscle could not be completely removed from the tibial cortical bone prior to RNA extraction, we computationally removed reads representing 894 transcripts which we had previously shown to comprise about 10% of all cortical bone mRNA and come from these contaminating tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref035">35</xref>]. We then used EdgeR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref042">42</xref>] to measure transcript abundance by calculating fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM).</p>
<p>We quantified -fold changes in expression between <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup>dko/dko</sup> and wild-type transcripts using the DESeq2 package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008361.ref043">43</xref>]. Reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008361.t002">Table 2</xref> are those transcripts having a mean FPKM greater than 3 in wild-type, <italic>Bglap/2</italic><sup><italic>dko/dko</italic></sup>, or in both mice, and those that changed significantly (adjusted p values &lt; 0.05) after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008361.s005">S4 Table</xref> includes adjusted p values for all transcripts regardless of FPKM.</p>

<p>* Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out. *</p>
<p>Dear Dr Williams,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your Research Article entitled 'An Osteocalcin-deficient mouse strain without endocrine abnormalities' to PLOS Genetics.</p>
<p>The manuscript was fully evaluated at the editorial level and by independent peer reviewers. As you will see, all three reviewers are supportive of the importance of the question and the central findings that the new mouse model of osteocalcin deficiency challenges early findings on another osteocalcin mouse model. Overall, we agree that the work has the potential to provide new information important for bone and mineral metabolism research.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are some significant issues that were raised by the reviewers, as well as a number of minor points. The first relates to the statistical significance of some of the results and question of whether or not the numbers of animals that were used are sufficient to support the validity of the claims. Given the importance of the findings in re-interpreting earlier data in the field, it is particularly important that the findings are robust and supported by adequate numbers of experimental mice.</p>
<p>The second major recommendation is that in addition to fasting glucose levels, provocative testing such as glucose tolerance should be carried out to further evaluate the claim that osteocalcin deficiency does not lead to endocrine abnormalities.</p>
<p>We therefore ask you to modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations before we can consider your manuscript for acceptance. Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer.</p>
<p>In addition we ask that you:</p>
<p>1) Provide a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript.</p>
<p>2) Upload a Striking Image with a corresponding caption to accompany your manuscript if one is available (either a new image or an existing one from within your manuscript).

<p>Reviewer #1: During the last twenty three years, the bone and mineral metabolism research community (and the NIH institutes and numerous other national and international funding agencies that support it) have devoted a great deal of intellectual energy and resources on some very provocative, albeit controversial, ideas about osteocalcin (OCN) – a 46 amino-acid protein that is made in bone and binds avidly to the hydroxyapatite mineral. OCN is produced and secreted almost exclusively by osteoblasts, terminally differentiated cells responsible for the synthesis and mineralization of the bone matrix during the development of the skeleton and its periodic regeneration throughout life. Osteoblasts are short-lived cells originating from mesenchymal progenitors that are replaced depending on the demand for bone formation in a particular location and time. OCN secreted by osteoblasts contains three γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues that are removed by the acidic pH created during the resorption of bone by osteoclasts.</p>
<p>According to ideas originated and propagated by Gerard Karsenty and co-workers, osteoblasts comprise an endocrine organ and decarboxylated OCN is a hormone. The circulating levels of this “new hormone” are, therefore, dependent on the rate of bone turnover, a.k.a. remodeling. Specifically, Karsenty and collaborators have claimed in a series of high profile publications over a period of several years that OCN acts on multiple organs and tissues including bone, pancreas, liver, adipose, muscles, testicles, and the brain to regulates functions ranging from bone mass accumulation, to body weight, adipocity, glucose metabolism, energy utilization, male fertility, mentation, and behavior. Notably, all these claims have been based on the results of studies of a single mouse model with genetic deletion of OCN, generated in the Karsenty laboratory over 23 years ago, but never made available to other investigators seeking to reproduce the results.</p>
<p>However, unlike hormones produced and released by dedicated cells in response to external stimuli, the number of osteoblasts and thereby the circulating levels of osteocalcin inexorably change throughout life as a result of physiologic or pathologic changes of bone itself that can be acute or chronic, systemic or localized, and reversible or irreversible. Examples are skeletal development, growth, adaptation of the skeleton to mechanical forces, fracture healing, changing calcium needs, stress, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, lactation, menopause, aging, hyper- or hypo-parathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypercortisolemia, Paget’s disease, bone tumors, etc. Furthermore, medications – approved after extensive trials with thousands of subjects and used by millions for the treatment of osteoporosis – decrease or increase serum osteocalcin levels without any effect on glucose homeostasis, testosterone production, muscles, or behavior. The glaring shortcomings and incongruence of the Karsenty ideas with physiology, pathophysiology, clinical medicine, and pharmacology notwithstanding, the concerns with the hypothesis that bone and osteocalcin regulate many other tissues have progressively intensified over the years by the fact that other groups have failed to reproduce the observations of Karsenty and colleagues in different mice or in a rat model with OCN deletion. Still major journal review articles and prestigious teaching textbooks have continued until now to publish the Karsenty claims as proven biologic facts.</p>
<p>In the study of Diegel et al, the authors have generated their own mouse model of loss of OCN function using CRISWPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Homozygous mice with deletion of the two alleles that encode OCN have undetectable mRNA for either allele in bone and no circulating OCN. Additionally, RNA sequencing of cortical bone samples from the OCN deficient mice show minimal differences from the wild type control mice. Unlike the Karsenty model, these mice have normal bone mass and strength, as well as normal blood glucose and male fertility. They do, however, exhibit increased bone crystal size and maturation of hydroxyapatite, consistent with earlier evidence and the general consensus that OCN plays a role in mineralization. The authors conclude that their OCN-deficient mouse has no endocrine abnormalities. The methods of analysis of the phenotype are state of the art, the results are solid and totally convincing, and the manuscript is concisely and clearly written.</p>
<p>Minor point</p>
<p>Page 3 of the Introduction, second line form the bottom: Spell out FPKM.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The authors used Crispr-CAS technology to generate a mouse in which a large portion of both of the osteocalcin genes in mice were deleted. They showed that the mRNA generated from the deleted genome encodes a truncated protein likely to be non-functional and showed that antisera detected no immunoreactive osteocalcin in KO mouse blood. MicroCT showed no difference in bone mass between KO and WT and bone strength, measured by 4-point bending assays was normal in the KO. They noted tha the KO had an increased crystallinity and decrease in acid phosphate in the KO. Fasting blood glucose was normal in 6-month-old KO, as was weight. Fasting and random blood sugar levels were similar in KO and WT mice. Fertility, testis size and testosterone levels were normal in KO males. Thus, the knockout mouse failed to reproduce the reported abnormalities in the bone.</p>
<p>1. While the Karsenty group did see changes in fasting blood glucose between WT and KO mice, they showed much more dramatic differences when mice were challenged with a glucose tolerance test. I think it’s important for the current investigators to challenge their mice with a glucose tolerance test to see if that brings out a difference in glucose metabolism missed by the studies that they performed.</p>
<p>2. Testis weight and volume measurements involved only four WT mice. The weights and volumes of the KOs were lower, but apparently not statistically so. Particularly given the wide variation in the WT testis weight (20-30%), the authors need to do a power calculation to determine how many mice need to be studied to avoid missing a real difference, and repeat this study with adequate power. Testosterone levels vary substantially in male mice, depending on whether they are being housed with females or not. No mention was made of precautions to minimize variation among the mice. Was testosterone measurement made at the same time of day to minimize variation due to diurnal variation? When the findings are that the mice are not different, then substantial efforts should be made to avoid missing real differences.</p>
<p>3. The nature of the deletion in the KO mouse appears to allow the possible expression of a peptide fragment of osteocalcin. How do the authors know that this isn’t sufficient to rescue the pancreatic and muscle effects of osteocalcin? This seems unlikely to me, but needs to be discussed more fully by the authors. Has there been any structure-function analysis of these proposed actions of osteocalcin?</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: This is a concise, well-constructed, and articulate study of novel Bglap1/2 KO mice, designed to characterise the physiological role of osteocalcin, which has been the subject of much research since the original publication of a KO mouse describing an endocrine phenotype for the bone protein KO mouse. Herein these studies confirm a role for osteocalcin in bone matrix, though not bone mass and strength. Crucially, there are no changes in plasma glucose or male fertility, which is at odds with a significant body of previous work.</p>
<p>As such, this work represents a valuable addition to the literature, and I commend it. I have no specific comments regarding the studies performed; suffice to say that they are generally appropriate, well executed, and clearly presented.</p>
<p>I have a few minor comments that the authors might wish to consider:</p>
<p>1. Please clarify more clearly the statistical analyses performed; it is not clear from the figure legends or methods for all of the experimental studies.</p>
<p>2. Related to (1), given the magnitude of the previously observed effects with Blglap KO mice (from the lab of Karsenty e.g. change in fasting plasma glucose), please confirm that the ‘n’ numbers used for the studies herein are sufficiently powered to detect such effects, given the variability in any given dataset? Also, are the values (e.g. fasting plasma glucose, bone density) for the WT mice in this study in line with previous work?</p>
<p>3. Please clarify in more detail the background of the mice, and specifically any differences between this new transgenic and the previous (for example, what is reported with respect to Bglap3 for previous mice lines?).</p>
<p>4. At times in the Results, it is not clear whether the authors are referring to their own data, or that of previous studies (quoting stats from previous papers makes this more confusing still). Please just check the syntax in places.</p>
