<title>Introducton:</title>
<p>The impact of social environment on the frequency and prevalence of schizophrenia is well known. However, in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, there are few studies which investigate the effect of social environment on disease prognosis and relapse. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of neighborhood social capital level and address change on relapse in schizophrenia and similar psychotic disorders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="st2">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The research sample consisted of 147 patients (schizophrenia, 76.1%; n=112), who were being followed up at regular intervals of at most six months at the Psychotic Disorders Unit outpatient clinic. Patients were followed-up for relapse indicators between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. During the follow-up, relapse criteria including hospitalization, increased need for help, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, violent behavior, suicide attempts, antipsychotic dose increase and electroconvulsive therapy were used. At least one of these criteria was accepted as a relapse for that period. Neighborhood social capital levels were obtained from a general public survey conducted in Izmir city center in 2008 and the voting rates in the neighborhood during the follow-up period. In addition, during the follow-up period, any change in the address of the patient was recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="st3">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>While there was no correlation between the neighborhood social environment and relapse, a significant relationship was found between relapse and address changes. The probability of relapse was 1.3 times higher in patients with change of address (95%CI: 1.0–1.6; p&lt;0.05), and decreased likelihood of relapse was found as the duration of residence in the same neighborhood shortened (β: (-0.05) 95%CI: [(-0.10)-(-0.003)]; p&lt;0.05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="st4">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>In schizophrenia, relapse appears to be related with the narrow social environment (family, home address) in which the person lives, not with the wider social environment (social capital of the neighborhood). The need for adaptation to a new social environment that arises with a change of address, albeit narrowly, can lead to an increase in symptoms of schizophrenia as a psychosocial stressor.</p>
