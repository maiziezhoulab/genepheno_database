<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">A wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders manifesting in infancy and early childhood (including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder) or young adulthood (including schizophrenia) are associated with disrupted interhemispheric communication, which in some but not all of the affected cases is accompanied by structural alterations of the corpus callosum, the brain’s largest commissure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The formation of interhemispheric connectivity involves a highly orchestrated multi-step process, including midline zipper glia promoting hemispheric fusion and midline crossing of pioneer fibers, followed by ingrowth of large numbers of transcallosal axons interconnecting the left and right cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Early occurring disruptions of commissural development could manifest as agenesis of the corpus callosum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, alterations affecting later phases of development, including defective or misdirected axonal growth cone navigation with failure to cross the midline, or faulty axonal ingrowth into the contralateral cortex, could be responsible for the partial thinning, or developmental hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, extending either across its entire rostro-caudal axis or subportion thereof<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, proper region- and lamina-specific axonal innervation and arborization within contralateral cortex are dependent on the functional activity of cortical projection neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, late occurring defects of transcallosal connectivity may not result in overt macroscopic defects of brain morphology including its commissures. Such a complex developmental program of commissural connectivity is, perhaps unsurprisingly, associated with a heavy footprint in the genetic risk architecture of neurodevelopmental disease. In fact, a number of chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) have been linked to callosal agenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Of note, many cases with a chr. 22q11.2 micro-deletion or -duplication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> as one of the most frequently diagnosed CNV in neuropsychiatric disease cohorts are affected by callosal hypo- and hyperplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and furthermore, interhemispheric dysconnectivity phenotypes have been associated with a rapidly increasing list of specific point mutations in cell surface signaling genes encoding key regulators of neurite outgrowth and connectivity, such as the <italic>Roundabout guidance receptor 1</italic> (<italic>ROBO1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or the <italic>L1 cell adhesion molecule</italic> (<italic>L1CAM</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Much less is known about the role of nuclear signaling molecules for disease-relevant commissural phenotypes. For example, orderly formation of transcallosal connectivity critically depends on proper gene dosage and activity of a subset of chromatin regulators such as the transcriptional repressor <italic>switch-insensitive 3 family member A</italic> (<italic>SIN3A</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and the <italic>Forkhead box G1</italic> (<italic>FOXG1</italic>) transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, molecular and cellular mechanisms linking the neuronal epigenome to interhemispheric connectivity remain poorly explored.</p>
<p id="Par5">Here, we describe <italic>C11orf46/ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 14 effector protein</italic> (<italic>ARL14EP</italic>), a small (35 kDa) nuclear protein encoded in the chr. 11p13 Wilms Tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary Abnormalities, intellectual disability (formerly referred to as Mental Retardation) (WAGR) risk locus, as a novel chromatin regulator of transcallosal connectivity. Importantly, we show that C11orf46 is, as an RNA-guided Cas9 fusion protein, suitable for targeted epigenomic promoter editing to drive the expression of specific regulators of axonal development in immature transcallosal projection neurons, thereby offering a molecular tool to affect interhemispheric communication.</p>

<title>C11orf46 is critical for transcallosal connectivity</title>
<p id="Par6">A recent study identified 50 novel genes associated with autosomal recessive forms of intellectual disability, including open reading frame <italic>C11orf46</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Importantly, moreover, this gene is located in the chr. 11p13-14 neurodevelopmental risk locus and deleted in some cases of WAGR syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) #194072), a rare copy number variant disorder with its core features caused by haploinsufficiency for the <italic>Wilms tumor 1</italic> (<italic>WT1</italic>) and <italic>Paired box 6</italic> (<italic>PAX6</italic>) homoebox gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Of note, <italic>C11orf46</italic> is positioned in between <italic>PAX6</italic> and the <italic>Brain derived neurotrophic factor</italic> (<italic>BDNF</italic>, chr. 11p14.1) gene which is included in the deleted segment in approximately half of patients with WAGR syndrome and associated with obesity and more severe cognitive and behavioral deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, there is evidence that, independent of <italic>BDNF</italic>, additional coding genes in chr. 11p13-14 could contribute to neurodevelopmental disease. For example, exome sequencing studies in Middle Eastern pedigrees associated homozygous <italic>C11orf46</italic> (chr11:30,323,051-30,338,458, GRCh38/hg38) point mutations with cognitive disease and intellectual disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To begin the neurological exploration of <italic>C11orf46</italic>, we studied differences in brain morphology between WAGR microdeletion cases encompassing the <italic>C11orf46</italic> gene and those with less extensive chr. 11p13 segment haploinsufficiency.</p>
<p id="Par7">To this end, we examined magnetic resonance T1-weighted images (MRI) in health control subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 23), isolated <italic>PAX6+/−</italic> subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 12), and individuals with WAGR-region deletions involving <italic>PAX6+/−</italic> and <italic>C11orf46+/−</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 27). Indeed, <italic>C11orf46</italic> haploinsufficiency was associated with significant differences observed in total corpus callosum (CC) and posterior CC volumes but not for other individual portions of the CC. After adjusting for age and sex, patients with isolated <italic>PAX6</italic>+/− compared to controls had significantly smaller total and posterior CC volumes [ANCOVA: F(4,57) = 29.43, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−8</sup>; post hoc two-sided LSD mean difference (95% CI): −705 (−1046 to −364) mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001] and posterior CC volumes [<italic>F</italic>(4,57) = 36.38, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup>; −180 (−282 to −78) mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0009], a finding consistent with the role of <italic>PAX6</italic> in morphologic brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, patients with combined <italic>PAX6/C11orf46</italic>+/− had an even smaller posterior CC volume compared to both patients with isolated <italic>PAX6</italic>+/− [−173 (−284 to −62) mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003] and controls [−353 (−436 to −270) mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup>] (Unadjusted volumes are shown but <italic>P</italic>-values from ANCOVAs adjusting for covariates are depicted in the figure; estimated marginal means are provided in the figure legend) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>). Because of the established role of <italic>BDNF</italic> in brain development and intellectual functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we also considered a potential confounding effect of <italic>BDNF+/−</italic>. We observed no significant differences in the <italic>PAX6/C11orf46</italic>+/− patients with (<italic>n</italic> = 17) and without (<italic>n</italic> = 10) <italic>BDNF+/−</italic> for total or posterior CC volumes [246 (−122 to 614) mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.19 and 41 (−73 to 156) mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.47, respectively, for unadjusted comparisons; 281 (−84 to 647) mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.13 and 50 (−61 to 162) mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.37, respectively, on ANCOVA adjusting for age and sex] (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). Lymphoblastoid cell lines from <italic>C11orf46</italic> haploinsufficient WAGR cases have approximately 50% lower C11orf46 mRNA levels, indicating that the expression of the remaining intact allele does not undergo compensatory upregulation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). Therefore, loss of one <italic>C11orf46</italic> copy in the context of chr. 11p13-14.1 microdeletions appears to be more highly detrimental for neurodevelopment and associated with more severe hypoplasia of the callosal commissure.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>C11orf46 is a neuronal nuclear protein important for callosal development. <bold>a</bold> (top) Genomic map of chr. 11 WAGR deletion locus.

<p id="Par8">Having linked <italic>C11orf46</italic> haploinsufficiency to callosal hypoplasia, we next explored C11orf46 expression patterns in mouse brain. In the cerebral cortex, C11orf46 quantification at the level of mRNA, and protein with a custom-made anti-C11orf46 antibody (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>) showed its expression across a wide age window, with higher levels in the pre- and post-natal developmental periods as compared to the adult brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c–f</xref>). C11orf46 was mainly expressed in the cortical plate (CP) with minimal labeling in the proliferative subventricular zone (SVZ) at mRNA and protein levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). To examine cell type-specific expression pattern of C11orf46 during brain development, C11orf46 was co-stained with multiple cell type-specific markers. Notably, C11orf46 is expressed in a nuclear punctate pattern in NeuroD2-positive cells, but not in PAX6 and TBR2-positive cells, although we observed cytoplasmic expression of C11orf46 in cells expressing these markers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). Nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of C11orf46 was also observed in neuronal markers, such as TBR1, SATB2, CUX1, and CTIP2-positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). In Nestin-expressing radial glial cells, C11orf46 is expressed in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that nuclear C11orf46 is primarily expressed in post-mitotic neurons. Additional double-labeling experiments confirmed that C11orf46 is predominantly expressed in Calmodulin-kinase II (CaMKII)-positive glutamatergic neurons but not in AlDH1L1-positive astrocytes or Olig2-positive oligodendrocytes and precursors, or Iba1-positive microglia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>). C11orf46 immunoreactivity in GABAergic neurons was much weaker than those in glutamatergic neurons (data not shown). We conclude that in the developing cerebral cortex, C11orf46 is primarily expressed in post-migratory glutamatergic cortical neurons.</p>
<p id="Par9">To explore the role of C11orf46 in developing cortex, we knocked down its expression by in utero electroporation (IUE). We delivered C11orf46 (shRNA1, shRNA2) or control short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) together with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmid using our published protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We selected embryonic day 15 (E15) for IUE procedure with two reasons: first, C11orf46 is highly expressed at E15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c, d</xref>). Second, at this stage IUE mostly targets progenitor cells in the ventricular zone (VZ) which later differentiate into cortical layer II/III pyramidal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, many of which become transcallosal projection neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> as our cell type-of-interest given the clinical phenotype reported above. Indeed, E15 IUE <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown resulted in severe arborization deficits in GFP-labeled callosal axons projecting into the contralateral cortex across all cortical layers at postnatal day 14 (P14) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a–c</xref>). This phenotype was highly dependent on the level of <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown. More severe axonal arborization deficits by C11orf46 shRNA1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>) was associated with stronger knockdown effect on C11orf46 compared with shRNA2 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>). Importantly, these axonal arborization deficits were partially rescued by co-expressing shRNA resistant wild-type C11orf46. Strikingly however, an shRNA resistant C11orf46 (R236H) mutant protein carrying a disease-associated non-synonymous point mutation that consists of arginine to histidine substitution at codon 236<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> did not rescue the transcallosal phenotype induced by <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>). We also found reduction of thickness of corpus callosum that was elicited by knockdown of <italic>C11orf46</italic>, which is reversed by co-expression of RNAi-resistant wild-type C11orf46, but not by C11orf46 (R236H) mutant (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3c</xref>). Furthermore, we observed no difference in percentage of SATB2 and CUX1 positive cells in GFP-labeled neurons in <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown brains, compared to those in controls, suggesting that <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown did not affect the number of cortico-cortical projecting neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3d</xref>). Importantly, the observed axonal phenotype resulting from C11orf46 knockdown was highly specific, because orderly radial neuronal migration into the cortex, when assessed at P2, was indistinguishable from control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Suppression of C11orf46 impairs callosal development and interhemispheric connectivity. <bold>a</bold> (top) Schematic representation of in utero electroporation of GFP expressing plasmid into somatosensory cortex at E15.

<title>C11orf46 regulates genes important for axonal connectivity</title>
<p id="Par10">Having shown that C11orf46 is widely expressed in cortical projection neurons and essential for transcallosal connectivity, we next wanted to gain initial insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying C11orf46 actions on the corpus callosum development. In the single report published to date on C11orf46 function, the protein was renamed ADP-Ribosylation Factor-Like 14 Effector Protein (ARL14EP), and ascribed with a role in major histocompatibility class (MHC) II antigen presentation in immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, we were very surprised about the predominant, if not exclusive, nuclear localization of C11orf46 in our immunohistochemical assays in the developing CP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e, f</xref>). However, a recent study listed C11orf46/ARL14EP among several hundred proteins serving as nuclear export cargo for the RanGTPase-driven exportin CRM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and moreover, large scale total proteome protein–protein interaction mappings consistently identified chromatin-regulatory proteins as C11orf46 binding partners, including the SET domain bifurcated histone lysine methyltransferase 1 (SETDB1)/KMT1E (SETDB2/KMT1F)-MBD-containing-associated factor (MCAF1) histone lysine 9 (K9) methyltransferase repressor complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> (referred to as KMT-RC hereafter). To further examine C11orf46-associated proteins by affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>), we generated inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing Flag-tagged C11orf46 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). We produced two types of inducible clones, one for full length FLAG-tagged C11orf46 (clones 1–5 and 10) and one for a truncated form lacking amino acids 209–237 at C11orf46’s C-terminal region which corresponds to cysteine rich domain, CRD, (C11orf46∆) (clone 7 and 8) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a, b</xref>). Interestingly, nuclear proteins outranked all other C11orf46 binding partners, with the top scoring SETDB1-KRAB associated protein (KAP1)-MCAF1 chromatin repressor complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c–e</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), which is consistent with proteome interaction databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. These findings were specific for full length C11orf46 because the truncated form C11orf46∆ showed only very weak, or no interactions with nuclear proteins including the SETDB1-KAP1-MCAF1 repressor complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). Given the <italic>C11orf46</italic><sup><italic>R236H</italic></sup> point mutation is located in the CRD domain which is required for protein binding of C11orf46 with SETDB1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b–d</xref>), we wondered whether R236H may affect the interaction of C11orf46 and the SETDB1 complex. To test this hypothesis, in addition to inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing Flag-tagged C11orf46 and Flag-tagged C11orf46∆, we generated cell lines for inducible expression of FLAG-C11orf46<sup>R236H</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>). We observed that deletion of CRD domain dramatically weakened the interaction of C11orf46 and SETDB1, whereas the R236H substitution abolished C11orf46-SETDB1 interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3g, h</xref>). Binding of C11orf46 with MCAF1 and KAP1, other members of the SETDB1 protein complex, were also severely decreased by R236H substitution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h</xref>). Notably, both C11orf46 with R236H mutation and that with deletion of CRD domain still kept binding affinity with histone H3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3i</xref>). Also, purified, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> derived, human C11orf46 specifically detected histone H3 tail modifications in a histone peptide array (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4c–e</xref>). Similarly, reciprocal affinity purification with FLAG-tagged SETDB1 using inducible cell lines confirmed C11orf46 as a top ranking binding partner together with other members of the complex, including KAP1 and MCAF1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3j–m</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments with mouse anti-C11orf46 antibody in HeLa cells, and in homogenates of human cerebral cortex confirmed that C11orf46 assembles with SETDB1, MCAF1 and other regulators of repressive chromatin, including heterochromatin-associated protein 1gamma (HP1γ) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3n</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4f</xref>). These results suggest that C11orf46 may function as a chromatin regulator in the SETDB1 complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3o</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>C11orf46 binds to the SETDB1 complex. <bold>a</bold> Flow diagrams for immunoaffinity purification of C11orf46 followed by mass spectrometric analysis. <bold>b</bold> Eight clones of inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged C11orf46 (clone 1–5 and 10) and a truncated form C11orf46 lacking amino acids 209–237 at the C-terminal region which corresponds to cysteine rich domain (CRD) of C11orf46 (C11orf46∆) (clone 7 and 8) in the presence of doxycycline (Dox+).

<title>Suppression of <italic>C11orf46</italic> altered expression of axonal genes</title>
<p id="Par11">Having shown that C11orf46 is a neuronal nuclear protein bound to repressive chromatin regulators, we hypothesized that the trans-callosal dysconnectivity resulting from <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown in fetal mouse cortex and of <italic>C11orf46</italic> deletions in WAGR patients could reflect dysregulated expression of genes critical for axonal growth and development. In order to obtain first insights into C11orf46-sensitive gene expression changes in WAGR deletion cases, we analyzed a RNA-seq dataset of lymphoblastoid cell lines obtained from the aforementioned 2 WAGR cases with <italic>C11orf46</italic> haploinsufficiency compared to 2 controls, including one WAGR case with a shorter microdeletion that retained intact <italic>C11orf46</italic> and one healthy control subject with no loss of genes for the entirety of chr. 11p13-14.1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). We identified 227 differentially expressed genes (182 down-regulated genes and 45 upregulated genes) (FDR &lt; 0.05, see Methods; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) that include 41 genes which have KAP1 binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Notably, among these 41 genes, we found that 17 genes are reportedly involved in axonal development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> genes marked in bold), while the remaining 24 genes, such as CAP2 encoding an adenylyl-cyclase associated protein, are linked to various other cellular functions (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). However, given that the observed gene alterations were likely confounded by deletion of other proximal genes with <italic>C11orf46</italic> at WAGR locus, we switched in our next set of experiments to neuron-like (neuroblastoma) NSC34 Tet-On cells expressing C11orf46 shRNA to further examine C11orf46-regulated genes. Nonetheless, we found that expression levels of the 17 axonal growth and development genes were not consistently affected in response to C11orf46 shRNA-mediated <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown in the neuroblastoma cell line. However, multiple putative C11orf46 target genes, including <italic>Semaphorin 6a</italic> (<italic>Sema6a</italic>), <italic>Doublecortin-like kinase 1</italic> (<italic>Dclk1</italic>), <italic>SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 3</italic> (<italic>Srgap3</italic>), and others showed increased expression after <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown in the NSC-34 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>).

<title>C11orf46- epigenome editing rescues a callosal phenotype</title>
<p id="Par12">Our results, reported above, showed that C11orf46 co-assembles with the KMT-RC. Apparently, this interaction is important because mutations such as <italic>C11orf46</italic><sup><italic>R236H</italic></sup>, disrupting C11orf46’s association with the complex, are highly detrimental to orderly brain development. We hypothesized that C11orf46’s affinity to the KMT-RC could be exploited, in order to ‘edit’ neuronal gene expression via a chromatin-associated mechanism. Such type of epigenome editing could be accomplished, for example, by RNA-guided fusion proteins comprised of nuclease-<underline>d</underline>eficient clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/<underline>C</underline>RISPR-<underline>as</underline>sociated protein 9 (dCas9) bound to a transcriptional activator or repressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

We built a dCas9-SunTag system to load ten copies of C11orf46, or the VP64 activator protein as a positive control, onto a single sgRNA-target sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). We began with our epigenome editing experiments in HEK293 cells selecting <italic>Sema6a</italic>, <italic>Dclk1</italic>, and <italic>GAP43</italic>. For each gene, we obtained four sgRNAs positioned within 500 bp upstream of the target TSS. For each of the three target genes, three groups of HEK293 cells were compared, based on transfection with (1) dCas9-ST alone (sgRNA-dCas9-10xGCN4<sup>’SunTag’</sup>) or dCas9-ST together with one of the following plasmids, (2) scFv which recognizes the GCN4 epitope on dCas9-ST-superfold GFP-VP64, or (3) scFv-superfold GFP-wild-type C11orf46 (C11orf46<sup>wt</sup>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). After nuclear localization of the scFv-sfGFP-C11orf46 domain was confirmed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>), testing for each target gene experiments were conducted in parallel in HEK293 cells, with each of the four sgRNA tested individually (and in a pool of four for <italic>SEMA6A</italic> as well).

<p id="Par13">Our studies in HEK293 cells suggest that C11orf46, when tethered in multiple copies to specific promoter sequences via the CRISPR-Cas9-SunTag system, could actively repress transcribed genes. Next, we wanted to explore this approach in vivo in developing upper layer cortical projection neurons of somatosensory cortex. We focused on <italic>Sema6a</italic>, which was de-repressed after <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown in NSC34 cells and GFP-positive neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, c</xref>). Both <italic>Sema6a</italic> and <italic>C11orf46</italic> are highly expressed in upper cortical layers II/III at P0, within the targeted time of brain development, via IUE (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>). Two sgRNAs, targeting different sequences within the first 500 bp upstream from the TSS of <italic>Sema6a</italic>, were selected for in vivo studies and delivered at E15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). Strikingly these <italic>Sema6a</italic> promoter-targeting sgRNAs rescued impaired midline crossing of callosal projections and axonal arborization deficit normally encountered upon <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown at E15 by IUE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f, g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6b</xref>). Consistent with C11orf46’s association with KMT-RC, introduction of <italic>Sema6a</italic> sgRNA also resulted in increased H3K9me3 levels at the <italic>Sema6a</italic> promoter, in striking contrast with a decrease in H3K9me3 levels after <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>). These effects were highly specific for the target gene sequence, because sgRNAs directed against <italic>Dclk1</italic> promoter did not affect the <italic>Sema6a</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>). Likewise, increased <italic>Sema6a</italic> expression in <italic>C11orf46</italic> knockdown neurons was strongly suppressed by our SunTag-based C11orf46-mediated epigenome editing toolkit targeting the <italic>Sema6a</italic>, but not the <italic>Dclk1</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5i</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par14">Axonal development is a pivotal process in establishing neural connectivity for brain functions, including cognition and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. This critical stepwise process coordinately regulates the establishment of synaptic connections to target sites with topographic specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Disrupting these processes may lead to altered neural connectivity, which may underlie cognitive disabilities in neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. While multiple molecular pathways including guidance cues and growth factors have been implicated in axonal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, very little is known about chromatin-regulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Recently, the SET (histone methyltransferase) domain-containing transcriptional repressor, PR/SET domain 8 (PRDM8), was described as essential for the formation of trans-callosal and other interhemispheric fiber tracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> Likewise, Heterochromatin-associated protein 1gamma (HP1γ) is required for the crossing of callosal axons into the contralateral hemisphere, while increased neuronal HP1γ expression promotes growth and differentiation of dendrites and axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Interestingly, PRDM8 promotes H3K9 methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and HP1γ is bound preferentially to compacted nucleosomal arrays bearing the repressive H3K9me3 mark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the C11orf46-binding partner and repressive H3K9MTase, SETDB1, has been implicated in transcriptional regulation of S-type clustered Protocadherin genes, a group of cell adhesion molecules broadly important for neuronal connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. These findings, when taken together with our results reported here, imply H3K9 methyl-regulators as important epigenomic determinant of the developing cortical connectome.</p>
<p id="Par15">In this study, we showed that C11orf46 assembles with bona fide factors of histone-3 lysine-9 trimethyltransferase (H3K9me3) SETDB1 complex, it substrate histone H3 and a subset of nuclear proteins functionally associated with repressive and heavily H3K9-methylated (hetero) chromatin, including Lamin B1 (LMNB1), Lamina-associated protein 2, isoform alpha (LAP2A) and HP1γ. These multi-molecular assemblies of chromatin-bound proteins presumably require distinct domains of C11orf46 to associate with SETDB1 complex and histone H3. Importantly, non-synonymous genetic mutations G218E and R236H found in the CRD domain of C11orf46 are associated with neurodevelopmental disease conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. We show that specifically the R236H, disrupted the C11orf46 assembly with the SETDB1 complex but not C11orf46’s association with histone H3. Therefore, mutations in critical domains of C11orf46 could disrupt the above assembly and potentially interfere with spatiotemporal gene silencing required for orderly development of transcallosal connectivity. Notably, purified C11orf46 showed strong affinity for histone H3 tail modifications in vitro; we were surprised to observe C11orf46’s high affinity towards a histone mark antagonizing histone methylation, H3R2-citrulline (H3R2Cit)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Future studies will explore in more detail the regulatory role for C11orf46. For example, C11orf46 could sense the levels of mono- or di-methylated H3K9 to promote trimethylation, or block H3K9 methylation in response to high levels of antagonizing H3R2Cit mark.</p>
<p id="Par16">In addition to protein components of the SETDB1 complex, such as KAP1 and MCAF1, our results of proteome screening identified LMNB1 and LAP2A, two nuclear lamina proteins that were previously discovered at the heterochromatin rich nuclear periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, as potential protein interactors of C11orf46. Interestingly, LMNB1 and LAP2A play critical roles for developmentally regulated dendritic and axonal connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Because C11orf46 resulted in impaired axonal development, but had no robust effect on dendritic structure, it will be important to further investigate epigenetic mechanisms to determine how C11orf46 specifically regulates axonal development.</p>
<p id="Par17">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the utility of the nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas9 system-mediated epigenome editing with IUE knockdown approach for addressing cell-autonomous epigenetic machinery for regulation of transcallosal connectivity. By targeting transcallosal projection neurons, we demonstrate that C11orf46 regulates axonal terminal arborization by control of expression of <italic>Sema6a</italic> via epigenomic promoter H3K9-methylation. The corpus callosum phenotypes in WAGR cases with <italic>C11orf46</italic> haploinsufficiency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) and the successful epigenomic rescue by sequence-specific C11orf46-mediated chromatin remodeling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>), would imply that future chromatin-based therapies could be harnessed to correct developmental errors in the brain’s connectome. Importantly, genetic deletion of <italic>Sema6a</italic> resulted in impaired neuronal connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. SEMA6A is a transmembrane protein and is known as a ligand for Plexin A2 (PLXNA2) and Plexin A4 (PLXNA4) which also play critical roles for regulating axon guidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. <italic>Plxna2</italic> and <italic>Plxna4</italic> knockout mice showed impaired axonal development similar to those observed in mouse models with genetic deletion of <italic>Sema6a</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Thus, dysregulation of C11orf46-mediated control of <italic>Sema6a</italic> expression may impair axonal development regulated by Plxns either in cell autonomous or non-autonomous manner, which warrants further investigation in the future.</p>
<p id="Par18">Our results, however, should carefully be interpreted for several reasons. First, although IUE-knockdown approach is a powerful method to examine the cell-autonomous effect of C11orf46 in the specific time critical for axonal growth, off-target effect of shRNAs might be confounded in the phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. To ensure that observed results do not originate from their off-target effects, we confirmed dose-dependent effects on the axonal phenotypes induced by two shRNAs with independent target sequences. Rescue experiments by co-expression of RNAi-resistant wild-type <italic>C11orf46</italic>, containing silent mutations in the target sequence of their shRNA, also ensured that the observed phenotypes are specifically due to its knockdown effect. Nevertheless, C11orf46-mediated mechanisms for axonal development and resulting WAGR syndrome-related phenotypes should be investigated in mice with genetic deletion of <italic>C11orf46</italic>, which will be considered for future studies. Second, we utilized RNA-seq data obtained from lymphoblastoid cell lines to identify differentially expressed genes involved in axonal development in WAGR cases, compared to those in controls. Lymphoblastoid cells may not represent brain-specific epigenome. Nevertheless, lymphoblastoid cells remain to be a convenient and well-characterized tool to elucidate brain disease-related molecular phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Importantly, our RNA-seq data sets with matched controls revealed not only lymphoid genes, but also genes critical for neuronal function, representing the disturbances of neuronal-like epigenome in these lymphoid cells. Third, the discrepancy of <italic>SEMA6A</italic> expression in lymphoblastoid cells and neuronal conditions likely arise from the confounding effect of other genes located in the WAGR risk locus, including <italic>PAX6</italic> transcription factor. Epigenomic signatures of lymphoid cell line as well as the developing brain may also contribute to this discrepancy. Fourth, because human subjects in our study were recruited on the basis of having aniridia, all participants were, by definition, <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficient, and, therefore, we were unable to assess the effect of <italic>C11orf46+/−</italic> independent of <italic>PAX6+/−</italic> and the phenotype of isolated <italic>C11orf46+/−</italic> is unknown (although homozygous mutations in <italic>C11orf46</italic> have been reported in association with intellectual disability). PAX6 is a transcription factor regulating neurogenesis and rostrocaudal patterning during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency is associated with corpus callosum hypoplasia in both rodents and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Thus, there remains the possibility that additional loss of <italic>PAX6+/−</italic> may be required for <italic>C11orf46+/−</italic> to cause significant defects in morphologic brain development. However, we were able to demonstrate that patients with combined loss of both genes had more severely reduced corpus callosum volumes compared to isolated <italic>PAX6+/−</italic>, confirming an additional role of C11orf46 in neurodevelopment. Whether the impact of mutations in the above molecules on axonal development is additive or synergistic remains to be determined. In addition, because the WAGR CNV encompasses a large genomic regions that encompass many genes, hampering identification of genetic drivers responsible for specific phenotypes shown in CNVs-associated disease conditions, our data do not exclude the possibility that other genes in 11p13 deletion region, besides <italic>BDNF</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic>, and <italic>C11orf46</italic> may have independent effect on axonal and other anatomical phenotypes as well as behavioral outcomes in WAGR syndrome.</p>
<p id="Par19">In summary, we identified a chromatin-associated mechanism underlying axonal development and show that C11orf46 plays an important role in transcallosal phenotypes in 11p13 deletion syndrome. Further investigation on epigenetic regulators in CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and altered neural connectivity is important for translational approaches that pave the way for novel treatment of neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions in early life.</p>

<title>RNA-seq and bioinformatic analysis</title>
<p id="Par28">Total RNA was isolated from four lymphoblastoid cell lines including one derived from healthy control subject, one WAGR patient with <italic>C11orf46 gene</italic> intact and two WAGR patients with <italic>C11orf46</italic> gene deletions using a total RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. RNA integrity determined in Bioanalyzer (Agilent’s Technologies) and a total RNA-seq was performed at Eurofins genomics. DNA libraries were prepared from total RNA samples, the adaptor-ligated libraries (125 bp) were enriched by PCR amplification and gel purified (average library size of ~270 bp). Libraries were sequenced with the Genome Analyzer II (Illumina) using pair-end 50-bp raw fastq reads. The sequencing approach resulted in 32,750,145 and 27,929,697 and 39,292,408, and 54,377,092 reads for lymphoblastoid cell line sample numbers one, two, three, and four, respectively. Sequencing raw reads were assessed for quality control using FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). RNA-seq reads of 50 bp were aligned against the human genome (UCSC hg19) references with TopHat2 using default parameters with Bowtie as the internal aligner and a segment mapping algorithm to discover splice junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. In all, 77–82% of all unique sequences correctly aligned to the reference genome. Reads were counted in exon regions using featureCounts tool (subread v1.5.2) producing a table that was normalized to rpkms (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Heatmaps were produced scaling rpkm values by scale function (base v3.5.1) and colors were adjusted by quantile breaking to allow colors represent an equal proportion of the data.</p>
<p id="Par29">Two different techniques were used in order to assemble the transcriptome: (i) reference-guided assembly of RNA-seq reads using reference annotations from Refseq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> and (ii) non-reference guided assembly (without the help of a reference gene model) to yield a ‘transcript reference-free’ characterization of RNA-seq reads. For the first approach, BioConductor packages DESeq (References) and EdgeR v2.4.6 in the R programming environment were used. HTSeq-count (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/index.html">http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/index.html</ext-link>) was used with UCSC annotation to generate a set of per-gene read counts for each sample, using default parameters including ‘stranded’ set to ‘no’. The HTSeq-count-generated matrix count dataset was used as input. The quartile of genes with the lowest counts was excluded to increase the detection power at a given FDR. For the second approach, the Cufflinks-CuffDiff-CummeRbund pipeline was used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Fragments per kilobase per millions of reads (FPKM) values were computed for each cell line sample. Genes that were significantly differentially expressed with a FDR of 0.05 in DESeq and EdgeR were selected for further analysis. Both methods yielded highly reproducible results in the expression measurements of the transcripts, and the majority of differentially expressed genes were also significant in an independent analysis using Cufflinks.</p>

<title>Generation of tet-inducible cell lines</title>
<p id="Par30">Human full-length <italic>SETDB1</italic> complementary DNA (cDNA), identical to SETDB1 transcript variant 1 (NM_001145415.1; 3876 bp, 1291 amino acids, predicted molecular weight 143 kDa,) was reverse-transcribed using primer Cjk-SA1. Total RNA was isolated from human brain derived U87-MG glioblastoma cells (ATCC, Cat #HTB-14) and was subsequently amplified by PCR (Cjk-SA2 &amp; Cjk-SA4). SalI-Not1 site was double digested and cloned into pENTR4 and transferred to the pFRT TO DESTFLAGHA vector by a LR reaction. The plasmid was completely sequenced. The FLAGHA epitope contributed 17 amino acids to the N-terminal of SETDB1. These amino acids fused at the N-terminus to the ~60 bp (1xFLAG)- (1xHA) epitope (FLAG-HA-SETDB1) downstream of a promoter containing the tetracycline-responsive element (pFRT-TO-FLAGHA-SETDB1) and stably transfected (hygromycin) into Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> T-Rex 293<sup>TM</sup> cells (ThermoFisher, Cat #R780-07) together with plasmid pOG44 (expressing FLP recombinase). Full-length <italic>C11orf46</italic> cDNA (NM_152316.2; 270 amino acids; 783 bp) was amplified by PCR from an Incyte plasmid (Openbiosystem, Cat #IHS1380-97432875) using primers Cjk24 and Cjk25, cloned into SalI-NotI restriction sites of the pENTR4 vector. A similar procedure was used to generate HEK293 cells for tet-inducible expression of a FLAG-HA-tagged full length <italic>C11orf46</italic> cDNA (NM_152316.1 784 bp, 260 amino acids). For cloning, high fidelity reverse transcriptase (AccuScript Hi-Fi; Agilent Technologies #600180) and DNA polymerase were used (Pfu Ultra DNA polymerase; Agilent Technologies #600380).
