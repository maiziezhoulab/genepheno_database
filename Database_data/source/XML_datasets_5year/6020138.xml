<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging, the effects of early
life stress on nonhuman primate striatal neuronal integrity were examined as
reflected by <italic>N</italic>-acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentrations. NAA
measures were interrogated through examining their relationship to
previously documented early life stress markers—cerebrospinal fluid
corticotropin-releasing factor concentrations, hippocampal volume, body
mass, and behavioral timidity. Rodent models of depression exhibit increases
in neurotrophic effects in the nucleus accumbens. We hypothesized that
rearing under conditions of early life stress (variable foraging demand,
VFD) would produce persistent elevations of NAA concentrations (in absolute
or ratio form) in ventral striatum/caudate nucleus (VS/CN) with altered
correlation to early life stress markers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2a-2470547018768450" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Eleven bonnet macaque males reared under VFD conditions and seven age-matched
control subjects underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging
during young adulthood. Voxels were placed over VS/CN to capture nucleus
accumbens. Cisternal cerebrospinal fluid corticotropin-releasing factor
concentrations, hippocampal volume, body mass, and response to a human
intruder had been previously determined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3a-2470547018768450" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>VFD-reared monkeys exhibited significantly increased NAA/creatine
concentrations in right VS/CN in comparison to normally reared controls,
controlling for multiple comparisons. In comparison to controls, VFD
cerebrospinal fluid corticotropin-releasing factor concentrations were
directly associated with right VS/CN absolute NAA. Left hippocampal volume
was inversely associated with left VS/CN NAA/creatine in VFD reared but not
in controls. Disruption of a normative inverse correlation between left
VS/CN NAA and body mass was noted in VFD. Only non-VFD subjects exhibited a
direct relationship between timidity response to an intruder and right VS/CN
NAA.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Early life stress produced persistent increases in VS/CN NAA, which
demonstrated specific patterns of association (or lack thereof) to early
life stress markers in comparison to non-VFD subjects. The data are broadly
consistent with a stable nonhuman primate phenotype of anxiety and mood
disorder vulnerability whereby in vivo indicators of neuronal integrity,
although reduced in hippocampus, are increased in striatum. The findings may
provide a catalyst for further studies in humans and other species regarding
a reciprocal hippocampal/nucleus accumbens relationship in affective
disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enduring effects of early life stress (ELS), including reduced neuronal integrity in
the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2470547018768450">1</xref></sup> and reduced left hippocampal volume,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2470547018768450">2</xref></sup> are evident in ELS-exposed nonhuman primates. Nonhuman primates are reared
under a schedule of variable maternal ease of access to food,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2470547018768450">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2470547018768450">3</xref></sup> termed variable foraging demand (VFD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2470547018768450">4</xref></sup> The VFD paradigm is designed not to affect the quantity of food obtained by
mother or the weight trajectory of her developing infant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2470547018768450">4</xref></sup> VFD is experimentally structured to increase maternal foraging
unpredictability, which disrupts the integrity of the maternal repertoire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2470547018768450">5</xref></sup> Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)
concentrations, a stress-related neuropeptide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2470547018768450">6</xref></sup> provide a valid biomarker of VFD rearing. CSF CRF concentrations increase in
synchrony in both mother and infant in response to VFD exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2470547018768450">7</xref></sup> A persistent elevation of CSF CRF concentrations is then observed in the
offspring at the juvenile phase of development and is sustained into full
adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2470547018768450">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2470547018768450">8</xref></sup>
Moreover, the aforementioned biological features observed in VFD are associated with
an anxious/depressed phenotype across the life cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2470547018768450">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The hippocampus is regarded as the primary site where antidepressants induce
neuroprotective effects through, at least in part, increased expression of
neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2470547018768450">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2470547018768450">10</xref></sup> Induction of BDNF expression
by antidepressants in the hippocampus has demonstrable antidepressant effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2470547018768450">10</xref></sup> while decreased BDNF expression in humans is correlated with smaller left
hippocampal volume in first-episode psychosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2470547018768450">11</xref></sup> Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (<sup>1</sup>H-MRSI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2470547018768450">1</xref></sup> quantifies alterations in neuronal integrity through measurement of the
ubiquitous neurometabolite <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-aspartate (NAA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2470547018768450">12</xref></sup> Spectroscopic imaging (SI) in normal humans confirmed an association between
the met-BDNF variant (Rs626), which impairs BDNF tracking and lowers
depolarization-induced secretion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2470547018768450">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2470547018768450">14</xref></sup> and reduced hippocampal levels
of NAA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2470547018768450">15</xref></sup> suggesting a direct relationship between BDNF function and hippocampal NAA.
NAA has also been used as a surrogate marker for clinical evidence of neurotrophic
effects of BDNF following intrathecal administration in patients with amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2470547018768450">16</xref></sup> Moreover, BDNF serum concentrations were predicted by the concentration of
NAA in the ACC, indicating that neuronal integrity in the ACC, as reflected by a
high concentration of NAA, might be related to high concentrations of BDNF in serum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2470547018768450">17</xref></sup> Consistent with the view that the VFD paradigm models long-standing affective distress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2470547018768450">18</xref></sup> and resembles the biology of depressive susceptibility, we previously
reported decreased hippocampal NAA concentrations, a marker of neuronal integrity,
in VFD-reared subjects in comparison to controls, suggesting decreased hippocampal
neurotrophic milieu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2470547018768450">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to the hippocampus, where neurotrophic processes exerts
antidepressant-like effects, intraventral tegmental area (VTA) BDNF administration
exerts a depression-like effect in the forced swim test (i.e. floating), while
blockade of BDNF action in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) causes an
antidepressant-like effect (i.e., struggling).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2470547018768450">19</xref></sup> Certain studies report that the increase in neurotrophic effects in the NAcc
is critical to the development of a behavioral repertoire associated with social defeat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2470547018768450">20</xref></sup> a mouse model of a depression-like phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2470547018768450">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The NAcc is a subcortical region of the brain activated during reward/punishment
mismatch and is contained within the ventral striatum (VS) of the basal ganglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2470547018768450">21</xref></sup> In the current study, we utilized <sup>1</sup>H-MRSI to determine NAA levels
in the macaque VS/caudate nucleus (CN), a region of interest (ROI) intended to
encompass the NAcc. To the extent that the VFD model resembles a depression-like analogue,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2470547018768450">18</xref></sup> and taken together with other translational studies described above, we
hypothesized that NAA concentrations would be <italic>elevated</italic> in VS/CN of
macaques who had undergone ELS. Although <sup>1</sup>H-MRSI has previously been
utilized in human developmental disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2470547018768450">22</xref></sup> this is the first report, to our knowledge, that specifically examines VS/CN
NAA following ELS in the nonhuman primate. However, it should be noted that although
a body of preclinical and clinical work supports a direct relationship between
hippocampal neurotrophic milieu and NAA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2470547018768450">23</xref></sup> no data, to our knowledge, support the converse—that high NAA in the VS/CN
ROI is reflective of an increase in regional neurotrophic milieu. Interestingly, we
have reported that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit hypertrophy
of the NAcc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2470547018768450">24</xref></sup> Moreover, antidepressant response to ketamine predicted reduction in NAcc
volume and an increase in hippocampal volume at 24-h postadministration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2470547018768450">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>We posed a second hypothesis—whether timid behavioral responses to a human intruder
would directly relate to VS/CN NAA, particularly in a VFD-reared group. Timid
vis-à-vis confrontational responses to the human intruder provides a behavioral
profile which aligns with markers of ELS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2470547018768450">2</xref></sup> and timidity responses are argued to provide a nonhuman primate proxy of
anxiety-like behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2470547018768450">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on reports demonstrating reciprocal roles for BDNF in the hippocampus, where it
mediates antidepressant-like effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2470547018768450">10</xref></sup> and VTA-NAcc, where social defeat enhances BDNF expression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2470547018768450">25</xref></sup> we hypothesized that the putative increases in VS/CN NAA would be associated
with reductions in hippocampal volume, specifically in VFD-reared subjects. Of note,
we previously reported reduced left hippocampal volume in VFD-reared animals in
comparison to unstressed controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2470547018768450">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2470547018768450">3</xref></sup> Therefore, an inverse
correlation between VS/CN NAA and hippocampal volume specifically in subjects
exposed to ELS was hypothesized to support the reciprocal nature of neurotrophic
influences on the VS/CN versus hippocampus.</p>
<p>CRF exerts pronounced effects on striatal-dependent behaviors such as facilitating
drug addiction, disruption of pair-bonding, and interruption of natural reward, each
through modulation of the NAcc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2470547018768450">26</xref></sup> CRF immunostaining is evident in dense concentrations in the NAcc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2470547018768450">27</xref></sup> However, neither acute nor chronic stress increases CRF-like immunoreactivity
within the NAcc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2470547018768450">28</xref></sup> It is clear, nevertheless, that CRF interacts with dopamine neurotransmission
under conditions of stress to enhance drug craving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2470547018768450">29</xref></sup> Increased central CRF expression has been documented following VFD rearing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2470547018768450">30</xref></sup> and is implicated in mood disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2470547018768450">31</xref></sup> A positive association between VS/CN NAA and CRF activation was hypothesized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2470547018768450">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Increased neurotrophic activity in the VTA-NAcc pathway may also cause profound

The latter may cause reductions in the rewarding properties of food.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2470547018768450">33</xref></sup> Developmental stress has been postulated to exacerbate markers of metabolic syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2470547018768450">34</xref></sup> and our previous studies have shown that VFD rearing resulted in increased

adult BMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2470547018768450">36</xref></sup> Therefore, in addition to causing an anxious/depressed phenotype, the VFD
form of ELS causes an increase in both central CRF and body mass. Thus, we
hypothesized an inverse association between VS/CN NAA with body mass.</p>
<p>In sum, consistent with a body of data regarding VTA/NAcc in negative affective
states, we hypothesized that NAA concentrations in voxels placed over VS/CN would be
increased following ELS in the form of VFD rearing. The association of VS/CN NAA
concentrations to CSF CRF (positive), hippocampal volumes (inverse), metabolic
indices (inverse), and timid behavioral responses to a human intruder (direct)
warranted examination in the VFD model versus controls. Positive preclinical studies
of VS/CN NAA increases following ELS may translate to clinical MRSI studies.</p>

following a brief restraint period, rapidly given anesthetic agent
intramuscularly. Saffan®, previously known as CT1341, is an injectable
veterinary steroid anesthetic and minimizes motion artifact, relative to
ketamine. Saffan® was administered at a dose of 16 mg/kg, which comprises
two bioactive constituents: 12 mg/kg of alphaxalone and 4 mg/kg alphadolone
acetate. Once sedated, the monkeys' heads were positioned in a Styrofoam
headrest inside a human knee coil and taped snugly over the forehead to
minimize movement. Subjects remained anesthetized throughout scanning and
were continuously monitored by pulse oximeter. Infrequently, because of
evidence of motion during the scan due to diminished level of anesthesia,
animals necessitated subsequent doses of Saffan® (¼ initial dose). Subjects
usually awakened within 20 min following completion of the 1-h scan.

phase-encoding steps over an FOV of 16 cm (zero filled to 32 × 32
phase-encoding steps before 3D Fourier transformation), a slice thickness of

sampling, to obtain voxels having a nominal size of 0.25 cm<sup>3</sup>
(1.0 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>). Outer volume saturation bands were
prescribed to coincide with all eight sides of the PRESS box. Water
suppression and magnet shimming were automatically performed and adjusted by
the host computer. The raw SI data were processed and fitted in the
frequency domain to obtain metabolite peak areas using manufacturer-supplied
MRS data processing software. Individual CSI images were reconstructed and
overlaid onto the T1 anatomical images. Automatic phase correction was
applied, voxels of interests were identified, and the metabolite levels were

surface CSF, and meninges were stripped using a combination of tools
including image thresholding, region growing, and manual tracing.</p>
<p>The hippocampi were manually traced bilaterally using a detailed set of
guidelines developed by Schumann et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2470547018768450">38</xref></sup> and adjusted, when necessary, to the bonnet macaque brain morphology
using a primate brain atlas. The tracings were performed in oblique coronal
slices but were also checked in sagittal and axial views. Repeated
measurements were performed in a random order on five subjects, and both
intrarater and interrater reliability gave an ICC of 0.93 for right/left
hippocampus. An additional structural MRI data analysis was performed using
VBM SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>). Briefly, a single subject raised
under normative conditions was chosen as the initial template. All images
were registered through linear (zooms, rotations, translations, and shears)
deformations to the single-subject template. An average image, called
template henceforth, was created with the obtained deformed images.
Afterward, the same original images were linearly deformed to the created
template, and this step was iterated 20 times to minimize the bias caused by
utilization of a single subject as the initial template. On the 22nd step,
original images were linearly and also nonlinearly registered to the final
template. A brain mask containing gray matter, white matter, and CSF was
manually delineated for the template and used to eliminate skull and
meninges from the final registered images. In order to preserve brain
volume, images were scaled using the Jacobian matrix, so that the total
amount of gray matter in the resulting images remains the same as it would
be in the original images. The obtained images were finally smoothed with a
Gaussian filter at full width at height maximum equal to 4 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2470547018768450">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>Data were inspected for outliers and tested for normality of distribution for
left and right VS/CN absolute NAA and left and right VS/CN NAA/Cr (creatine),
which were the primary independent measures of study. Predictor variables (CSF
CRF, hippocampal volume, body mass, and timidity response to an intruder) were
also evaluated for normality. Rearing group effects were analyzed by
<italic>t</italic> test between VFD and non-VFD monkeys. We examined whether
age and weight were distinguishable either by rearing groups, or whether either
variable was predictive of the dependent or predictor variables in the current
study. In either of these instances, age and/or weight were used as covariates.
General linear models (GLMs) were used where the predictor variable was the
variable of interest (CSF CRF concentrations, right or left hippocampal volume,
body mass, and behavioral response to an intruder) and left and right VS/CN
absolute NAA and left and right NAA/Cr served as a 2 × 2 (NAA measure (absolute
vs. ratio) × VS/CN side) repeated measures dependent variable. The interaction
term between rearing group and the predictor variable was included in the GLM
and, when significant, would indicate an associative relationship between the
predictor and predicted variable that was significantly influenced by rearing
status. Univariate analyses followed and the interactive term of individual NAA
measures was the primary focus (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2470547018768450">Tables 4</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2470547018768450"></xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-2470547018768450"></xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-2470547018768450">7</xref>). Within-rearing group, Pearson's
correlational matrices were computed using left and right absolute NAA and left
and right NAA/Cr, correlated with the measures of interest for ELS. </p>
<p>The GLM makes an assumption of a linear response model and normal distribution,
so a generalized linear model with 95% confidence limits (CL) was employed to
confirm the interactive results. The latter test allows for response variables
that have error distribution models other than normal distribution (arbitrary
distributions) to be analyzed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2470547018768450">39</xref></sup> All tests were two-tailed. Since the primary hypothesis was that VS/CN
NAA or NAA/Cr concentrations were elevated in VFD subjects versus non-VFD
controls, and four NAA measures were available (left and right, and absolute NAA
and NAA/Cr), data were corrected for four comparisons; p ≤ .0125. Because of the
exploratory nature of the associative relations, significance for these tests
was set at a significance level of p ≤ .05, two-tailed. To protect against type
I errors, an effect size of the interactive term would need to reach twice that
of a large effect size as determined by partial η<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2470547018768450">2</xref></sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2470547018768450">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Akaike information criterion (AIC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2470547018768450">41</xref></sup> is an estimator of the relative quality of statistical models for a given
set of data. Given a variety of models for a data set, AIC provides an estimate
of the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Burnham and Anderson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2470547018768450">42</xref></sup> note that, since AIC corrected (AICc) converges to AIC as N gets large,
AICc—rather than AIC—should generally be employed. To provide a context for the
“goodness of fit” of the AICc, we performed generalized linear models for
bivariate correlations in order to provide a context for the AICc values and to
confirm the key Pearson's correlations, which assume normality of distribution
of the response variable. In addition, Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-2470547018768450">Table 8</xref> provides the AIC, AICc, and

<title>Response to Intruder Stress</title>
<p>Body mass clearly had an influence on VS/CN NAA as a function of rearing (see
above), and therefore, body mass was used as a covariate in the intruder
response analysis. Moreover, as described above, there was a significant
group × body mass interaction in the prediction of VS/CN NAA measures. We
therefore developed a GLM model controlling for body mass as a covariate, used
behavioral response to a human intruder as a continuous predictor variable, and
controlled for the body mass × group interactive effect by introducing a triple
interaction variable—intruder response × body mass × group. Controlling for the
body mass effect (F<sub>(1,10)</sub> = 6.23; p = .032; greater body mass = less
timid), there was a group × behavioral response interactive effect
(F<sub>(1,10)</sub> = 10.57; p = .009; partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.51). The
latter effect was significant when controlling for a triple interactive term
which included body mass (group × body mass ×behavioral response effect

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data of the current study indicate that VFD-reared bonnet macaques exhibit
significantly increased right VS/CN NAA/Cr in comparison to normally reared
controls, an effect that retained significance following correction for multiple
comparisons. Based on the finding of an increased neurotrophic response in mouse
NAcc following social defeat stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2470547018768450">20</xref></sup> NAA measures, shown to be representative of neuronal integrity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2470547018768450">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2470547018768450">18</xref></sup> would be
expected to be relatively elevated in striatum following ELS. To the extent, NAA is
deemed to reflect neuronal integrity, increased NAA in the VS/CN may conceivably
reflect a persistent increase in neurotrophic milieu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2470547018768450">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2470547018768450">43</xref></sup> However, the current study
provides no evidence that the increased NAA in VS/CN is related to an increase in
regional neurotrophic response, for example, BDNF measures. For instance, an
increase in NAA may also reflect increased regional energy metabolism in neuronal mitochondria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2470547018768450">44</xref></sup> However, NAA measures in VS/CN, whether as absolute concentration or as
NAA/Cr, were predicted (or not) by relationships between VFD subjects and stress
markers, generally occurring in the expected direction.</p>
<p>A group × log CSF CRF concentration interactive effect indicated that CRF
concentrations positively predicted right VS/CN absolute NAA, specifically within
the VFD group. The correlation was greater than the corresponding correlation in
non-VFD subjects (the interactive effect size was in excess of threefold greater
than a large effect size (0.14)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2470547018768450">40</xref></sup>). Based on prior studies indicating elevations of CSF CRF concentrations in
VFD versus non-VFD subjects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2470547018768450">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2470547018768450">30</xref></sup> the data suggested that this effect may occur in concert with
VS/CN absolute NAA elevations.</p>
<p>Consistent with a reciprocal relationship between NAcc (increased) versus hippocampal
(decreased) for neurotrophic expression following social adversity in rodents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2470547018768450">25</xref></sup> left hippocampal volume decreases predicted increases in left VS/CN NAA/Cr,
specifically in VFD subjects. Of note, left hippocampal volume in the current cohort
was previously demonstrated to be persistently reduced in VFD versus non-VFD subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2470547018768450">2</xref></sup> That relatively high VS/CN NAA was associated with reduced left hippocampal
volume, specifically in VFD-reared nonhuman primates, potentially provides support
for a relationship of reciprocal neuronal entailing VS/CN and hippocampus.</p>
<p>VFD rearing significantly disrupted a “normal” inverse correlation observed in
non-VFD animals between body weight and VS/CN NAA concentrations bilaterally. The
inverse association between body mass and NAA in non-VFD was significantly
distinguishable from an absence of the relationship observed in VFD subjects (see
Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-2470547018768450">Table 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2470547018768450">Figure 3</xref>). The latter
suggested a loss of association between VS/CN NAA and body mass in VFD. An increase
in neurotrophic effects in the VTA-NAcc pathway in rats causes profound weight loss,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2470547018768450">32</xref></sup> which has been postulated to stem from a hyperdopaminergic (e.g.,
amphetamine-like) state which causes reductions in the rewarding properties of food.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2470547018768450">45</xref></sup> The loss of the relationship, or even frank reversal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2470547018768450">Figure 3</xref>), may set the stage
for the documented increase in BMI in young adult VFD versus non-VFD subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2470547018768450">35</xref></sup> VFD rearing may conceivably interfere with dopaminergic functioning in the
NAcc and an uncoupling in VFD of the NAA spectral signal, and body mass may
underlie, in part, a positive association between early life adversity and both
adult obesity and/or substance abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2470547018768450">46</xref></sup> Supportive of the latter “uncoupling” view, when adjusting for body mass,
left VS/CN absolute NAA was elevated in VFD versus non-VFD subjects, suggesting that
elevations of NAA were not associated with linear reductions in body mass in
VFD-reared subjects. Of note, we have demonstrated in humans that overweight
individuals exhibit reduced hippocampal absolute NAA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2470547018768450">47</xref></sup> but we did not examine concomitant NAA concentrations in striatum.</p>
<p>Finally, right VS/CN absolute NAA in non-VFD was positively associated with timidity
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2470547018768450">Figure 4</xref>). The expected
relationship between high VS/CN NAA and timidity evident in non-VFD subjects was
absent in VFD subjects, again suggesting that VFD rearing may interfere with a
relationship linking an adaptive fear-related behavioral response and VS/CN NAA.</p>
<p>All interactive effects for the four predictor variables (log CRF, left hippocampal
volume, body mass, and timidity response to a human intruder) were significant when
using a generalized linear model, which controls for the possibility of nonnormal
distributions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2470547018768450">Table 3</xref>,
Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-2470547018768450">Table 8</xref>).
Moreover, significant Pearson's correlations were robustly confirmed using the
generalized linear model, and AICc values indicated a “closeness of fit” for each of
the four key correlations.</p>
<p>The current study therefore links ELS to persistent elevations of VS/CN NAA and
demonstrates a positive association between VS/CN NAA and CSF CRF concentrations,
specifically in subjects exposed to early life adversity. An inverse association
between VS/CN NAA with left hippocampal volume in VFD, but not non-VFD, is
consistent with the reciprocal hippocampal/NAcc relationship observed in rodent
social defeat studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2470547018768450">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2470547018768450">4</xref></sup>
and possibly human volumetric studies of MDD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2470547018768450">24</xref></sup> Additional findings demonstrate a loss in VFD of a normative inverse
relationship between VS/CN NAA and body mass. Altered patterns of neuroplasticity in
the VS that disrupt endogenous amphetamine-like effects may be implicated in obesity
and substance use disorders following early life adversity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2470547018768450">48</xref></sup> VFD-reared subjects also exhibit loss of a normative direct correlation
between timidity in response to an intruder and VS/CN NAA, again suggesting a
failure to elicit graded behavioral responses following enhanced neuronal integrity
in the NAcc.</p>
<p>Limitations of the study include the exploratory nature of the analysis, yet the
primary finding of persistent elevations of striatal NAA concentrations in
VFD-reared subjects survived correction for multiple testing. In addition, when
using body mass as a covariate in a more elaborate GLM, it emerges that there are
overall increases in absolute NAA in the VFD versus controls using our ROI of left
VS/CN. Moreover, effect sizes yielded by the interaction analyses are observed to
occur in the direction expected and are generally threefold greater than the level
necessary to generate a large effect size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2470547018768450">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current male macaque sample has been used in previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2470547018768450">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2470547018768450">30</xref></sup> The findings require
replication in other male bonnet macaque samples as well as rhesus macaque and
female samples generally. However, positive findings arising from multiple
stress-related biological systems in the same sample may well indicate an array of
coordinated parallel alterations occurring in tandem. We are, however, not aware of
any study that provides a precedent for <sup>1</sup>H-MRSI studies of the VS
following ELS.</p>
<p>Frye et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2470547018768450">49</xref></sup> reported decreased NAA and NAA/Cr in a voxel containing “basal ganglia” in
bipolar disorder patients. Of note, the number of hospitalizations for manic
episodes correlated inversely with NAA. The latter finding emphasizes that the VFD
model provides insights into the effects of ELS without overlying confounds of
subsequent psychopathologies, treatments, and/or substances of abuse.</p>
<p>Therefore, high NAA in VS/CN may represent persistent alterations in the neuronal
integrity response to the VFD form of aversive early life experience. However,
direct evidence linking high NAA with an increased neurotrophic milieu in VS/CN is
lacking. That high VS/CN NAA interfaces in the expected direction with other ELS
markers—decreased hippocampal volume and increased CSF CRF concentrations—depicts a
phenotype entailing parallel long-term alterations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2470547018768450">8</xref></sup> presumably maintained by epigenetic modifications. The findings reported
herein may provide a catalyst for further studies in humans, nonhuman primates, and
other species regarding a reciprocal hippocampal/NAcc relationship in affective
disorders.</p>
