<title>Background/Aims</title>
<p>The effects of lncRNA-NORAD/mir-520a-3p on proliferation and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were studied, and its potential molecular mechanism was discussed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of lncRNA NORAD and miR-520a-3p in non-small cell lung cancer tissues and cell lines. CCK-8 method and Transwell test were used to identify the effects of lncRNA NORAD on the proliferation and invasion in NSCLC. Target gene prediction and screening and luciferase reporter assay was used to verify downstream target genes of lncRNA NORAD. The expressions of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR proteins were detected by Western blot.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Compared with normal tissues and cells, the expressions of lncRNA NORAD in cancer tissues and cells were significantly higher. Compared with normal cells, the expression of miR-520a-3p in cells was considerably lower. LncRNA NORAD could accelerate the growth and metastasis of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase reporter assay results indicated that miR-520a-3p was a downstream target gene of lncRNA NORAD. Further findings showed that lncRNA NORAD might bind to miR-520a-3p, thereby affecting the PI3k/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>LncRNA NORAD can regulate the proliferation of NSCLC by regulating miR-520a-3p/PI3k/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thus promoting the occurrence and development of NSCLC.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Lung cancer has high morbidity and mortality, poor prognosis, which poses a severe threat to human health and life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref> According to different degrees of differentiation and morphological characteristics, lung cancer is divided into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in which NSCLC accounts for about 85% of all lung cancer patients. When clinical symptoms appear, it has developed to the middle and late stage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref> Therefore, finding useful and sensitive early diagnostic indicators, therapeutic evaluation indicators, drug resistance monitoring indicators. Prognostic evaluation indicators has become the main direction of lung cancer. This mainly depends on molecular biology and through the study of lung cancer in the occurrence, development, invasion, metastasis, and other transformation processes of detailed mechanisms.</p>
<p>Current studies have shown that the occurrence and development of lung cancer are related to abnormal gene expression and regulatory function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref> It was found that lncRNAs have higher intracellular transcription ratio than miRNA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref> In the development of tumors, lncRNAs can regulate cancer cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref> Accumulative evidence shows that lncRNA is involved in the progression of NSCLC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref> It was shown that lncRNA CCAT2 is up-regulated in NSCLC, and silencing of lncRNA CCAT2 by siRNA inhibits proliferation of NSCLC cell lines in vitro.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref> The current study has found that lncRNA NORAD can participate in the regulation of the occurrence and development of a variety of cancers, including proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, metabolism, epithelial-mesenchymal transition etc. It could thereby inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref> However, there are few studies on lncRNA NORAD in NSCLC.</p>
<p>In recent years, the regulatory relationship of lncRNA-miRNAs is currently a research hotspot. Abnormal expression of small RNAs is associated with lung cancer. Recently, it has been reported that miR-520a-3p can inhibit apoptosis of NSCLC. It has been found that miRNA-520a-3p can inhibit proliferation and reverse gefitinib resistance by targeting HOXD8 and miRNA-520a-3p in non-small cell lung cancer cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref> We will also explore the mechanism of the role of the lncRNA NORAD/miR-520a-3p axis in promoting the development of NSCLC. It will provide a reliable basis for clinical diagnosis and targeted therapy of NSCLC.</p>

Next, the wild type NORAD transcript or its mutation sequence (a mutant in the miR-520a-3p binding site) was cloned into a luciferase reporter construct and then transiently co-transfected into cells with miR-520a-3p or a negative control mimic (miR-NC). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4B</xref>, miR-520a-3p was able to significantly inhibit luciferase activity in wild-type construct transfected A549 cells but did not affect luciferase activity in cells transfected with mutant constructs (P &lt; 0.01).<fig fig-type="figure" id="F0004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>NORAD interacted with miR-520a-3p.

<p>As a result, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4C</xref>, endogenous NORAD was significantly increased in A549 cells transfected with miR-520a-3p mimics compared with that in the control group. Furthermore, wild-type NORAD significantly reduced miR-520a-3p expression in H1299 cells compared with that in the control group but did not affect miR-520a-3p expression in cells transfected with the mutant construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4D</xref>) (p &lt; 0.01). Compared with the control group, the NORAD knockdown was able to significantly up-regulate the level of miR-520a-3p in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4E</xref>). The result indicated that NORAD can target miR-520a-3p by targeting and that NORAD can act as a ceRNA.</p>

<title>NORAD Positively Regulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR via Sponging miR-520</title>
<p>Whether the NORAD/miR520 can regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was analyzed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5A</xref>, wild-type NORAD increased expression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-associated protein compared with that in the control group and did not affect the expression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins in NORAD mutant-transfected cells. The expression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins was not significantly affected by the mimic of miR-520a-3p. The co-transfection of NORAD with mimic microRNA-520 reversed the expression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins in wild-type NORAD. Compared with the control group, the NORAD silencing group had no significant effect on the expression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins, and anti-miR-520 significantly increased the expression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins. Anti-miR-520 NORAD silencing co-transfection reversed the expression of the anti-miR-520 against the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-associated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5B</xref>). The above results indicated that NORAD could activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via the sponge miR-520.<fig fig-type="figure" id="F0005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>NORAD regulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR by targeting miR-520.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Lung cancer is a highly malignant tumor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref> The mortality of lung cancer is at the forefront of all kinds of malignant tumors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref> Overall, the current treatment of lung cancer is not satisfactory. The main reason is that the specific pathogenesis of lung cancer is not clear. At the same time, there is a lack of useful, sensitive and reproducible early diagnostic indicators, therapeutic evaluation indicators, drug resistance monitoring indicators, and prognostic evaluation indicators.</p>
<p>As a significant component of non-coding protein genes, lncRNA plays a critical role in lung cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref> More and more evidence has showed that lncRNA is involved in the progress of the NSCLC. The study of tumor-suppressing lncRNA provides a new way to elucidate the pathogenesis and development of NSCLC and offers a unique platform for seeking more effective treatment of NSCLC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref> The primary function of NORAD is to regulate cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell aging. In tumors, ectopic expression of NORAD reduces tumor cell doubling time. This study found that the expression level of NORAD in tumor tissues and cell lines was significantly higher, indicating that NORAD acted as an oncogene.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref> In addition, the study showed that after NORAD silencing in vivo and in vitro and, the cell proliferation rate and the number of cell invasion and migration were significantly lower. The volume of tumors and the number of lung metastases were also significantly reduced in mice. These results indicated that NORAD had important implications for NSCLC.</p>
<p>Studies have found that some lncRNA can act as ceRNA and play a role in disease through mi RNA-m RNA regulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref> Highly expressed lncRNA is an essential member of ceRNA, which plays an oncogene role in NSCLC cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref> The expression of mi RNA is related to the occurrence of many major diseases such as tumors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref> In the NSCLC study, many down-regulated mi RNAs have been shown to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">30</xref> This study found that the expression of miR-520a-3p was significantly down-regulation in NSCLC cell lines, and there was a negative correlation between miR-520a-3p and NORAD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">31</xref> MiR-520a-3p was selected as the target gene of NORAD through the database. Luciferase results indicated that NORAD regulated its expression by targeting the 3ʹUTR of the NORAD gene. Moreover, wild-type NORAD WT reduced miR-520 expression in H1299 cells, while NORAD knockdown up-regulated miR-520 levels in A549 cells. These results indicated that NORAD and miR-520 could bind to each other and play a role as ceRNA.PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is one of the critical signal transduction pathways in cells. PI3K/Akt/mTOR can control important cellular biological processes in tumorigenesis and development by affecting the activation of downstream effector molecules.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">32</xref> Studies have found that sustained Akt activation and mTOR phosphorylation were found in 51% of NSCLC patient samples and 74% of NSCLC cell lines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">33</xref> Previous studies demonstrated that miR-3188 interacts with mTOR to inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation through an mTOR-p-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, miRNA/PI3K/Akt/mTOR might be a potential target for the treatment of NSCLC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">34</xref> This study found that NORAD overexpression up-regulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-associated protein levels, and co-transfection with miR-520 mimics can reverse this effect. The results of NORAD overexpression after NORAD silencing were contrary. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-520 or PI3K/AKT/mTOR overexpression reversed the impact of NORAD overexpression on cell proliferation. The above results indicated that NORAD could promote NSCLC progression through miR-520-PI3K/AKT/mTOR.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>NORAD promoted cell proliferation and enhanced cell invasion and migration by directly targeting the miR-520-PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, which provided experimental evidence for the clinical prognosis of the tumor and further targeted intervention therapy.</p>
