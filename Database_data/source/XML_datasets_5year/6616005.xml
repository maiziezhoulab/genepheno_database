<abstract id="ABS1">
<p id="P1">The short-term effects of alcohol on gene expression in brain tissue
cannot directly be studied in humans. Because neuroimmune signaling is altered
by alcohol, immune cells are a logical, accessible choice to study and might
provide biomarkers. RNAseq was used to study the effects of 48 h exposure to
ethanol on lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 20 alcoholics and 20
controls.</p>
<p id="P2">Ethanol exposure resulted in differential expression of 4,456 of the
12,503 genes detectably expressed in the LCLs (FDR ≤ 0.05); 52% of these
showed increased expression. Cells from alcoholics and controls responded
similarly. The genes whose expression changed fell into many pathways:
NFκB, neuroinflammation, IL6, IL2, IL8, and dendritic cell maturation
pathways were activated, consistent with increased signaling by NFκB,
TNF, IL1, IL4, IL18, TLR4, and LPS. Signaling by Interferons A and B decreased,
as did EIF2 signaling, phospholipase C signaling and Glycolysis.</p>
<p id="P3">Baseline gene expression patterns were similar in LCLs from alcoholics
and controls. At relaxed stringency (p&lt;0.05), 465 genes differed, 230 of
which were also affected by ethanol. There was a suggestion of compensation
because baseline differences (no ethanol) were in the opposite direction of
differences due to ethanol exposure in 78% of these genes. Pathways with IL8,
phospholipase C, and α-adrenergic signaling were significant. The pattern
of expression was consistent with increased signaling by several cytokines
including interferons, TLR2 and TLR3 in alcoholics. Expression of genes in the
cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, including the rate-limiting enzyme HMGCR, was
lower in alcoholics.</p>
<p id="P4">LCLs show many effects of ethanol exposure, some of which might provide
biomarkers for alcohol use disorders. Identifying genes and pathways altered by
ethanol can aid in interpreting which genes within loci identified by GWAS might
play functional roles.</p>
