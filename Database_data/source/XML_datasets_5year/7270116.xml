<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">The neurotrophin Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is widely expressed in the mammalian brain and signals via the Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) to regulate neuronal differentiation and survival, synapse formation and activity-dependent changes in synapse structure and function. <italic>Bdnf</italic> and <italic>TrkB</italic> null mice are embryonically lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. <italic>Bdnf</italic> haplo-insufficient mice and mice in which <italic>Bdnf</italic> is deleted in the postnatal brain, survive and exhibit hyperactivity, impaired pain sensation, increased food intake and weight gain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In humans, deletions encompassing the <italic>BDNF</italic> gene on chromosome 11p.12.3 and very rare loss of function coding variants in <italic>TrkB</italic> have been reported in individuals with speech and language delay, hyperphagia and severe obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">BDNF is synthesised as a precursor protein, pre-pro-BDNF, which is converted into pro-BDNF by removal of the signal peptide and packaged into vesicles before being transported distally to dendrites or axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Only once the protein is destined for secretion, is pro-BDNF converted to mature BDNF through proteolytic cleavage by furin and other proprotein convertases in the trans-Golgi network or secretory vesicles, releasing mature BDNF from the pro-domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Processing of pro-BDNF and secretion are thought to occur almost simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The regulated equilibrium between pro-BDNF and mature BDNF appears to be physiologically relevant as a hippocampus-specific deletion of the serine protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which is involved in the cleavage of pro-BDNF to BDNF extracellularly, increases depression and anxiety-like behaviour in adult mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Here we functionally characterise a rare coding variant in <italic>BDNF</italic> and several rare variants in <italic>TrkB</italic> recently identified using exome sequencing and targeted sequencing of people with severe obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We use these human variants as tools with which to explore the consequences of impaired BDNF-TrkB signalling on dendritic spine structure and function, which forms the neural substrate for learning and memory in hippocampal neurons.</p>

<title>A rare coding variant in BDNF disrupts processing of pro-BDNF</title>
<p id="Par5">While several common variants in BDNF exist (including the widely studied variant p.V66M; variant allele frequency: 19%), to date, no rare coding variants in this gene have been reported. Here, we identified a single heterozygous missense variant in BDNF (p.E183K) in a 15 year old girl with severe obesity and moderately severe learning difficulties (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). This variant was not reported in publically available databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/">http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/</ext-link>); it was inherited from her father (BMI 36 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who also had learning difficulties. We performed a number of experiments to test whether this variant had functional consequences in cells.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Functional characterisation of a rare coding variant in BDNF (E183K). (<bold>A</bold>). Schematic representation of BDNF protein with the common variant (V66M) and rare variant (E183K) indicated. (<bold>B</bold>). PC12 cells were transfected with WT (top)/E183K (bottom) BDNF; neurite length was measured by fluorescence microscopy. Left panel: representative images from 3 experiments. Scale bar: 50 μm. Average neurite length per nucleus is shown (right panel; data point = mean of replicate); *p &lt; 0.05, student’s t-test. (<bold>C</bold>). WT/mutant BDNF was transfected into PC12 cells and protein quantified by Western blot in cell lysate (left) and growth medium (right) using an antibody against a c-terminally fused myc-tag. (<bold>D</bold>). Cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons were co-transfected with RFP-tagged (red) WT BDNF and ClFP-tagged (green) WT BDNF (top image panel), or RFP-tagged WT and ClFP-tagged mutant (E183K) BDNF (bottom image panel). Co-localisation of the proteins was measured by fluorescent confocal microscopy in axons (shown here) and dendrites, and is presented as proportion of vesicles containing both (combined) or only one of the tagged proteins (center panel; data point = one axon).

WT/mutant BDNF expressed in HEK293 cells was immunoprecipitated, followed by Furin-mediated protein cleavage. The cleavage products were analysed by Western blot. (<bold>F</bold>). WT/mutant BDNF were transfected into PC12 cells and depolarisation-dependent BDNF secretion triggered by addition of KCl. Amounts of secreted BDNF were measured by Western blotting. (<bold>G</bold>).

<p id="Par6">While mature BDNF can be secreted constitutively, it is preferentially released via a tightly controlled regulated pathway driven by activity-dependent depolarisation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We first tested whether the E183K BDNF variant had any functional impact on BDNF globally, by transfecting wild-type (WT) and mutant BDNF into PC12 cells, which stably express human TrkB (PC12<sup>TrkB</sup>), followed by measurement of neurite outgrowth 48 hours later. We found that mutant BDNF was significantly impaired in its ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth compared to WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>, n = 4, p &lt; 0.05), demonstrating that the E183K substitution causes a loss-of-function. Expression levels of WT and E183K pro-BDNF in cell lysates were comparable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C</xref>). To test if packaging of the protein into vesicles or distal trafficking might be affected, primary rat hippocampal neurons were co-transfected with differentially labeled WT and E183K mutant BDNF. After 48 hours, protein localisation was measured using confocal-fluorescent microscopy and found to be strongly overlapping in dendrites and axons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1D</xref>), while vesicular density was reduced when WT and mutant constructs were co-expressed (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1A, n</xref> = 3, p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that although packaging of the mutant pro-BDNF into vesicles is reduced, trafficking of E183K BDNF to the distal parts of the neuron can occur. We next tested proteolytic cleavage of mutant pro-BDNF by capturing epitope-tagged BDNF on antibody-coated beads, followed by incubation with purified, recombinant furin. We found that, while WT pro-BDNF was efficiently processed to the mature form, E183K disrupted pro-BDNF processing by the protease (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1E</xref>). Thus defective processing of the pro-form is the most likely explanation for the significantly reduced levels of mature mutant vs WT BDNF detected in cell lysates, and likely a contributing factor to the same observation in cell culture medium, where defective secretion may also play a role (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C</xref>). It is not clear how the mutation at position 183 could disrupt furin-mediated cleavage at position 128. However, it is conceivable that in the tertiary structure of the pro-peptide those two positions are proximal to each other (no structural data are available). Next, we tested regulated secretion of WT vs mutant BDNF in PC12 cells following depolarisation by potassium chloride (90 mM KCl). KCl treatment led to the detection of increased amounts of immature and mature BDNF in the medium of cells transfected with WT - but not with mutant - BDNF, thus confirming that the E183K variant impairs regulated BDNF secretion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1F</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par7">Once secreted, mature BDNF binds with high affinity to TrkB and with much lower affinity to the p75 neurotrophin receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Upon ligand binding, TrkB auto-phosphorylates several tyrosine residues within its tyrosine kinase domain to initiate signalling via the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Phospholipase C (PLC)-γ pathways. Signalling via PLCγ and PI3K regulates synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival respectively, while MAPK promotes neuronal maturation and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We explored the effect of WT/E183K BDNF on downstream signalling and neurite outgrowth by applying chemically synthesized mature WT/E183K BDNF to PC12<sup>TrkB</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1B</xref>). We observed no significant difference in the activation of any of the three major signalling pathways downstream of TrkB (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1C</xref>) or in the mutant’s ability to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12<sup>TrkB</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1G</xref>). Furthermore, in human stem-cell derived hypothalamic POMC neurons, cells which are directly involved in energy homeostasis, WT and mutant BDNF-mediated neurite outgrowth and cellular migration were comparable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1H</xref>, S1D). In conclusion, the E183K substitution has no functional consequences on the mature peptide, but impairs processing, trafficking and secretion of the pro-hormone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B,C,D</xref>).</p>

<title>Rare variants in NTRK2 which encodes TrkB disrupt signalling and neurite outgrowth</title>
<p id="Par8">We next functionally characterised seven missense variants in TrkB (encoded by the <italic>NTRK2</italic> gene) as well as three previously reported variants (Y722C, P660L, T821A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. All variants were found in heterozygous form; one variant (R715Q) was found in 2 unrelated individuals (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). TrkB is composed of 821 amino acid residues that encode a signal peptide, two cysteine-rich clusters, a leucine-rich motif, two immunoglobulin-like C2-type motifs, a transmembrane region and the canonical tyrosine kinase domain, which is required for signalling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>). Of the ten variants investigated, eight lie in the tyrosine kinase domain, one at the very c-terminal end of the protein, and one in the extracellular domain of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>). None of the TrkB variants reduced protein expression (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2A</xref>). We transiently transfected PC12 cells (which do not endogenously express TrkB) with WT/mutant TrkB. After stimulation with recombinant BDNF, cells were lysed and phosphorylation of the three downstream effectors (PLCγ, AKT, ERK) measured using Western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref>). All five of the newly identified kinase domain variants resulted in significantly impaired signalling through all three pathways (n = 4, p &lt; 0.05). The variants in the extracellular domain (P204H) and at the C-terminus (P831L) did not affect function in these assays. The same five mutants also led to a significant reduction in neurite outgrowth, with the level of impairment reflecting the extent of reduced signalling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2C</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2B, n</xref> = 3, p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, all variants in the kinase domain – with the exception of the previously reported P660L – led to significantly diminished cell survival under serum starved conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2C</xref>; n = 3, p &lt; 0.05). Taken together, the five newly identified TrkB kinase domain variants result in a significant loss-of-function in cells. Of interest, four of those five variants (R691H, R696K, R715Q, R715W) affect Arginine residues, which are situated at the active site of the kinase domain and likely play a role in catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The fifth variant (S714F), has the most disruptive effect of all mutations tested here, and falls immediately adjacent to the highly conserved DFG motif, which is indispensable for kinase activity.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Functional characterisation of TrkB mutants.

<title>Loss of function TrkB variants affect glutamatergic synaptogenesis</title>
<p id="Par9">BDNF and TrkB are highly expressed in areas of the brain involved in learning and memory including the hippocampus. BDNF expression within the developing hippocampus also coincides with a period of rapid glutamatergic synaptogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Dendritic spines are the main sites of excitatory synaptic input for neurons; as such factors that affect their density and morphology can alter synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Several forms of learning can increase the number of dendritic spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, for example, spatial learning is associated with an increase in hippocampal spine densities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, whereas aging leads to a decline in hippocampal spine densities. Experiments in hippocampal neurons have shown that activity-driven local synthesis and release of mature BDNF controls dendritic spine density and morphology, long-term potentiation and the plasticity of dendritic spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. To test the effects of human TrkB variants on these processes, we isolated primary neurons from rat hippocampus and tested BDNF’s ability to promote the formation of dendritic spines following transfection with either WT or mutant TrkB. A dendritic spine can change its shape within a short time from a thin spine with a small head and a narrow neck (filopodia; the least developed) to a dendritic spine with a large head and a narrow neck (mushroom spines; the most developed) as well as ‘stubby’ spines, which display a transitional morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. To investigate the ability of TrkB mutants to support BDNF stimulated spinogenesis, we transfected primary rat hippocampal neurons, which endogenously express TrkB, with various recombinant wt or mutant human TrkB receptor mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). BDNF treatment resulted in a selective increase in mushroom spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>, n = 4, p &lt; 0.01), but had no significant effect on the density of filopodia or stubby spines, suggesting that TrkB signaling is involved in the maturation process to mushroom spines. Overexpression of WT human TrkB had no significant effect on the density of mushroom spines, however expression of most of the kinase domain mutants (P660L, R691H, R696K, S714F, R715Q and R715W) completely abolished the spine-stimulatory effect of BDNF. Interestingly, this observation is strongly indicative of a dominant-negative effect exerted by the mutant receptor over the endogenous WT receptor in these neurons, a hypothesis that will require additional experiments to test. These findings align with work from Rauskolb and colleagues who found that a decrease in mature BDNF in the rodent hippocampus reduces mature mushroom type spines and increases less stable thin spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. An inhibition in the number of mature mushroom shaped dendritic spines strongly suggests that these mutants suppress the ability of BDNF to stimulate synaptogenesis. To test whether the changes were associated with functional changes, we investigated the effect of TrkB mutants on BDNF-stimulated increases in miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSC). We found that BDNF increased mEPSC frequency in either control (vector only) transfected neurons or neurons transfected with WT TrkB, (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3, n</xref> = 3, p &lt; 0.01), but did not affect amplitude (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref>). Taken together with the increase in spines, this suggests BDNF-TrkB signaling increases functional synapses, as has been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Functional characterisation of TrkB mutants in neurons. (<bold>A</bold>). Primary dissociated hippocampal neurons were transfected with WT/mutant TrkB alongside Clover fluorescent protein (ClFP)-tagged actin and stimulated with either vehicle or recombinant BDNF.

<p id="Par10">We then went on to test the effect of a subset of TrkB variants on mEPSC frequency and found that the loss-of-function TrkB variant S714F abolished the BDNF-stimulated increase in mEPSC frequency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>, S3). Interestingly, P204H and T821A also blocked, while P831L greatly attenuated, BDNF’s effect to increase mEPSC frequency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>). This is in contrast to their lack of effect on spine number suggesting these mutants affect the maturation of spines into functional synapses, rather than spine formation. Similar to the effect on dendritic spines described above, the mutants had a dominant negative effect, as the ability of endogenous TrkB to increase mEPSC frequency was abolished by overexpression of the mutants. BDNF did not significantly change the amplitude of the mEPSCs following transfection of any of the TrkB mutations compared to their own controls (when standardised relative to the unstimulated control group, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref>). However, the average amplitude of mEPSCs was very slightly, but significantly, higher in neurons expressing the T821A mutation compared to control neurons, suggesting that this mutation may alter the basal expression or function of AMPA receptors (AMPA: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref>, n = 3, p &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p id="Par11">To further test if the P204H, S714F, T821A, and P831L mutations change spine maturation and synapse formation, we next analysed synaptic structure and Glutamate Receptor 1 (GluR1) surface expression. We first addressed whether these mutants altered the formation of “morphological” synapses, i.e. if the dendritic spines failed to make connections with presynaptic axonal terminals. We transfected hippocampal neurons with the various mutant TrkBs and ClFP-Actin to identify mature dendritic spines (mushroom and stubby). We then stained for vesicular Glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) to identify glutamatergic presynaptic termini and determined pre- and post-synaptic correlation. Expression of the mutants had no apparent effect on the proportion of dendritic spines that had an associated presynaptic terminal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3D</xref>), with pre- and post-synaptic correlation ≈ 95% under both control and BDNF-stimulated conditions. This suggests that the mutations in the TrkB receptor do not alter the recruitment of the presynaptic terminals to dendritic spines. As the size of the dendritic spine has been associated with synaptic efficacy, we next determined the effect of these mutants on the size distribution of dendritic spines (mushroom and stubby). As before, mutant TrkBs were expressed with ClFP-actin, then the area of the dendritic spine was measured. We found that BDNF stimulation significantly increased the area of the dendritic spine compared to untreated conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>, n = 3, p &lt; 2.2*10<sup>−16</sup>). Interestingly, expression of the four TrkB mutants tested significantly reduced the ability of BDNF to increase overall spine size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>, n = 3, p &lt; 0.001), as well as average spine size (unstimulated: 1.533 ± 0.047 μm<sup>2</sup>, BDNF: 2.238 ± 0.053 μm<sup>2</sup>), P204H (unstimulated: 1.152 ± 0.036 μm<sup>2</sup>, BDNF: 1.740 ± 0.101 μm<sup>2</sup>), S714F (unstimulated: 1.634 ± 0.59 μm<sup>2</sup>, BDNF: 1.851 ± 0.119 μm<sup>2</sup>), T821A (unstimulated: 1.714 ± 0.052 μm<sup>2</sup>, BDNF: 1.677 ± 0.677 μm<sup>2</sup>), P831L (unstimulated: 1.712 ± 0.052 μm<sup>2</sup>, BDNF: 1.699 ± 0.119 μm<sup>2</sup>); n = 3 independent cultures, 14-16 neurons analysed, 675–1180 spines/data point). To further characterise the dendritic spines, we also examined the expression of the postsynaptic and AMPA-GluR1 anchoring protein PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein 95). Under both unstimulated and BDNF stimulated conditions ≈95% of dendritic spines (mushroom and stubby) of control neurons were positive for PSD-95 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). In contrast, only ≈30% of dendritic spines were positive for PSD-95 in neurons expressing the TrkB mutants, P294H S714F, T821A and P831L (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). Moreover, the size of the spine area covered by PSD-95 staining was significantly increased by BDNF treatment in control neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4B</xref>, n = 3, p = 3*10<sup>–15</sup>), an effect that was diminished when expressing any of the four TrkB mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4B</xref>, n = 3, p &lt; 2.2*10<sup>−16</sup>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Effects of TrkB mutants of on dendritic spine maturation.

To determine the effects of TrkB mutants on dendritic spines size, rat hippocampal neurons - transiently transfected with Clover fluorescent protein-actin and WT/mutant TrkB - were analysed for spine area before (−) and after (+) recombinant BDNF on DIV11. Representative images are shown in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref> and 4C (images used for quantification).

Representative images are shown (left-hand panel) and the percentage of dendritic spines (mushroom and stubby) positive for surface GluR1 staining is shown in the right-hand panel. In control, stimulation with BDNF significantly (*p &lt; 0.01, student’s t-test ± SEM) increases GluR1 staining in spines, but shows the reverse effect (i.e. decrease) in 3 of the 4 mutants tested (<sup>#</sup>p &lt; 0.05, student’s t-test ± SEM).</p></caption><graphic id="d30e1376" xlink:href="41598_2020_65531_Fig4_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par12">Synaptic efficacy can also be influenced by the amount of surface expressed AMPA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. PSD-95 is a key scaffolding molecule for AMPA receptors, especially those containing GluR1 subunits, and BDNF regulates the trafficking of the AMPA glutamate receptor in hippocampal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. We therefore examined the expression of surface expressed GluR1. Under control conditions ≈55% of dendritic spines were positive for GluR1. BDNF stimulation increased this to ≈87% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4D</xref>, n = 4, p &lt; 0.01). Expression of mutant TrkB receptors blocked the BDNF-induced increases in the number of dendritic spines positive for GluR1. In fact, the proportion of dendritic spines positive for GluR1 actually decreased upon BDNF-treatment in neurons expressing P204H, T821A and P831L (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4D</xref>, n = 3, p &lt; 0.05). This apparent decrease is most likely due to BDNF increasing spinogenesis in the presence of those TrkB mutants, but these newly formed spines do not express surface GluR1s (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). Taken together our data support the conclusion that expression of P204H, T821A and P831L TrkB does not block the initial event of spinogenesis, e.g. spine formation, but rather blocks spine maturation, GluR1 membrane insertion and functionality.</p>

<title>BDNF and TrkB variant carriers exhibit hyperactivity, maladaptive behaviours and impaired short-term memory</title>
<p id="Par13">We sought to obtain clinical data on variant carriers where possible. In addition to severe obesity, variant carriers exhibited a spectrum of learning difficulties, impaired short-term memory, hyperactivity, repetitive behaviours often considered to be autistic-like, fearlessness and in some cases aggression (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). Some of these neurobehavioural phenotypes as well as increased locomotor activity have been observed in animal models of <italic>Bdnf/Trkb</italic> disruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Whilst playing an important developmental role, deletion of this pathway in mature mice also leads to impaired function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, in keeping with BDNF’s role in neuronal maintenance and cell survival shown here.</p>
<p id="Par14">In summary, we demonstrate that loss of function human variants in BDNF/TrkB are associated with a spectrum of neurobehavioural phenotypes and affect BDNF-stimulated synaptogenesis, particularly maturation of a functional synapse, in hippocampal neurons. By studying rare variants that caused a severe loss of function, we were able to demonstrate effects on signalling, neurite outgrowth and glutamatergic synapse formation and function. The effects we observe with rare, highly penetrant variants in BDNF and TrkB support the view that more common genetic variants that have a modest effect on BDNF/TrkB secretion or signalling may contribute to a spectrum of neurobehavioural phenotypes by affecting hippocampal synaptogenesis. A common variant in BDNF (V66M), found in heterozygous form in approximately 20% of the population, has been shown to reduce activity-dependent secretion of mature BDNF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In human experimental studies, V66M BDNF heterozygous carriers have episodic and long-term memory deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, reduced hippocampal blood flow during memory tasks and reduced hippocampal volumes measured by MRI. In larger association studies, V66M has been associated with a number of traits and neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

<title>Protein refolding and purification</title>
<p id="Par27">BDNF was refolded from inclusion bodies following a modified protocol used for pro-activin A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Cell pellet from 1 L of bacterial culture was suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT (lysis buffer) with 0.5% (v/v) Triton-X 100 and lysed using the Emulsiflex C5 emulsiflier (Avestin, USA). The lysate was incubated with DNaseI for 20 min at room temperature to digest genomic DNA before centrifugation at 15,000 g for 20 min to pellet the insoluble inclusion bodies containing BDNF. The inclusion bodies were washed in lysis buffer with i) 0.5% Triton X-100, ii) with 1 M NaCl, and iii) with lysis buffer only. Purified inclusion bodies were re-suspended in 5 ml of 100 mM neutralized TCEP and protein denatured by addition of 15 ml of 8 M guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA. The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min and soluble BDNF was exchanged into 6 M urea and 20 mM hydrochloric acid. Refolding was started by adding the denatured BDNF into cold solution of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 M pyridinium propyl sulfobetaine, 250 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM cystine and 2 mM cysteine with vigorous stirring. The refolding solution was kept at 7 days at 4 °C, after which it was clarified by filtering and loaded onto Source 30 S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA), equilibrated with 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient to 1 M NaCl in 30 column volumes and peak fractions containing BDNF pooled. The sample was acidified and purified further by reverse-phase chromatography (RPC) using HiChrom-5C8-25002 column (Hichrom, UK) equilibrated in 10% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and sample eluted with a gradient of increasing acetonitrile. Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of reduced and non-reduced samples and correct mass (assuming fully disulfide-linked protein) confirmed by LC-MS analysis. Pure protein was dried under vacuum and stored at −80 °C.</p>

<title>Imaging acquisition</title>
<p id="Par31">Monolayer and aggregates were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope (Zeiss AG, Germany), or on an INCell Analyser 2200 automated microscope (GE Healthcare, USA). Image analysis was performed on ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). For neurite length measurements, neurites from individual, spatially isolated POMC neurons were traced in the POMC and Tuj1 channels using the Freehand line and then measure using the measurement tools. Total neurite lengths were then determined by summing the lengths of neurites for each neuron. For BDNF-induced POMC neuron migration POMC-positive cells outside the aggregate body - defined for each aggregate individually by DAPI, MAP2 and Tuj1 expression - were counted and normalised to area.</p>

<title>Hippocampal Cell Culture Preparation and transfection</title>
<p id="Par33">Hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Primary hippocampal cultures were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, USA). Native media was collect before transfection and replaced with warm growth media.

<title>Hippocampal Spine Quantification</title>
<p id="Par34">Hippocampal cultures were transfected with designated DNA constructs and Clover-βactin to allow for visualisation of dendritic spine density and morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Confocal fluorescent images were obtained using the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, USA) and a Leica DMI6000 SD confocal microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk. Dendritic spine and filopodia density was measured on primary and secondary dendrites at a distance of at least 100 μm from the soma. Two to five dendrites, each at least 50 μm in length, from at least 25 neurons were analysed for each data point reported. Each experiment was repeated at least three times using independent culture preparations. Dendrite length was determined using ImageJ 1.41 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and the neurite tracing program Neuron J<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

<title>BDNF vesicle co-localization and density measurements</title>
<p id="Par35">Hippocampal neurons were transfected as described above with soluble Blue Flourescent Protein (BFP) to visualise dendrites and axons and either RFP or GFP tagged wtBDNF or E183K-BDNF. Confocal fluorescent images were obtained as in 2.7. High resolution images of dendritic processes where obtained from primary and secondary dendrites at a distance of at least 100 μm from the soma. Two to five dendrites, each at least 50 μm in length were analysed. High resolution images of axon processes where obtained 1000 μm from the soma. Two to five axon segments, each at least 50 μm in length were analysed. 600–1000 vesicles were analysed for wt-BDNF and mutant-BDNF vesicle co-localisation. Axonal and dendritic vesicle density was calculated from at least 25 neurons from three independent cultures.</p>

<title>Whole-Cell Recordings</title>
<p id="Par36">Patch-clamp experiments were performed - as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> - on Clover-βactin-transfected cultured hippocampal neurons with PBS (vehicle control) or BDNF pretreatment. Recordings were made on DIV10 to DIV11. The culture medium was exchanged by an extracellular solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM glucose, and 5 mM HEPES; pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH, and osmolality was adjusted to 307–310 mOsM. Cultures were allowed to equilibrate in a recording chamber mounted on an inverted microscope (IX-71; Olympus Optical) for 30 min before recording. Transfected cells were visualised with fluorescence (Olympus Optical). Recording pipettes were pulled (P-97 Flaming/Brown micropipette puller; Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) from standard-wall borosilicate glass without filament (o.d. = 1.5 mm; Sutter Instrument Company). The pipette-to-bath d.c. resistance of patch electrodes ranged from 4.0 to 5.2 MΩ, and they were filled with an internal solution of the following composition: 25 mM CsCl, 100 mM CsCH3O3S, 10 mM phospho-creatine, 0.4 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM Mg-ATP, and 0.04 mM Na-GTP; pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH, and osmolality was adjusted to 296 to 300 mOsM. Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were isolated pharmacologically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> by blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with picrotoxin (100 μM; Sigma-Aldrich), blocking glycine receptors with strychnine (1 μM; Sigma-Aldrich), and blocking action potential generation with tetrodotoxin (500 nM; Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO). Recordings were obtained using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Analog signals were low-pass Bessel-filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz through a Digidata 1440 A interface (Molecular Devices), and stored in a computer using Clampex 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). The membrane potential was held at -70 mV at room temperature (25 °C) during a period of 0.5 to 2 h after removal of the culture from the incubator. Liquid junction potentials were not corrected. Data analysis was performed using Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices) and Mini-Analysis 6.0 software (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). The criteria for a successful recording included an electrical resistance of the seal between the outside surface of the recording pipette and the attached cell &gt;2 GΩ and neuron input resistance &gt;240 MΩ. The mEPSCs had a 5-min recording time.</p>
