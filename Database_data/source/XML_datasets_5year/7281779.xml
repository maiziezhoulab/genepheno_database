<p>Neuronal development is a complex
multistep process that shapes
neurons by progressing though several typical stages, including axon
outgrowth, dendrite formation, and synaptogenesis. Knowledge of the
mechanisms of neuronal development is mostly derived from the study
of animal models. Advances in stem cell technology now enable us to
generate neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
Here we provide a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic signature
of human iPSC-derived neurons, i.e., iPSC-derived induced glutamatergic
neurons and iPSC-derived motor neurons, throughout neuronal differentiation.
Tandem mass tag 10-plex labeling was carried out to perform proteomic
profiling of cells at different time points. Our analysis reveals
significant expression changes (FDR &lt; 0.001) of several key proteins
during the differentiation process, e.g., proteins involved in the
Wnt and Notch signaling pathways. Overall, our data provide a rich
resource of information on protein expression during human iPSC neuron
differentiation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human brain is
a complex system with different regions and
cell types, having billions of cells and trillions of synapses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> This diversity presents a great challenge in understanding the molecular
and cellular function of this organ. As recent studies have revealed,
perturbation of brain development underlies many neurological disorders,
such as autism and schizophrenia; however, much of our current knowledge
is derived from the rodent brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Human neural development
remains difficult to study given the ethical constraints with use
of primary human brain tissues, together with the paucity of high-quality
post-mortem tissue. Moreover, the degree of cell and tissue heterogeneity,
in combination with complex developmental and environmental factors,
further complicates (human) neuronal research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> One
approach with great promise to study neurological disorders is the
use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from, for example, human
fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Ever since the first report
on iPSCs, major efforts have been directed toward developing differentiation
protocols to induce neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Given the rapid developments
in the field of iPSC-derived neurons, a comprehensive understanding
of the mechanism underlying iPSC differentiation toward neurons is
required. Neuronal development is coordinated by morphogens and neurogenic
factors that can be captured <italic>in vitro</italic> using iPSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Over the last years, major advances in iPSC differentiation improved
the generation of a homogeneous population of neurons, which has been
used to study various neurological disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Although many of these regulatory pathways involved in neuronal
development have been studied in genomic and transcriptomic studies,
their mechanisms at protein levels have not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Since proteins are the final molecular effectors of cellular processes
and their perturbation is linked to pathological states, their investigation
is essential. Multiple protocols exist for generating neurons from
iPSCs. Here, to monitor the differentiation process of iPSC-derived
neurons by high-resolution proteomics, we adapted two different approaches,
often used to model neuronal development and neurological disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Forced expression of a single neurogenic transcription factor (Ngn2)
causes rapid differentiation of human iPSCs into functional excitatory
cortical neurons (iN cells).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> This approach
shows, within 10 days, rapid and reproducible production of a homogeneous
population of glutamatergic neurons. In addition, extrinsic-factor-based
strategies of different morphogens, such as Wnt, fibroblast growth
factor (FGF), retinoic acid (RA), and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), can be
used to generate neuronal subtypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Here,
the course of differentiation is a three-step process, with neural
crest cell activation by dual SMAD inhibition, caudalization by RA
signaling, and ventralization by SHH signaling. We will refer to these
neurons as motor neurons (MNs). Both approaches can be used as model
systems to study the molecular mechanisms during neuronal development.</p>
<p>The research presented here quantitatively probes proteome changes
during differentiation of iN cells and MNs at 10 different time points
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref></xref>). We observe
a two-step resetting of the global proteome, showing abundant proteins
in iPSCs decreasing and neuronal proteins increasing over time. We
highlight both well-established and novel proteins up- and downregulated
during differentiation. Additionally, we show the relative fold change
of proteins associated with signaling pathways such as Wnt, Notch,
and Hedgehog signaling. Finally, we illustrate which proteins are
specifically changing during differentiation of iPSCs into either
iN cells or MNs.</p>

<p>Workflow of MS-based quantitative proteomics during neuronal
differentiation.
Differentiation of iPSCs toward iN cells was performed using doxycycline-induced
expression of Ngn2. Differentiation of MNs was performed using the
action of small molecules for neural induction and cell fate determination.
Proteins extracted at 10 time points from 2 biological replicates
were digested and tandem mass tag (TMT) 10-plex labeled. Peptides
were combined and fractionated using high-pH fractionation. The resulting
fractions were analyzed by high-resolution nano-LC–MS/MS, and
quantification was achieved using TMT 10-plex isobaric labeling.</p>

<title>Experimental Design and
Statistical Rationale</title>
<p>For LC–MS/MS
analysis, two biological replicates were used for both iN and MN differentiations.
Samples derived from 10 time points were extracted and time point
1 was used for normalization within each biological replicate. In
total, 40 samples were collected and processed further with high-pH
fractionation. The 10 time point samples were tryptic digested into
peptides, TMT-labeled, and mixed at equal ratios. Each mix was processed
further with high-pH fractionation and each fraction was run on an
Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer.</p>

<title>iPSC Generation</title>
<p>The Medical Ethical Committee of the
University Medical Center Utrecht granted approval for iPSC line generation.
Generation of iPSCs was performed using a previously established protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Briefly, skin biopsies from healthy individuals
were taken and maintained in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) medium
containing DMEM GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 10% fetal bovine serum
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies).
The iPSCs were generated by lentiviral transduction expressing OCT4,
KLF4, SOX2, and c-MYC in MEF medium containing 4 mg/mL hexadimethrine
bromide (Sigma). After 24 h of incubation, cells were cultured in
MEF medium for another 5 days. Subsequently, cells were detached with
trypsin–EDTA (Life Technologies) and cultured in a 10 cm dish
containing irradiated MEFs in human embryonic stem cell (huES) medium
containing DMEM-F12 (Life Technologies), knockout 10% serum replacement
(Life Technologies), 1% penicillin/streptomucin (Life Technologies),
2% <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Life Technologies), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol
(Merck Millipore), and 20 ng/mL recombinant human fibroblast growth
factor-basic (Life Technologies). After 3–6 weeks, colonies
were picked manually and maintained in huES medium on irradiated MEFs
for another 3–6 weeks. The iPSCs were passaged using Accutase
(Innovative Cell Technologies) and cultured feeder-free on Geltrex
(Life Technologies) coated dishes in mTeSR1 medium (STEMCELL technologies).
Medium change was done every other day.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2.2.2">
<title>Virus Generation</title>
<p>Lentiviruses were produced as described
previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> HEK293T cells plated on a
500 cm<sup>2</sup> dish were cotransfected using MAXPEI solution with
35 μg of pMD2.G, 65 μg of psPAX, and 100 μg of pSIN-FUW-TeTO-Ngn2-P2A-EGFP-T2A-Puromycin
or pSIN-FUW-M2rtTA in OPTI-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Six hours
after transfection, the medium was replaced with OPTI-MEM supplemented
with penicillin/streptomycin 1% (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lentiviral
particles were harvested 48 h after transfection, concentrated by
tangential flow filtration using a 100 kDa cutoff spin filter (Millipore),
and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2.2.3">
<title>Differentiation</title>
<p>Generation of iN cells was performed
using a slightly modified version of the protocol described by Zhang
et al., in 2013.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> In short, on day 0,
iPSCs were treated with Accutase and plated at a density of 50 ×
10<sup>3</sup> cells/well in a 24-well plate on top of a Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) coated coverslip in mTeSR containing 10 μM
Y27632 (Miltenyibiotec). On day 1, the medium was changed to mTeSR
supplemented with 2.5 μL of lentivirus and 8 μg/μL
Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). On day 2, the medium was replaced with
N2/DMEM/F12/NEAA (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 μg/L BDNF
(R&amp;D Systems), 10 μg/L human NT-3 (ReproTech), 0.2 mg/L
mouse laminin (Invitrogen), and 2 g/L doxycycline (Clontech). On day
3, 1 mg/L puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cells. On day
4, coverslips with neurons were transferred on top of a 12-well plate
cultured with glial cells in neurobasal medium containing B27 (ThermoFisher),
Glutamax (Invitrogen), BDNF, NT-3, doxycycline, and 2 g/L Ara-C (Sigma-Aldrich).
Every other day thereafter, 50% of the medium was changed. At predetermined
time points, cells were fixed for immunohistochemistry or for proteomics
approaches.</p>
<p>MN differentiation was performed using a slightly
modified version of a previously described protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Briefly, on day 0, iPSCs were dissociated with Accutase
and resuspended in differentiation medium containing DMEM F-12, Neurobasal
(1:1; v/v), N2 supplement (Life Technologies), B27 without vitamin
A (Life Technologies), 1% penicillin/streptomucin, ascorbic acid (0.5
μM, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (STemGent). Embryoid
body (EB) formation was accompanied by a standardized microwell assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> IPSCs were seeded at a density of 150 cells/microwell
in differentiation medium. Chir-99021 (Tocris), LDN193189, SB-431542,
smoothened agonist (SAG, Calbiochem), retinoic acid (RA, Sigma-Aldrich),
DAPT (Tocris), BDNF (Peprotech), and GDNF (Peprotech) were added at
indicated time points and concentrations. Medium was changed every
other day. After 2–3 days, EBs were flushed out of the microwell
and transferred to a nonadherent 10 cm Petri dish (Greiner Bio-one).
On day 15, EBs were dissociated into single cells using papain (Worthington
Biochemical Corp.) and DNase (Worthington Biochemical Corp.). Cells
were plated on PDL (20 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) and laminin (5
μg/mL, Invitrogen) coated coverslips at 60–70% confluency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2.2.4">
<title>Glial Cells</title>
<p>Newborn mouse forebrain homogenates were
incubated with trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C. Following harsh trituration,
cells were plated in MEM Alpha medium containing 20% <sc>d</sc>-glucose,
10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomucin. After three passages, glial
cells were used for coculture purposes.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2.2.5">
<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>At the time points
of interest,
cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room
temperature (RT) and washed with PBS. Cells were blocked for 45 min
at RT in blocking solution [0.1% Tween in PBS containing 2% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and 20% goat serum]. Cells were washed three times
in PBS, and primary antibody was incubated for 1 h at RT. After washing
the cells three times with PBS, secondary antibody was applied with
Hoechst or DAPI (Invitrogen) and incubated for 1 h at RT in darkness.
Primary and secondary antibodies were mixed in staining solution (0.1%
Tween in PBS containing 5% goat serum). Cells were washed again with
PBS, fixed with ProLong Gold, and mounted on glass slides. The following
commercial antibodies were used: rabbit anti-tubulin-β3 (1:2000)
(Sigma), mouse anti-Isl-1 (1:1000) (DSHB), rabbit anti-FOXG1 (1:1000)
(Abcam), and mouse anti-TuJ1 (1:2000) (Covance). Alexa 488 and Alexa
546 conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2.2.6">
<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Cells were washed in cold PBS
and scraped into cold lysis buffer [20 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM KCl,
10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% NP-40, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma), complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. After incubation
on ice for 15 min, lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Protein
concentration in the supernatant was measured using a BCA protein
assay (Pierce). The proteins were heated in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer
containing 10% 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 70 °C. Proteins
were separated using SDS–PAGE (Novex NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris
precast gel, Invitrogen) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane
(Amersham). For normalization, lanes were quantified using REVERT
Total Protein Stain (LI-COR). Membranes were incubated in blocking
buffer (TBS, 0.05% Tween, and 5% milk powder) for 30 min at RT, followed
by incubation with primary antibodies [mouse anti-NCAM1 (1:2000; Millipore,
clone 11G7.1) and mouse anti-α-tubulin (1:2000; Sigma, clone
B-5-1-2) in blocking buffer] overnight at 4 °C. After washes
with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies in TBS for 1 h at RT. Blots were washed in TBS
and developed using the Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate
detection system (Pierce) before being visualized using a FluorChem
E Imager (ProteinSimple). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with
mouse anti-TUBB3 (1:1000; BioLegend) for TUBB3 measurements. For quantification,
intensity measurements of protein bands were performed with ImageJ.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2.2.7">
<title>Sample Preparation for MS Analysis</title>
<p>Samples (<italic>n</italic> = 2) for each approach were collected at the indicated
time points (10 time points) for MS analysis as follows: cells were
lysed in lysis buffer containing 8 M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate,
and 1× cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor (Roche). The lysate was
sonicated on ice using a Bioruptor (Diagenode) and centrifuged at
2500<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant with the
proteins was reduced with 4 mM dithiothreitol at 56 °C for 30
min and alkylated with 8 mM iodoacetamide at RT for 30 min in darkness.
The lysate was enzymatically predigested with Lys-C (1:75; Wako) incubation
for 4 h at 37 °C. The mixture was 4-fold diluted with ammonium
bicarbonate and digested with trypsin (1:100; Promega) at 37 °C.
The sample was quenched by acidification with formic acid (FA, final
concentration 10%), and peptides were desalted using a Sep-Pak C18
column (Waters). Peptides were dried in vacuum and resuspended in
50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2.2.8">
<title>Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) 10-Plex Labeling</title>
<p>Aliquots of
∼100 μg of each sample were chemically labeled with TMT
reagents (Thermo Fisher) according to <xref ref-type="other" rid="tbl1">Table <xref ref-type="other" rid="tbl1">1</xref></xref>. Peptides were resuspended in 80 μL
of resuspension buffer containing 50 mM HEPES buffer and 12.5% acetonitrile
(ACN, pH 8.5). TMT reagents (0.8 mg) were dissolved in 80 μL
of anhydrous ACN of which 20 μL was added to the peptides. Following
incubation at RT for 1 h, the reaction was quenched using 5% hydroxylamine
in HEPES buffer for 15 min at RT. The TMT-labeled samples were pooled
at equal protein ratios followed by vacuum centrifuge to near dryness
and desalting using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges.</p>

Basic pH Fractionation</title>
<p>We fractionated and
pooled samples using basic pH reverse-phase HPLC. Samples were solubilized
in buffer A (5% ACN, 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0) and subjected
to a 50 min linear gradient from 18% to 45% ACN in 10 mM ammonium
bicarbonate pH 8 at flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. We used an Agilent 1100
pump equipped with a degasser, a photodiode array (PDA) detector,
and an Agilent 300 Extend C18 column (5 μm particles, 4.6 mm
i.d., and 20 cm in length). The peptide mixture was fractionated into
96 fractions and consolidated into 24 fractions. Samples were acidified
with 10% formic acid and vacuum-dried, followed by redissolving with
5% formic acid/5% ACN for LC–MS/MS processing.</p>

<title>Mass Spectrometry
Analysis</title>
<p>Mass spectrometry was performed
on Orbitrap Fusion (for iN cells) and Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (for MNs)
mass spectrometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Agilent
1290 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies). Peptides were separated on
a double-frit trap column of 20 mm × 100 μm inner diameter
(ReproSil C18, Dr Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany). This was followed
by separation on a 40 cm × 50 μm inner diameter analytical
column (ReproSil Pur C18-AQ, Dr Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany).
Both columns were packed in-house. Trapping was done at 5 μL/min
in 0.1 M acetic acid in H<sub>2</sub>O for 10 min, and the analytical
separation was done at 100 nL/min for 2 h by increasing the concentration
of 0.1 M acetic acid in 80% acetonitrile (v/v). The instrument was
operated in a data-dependent mode to automatically switch between
MS and MS<sup>2</sup> for MNs or MS and MS<sup>3</sup> for iN cells.
Full-scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap from <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 350 to 1500 with a resolution of 60 000
full half-maximum width (fhmw), automatic gain control (AGC) target
of 200 000, and maximum injection time of 50 ms. For the MS<sup>2</sup> analysis, the 10 most intense precursors at a threshold above
5000 were selected with an isolation window of 1.2 Th after accumulation
to a target value of 30 000 (maximum injection time was 115
ms). Fragmentation was carried out using higher-energy collisional
dissociation (HCD) with a collision energy of 38% and activation time
of 0.1 ms. Fragment ion analysis was performed on the Orbitrap with
a resolution of 60 000 fhmw and a low-mass cutoff setting of
120 Th. For the MS<sup>3</sup> analysis, MS<sup>2</sup> was first
performed with CID fragmentation on the top 10 most intense ions with
an AGC target of 10 000 and isolation window of 0.7 Th, followed
by a MS<sup>3</sup> scan for each MS<sup>2</sup> scan with HCD fragmentation
with 35% collision energy. The MS isolation window was set to 2 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> and the AGC target to 100 000,
and the maximum injection time was 120 ms. When using TMT-labeling,
there is a known common drawback, the so-called coisolation issue.
Here, when a peptide is selected for fragmentation, coeluting peptides
are present in the isolation window. This leads to a mixed population
of peptides that disturbs the ratios of the original reporter ions.
Normally this is skewed toward unity, since the majority of the proteins
do not change between samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> The ratios
acquired by the MS<sup>2</sup> method are more compressed compared
to the MS<sup>3</sup> method. Therefore, data analysis and statistics
were performed separately for MS<sup>2</sup> and MS<sup>3</sup> to
identify differentially expressed proteins.</p>
<sec id="sec2.2.11">
<title>Data Processing</title>
<p>Mass spectra were processed using Proteome
Discoverer software (version 2.1, Thermo Scientific). the peak list
was searched using the Swissprot database (version 2014_08, with 20 156
entities) with the search engine Mascot (version 2.3, Matrix Science).
The following parameters were used: the enzyme was specified as trypsin
and allowed up to two missed cleavages. Taxonomy was chosen for <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and precursor mass tolerance was set
to 50 ppm with 0.05 Da fragment mass tolerance for MS<sup>2</sup> analysis
or 0.6 Da for MS<sup>3</sup> analysis. TMT tags on lysine residues
and peptide N termini and oxidation of methionine residues were set
as dynamic modifications, while carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues
was set as a static modification. For the reporter ion quantification,
integration tolerance was set to 20 ppm with the most confident centroid
method. Results were filtered with a Mascot score of at least 20,
and Percolator was used to adjust the peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs)
to a false discovery rate (FDR) below 1%. A FDR of 1% was applied
at the level of proteins and peptides. Finally, peptides with less
than six amino acid residues were discarded.</p>

<sec id="sec2.2.12">
<title>Data Visualization</title>
<p>Perseus software was used to generate
the plots and heatmaps and to calculate Pearson correlations. Normalized
protein and peptide abundances were extracted from PD2.2 and further
analyzed using Perseus software. For quantitative analysis, the TMT
reporter intensity values of proteins at each time point were normalized
to the reference intensity value of T1 (reference), within each replicate.
The ratios of each replicate were then log<sub>2</sub> transformed.
All the peptide ratios were normalized against the median. At least
one peptide was required to identify a protein. A volcano plot for
each time point was generated, and up- or downregulated proteins were
considered significant with FDR &lt; 0.05. <italic>Z</italic> scores
were used to generate heatmaps. Functional analysis to enrich to GO,
MF, and CO terms was done using the GProX open-source software package.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Clustering parameters such as fuzzification,
regulation threshold, and number of clusters were set to 2.00, upper
limit = −0.58/lower limit = 0.58, and 3, respectively. For
the identification of time-specific proteins between iN and MNs, volcano
plots were generated comparing the two groups for each time point,
and proteins were considered to be significant with a fold change
cutoff ≥1.5 and a <italic>p</italic>-value ≤0.1. Furthermore,
protein classification was performed using the PANTHER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> classification system and GO analysis, and classification
of transcription factors and cytoskeletal proteins was done using
the DAVID database. The <italic>p</italic>-values are corrected for
multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamin–Hochberg method.
In addition, Reactome pathway database analysis was used to identify
pathways enriched in several clusters.</p>

<p>We identified 5750

in just one of the replicates within each approach were discarded.
The relative abundances of the quantified proteins span more than
4 orders of magnitude, indicating a broad dynamic range in our quantitative
measurement. Tissue enrichment analysis of the 25% most abundant proteins
against the whole human proteome background revealed enrichment for
“Cajal–Retzius cell”, “fetal brain cortex”,
and “epithelium” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S1C</ext-link>, SI). The expression of Cajal–Retzius cells is not surprising,
since these cells are involved in the organization of brain development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> The enrichment associated with epithelium may
be caused by the origin of the fibroblast. Finally, the annotation
of protein class for all identified proteins revealed a wide coverage,
including typically lowly abundant protein classes such as transcription
factors and storage proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S1D</ext-link>, SI). Furthermore, the ratio distribution after normalization was
observed between biological replicates both for iN cells and MN differentiation

values of proteins identified in each time point were normalized to
the reference intensity value of these proteins before initiation
of differentiation (T1). As a consequence, all data throughout the
study reflects a ratio change relative to T1. After global analysis
of our proteomics data, we set out to confirm the quality of the neuronal
differentiation. We investigated known stem cell markers (e.g., SOX2
and OCT4) that indeed decreased during differentiation while, as expected,
several neuronal markers (e.g., NEFL, GAP43, and MAP2) increased in
both neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>A).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> Progenitor markers (e.g., BIRC5, SPARC, and TOP2A) that are required

was only observed in iN cells, where it is overexpressed, and previous
studies showed its involvement in cortical specification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> Taken together, these data confirm the validity

<p>To obtain a global proteome view, changes of proteins along the
course of differentiation for the two approaches were evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>B,C). We observed
that proteins highly expressed in iPSCs show downregulation over time,
and vice versa, proteins with low expression in iPSCs increase over
time. From these observations it appears that neurons are differentiated
around T5 and maintain their neuronal identity onward. This distinct
separation of the proteome, which happens around the intermediate
stage (T5), independent of the differentiation approach, can be further
emphasized by performing Pearson correlation within each replicate
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>B). Here,
an anticorrelation (<italic>R</italic> between −0.58 and −0.83)
was found between T1 and T10, which was similarly observed during
reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> Next, we performed an unsupervised clustering of the protein
expression across the time points for both cell types iN cells and
MNs. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>D,E).
Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>F,G) for both iN
cells and MNs respectively revealed biological processes such as cell
communication, growth, and movement as being upregulated (cluster
3), while biogenesis is slowly downregulated (cluster 1). Proteins
associated with cell differentiation in MNs are downregulated, whereas
in iN cells, most of these proteins belong to cluster 3 and few to
cluster 1. For both iN cells and MNs, closer inspection of the corresponding
proteins in cluster 3 revealed pan-neuronal proteins, such as tubulin-beta-3,
neurofilament, and MAP2. For iN cells and MNs, cluster 3 also reveals
increased expression of proteins localized in the membrane, cytoskeleton,
and several organelles, as well as molecular functions related to
transport, enzymatic activity, and signaling. Cluster 1 contains nuclear,
chromosomal, and ribosomal proteins that gradually decrease over time,
having a function in RNA and DNA binding. Downregulation of RNA processing
during differentiation was previously shown in mouse by proteomics
analysis and in human by transcriptomic analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Cluster 2 includes a group of proteins with general terms such as

<title>Proteomic Changes
across Time Points during Neuronal Differentiation</title>
<p>To identify
differentially expressed proteins during neuronal differentiation
in the two approaches, we compared T10 relative to T1 and performed
a <italic>t</italic> test for both neuronal subtypes separately. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref></xref>A,C shows the volcano
plots with the most extreme comparison of T10 (mature neurons) against

0.1%. This resulted in 696 significantly downregulated proteins and
686 upregulated proteins in iN cells and 706 significantly downregulated
proteins and 620 upregulated proteins in MNs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_002.xlsx" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Tables S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_003.xlsx" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S2</ext-link>, SI). Close inspection
of the proteins significantly enriched in T10 reveals general microtubule-associated
proteins necessary for neuronal stabilization, outgrowth, and migration,
whereas specific iPSC-enriched proteins consisted of transcription
factors and proteins having a role in embryonic development. Furthermore,
we highlight the top 15 proteins showing the largest fold change over
time in both neuronal differentiation approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref></xref>B,D). As expected, proteins
such as SOX2, POU5F1 (OCT4) (iPSC markers) and MAP2, DCX (neuronal
markers) were enriched. Moreover, several proteins (e.g., INA, DPYSL4,
and RPS19) were identified that have less established roles in the
context of pluripotency and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> Furthermore,
a protein interaction network was visualized using Cytoscape, Genenmania
plugin. Protein network analysis of these regulated proteins shows
an interaction network around the proteins INA, NCAM, NEFM, and NEFL,
being upregulated, and POU5F1, SOX2, DNMT3B, and DPPA4, being downregulated
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref></xref>E). To further
validate the utility of this data set, we compared two highly expressed
proteins during neuronal development via Western blots. We validated
the expression changes for NCAM and TUBB3 on Western blots for human
MN and mouse Neuro2a cell line, which have many properties of neurons
and have been used to study, for example, neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref></xref>F). Both NCAM1 and
TUBB3 expression was higher in human iPSC-derived MNs compared to
iPSCs and to a lesser extent in mouse Neuro2a cells. Several of our
highest top 15 upregulated proteins are increased in expression for
rat hippocampal neurons as well as during human brain development,
indicating that these proteins might serve as general neuronal markers
(e.g., NEFL, NEFM, CNRIP1, and NAPB).</p>

<title>Transcription Factors and Cytoskeletal Proteins</title>
<p>During

separately), of which PHC2, CRTC1, NCOA3, and SMAD3 are the most upregulated
in both neuronal differentiation approaches (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S3A</ext-link>, SI). Interestingly, PHC2 has been reported to have an
early developmental role in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, while its specific function in human cells has not been determined.
CRTC1 is ubiquitously expressed in fetal brain and acts as a coactivator
of the CREM (cAMP-responsive element binding)-dependent gene transcription
pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> Furthermore, CRTC1 has been
associated with different neuronal functions, such as synaptic plasticity
and dendritic growth in cortical neurons, and is also downregulated
in Alzheimer’s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> NCOA3 has been identified
as a novel microRNA regulator of dendritogenesis in mouse cortical
neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref></sup> In line with this, we show that
NCOA3 increases over the course of human neuronal differentiation.
SMAD3, which was shown to promote neuronal differentiation in the
spinal cord of zebrafish,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> was found to
be more highly expressed in MNs compared to iN cells. In addition,
several TFs are upregulated at early time points of neuronal differentiation.
NFXL1 was upregulated at the early time points of both neuronal subtypes,
while CCNT1 and LITAF were upregulated for iN cells and ZIC5, NFATC4,
and ZBTB40 were upregulated for MNs. Both ZIC5 and NFATC4 are essential
in neural development and survival; however, their association with
early stages of caudalization, as seen here, has not been studied
yet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, we captured 256 cytoskeletal
proteins, as shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S3B</ext-link> (SI),
with TUBB3, TAGLN3, and MAP1LC3A being the most upregulated in both
differentiation approaches. TUBB3 and MAP1LC3A are highly expressed
in neurons and function in neurite formation and stabilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref></sup> TAGLN3 is an actin-binding protein involved in cytoskeletal organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref></sup> Interestingly, the transgelin family members
TAGLN, TAGLN2, and TAGLN3 show differential expression between iN
cells and MN differentiation. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S3C</ext-link>, SI). TAGLN decreases during MN differentiation, while in iN cells,
there is an increase only in the early time points. TAGLN2 has a moderate
increase in iN cells and decreases in the early time points of MN
differentiation. Only the third member of the transgelin family (TAGLN3)
shows strong upregulation during neuronal differentiation in both
approaches.</p>

<title>Signaling Pathways</title>
<p>In the last 30
years, several studies
have demonstrated the importance of signaling pathways for regulating
the developmental program, specifying cell fate and patterning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref></sup> Some of these signaling pathways will be discussed here, displaying
the expression of their associated proteins in heatmaps for both iN
cells and MNs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S4</ext-link>, SI). The TGFβ/BMP
signaling is known to inhibit neuronal development by blocking the
proliferation of precursor cells in the adult brain. The dual-SMAD
inhibition with LDN-193189 and SB-431542 (SMADi) induces the specification
of cells with neural plate identity by selectively inhibiting the
TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref></sup> We
applied this to our MN differentiation protocol (at T2) and identified
expression changes for all SMAD members, as well as SMAD interacting
protein 1 (SNIP1) over time (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S4A</ext-link>, SI). SMAD3 rapidly increases at the late time points of MN differentiation,
whereas the other members remain more constant. Interestingly, we
observed in our iN cell differentiation protocol, which did not use
SMADi, a similar expression pattern over time for most of the SMAD
family members. This might indicate that NgN2 protein is an upstream
regulator of TGFβ signaling. Furthermore, Wnt signaling regulates
cell migration, cell polarity, and neuronal development during embryonic
development and has an essential role in body axis formation, particularly
in the formation of anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref></sup> Furthermore, the combinatorial effects of Wnt, retinoic acid (RA),
and Hedgehog (HH) signaling specify neuronal subtypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref></sup> Upon activation of Wnt signaling in MNs (by Chir-99021 at T2 for
4 days), elevated levels of WNT5A, WLS, ZBTB16, and NFATC4 are observed
in the early time points of MNs, while not identified or very lowly
expressed in iN cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S4B</ext-link>, SI).
These proteins are involved in cell fate pattering and development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">79</xref></sup> PLCB1 and PLCB4 are highly expressed in iN cells, compared to MNs.
A previous study showed their high expression and differential distribution
in several regions of the brain, including cortex, suggesting a specific
role in different regions of the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">80</xref></sup> Proteins associated with HH and RA signaling act as the posteriorizing
agent for spinal cord development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">82</xref></sup> Both HH and
RA are induced at T3 in the MN differentiation protocol and remained
until the end of the experiment. We looked for proteins associated
with HH and RA and observed that the majority of these proteins are
slightly elevated in MNs compared to iN cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S4C,D</ext-link>, SI). CSNK1E and GSK3B together with CCND2 protein
are higher in expression in the MNs compared to iN cells. GSK3B has
a critical role in axonal regulation and CCND2 has a function in neuronal
development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>The expression of cellular
retinoic acid-binding protein 1 and 2 (CRABP1 and CRABP2) is increased
in the MNs after addition of RA. Interestingly, CRABP1 expression
was restricted to certain neuronal subtypes in the hypothalamus, suggesting
a cell-type-specific function in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">85</xref></sup> Homeobox proteins, which promote the expression of posterior neural
genes, are all identified in the MNs but not in the iN cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S4E</ext-link>, SI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inhibition of Notch signaling is induced (at T4) for the MN
differentiation,
which is necessary to induce proneural genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref87">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref88">88</xref></sup> We identified 81 proteins involved in Notch signaling, of which
THBS1 showed a direct response after induction in the MNs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S4F</ext-link>, SI). THBS1 has been shown to play
roles in neuronal development, such as in neurite outgrowth and cell
migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref90">90</xref></sup> We further explored our data
for enrichment of axon guidance proteins. They are important in regeneration
along the anterior–posterior axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91">91</xref></sup> We identified 36 proteins associated with axon guidance, of which
the majority increases along the course of MN differentiation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S4G</ext-link>, SI). As described previously, axonal
guidance cues are often categorized as “attractive”
or “repulsive”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref92">92</xref></sup> NTN1 and
its receptor (DCC), having attractive roles, are both increased in
expression only in MNs, whereas ENAH and VASP, which function downstream
of the repulsive axon guidance receptor Robo, are downregulated along
the course of differentiation for both approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">93</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3.6">
<title>Neurogenesis Associated Proteins</title>
<p>To further investigate
proteins involved in specific processes related to neuronal differentiation
we next looked for enrichment of proteins associated with neurogenesis
using the DAVID database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref94">94</xref></sup> This analysis
revealed 129 proteins for which we had a closer look at their differentiation
profile, plotting their expression over time in a heatmap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00070/suppl_file/pr0c00070_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S5</ext-link>, SI). These neurogenesis-associated
proteins for the most part increase their expression over time, such
as DCX, CPLX2, and ELAVL3. Upregulated microtubule-associated protein
DCX has been increasingly used as a marker for neurogenesis, and ELAVL3
is a neuron-specific protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">96</xref></sup> Several proteins also
show downregulation, such as SLC7A5 and the transcription factor ZIC2,
known to play a role in neuronal cell proliferation (neurogenesis)
and early stages of central nervous system development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref98">98</xref></sup> Additionally, ARF6 is known to regulate neuronal development in
the brain via regulation of actin dynamics and synaptic plasticity.
Its relatively lower expression here, however, might indicate that
additional factors are needed to fully recapitulate the neuronal development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study provides insight into the remodeling
of the proteome
during human neuronal development. To our knowledge, this is the first
comprehensive proteomic profiling of human iPSC differentiation toward
neurons. The rapid neurogenesis through transcriptional activation
toward iN cells and the introduction of small molecules toward MNs
allowed us to identify regulatory proteins involved in differentiation.
Quantitative proteomics was applied to profile the dynamic changes
of proteins during neuronal differentiation by using TMT 10-plex labeling
coupled with high-resolution LC–MS/MS, which resulted in the
identification of 7230 proteins. There are several challenges in the
study of cell differentiation with MS-based proteomics. In this study,
we collected different time points (temporal resolution) during neuronal
development to visualize proteins having specific expression profiles.
However, cells are not completely synchronized at each time point,
leading to potential dilution of differentiation stage in the same
culture dish. Here, the protein expression profiles are therefore
an average of multiple cells. Despite this, we do see time-point-specific
clusters and progenitor markers appearing at early time points, as
expected. Ideally, to achieve a high temporal resolution, single-cell
proteomic approaches are needed in the future.</p>
<p>Here, we found
a proteome-wide change in expression, which occurs
in a two-step fashion, revealing a clear switch in protein expression
levels, halfway through our time window, leading to an anticorrelation
between iPSCs (T1) and neurons (T10). A similar but opposite trend
was observed previously in a study monitoring proteome changes during
the course of fibroblast reprogramming to iPSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> According to GO classification, most of the proteins that
downregulate during differentiation are located in the nucleus and
are involved in RNA and DNA binding. Proteins that upregulate are
mainly cytoskeletal proteins involved in cell communication and transport
that could play a role in dendritic/axon outgrowth and branching.
These findings are in line with our previous study, characterizing
the proteome changes of rat hippocampal neuron development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> The majority of the proteins are steadily upregulated
or downregulated along the course of differentiation. We highlighted
the most extreme comparison of iPSCs (T1) against mature neurons (T10)
and showed the top 15 most up- or downregulated proteins during neuronal
differentiation, consisting of proteins such as MAP2, a neuron-specific
cytoskeletal protein having an established role in neurodevelopment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99">99</xref></sup> Moreover, we detect several proteins (e.g.,
INA, DPYSL4, and RPS19) being highly upregulated with less established
association with neuronal development, suggesting that they may be
considered as novel pan-neuronal markers. Previously, Djuric et al.
used proteomics based on label-free quantification MS to profile neuronal
development in IPSCs, neural precursor cells, and cortical neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">100</xref></sup> In line with this study, extracellular membrane
proteins were enriched in neurons, and nuclear proteins were enriched
in early time points. Despite the different protocols, among the most
differentially upregulated proteins were TUBB3, DCX, MAP2, and NCAM1.
In conjunction, we captured all TFs and cytoskeletal proteins in our
data and illustrated their expression changes during neuronal differentiation
toward the two subtypes. Several of these TFs (PHC2, CRTC1, NCOA3,
and SMAD3) have been reported to promote neuronal differentiation
in zebrafish and mice; however, their association with human neuronal
differentiation was not detected. In addition, we illustrated several
subunits of a protein family having differential expression profiles
in both cell types, such as strong upregulation of TAGLN3 in both
cell types and the upregulation of TAGLN and TAGLN2 only in iN cells.
TAGLN was previously shown to regulate cytoskeleton organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">101</xref></sup> and was differentially expressed in neuronal
subpopulations of the rat central nervous system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref102">102</xref></sup> highlighting this protein as an interesting target for
further investigation. Furthermore, we provide a rich source of information
on proteins associated with several signaling pathways, such as Wnt
and Notch, involved in neuronal development. We identified several
proteins associated with these signaling pathways as being upregulated
toward one of the two neuronal subtypes and being involved in cell
fate pattering and development, further emphasizing their critical
role in neuronal (subtype) differentiation.</p>
<p>NgN2 is a transcription
factor essential for neurogenesis and its
expression is regulated by Notch signaling. Upregulation of Notch
represses NgN2 expression in early time points (iPSCs or neural precursor
stages) and keeps cells in a proliferative state. During neuronal
development, inhibition of Notch leads to upregulation of NgN2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref103">103</xref></sup> Proteins associated with the Notch signaling
pathway are lower in expression in iN cells compared to MNs. At T2,
NgN2 is induced in iN cells, and THBS1 is downregulated as a consequence
within this pathway, which was shown to play different roles in neuronal
development, such as in neurite outgrowth and cell migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref90">90</xref></sup> It might be interesting to inhibit THBS1 and further evaluate whether
neuronal differentiation is possible. Inhibition of Notch was previously
shown to upregulate NgN2 expression. However, upregulation of NgN2
(and as a consequence downregulation of Notch) seems to be more effective
and efficient (neuronal differentiation within 7 days). NgN2 is a
key transcription factor regulating other neuronal transcription factors
and repressing inhibitors of neurogenesis. Combining the overexpression
of two transcription factors (NgN1 and NgN2) resulted in rapid neuronal
differentiation within 4 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> This may
regulate neuronal genes downstream of NgN, resulting in concerted
activation of neuronal development. Several transcription factors,
such as PHC2 and CCNT1, are shown to be elevated after NgN2 induction,
which might be of importance in neurogenesis. In summary, we provide
a quantitative overview of key proteins that promote the loss of pluripotency
and rapid neuronal development along the course of differentiation.</p>
<p>Overall, we show that neuronal development is a complex process
involving many protein expression changes. During differentiation,
especially cytoskeletal proteins associated with cell communication
and movement are upregulated, whereas nuclear proteins involved in
embryogenesis were downregulated. Several proteins are known pan-neuronal
markers, but we also identified multiple candidate proteins that could
be involved in the regulation of differentiation. Many of the upregulated
proteins were localized in the extracellular membrane, which could
be useful for future extracellular cell surface protein-based sorting
strategies. This study provides a valuable discovery platform for
novel markers of neuronal development. Especially, transcription factors,
identified in this study to show upregulation during differentiation,
can be interesting candidates for further studies to investigate their
ability to influence neuronal differentiation. Our data further supports
the important role of signaling pathways such as Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog
in neuronal differentiation and in neuronal subtype specification.
Although the two approaches (iN cells and MNs) are different in their
differentiation protocol, we show many proteins that are similarly
regulated. This indicates that these proteins have a general neuronal
function rather than being subtype-specific. We further highlighted
proteins showing opposite trends in expression between the two subtypes,
which could be interesting candidates for future studies for their
subtype-specific roles. We also highlighted several proteins with
time-point-specific expression patterns, which might be important
in precise tuning of developmental stages. These data constitute a
rich resource that can be used to understand specific molecular mechanisms
involved in neurodevelopment.</p>
