<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Kabuki syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect multiple body systems and manifest as congenital abnormalities and both developmental and socio‐emotional delays. The condition is largely unknown by most primary care physicians and has no available treatment other than symptomatic management. This research sought to obtain caregiver‐reported data about the experience of living with and caring for someone with Kabuki syndrome to fill a gap in the available literature. Fifty‐seven caregivers participated in an online survey and reported that Kabuki syndrome affected their children in a wide variety of ways, including a high frequency of visits to various healthcare professionals. Caregivers reported their child experienced problems with hearing, eating, eyes, mouth, immune system, anxiety, depression, autism, teeth, joints, seizures, kidneys, and heart. Caregivers also described the challenges of caring for someone with Kabuki syndrome, including an impact on emotional well‐being and the ability to work outside the home. This unique research characterizes the caregiver experience of living with and caring for someone with Kabuki syndrome, both through observed manifestations of Kabuki syndrome in their own children and their experience managing their treatment. Additional research is needed to investigate the patient experience of living with Kabuki syndrome.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Kabuki syndrome, first described by Drs. Niikawa and Kuroki in 1981, is a rare disorder characterized by congenital abnormalities that affect the development and function of multiple bodily systems, often manifesting as impaired mental and physical growth and craniofacial, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities, among a wide variety of other abnormalities (Niikawa et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0016">1988</xref>). The prevalence is estimated at one in every 32,000 live births and recent literature describes 201 missense variants (Adam &amp; Hudgins, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0003">2005</xref>; Bögershausen et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0004">2016</xref>; Faundes, Malone, Newman, &amp; Banka, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0009">2019</xref>; Kasdon &amp; Fox, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0011">2012</xref>; Matsumoto &amp; Niikawa, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0015">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>An international group of experts created new consensus diagnostic criteria for Kabuki syndrome that includes a variant in the <italic>KMT2D</italic> or <italic>KDM6A</italic> genes and dysmorphic features (i.e., two or more of the following: “arched and broad eyebrows with the lateral third displaying notching or sparseness, short columella with depressed nasal tip, large, prominent or cupped ears, persistent finger pads”; Adam et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0002">2018</xref>). Other manifestations used to assist diagnosis include: skeletal abnormalities, dermatoglyphic abnormalities, developmental delay, and short stature (Cheon &amp; Ko, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0006">2015</xref>; Lepri et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0012">2018</xref>; Liu et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0013">2015</xref>). This condition is largely unknown by most primary care physicians and may be misdiagnosed, as the phenotype evolves over time and socio‐emotional delays may be mistaken for other conditions (Cheon &amp; Ko, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0006">2015</xref>; Kasdon &amp; Fox, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0011">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the cardinal features, a review of Kabuki syndrome descriptions in the literature found that patients may also experience system‐wide issues, including but not limited to: feeding, neurological (e.g., seizures), cardiovascular, kidney, endocrine, ophthalmologic, hearing, dental, gastrointestinal, urinary tract, musculoskeletal, and immunologic issues (Adam, Dugan, Hudgins, &amp; Hannibal, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0001">2010</xref>; Cheon &amp; Ko, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0006">2015</xref>; Dentici et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0008">2015</xref>; Lepri et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0012">2018</xref>) Individuals with Kabuki syndrome may also experience psychosocial issues, but are widely known to exhibit a gregarious behavior (Adam et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0001">2010</xref>; Caciolo et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0005">2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, there are no effective treatments for Kabuki syndrome; the only treatment option is management of the manifestations of the condition (Lu, Mo, Ling, &amp; Ji, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0014">2016</xref>). Case studies describe a wide range of medical issues, developmental disorders, and socio‐emotional factors that lead to variation in the management of patients; care can be complex and may include medical intervention to minimize susceptibility to infection, dental issues, or cardiac problems and/or psychotherapeutic intervention for both patients and their families (Crane, Alpert, Cyrkiel, &amp; Jauregui, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0007">2013</xref>; Kasdon &amp; Fox, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0011">2012</xref>). Treatment may also include assistance with feeding (e.g., feeding tubes), antiepileptic medications for seizures, educational assistance, and various psychological interventions (Adam et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0001">2010</xref>; Kasdon &amp; Fox, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0011">2012</xref>; Lu et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0014">2016</xref>). Kabuki syndrome is not typically associated with severe medical complications, and with proper management of congenital anomalies in childhood, prognosis for survival into adulthood is good (Adam &amp; Hudgins, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0003">2005</xref>; Kasdon &amp; Fox, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0011">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many patients need the assistance of a caregiver into adulthood. Caregivers often face many stressful situations while taking care of their relative or patient. Caregivers may deal with burden from physical, psychological, emotional, social, and/or financial stressors (Toledano‐Toledano &amp; Domínguez‐Guedea, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0017">2019</xref>). In general, caregivers of patients who have been diagnosed with a chronic illness often face interrupted sleep, family conflict, personal mental health struggles, and the possibility of lower quality of life (Javalkar et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0010">2017</xref>).</p>
<p>While there are individual studies and clinical descriptions on the presentation of Kabuki syndrome, there is little information on the frequency of certain features in larger cohorts (Adam et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0002">2018</xref>). Further, nowhere in the literature is the burden on the caregivers of patients with Kabuki syndrome described. Given the wide range of unique issues experienced by these patients, it is hypothesized to pose a heavy burden on the parents or primary caregiver. The purpose of this research was to obtain caregiver‐reported data about the experience of living with someone with Kabuki syndrome and to better characterize the patient experience from the perspective of the caregiver via an online survey.</p>

<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="ajmga61584-sec-0003">
<label>2.1</label>
<title>Recruitment and eligibility criteria</title>
<p>Ethics approval was obtained from Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB). Caregivers of adolescents with Kabuki syndrome were primarily targeted for recruitment given the possibility of cognitive deficits seen in patients with Kabuki syndrome that could make it difficult for them to complete a lengthy online survey. A recruitment flyer was distributed via a clinical site (Johns Hopkins University) and advocacy groups (All Things Kabuki, Kabuki Syndrome Kids, and Kabuki Syndrome Network) using e‐mail and social media. Interested caregivers reached out and were screened for eligibility via telephone; if eligible, they received a link to an electronic consent and online survey administered using the SurveyMonkey platform. Eligibility criteria included:<list id="ajmga61584-list-0001" list-type="bullet"><list-item id="ajmga61584-li-0001"><p>Verbal consent to be screened over the phone;</p></list-item><list-item id="ajmga61584-li-0002"><p>≥18 years old;</p></list-item><list-item id="ajmga61584-li-0003"><p>Located in the United States (US) or Canada;</p></list-item><list-item id="ajmga61584-li-0004"><p>Able to identify how they learned about the survey;</p></list-item><list-item id="ajmga61584-li-0005"><p>Able to identify when their son or daughter was diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome;</p></list-item><list-item id="ajmga61584-li-0006"><p>Able to confirm their son or daughter had at least one of the five cardinal manifestations of Kabuki syndrome): unique facial features, skeletal deformities, fingerprint abnormalities, mild or moderate intellectual disability, and/or growth deficiencies;</p></list-item><list-item id="ajmga61584-li-0007"><p>Confirmation that they were able to read and complete an online survey in US English; and</p></list-item><list-item id="ajmga61584-li-0008"><p>Confirmation that they were willing and able to complete an online survey that took at least 45 min to complete.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="ajmga61584-sec-0004">
<label>2.2</label>
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The caregiver survey consisted of 156 multiple choice and open response questions on various topics using branched logic; caregivers answered only a portion of these questions due to skip patterns associated with their responses. It included questions such as how they found out about the study as well as their child's diagnosis, healthcare provider information, the clinical characteristics of Kabuki syndrome, and the burden of living with and caring for someone with Kabuki syndrome. For questions including medical jargon (e.g., conductive hearing loss), a brief explanation (e.g., hearing loss due to problems with the ear canal ear drum, or middle ear) was also provided to ensure understandability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="ajmga61584-sec-0005">
<label>2.3</label>
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>All data were analyzed descriptively (e.g., frequency, mean, <italic>SD</italic>, range, etc.) for all survey respondents. All open response items from the survey were analyzed using ATLAS.ti. version 7.5.18 or higher (Atlas.ti GmbH, Berlin), a software program designed specifically for qualitative data analysis.</p>

<label>3.1</label>
<title>Demographic and health characteristics</title>
<p>Most caregivers (<italic>n</italic> = 54, 94.7%) were female and the average age of caregivers was 40 years old (range: 21–64). Caregivers reported they had both male (<italic>n</italic> = 29, 50.9%) and female (<italic>n</italic> = 28, 49.1%) children, with their child's age ranging from one to 32 years (<mml:math id="nlm-math-1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mspace width="0.25em"></mml:mspace></mml:math>= 9). Most caregivers (<italic>n</italic> = 54, 94.7%) reported their child was diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome via genetic testing and that they were diagnosed by a geneticist (<italic>n</italic> = 57, 100.0%). When asked to report which of the five characteristic manifestations of Kabuki syndrome their child exhibited, all caregivers (<italic>n</italic> = 57, 100.0%) endorsed unique facial features; the next most common characteristic reported was abnormal fingerprints (<italic>n</italic> = 53, 74.6%). See Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="ajmga61584-tbl-0001">1</xref> for demographic and health information reported by caregivers.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>This research was conducted in order to add to the body of literature describing the characteristics and presentation of Kabuki syndrome from the novel perspective of caregivers of children with Kabuki syndrome. Caregivers are uniquely qualified to report on the multitude of health issues experienced by these patients, as they are largely responsible for their care, especially when patients are young, and can provide more reliable reports than patients who experience developmental or cognitive issues. Given the lack of patient‐ and/or caregiver‐reported data on Kabuki syndrome found in the literature, this research helps to describe the magnitude of issues often experienced by these patients and families. Perhaps this is most evident in the frequency of visits to a wide range of treatment providers reported by caregivers and also described in existing literature, as families must find treatment providers who can help manage symptoms of physical abnormalities, cognitive impairment, socio‐emotional problems, familial stress caused by chronic illness, among other various medical conditions (Kasdon &amp; Fox, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0011">2012</xref>). While this research does not intend to inform medical decision making in the care and treatment of patients with Kabuki syndrome, it does provide a picture of the multidisciplinary approach sought by families to manage the condition and the potential need for specialty clinics for Kabuki syndrome that seek to address these special healthcare needs and improve outcomes for this population by establishing best practices for treatment management.</p>
<p>The issues related to Kabuki syndrome reported by caregivers ranged from those affecting hearing, eating, and seeing (i.e., difficulty eating and swallowing, oral issues, dental issues, eye issues, hearing loss), to difficulties with the immune system and infections, to joint problems, to even more serious issues such as seizures, kidney and heart problems. Further, although not reported by the majority of caregivers, mental health issues such as anxiety and depression are also seen in this population. Even then, caregivers provided a list of additional issues not covered in the wide‐ranging survey that their children experience. This both corroborates and adds to current literature describing the clinical manifestations of Kabuki syndrome and the many variations in phenotype that have been observed.</p>
<p>Although it is usually preferable to collect self‐report of health‐related quality of life, when this information is difficult to collect a proxy report is often used; in fact, the caregiver's perception of their child's health status is what determines utilization of the healthcare system (Varni, Seid, &amp; Kurtin, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0018">2001</xref>). As such, the difficulty in managing these many medical issues is seen in the large number of and frequency of visits to a large number of healthcare providers (in addition to a primary care physician) utilized in these patients' treatment. Caregivers also reported that one of the most challenging aspects of caring for someone with Kabuki syndrome was the frequent medical appointments. The many issues and associated need for treatment reported by caregivers suggest a significant impact on health‐related quality of life in patients.</p>
<p>Frequent interactions with the healthcare system are just one aspect of caring for someone with Kabuki syndrome, however, and caregivers reported that living and caring for someone with Kabuki syndrome can be quite burdensome. Caregivers reported that their experience caring for someone with Kabuki syndrome was time consuming, affected their ability to work outside the home, and was tiring, among other things. In fact, many of these caregivers reported not being employed outside the home and that caring for someone with Kabuki syndrome was a “full time job.” The strain on caregivers due to the constant time commitment and worry associated with caring for Kabuki syndrome was evident in these survey responses. These data are supported by existing literature that states a patient's treatment regimen as well as their ability to manage their own illness may also lead to a greater burden on the caregiver (Javalkar et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="ajmga61584-bib-0010">2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the authors feel this novel research in caregivers of children of Kabuki syndrome is a significant addition to current literature in this disorder, there were some limitations to this survey research. Firstly, caregivers completed a screening based on self‐report and no medical records were requested to verify diagnosis. However, given the active involvement of advocacy groups in recruitment and the fact the majority of participants were recruited through their outreach, the authors feel confident these caregivers were indeed members of this community. Additionally, follow‐up for clarification on responses was not possible when a caregiver's answer was unclear or seemed implausible. Face‐to‐face interviews would allow for better assessment of caregivers' observations, thereby providing more complete data on the experience of living with someone that has Kabuki syndrome.</p>
<p>Of note, adults and adolescents were also asked to participate in this survey research. Adolescents were asked to complete a much shorter survey with the assistance of their caregiver if needed. Although adults were invited to participate, there was little interest from the adult community. The authors acknowledge the value of collecting patient‐reported information from these groups in the future.</p>

<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>This research is a novel and unique characterization of the patient experience with Kabuki syndrome from the perspective of caregivers. Although there are smaller studies that summarize the clinical manifestation of Kabuki syndrome, this study is an important addition to current research given the wide range of topics covered and the large number of caregivers who participate. However, additional research is warranted to further investigate the patient perspective both in the US and other countries. Given the significant burden on both patients and their caregivers, the Kabuki syndrome community is eager to participate in and a great asset to future research endeavors, particularly because there is currently no treatment for Kabuki syndrome.</p>
