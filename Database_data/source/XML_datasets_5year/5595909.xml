<p id="Par1">Alternative splicing is crucial for molecular diversification, which greatly contributes to the complexity and specificity of neural functions in the central nervous system (CNS). Neurofascin (NF) is a polymorphic cell surface protein that has a number of splicing isoforms. As the alternative splicing of the neurofascin gene (<italic>Nfasc</italic>) is developmentally regulated, NF isoforms have distinct functions in immature and mature brains. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the alternative splicing of <italic>Nfasc</italic> in neurons are not yet understood. Here, we demonstrate that, alongside developmental regulation, <italic>Nfasc</italic> alternative splicing is spatially controlled in the mouse brain. We then identified distinct <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing patterns at the cell-type level in the cerebellum, with <italic>Nfasc186</italic> being expressed in Purkinje cells and absent from granule cells (GCs). Furthermore, we show that high K<sup>+</sup>-induced depolarization triggers a shift in splicing from <italic>Nfasc140</italic> to <italic>Nfasc186</italic> in cerebellar GCs. Finally, we identified a neural RNA-binding protein, Rbfox, as a key player in neural NF isoform selection, specifically controlling splicing at exons 26−29. Together, our results show that <italic>Nfasc</italic> alternative splicing is spatio-temporally and dynamically regulated in cerebellar neurons. Our findings provide profound insight into the mechanisms underlying the functional diversity of neuronal cell-adhesive proteins in the mammalian CNS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a fundamental mechanism that generates molecular diversity from a single gene, and is therefore thought to be essential for biological complexity and diversity. The regulation of this splicing is highly dynamic and complex in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Alternative splicing decisions are known to be dynamically switched during neural development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and show distinct patterns in a neuronal tissue- or cell type-specific manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, neuronal activity modulates alternative splicing of neural genes via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signalling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, neuronal alternative splicing is controlled in a spatio-temporal manner, which likely contributes to the complexity and specificity of neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">Neurofascin (NF) is a polymorphic cell-surface protein that belongs to the L1 subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the neurofascin (<italic>Nfasc</italic>) gene is developmentally regulated, which results in 50 variant isoforms expressed at different developmental stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In the CNS and peripheral nervous system, NF is involved in a variety of processes, such as cell adhesion, cell migration, and neurite outgrowth, during development, and is required for action potential propagation and myelination in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Thus, the alternative splicing of certain cell-adhesion molecules is thought to underlie the specificity of neuron–neuron and neuron–glia contacts during development, playing a major role in the organization of neural circuits.</p>
<p id="Par4">Alternative splicing at segments on the proximal ectodomain is particularly crucial for generating the four major NF isoforms, namely NF186, NF180, NF155, and NF140 (NF166 in chicken) in the mammalian CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. NF186, NF180, and NF140 are neural isoforms, whereas NF155 is a glial isoform. NF consists of a set of six Ig-like domains that are common to all its isoforms and up to five variable FNIII-like domains. The four NF isoforms differ in their combination of FNIII-like domains, as well as in the presence of a PAT domain. Thus, alternatively spliced events provide most of the structural diversity of the NF ectodomain.</p>
<p id="Par5">The three neural NFs show distinct functions in developing and adult brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. For example, the major neural isoform, NF186, predominantly confers stabilization to axon initial segments (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier in adults. The other neural isoforms, NF140 and NF180, are embryonic protein variants that regulate neurite outgrowth. In accordance with their distinct function, the embryonic isoforms are largely converted to the adult NF186 isoform during neural development and differentiation. This process occurs through the inclusion of four tandem exons (i.e., exons 26, 27, 28, and 29; ex26-29) which encode the fifth FNIII domain and the PAT domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, alternatively spliced NF isoforms serve as a developmental switch, imparting neural functions that are distinct between developing and adult brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the alternative splicing of <italic>Nfasc</italic> are unknown.</p>
<p id="Par6">This study shows spatially-dependent and dynamic alternative splicing of neural <italic>Nfasc</italic> in mammals; this regulation is dependent on brain region, neuronal cell type, and activity. Such splicing is likely crucial for creating the morphological and functional diversity of the mammalian CNS.</p>

<title>Alternative splicing of Nfasc shows spatial patterning in adult brains</title>
<p id="Par7">Alternative splicing of <italic>Nfasc</italic> generates four protein isoforms (NF186, NF180, NF155, and NF140) in the CNS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). The third FNIII domain (FN3) is unique to glial isoform NF155. However, the PAT domain is included in the neural isoforms NF186 and NF180, with NF186 further including a fifth FNIII domain (FN5). Another neural isoform, NF140, does not contain any of these domains. NF140 is an embryonic isoform, originally identified as NF166 in the chick dorsal root ganglia (DRG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The NF180 variant is also expressed in the rat brain during early development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In contrast, NF186 is a major isoform expressed in adult brains. Interestingly, both embryonic isoforms shift to the adult isoform, NF186, during development. To verify that NF186 is ubiquitously dominant in adult brains, we performed immunoblotting analysis with an anti-pan-neurofascin antibody in various adult brain tissues; the antibody detects several protein bands around 150–200 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). Of the protein variants we investigated, the one with the highest molecular weight (i.e., NF186/NF180) was prominent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). However, we noticed that hindbrain areas, such as the cerebellum and brainstem, displayed higher levels of the lower molecular weight protein (i.e., NF140) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>), which has been reported to be expressed in developing brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These results revealed a regional difference in the ratio of neural NF isoforms in adult brains.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Brain area survey for neurofascin (NF) protein isoforms.

<p id="Par8">Expression of the three neural NF isoforms is mainly determined by alternative exclusion or insertion of the four tandem exons, ex26-29, which encode the FN5 and PAT domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>).

</p>
<p id="Par9">To examine differential expression of neural NF isoforms between adult brain regions further at the “transcript level,” we analysed alternative splicing at ex26-29 by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To this end, we designed primer sets to recognize neighbouring constitutive exons (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>) and, as expected, we observed three PCR products corresponding to <italic>Nfasc186</italic>, <italic>Nfasc180</italic>, and <italic>Nfasc140/155</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). A sequence analysis confirmed that these PCR products were derived from the transcripts of <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing variants (data not shown). Moreover, the expression analyses derived by RT-PCR revealed that the splicing pattern of ex26-29 varied between brain areas, implying that <italic>Nfasc186</italic> transcripts, which include ex26-29, were more abundantly expressed in forebrain areas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>, right graph). Furthermore, with the exception of the olfactory bulb, <italic>Nfasc180</italic> transcripts, which include exons 26 and 27, were nearly undetectable. This finding suggests that the higher molecular weight bands observed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref> could not contain significant amounts of NF180, except for some brain areas. In addition, we evaluated splicing at exons 22 and 23 (ex22-23), as this pattern could lead to expression of glial <italic>Nfasc155</italic>. Differences in ex22-23 splicing among adult brain areas were not as evident as those of ex26-29 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>), suggesting that alternative splicing at ex26-29—a segment critical for expression of the neuronal <italic>Nfasc</italic> isoform—is spatially regulated in adult brains.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Oligonucleotide sequences of PCR primer sets.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Primer (Forward) (Reverse)</th><th>Sequence (5′–3′)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

<p id="Par10">However, in contrast to the protein analysis results shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>, <italic>Nfasc140/155</italic> transcripts, which lack ex26-29, were strongly amplified from all brain areas in semi-quantitative PCR. The discrepancy might be due to a large difference in PCR amplification between longer and shorter variants, because the length of the products differed by more than 500 bp. Therefore, we conducted quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to quantify the transcript levels of <italic>Nfasc186</italic> and <italic>Nfasc155</italic> more exactly between three forebrain and two hindbrain areas. There was a significant variance in the total <italic>Nfasc</italic> levels (ex24-25) between brain areas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref> left). However, the relative transcript level of ex27-28, selectively included in <italic>Nfasc186</italic> transcript, (normalized to total <italic>Nfasc</italic>) was relatively lower in the two hindbrain areas than in the three forebrain areas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref> right), similar to the pattern obtained by semiquantitative PCR in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>. While there was no significant difference in <italic>Nfasc155</italic> (ex22-23) between the brain areas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref> middle), <italic>Nfasc186</italic> levels in the cerebellum was significantly lower than that in the cortex, by approximately 35% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref> right), confirming the regional difference in neuronal <italic>Nfasc</italic> isoforms.</p>

<title>Alternative splicing of Nfasc is cell type-specific in cerebellar neurons</title>
<p id="Par11">To investigate the mechanisms underlying the spatial difference in neural NF isoform expression among brain areas, we focused on the large disparity in NF variants between the cortex and cerebellum. Whereas the adult cortex predominantly and strongly expressed NF186, the adult cerebellum inversely expressed the embryonic isoform NF140 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). Therefore, we compared <italic>Nfasc</italic> splice selection during cerebellar and cortical development. As expected, <italic>Nfasc186</italic> gradually increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a,b</xref>), whereas <italic>Nfasc180</italic> reciprocally decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a,c</xref>) during cortical and cerebellar development to different extent, respectively. The qRT-PCR confirmed the significant differences in inclusion of ex27-28 between postnatal day 0 and adulthood (2-3 months) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). These data indicate that the amounts of <italic>Nfasc</italic> isoforms changed distinctly during cortical and cerebellar development, through inclusion of ex26-29, but the extent of the developmental change in the cerebellum was less than that in the cortex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Developmental change and alternative splicing of neuronal Nfasc in the adult cerebellum.

</p>
<p id="Par12">We then analysed alternative splicing choices for <italic>Nfasc</italic> at the neuronal cell-type level in the adult cerebellum. One major type of neuron in the cerebellum is the granule cell (GC); thus, we compared alternative <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing at ex26-29 between cerebellar tissue and GC cultures using standard RT-PCR. Interestingly, while <italic>Nfasc186</italic> transcripts were not detectable in GC cultures, a small amount was identified in whole cerebellar tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Nfasc186</italic> is remarkably less from GCs. We further investigated the inclusion of ex26-29 in immature GC cultures (at 3 days in culture [DIV] and 7 DIV) and confirmed that ex26-29 was not largely included in <italic>Nfasc</italic> at any time in cerebellar GC development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Cell type–specific alternative splicing of Nfasc in the adult cerebellum.

<title>High K<sup>+</sup>-induced depolarization triggers a shift in alternative splicing of Nfasc in cerebellar GCs</title>
<p id="Par14">Although <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing in cerebellar GCs was not changed during development, we speculated whether <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing was regulated via additional mechanisms in cerebellar GCs. Increasing evidence suggests that a significant number of neural proteins are subject to alternative splicing in response to neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that depolarization/neuronal activity dynamically modulates alternative splicing events in cerebellar GCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next tested the inducible change in <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing in cerebellar GCs, by applying chronic high K<sup>+</sup> treatment as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>. Interestingly, we found that high-K<sup>+</sup> stimulation over a period of several days induced inclusion of <italic>Nfasc</italic> ex26-29 in transcripts, leading to an increase in <italic>Nfasc186/180</italic> in cultured GCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Bands of <italic>Nfasc186</italic> became detectable after incubation for 1 day or more (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Thus, inclusion of <italic>Nfasc</italic> ex26-29 was dependent on the duration of high K<sup>+</sup> treatment.

Importantly, immunoblot analysis with pan-NF antibody showed that high-K<sup>+</sup> stimulation significantly increased NF186/180 and reciprocally reduced NF140 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>), confirming the depolarization-dependent change in <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing at the protein level.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Depolarization-dependent alternative splicing of neuronal <italic>Nfasc</italic> in cerebellar GCs.

<p id="Par15">We next determined which cellular signalling pathway was critical for <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing at ex26-29.

<title>The Rbfox family is responsible for neural isoform selection through inclusion of Nfasc ex26-29</title>
<p id="Par16">We next sought to determine the factor responsible for the spatio-temporal manner of <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing. We noticed that the intronic sequence neighbouring ex26-29 contained multiple copies of the Rbfox-binding consensus sequence, UGCAUG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). In fact, a recent study that employed high-throughput sequencing together with UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) listed clustered sequences downstream of exons 26 and 29 as putative Rbfox-interacting elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>, underlines). The effect of the Rbfox family on splicing activation or repression depends on the location and context of the interacting sequences; downstream intronic binding sites are usually enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, we decided to test whether the Rbfox family induced the inclusion of ex26-29 in <italic>Nfasc</italic>. Interestingly, and similar to the effect of depolarization on <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing, overexpression of Rbfox1 by lentiviral infection in cerebellar GC cultures strongly induced the insertion of ex26-29 in endogenous <italic>Nfasc</italic> transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). Moreover, neither the overexpression of the other splicing factors, SAM68 or SLMs, affected the splicing of <italic>Nfasc</italic>.

<p id="Par17">Importantly, it has also been reported that Rbfox1 regulates the depolarization-dependent alternative splicing of NMDA receptor 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par18">Finally, to explore the cellular mechanisms underlying the depolarization-induced switch of <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing by Rbfox1 protein, we examined the expression level and subcellular localization of Rbfox1 protein in cerebellar GCs upon depolarization. Western blot analysis showed no significant difference in Rbfox1 protein levels between untreated and high-K<sup>+</sup>-treated cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>), but immunostaining with anti-Rbfox1 antibody in cerebellar GC culture revealed distinct staining patterns between untreated GCs and high-K<sup>+</sup>-treated GCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d–f</xref>). Rbfox1 proteins were widely distributed throughout the neurons in untreated cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d</xref>), with immunoreactivity clearly detected on small dendritic processes of GCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref>). On the other hand, in high-K<sup>+</sup>-treated GCs, immunoreactivity for Rbfox1 proteins were not as clearly localised (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref>), but was more evident (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7f, g</xref>) and strongly concentrated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7h</xref>) in the cell soma/nucleus, despite the absence of significant morphological changes in the somata (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par19">This study systematically characterized the detailed alternative splicing patterns of <italic>Nfasc</italic> and its regulation in adult brains. First, we showed that alternative splicing of neural <italic>Nfasc</italic> was not only temporally dependent, as previously shown, but that it was also spatially dependent, showing a distinct pattern in the adult CNS (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). In particular, we showed that the alternative splicing patterns of neural <italic>Nfasc</italic> were cell type-specific in the cerebellum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>), and that these patterns could be altered by high K<sup>+</sup>-induced depolarization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). Finally, an RNA-binding protein, Rbfox1, was shown to be responsible for the alternative splicing of neural <italic>Nfasc</italic> at ex26-29 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>). Together, this study revealed that alternative splicing of <italic>Nfasc</italic> in the mouse brain is more complex and dynamic than previously thought.</p>
<p id="Par20">To date, it had been shown that the ratio of neural NF isoform expression changes during development, with the majority of NF140 (NF166) and NF180 switching to NF186<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Our study revealed that this is not exactly the case in some brain parts. We unexpectedly found that a significant amount of the embryonic isoform, NF140, continued to be expressed in the caudal parts of the adult brain, where <italic>Nfasc186</italic> levels were reciprocally lower (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Importantly, we showed that inclusion of ex26-29 was not comprehensive, in particular in cerebellar GCs, during development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). We speculate that the distinct expression pattern of <italic>Nfasc</italic> isoforms observed in different neuron types in adults might be due to the extent of the developmental switch in <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing.</p>
<p id="Par21">The molecular mechanism underlying <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing is beginning to be uncovered. Indeed, a recent study revealed that Quaking (QKI) RNA-binding proteins are crucial regulators of the alternative splicing of glial <italic>Nfasc</italic> at ex21-22, demonstrating a role for QKI in oligodendrocyte development and myelination through <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Importantly, this study further identified Rbfox as a potential key regulator for neural <italic>Nfasc</italic>. Rbfox-family proteins (Rbfox1/2/3) are evolutionarily conserved regulators of tissue-specific alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We found that inclusion of ex26-29 was significantly attenuated by double-knockdown of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> and <italic>Rbfox3</italic> in cortical neuron cultures, where a large amount of <italic>Nfasc186</italic> is constitutively expressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>). In support of our findings, CLIP-tagged Rbfox-binding consensus elements are observed on intronic sequences neighbouring ex26-29<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A recent report revealed that Rbfox regulates an alternative splicing program underlying the developmental switch associated with neural differentiation in the developing cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Given that <italic>Rbfox1</italic> expression is upregulated during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, the Rbfox family can potentially regulate the developmental switch in <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing.</p>
<p id="Par22">Expression of the Rbfox family overlaps widely, but is distinct in specific types of neurons, such as hippocampal interneurons and cerebellar neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In the cerebellum, whereas GCs express Rbfox1/3, Purkinje cells express Rbfox1/2. Therefore, the distinct levels of <italic>Nfasc186</italic> between GCs and Purkinje cells shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref> might be due to the prominent expression or regulatory activity of Rbfox2 in Purkinje cells. <italic>Rbfox1/2</italic>-knockout (KO) mice exhibit a strong functional deficit of AIS in Purkinje cells, a molecular phenotype that is shared with <italic>Nfasc</italic>-KO mice, suggesting that alternative splicing by Rbfox is required for Purkinje cell pacemaking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Gehman and colleagues suggested that the impairments associated with <italic>Rbfox1/2</italic>-KO were mainly caused by altered <italic>Scn8a</italic> splicing. Our findings further imply that altered <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing may also be the cause of functional AIS deficits. Therefore, we speculate that alternative splicing patterns of <italic>Nfasc</italic> ex26-29 may be at least partially dependent on the spatio-temporal expression pattern and protein dose of Rbfox-family proteins.</p>
<p id="Par23">Importantly, our current study further revealed that Rbfox1 selectively contributes to the depolarization-dependent alternative splicing of <italic>Nfasc</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>), since <italic>Rbfox1</italic> knockdown, but not <italic>Rbfox3</italic>, selectively and strongly influenced inclusion of <italic>Nfasc</italic> ex26-29 in GCs exposed to high K<sup>+</sup>. Importantly, we further found that subcellular localization of Rbfox1 protein in GCs was markedly altered upon depolarization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d−h</xref>); whereas distribution of Rbfox1 proteins were widely extended toward small dendritic processes in mature GCs, they were strongly concentrated in the cell soma upon depolarization. Therefore, we speculate that depolarization-dependent inclusion of ex26-29 is likely due to the increase in nuclear concentration of Rbfox1 proteins through changes in the subcellular localization. Similar to this study, it has previously been reported that Rbfox1 regulates depolarization-dependent NMDA-R splicing in P19 cells through subcellular localization changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that the skipping of 53 nucleotides of exon 18 (ex18) on <italic>Rbfox1</italic> pre-mRNA during depolarization enhances nuclear localization of Rbfox1, subsequently triggering Rbfox binding element-dependent alternative splicing. However, splicing of ex18 on <italic>Rbfox1</italic> was not significantly changed by depolarization in cerebellar GCs under our experimental conditions (data not shown). It has been revealed that depolarization-dependent NMDA-R splicing by Rbfox1 is mediated via CaMK activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. On the other hand, we revealed that depolarization-dependent <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing was mediated via the ERK/MAPK pathway predominantly, rather than via the CaMK pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). Thus, although the exact mechanism underlying subcellular localization of Rbfox1 in cerebellar GCs remains uncertain, our findings imply the existence of a similar but somewhat distinct mechanism underlying depolarization-induced alternative splicing by Rbfox1.</p>
<p id="Par24">It has previously been shown that NF140 (NF166) is an embryonic isoform in the developing brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and that it regulates neurite outgrowth in chicken DRG via interaction with axonin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, our finding that NF140 is highly expressed in some regions of the adult mouse brain raises intriguing questions about the possible function of an embryonic isoform in the mature CNS. NF140 lacks the FN5 and PAT domains included in NF186. A recent study showed that these domains are likely unnecessary for AIS targeting or for sodium channel clustering. Two neural isoforms expressed in <italic>Nfasc</italic>-KO background do not show distinct subcellular localizations and function at the AIS and nodes of Ranvier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. If this were the case, it would indicate that NF140 could play a role similar to NF186 in adults. However, unknown functional differences may exist between NF186 and NF140. One possibility is shaping the structural and functional specificity of the AIS at the cell-type level. Previous reports have shown that NF140 (NF166) preferentially forms and stabilizes assemblies of GABAergic synapses on the AIS through clustering of gephyrin and GABAα receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Given that the inclusion of ex26-29 is distinct at the cell-type level in the adult cerebellum, <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing may specify the unique functional and structural features of axo-axonic GABAergic input onto the AIS that are particular to a given type of neuron.</p>
<p id="Par25">Another related question concerns the potential roles of activity-dependent shifts in NF isoforms. This study showed that alternative splicing of neural <italic>Nfasc</italic> is altered by high K<sup>+</sup>-induced depolarization in cerebellar GCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). Depolarization-dependent alternative splicing may serve as a programmed mechanism for the dynamic modification of neuronal function, where the production of specific splice variants modifies cellular trafficking, signalling properties, or synaptic protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Importantly, the resting membrane potential of immature GCs developmentally decreases from −25 mV to −55 mV upon maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Membrane potential-dependent changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> control the gene expression profile in GCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Our previous study further revealed that depolarization controls the spatial and developmental regulation of neurexin-1 (<italic>Nrxn1</italic>) alternative splicing via SAM68 activation in cerebellar GCs, and that the changes in <italic>Nrxn</italic> splicing parallel the developmental shift in resting membrane potential in cerebellar GCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, unlike <italic>Nrxn</italic> splicing, our current findings revealed that <italic>Nfasc</italic> splicing was not developmentally shifted in GCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). This difference might be explained by a distinct temporal expression of SAM68 and Rbfox1 in cerebellar GCs; whereas SAM68 is expressed robustly throughout development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, Rbfox1 is mainly expressed in mature internal GCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, depolarization-dependent alternative splicing by Rbfox1 is likely a mechanism mediating homeostasis in mature neurons, rather than inducing a developmental switch. Chronic depolarization dynamically changes the mobility and morphology of the AIS, which is thought to be a homeostatic mechanism for tuning the level of neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Considering that NF is one of the key players in AIS structure and function, we speculate that a depolarization-induced NF isoform shift is a core mechanism underlying activity-dependent changes in the mobility and morphology of the AIS.</p>

<title>Antibodies and DNA constructs</title>
<p id="Par26">For immunoblot analysis, the following commercially available antibodies were used: rabbit anti-neurofascin (ab31457, Abcam, Cambridge, MS, USA), rabbit anti-GAPDH (G9545, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), rabbit anti–SAM68<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, rabbit anti-MAP2 (M3696, Sigma-Aldrich), and mouse anti-Rbfox1 (1D10, Millipore, Billerica, MS, USA). pEGFP-HA-neurofascin186 (Plasmid #31061)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA). pEGFP-HA-neurofascin140 was constructed from this by removing the ex26-29 sequence.</p>

<title>Lentivirus production</title>
<p id="Par27">Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors provided by St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> were used in this study. The pCL20c vectors were designed under the control of the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) promoter. The viral vector was produced by co-transfection of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) with a mixture of four plasmids using a calcium phosphate precipitation method. The four-plasmid mixture consisted of 6 µg of pCAG-kGP1R, 2 µg of pCAG-4RTR2, 2 µg of pCAG-VSV-G, and 10 µg of vector plasmid pCL20c MSCV-SLM1-2A-venus. The medium containing vector particles was harvested 40 h after transfection. Medium samples were concentrated by centrifugation at 25,800 rpm for 90 min. Virus samples were then suspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), frozen in aliquots, and stored at −80 °C until use. After assessing the titre in HEK293T cells, the appropriate amount of lentivirus was infected into cultured neurons 5 days before harvesting.</p>

<title>RNA isolation and alternative-splicing assays</title>
<p id="Par28">RNA was isolated with RNAiso Plus reagent (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan), followed by removal of contaminating DNA using Turbo DNA-free (RNase-free DNase, Ambion). Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and ImProm-II (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For semi-quantitative PCR, DNA fragment intensities were quantified using an image analyser (FAS-III, Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and ImageGauge software (Fujifilm, Valhalla, NY, USA). The value for the intensity of each <italic>Nfasc</italic> isoform band was normalized to that of <italic>total Nfasc</italic> (ex24-25). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on a StepOnePlus qPCR system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MS, USA) with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the comparative C<sup>T</sup> method. For the relative quantification by qRT-PCR, transcript level was normalized to that of <italic>Gapdh</italic>. On the other hand, transcript levels of each <italic>Nfasc</italic> isoform was normalized to that of <italic>total Nfasc</italic> (ex24-25), to avoid confounding by differences in amount of total <italic>Nfasc</italic> between groups. All the oligonucleotide primer sequences used for semi-quantitative PCR and qRT-PCR are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>.

<title>Neuronal cell culture</title>
<p id="Par29">Cerebellar GC culture were prepared from both male and female ICR mouse pups on postnatal days 5–7 by tissue dissociation with 0.05% trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of DNase I (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) for 10 min at 37 °C. After cell dissociation, trypsin was inactivated with soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma−Aldrich). Cells were then plated into poly-D-lysine–coated dishes (0.5–1.0 × 10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>) and maintained for 15 days in Neurobasal Medium (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 2% B27 supplement, 2 mM Glutamax, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For pharmacological experiments, KN93 and U0126 were purchased from TOCRIS (Bristol, UK). For knockdown experiments, the following commercially available cell-permeable siRNAs were used: Accell non-targeting control siRNA (individual, D-001910-01, GE Healthcare Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) Accell mouse Rbfox1 siRNA (individual, A-041929-13, GE Healthcare Dharmacon) and Accell mouse Rbfox3 siRNA (individual, A-065754-09, GE Healthcare Dharmacon). Cultured cerebellar neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. After fixation, neurons were then permeabilized with the PBS containing 0.15% TritonX-100 for 15 min at room temperature and incubated with blocking solution (5% normal goat serum in PBS) for at least 30 min at room temperature and were then incubated with the primary antibodies for 24 h at 4 °C. For visualization, appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 546 or 488 (goat, 1:1000) (Life Technology) were used. Confocal images were captured on a LSM700 confocal system (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The original images were analysed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). After the appropriate threshold was set, the mean intensity and positive areas of immunoreactivity was measured on cell bodies of cerebellar GCs. Neuron morphology was visualized by staining for a neuronal marker, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2).</p>
<p id="Par30">All procedures related to the care and treatment of animals were carried out strictly in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Tokai University. All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Laboratory Animal Center, Tokai University. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tokai University (permit number 141018). Surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital anaesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.</p>

<title>Laser-capture microdissection</title>
<p id="Par32">Brains were obtained from adult mice (2–3-months-old) and freshly frozen in powdered dry ice. Frozen sections cut at a thickness of 10 µm on a cryostat (CM1900; Leica) were mounted on silane-coated glass slides (Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) and air-dried. Cresyl violet staining was then performed to visualize the neuronal structure in brain. Approximately 500−800 µm<sup>2</sup> of area from each layer per animal was sculpted with a laser microdissection system (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Jena, Germany) within 2 h. Thereafter, total RNA was extracted from the dissected specimen using a NucleoSpin RNA XS Kit (TaKaRa).</p>
