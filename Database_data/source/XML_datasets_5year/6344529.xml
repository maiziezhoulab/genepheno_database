<p id="Par1">Excitatory synapse formation during development involves the complex orchestration of both structural and functional alterations at the postsynapse. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie excitatory synaptogenesis are only partially resolved, in part because the internal machinery of developing synapses is largely unknown. To address this, we apply a chemicogenetic approach, in vivo biotin identification (iBioID), to discover aspects of the proteome of nascent synapses. This approach uncovered sixty proteins, including a previously uncharacterized protein, CARMIL3, which interacts in vivo with the synaptic cytoskeletal regulator proteins SrGAP3 (or WRP) and actin capping protein. Using new CRISPR-based approaches, we validate that endogenous CARMIL3 is localized to developing synapses where it facilitates the recruitment of capping protein and is required for spine structural maturation and AMPAR recruitment associated with synapse unsilencing. Together these proteomic and functional studies reveal a previously unknown mechanism important for excitatory synapse development in the developing perinatal brain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">During early postnatal development, excitatory postsynapses of the cortex and hippocampus undergo profound morphological and functional changes as synapses mature, which begins with the emergence of dendritic filopodia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In the mid-1990s, imaging studies of CA1 pyramidal neurons in dissociative cultures, as well as hippocampal slices, led to the suggestion that dendritic filopodia are precursors of dendritic spines: filopodia stabilized upon axonal contact, but otherwise remained transient precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The authors of these studies hypothesized that spines are formed by restructuring the actin cytoskeleton of filopodia. Additionally, dendritic filopodia form in response to activity; CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slice cultures were shown to increase filopodia in response to synaptic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, sensory deprivation of animals through whisker trimming led to a 40% reduction in filopodia dynamics as well as an inhibition of cortical map refinement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This suggests that sensory experience can drive synaptic plasticity in dendrites, and dendritic filopodia are a part of that process. In the hippocampus of rat pups, dendritic filopodia rapidly emerge from the dendritic shaft and dynamically explore the surrounding neuropil in search of presynaptic partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Upon contact with presynaptic terminals, these filopodia are stabilized via rapid calcium transients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and undergo a dramatic morphological transition from thin filopodia to spine structures, which recruit AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in a process termed synapse unsilencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Driving both the morphological and functional spine maturation is the underlying actin cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Synaptic actin filaments undergo a sudden structural remodeling from loose linear actin filaments in filopodia to a highly branched network of filaments that are believed to provide force generation for spine head enlargement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Mechanisms that trigger this switch in actin structures remain unknown. Recent evidence demonstrates spine synapses must have an internally guided mechanism for development as their formation can occur independent of glutamate or GABA release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These internal mechanisms remain enigmatic, however, despite clear evidence that abnormalities in spine development are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Unlike biochemical fractionation methods such as synaptosomal preparations or postsynaptic density fractions to isolate mature excitatory postsynapses, there is currently no way to isolate nascent excitatory synapse compartments of neurons. To do so is a particularly challenging endeavor because developing spines are only transiently present in high numbers for several days postnatally and because there are only a small number of proteins known to localize to and mark dendritic filopodia. The Rac-GAP, Wrp (or srGAP3) is one early synaptogenic protein, which is highly enriched in nascent spines. This targeting of Wrp is solely mediated via an N-terminal phosphoinositide-binding FBAR domain that preferentially localizes to dendritic filopodia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Here we take advantage of the dendritic filopodial targeting of the WRP-FBAR domain to localize the biotin ligase BirA to developing synapses of the cortex and hippocampus to enable in vivo <italic>Bio</italic>tin <italic>Id</italic>entification (iBioID) of nascent synaptic proteins via proximity labeling. Similar to our work to isolate the proteome of inhibitory postsynapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, this approach allowed the chemicogenetic tagging and subsequent mass spectrometry identification of 60 proteins within nascent dendritic spines. One of the highly enriched proteins was a previously uncharacterized member of a family of actin regulator proteins, CARMIL3.</p>
<p id="Par5">The CARMIL (<italic>C</italic>apping protein, <italic>Ar</italic>p2/3, <italic>M</italic>yosin<italic>IL</italic>inker) family of proteins was originally identified and described in <italic>A. castellanii</italic> and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. While there is only one CARMIL family member in amoeba, vertebrates express three proteins, CARMIL1–3. The key function of CARMIL proteins is to deliver actin capping proteins to sites of actin filament remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Indeed, CARMIL1 localizes to lamellipodia (sites of membrane expansion in cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Depletion of CARMIL1 leads to a loss of lamellipodia in cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, while its overexpression enhances membrane protrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Mutation of the CARMIL1 capping protein-binding domain demonstrates the delivery of capping protein to sites of actin remodeling is essential for its effects on lamellipodia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These results are consistent with the essential role of capping protein in facilitating Arp2/3-dependent branched actin filament networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">Using newly developed CRISPR genome editing approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> we demonstrate that CARMIL3 expression is co-incident with spinogenesis, that it localizes to developing synapses, and that it forms an endogenous complex with Wrp and neuronal actin capping protein. Loss of CARMIL3 impairs the transition from filopodia to spines, synaptic AMPAR surface levels, and AMPAR-mediated postsynaptic currents. Thus, CARMIL3 is a previously unknown factor present in nascent synapses that organizes an actin restructuring complex required to transition filopodia to functional dendritic spines.</p>

<title>Wrp-BirA biotinylates proteins within developing spines</title>
<p id="Par7">Our previous work demonstrated that the Rac-GAP Wrp localizes to dendritic filopodia via the membrane phosphoinositide-binding FBAR domain of Wrp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We found that this domain alone, when expressed in developing neurons, was sufficient to localize GFP to filopodia as well as early developing spines. Recently we utilized fusions between inhibitory synaptic proteins with the promiscuous biotin ligase, BirA (which is similar in size to GFP), to identify proteomes enriched at GABAergic postsynapses by proximity biotinylation in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We thus hypothesized a Wrp-FBAR domain fusion to BirA may enable the localized covalent tagging of the proteome of developing dendritic synaptic structures, which previously have not been amenable to biochemical purification by traditional methods. We tested this possibility by electroporating hippocampal neurons from postnatal day 0 (P0) mice with a tdTomato fill and constructs expressing either BirA alone, Membrane-tagged-BirA (MT-BirA) created from the membrane-targeting region of Gap43, or Wrp-FBAR-BirA (Wrp-BirA). At DIV8 neurons were incubated with biotin overnight, fixed, and stained for tdTomato (αRFP, red), biotinylation (streptavidin, green), and BirA, (αHA, blue) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). The enrichment of BirA (HA immunoreactivity) and biotinylated proteins (streptavidin staining) in dendritic protrusions was quantitatively analyzed, demonstrating Wrp-BirA significantly biotinylated proteins in early developing dendritic spines compared to BirA alone or MT-BirA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>). Thus, Wrp-BirA may allow for the unbiased labeling and identification of proteins involved in early synapse formation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Wrp-BirA localizes to and biotinylates proteins within nascent dendritic spines. <bold>a</bold> Representative images of cultured neurons expressing either BirA (Control), Membrane-Tag-BirA (MT-BirA), or Wrp(IFBAR)-BirA (Wrp-BirA).

<title>Identification of proteome composition of nascent synapses</title>
<p id="Par8">With this new toolset of BirA probes, we next set out to isolate the proteome of developing synapses by modifying the iBioID approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> for early postnatal proximity biotinylation. We injected pregnant females subcutaneously with 5 mM biotin starting at embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5). When mouse pups were born, they were injected with purified AAVs for each iBioID probe. From the time of AAV injection until postnatal day 5 (P5), both mouse pups as well as mothers received daily subcutaneous injections of biotin to ensure robust in vivo biotinylation. Brain samples were collected at P5, a time point in which synaptogenesis is still in the very early stages and filopodia make up about 20% of synaptic contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Samples were processed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and analyzed using label free quantitative high-mass accuracy LC/MS/MS (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a,b</xref>). Based on peptide identity, a total of 2490 proteins were identified in all three iBioID samples, which were further analyzed for proteins specific to either the Wrp-BirA or MT-BirA fractions (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c–g</xref>). The resulting proteomes specific for each probe consisted of 60 Wrp-BirA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>) and 117 MT-BirA (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>) enriched proteins. These proteomes (Wrp-BirA vs MT-BirA) were distinct with limited overlap (37%), consistent with the membrane localization of each probe but the early developing spine enrichment specific for the Wrp-BirA probe.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Proteome of developing dendritic protrusions. <bold>a</bold> Wrp-BirA-dependent iBioID identified a network of known and unknown proteins enriched in dendritic filopodia early in spinogenesis.

<p id="Par9">Bioinformatic analysis of each proteome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b–e</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b–e</xref>) revealed that the Wrp-BirA proteome represents a nexus of proteins implicated in excitatory synaptic function and development. First, the Wrp-BirA network, when compared to the MT-BirA network, was selectivity enriched for Grin2b, which is preferentially recruited to developing spines compared to later in development, when Grin2a is also recruited to dendritic spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The Wrp-BirA isolated complex also specifically contained a large number of adhesion and receptor molecules known to play critical roles in excitatory postsynaptic development, including latrophilins (<italic>Lphn1–3</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, <italic>Lrrtm3</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>), <italic>MAGI1</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>), <italic>Dscam</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>), <italic>Bai3</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>), and <italic>Slitrk5</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c, d</xref>). Consistent with the central role of the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spine development, multiple proteins functionally implicated in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics during spinogenesis were identified only in the Wrp-BirA fraction. These included WAVE1 (<italic>Wasf1</italic>), an activator of the Actin Related Protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex that functions downstream of Rac signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). All three of these (WAVE1, Arp2/3, and Rac) are critical for generating highly branched actin filaments required for excitatory synapse maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Moreover, the finding of WAVE1 enriched in the Wrp-BirA fraction was consistent with our prior work demonstrating the C-terminal SH3 domain of Wrp binds to WAVE1 to form a complex in neurons important for dendritic spine formation and synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Indeed, we also found peptides not included in the Wrp-BirA bait corresponding to endogenous Wrp (also known as <italic>Srgap3</italic>) and other members of the SrGAP family (<italic>Srgap1 and 2</italic>), highlighting the roles of these endogenous SrGAP family members during early synapse development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par10">Finally, we also analyzed the distribution of 1951 proteins between the Wrp-BirA-enriched proteins and three comprehensive datasets of mature postsynaptic proteomes available on the genes2cognition online database of synaptic proteomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). These datasets include TAP affinity purification of PSD-95-associated complexes from transgenic mice;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> purified mouse cortical PSDs;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and an extensive postsynaptic proteome (PSP) dataset combining mass spectrometry data from seven PSD experiments, AMPA and NMDA receptor immunopurifications, and NR2B peptide-affinity purification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We found that 36 of our 60 proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>) are not found in any of these prior datasets from mature synapses, indicating an enrichment of the Wrp-BirA proteome for early synapse formation. Bioinformatic analysis using DAVID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> of these 36 proteins found a significant enrichment for biological processes of “positive regulation of synapse assembly” (<italic>p</italic> = 3.1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>) and “heterophilic cell-cell membrane adhesion molecules” (<italic>p</italic> = 3 × 10<sup>−11</sup>), further supporting the notion that these proteins are involved in synapse formation and maturation.</p>

<title>Validating proteomic screen candidates</title>
<p id="Par11">We next tested whether the proteins we identified at developing synapses were functionally required for aspects of spinogenesis in a CRISPR-based imaging screen for dendritic spine formation in vitro. We chose to target the genes encoding the adaptor proteins Erbin (<italic>Lap2)</italic> and Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 7 (<italic>Lrrc7</italic>, also known as Densin-180), the Lipid Phospholipid Phosphatase-Related Protein Type 4 (<italic>Lppr4</italic>, also known as Plasticity Related Gene Protein 1), and the actin cytoskeletal regulatory capping protein, Arp2/3 and Myosin-I Linker Protein 3 (<italic>Lrrc16b</italic> or <italic>Carmil3</italic>) for CRISPR-based depletion based on insertion–deletion (Indel) mutagenesis. Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for each candidate were screened in a cell-based assay that we developed to verify sgRNA efficacy against genomic target sequences cloned in-frame with GFP (GFP validation vector) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). In this assay, highly efficient sgRNAs are selected based on their ability to reduce the expression of GFP when the genomic sequence they target is placed in-frame following the start methionine.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Candidate screening for functional role in filopodia maturation. <bold>a</bold> Schematic depicting the depletion and GFP validation vectors for in vitro guide screening.

<p id="Par12">We first validated this system for identifying functional sgRNAs that alter synaptogenesis by targeting a positive control gene, <italic>ArpC3</italic>, which we previously demonstrated by Cre-<italic>Lox</italic> deletion to significantly alter spine formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The GFP cell-based assay indicated that the ArpC3 sgRNAs 1 and 2 were both efficacious in mediating Indel formation at their respective genomic target sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b, c</xref>). Viral expression of Cre and ArpC3 sgRNA 1 in primary hippocampal neurons from <italic>Lox-stop-Lox</italic>-Cas9-P2A-GFP (Cas9 KI) mice phenocopied the increased density of the dendritic filopodial phenotype that we previously reported following the genetic deletion of <italic>ArpC3</italic> (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, cell-based GFP-validated sgRNAs can effectively recapitulate morphological alterations in excitatory synapse development downstream of gene disruption.</p>
<p id="Par13">Using this guide validation approach, three sgRNAs for each candidate of interest were screened. We then picked the most efficient sgRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b, c</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>) for viral-mediated expression in cultured hippocampal neurons beginning at DIV0-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). Cultured neurons were fixed at DIV14–16 and immunostained for both GFP (a marker of Cas9 expression) as well as RFP (FLEx-tdTomato; a soluble fill in response to Cre activity). Imaging and analysis of the density and morphology of dendritic protrusions (spines and filopodia) in sgRNA vs negative control (empty sgRNA) was utilized to identify candidates critical for structural aspects of excitatory postsynapse development. Of the four candidates, <italic>Lap2, Lrrc7</italic>, and <italic>Carmil3</italic> each showed significant alterations in the density of dendritic protrusions when compared to negative controls, suggesting they were functionally important for aspects of spinogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e, f</xref>). Thus, the results of this functional screen supported the notion that the in vivo proteomics analysis of nascent synapses could successfully identify proteins likely to be critical for aspects of dendritic spine formation and maturation.</p>

<title>Expression of CARMIL3 during synapse development</title>
<p id="Par14">Of the candidates functionally tested above, CARMIL3 depletion led to the greatest phenotype, with a 28% reduction in dendritic protrusions compared to negative controls. CARMIL3 was especially interesting in this regard due to its potential role in regulating actin dynamics as predicted by prior studies of its close homologs, CARMIL1 and CARMIL2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. However, unlike CARMIL1 and 2, the roles of CARMIL3 in actin modulation have not been studied and virtually nothing is known about its potential roles in the developing nervous system. To obviate issues with uncharacterized antibodies, we devised a strategy to tag endogenous CARMIL3 with highly antigenic epitopes detected by well characterized monoclonal antibodies (myc for immunoprecipitation or spaghetti-monster (smFP) that contains 12 HA epitopes for immunolocalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>) using Homology-Independent Targeted Integration (HITI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. AAV-HITI vectors with a myc or smFP tag followed by a P2A and mCherry fluorescent protein cassette were designed. These vectors enabled the antigenic tagging of the c-terminus of endogenous CARMIL3 protein while simultaneously marking those neurons with a red fluorescent fill under the endogenous CARMIL3 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>CARMIL3 localization during synapse development. <bold>a</bold> Schematic depicting HITI labeling of endogenous CARMIL3 with myc or smFP. <bold>b</bold> Representative western blot of myc pulldown of endogenous CARMIL3 at P7, P14, P21, and P28. <bold>c</bold> Expression of endogenous CARMIL3 in the P14 mouse brain.

<p id="Par15">We first characterized the expression of CARMIL3 within the cortex and hippocampus during the period of dendritic spine development. P0 Cas9 KI mice were intracortically infused with AAV-CARMIL3 HITI-myc-P2A-mCherry and brain samples were collected at P7, P14, P21, and P28 for immunoprecipitation using a Myc-trap resin, followed by western blot using anti-myc antibodies. CARMIL3 expression was readily detected at P7, but expression declined by P21 and was low to undetectable by P28 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). These findings supported the initial proteomic data indicating CARMIL3 is expressed during early synapse development.</p>
<p id="Par16">Using a similar HITI strategy, the regional expression of CARMIL3 within the cortex and hippocampus was also examined. P0 Cas9 KI mice were injected intracortically with AAV-CARMIL3 HITI-smFP-P2A-mCherry, and mice were perfused at P14. The brains were then cryosectioned and immunostained for mCherry as a proxy of CARMIL3 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). mCherry expression was present in pyramidal neurons throughout the cortex and hippocampus, while there was no mCherry immunoreactivity in negative control samples, confirming CARMIL3 expression in these brain regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d, e</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Next, the localization of CARMIL3 within hippocampal neurons was assessed based on smFP immunoreactivity. DIV0 cultured mouse hippocampal neurons were sparsely transfected with GFP to visualize morphology followed by infection with AAV-Cas9 and AAV-CARMIL3 HITI-smFP-P2A-mCherry or negative control AAV. Neurons were cultured for 14 days to allow for integration and expression of the smFP cassette at which point neurons were fixed, immunostained for mCherry and smFP, and imaged to localize endogenous CARMIL3. Compared to negative control neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f, h</xref>), CARMIL3 localized as discrete puncta within dendritic shafts, filopodia, and spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g, i</xref>). Other candidates we identified (Lrrc7 and Lppr4) were also localized in cultured hippocampal neurons using HITI to c-terminal tag the endogenous proteins for immunocytochemistry. Co-localization with the postsynaptic marker Homer1 demonstrated these candidates were also present at synapses (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Together these data support the localization of several candidates we identified in the Wrp-BirA screen as synaptic proteins. Importantly, endogenous CARMIL3 is also expressed in a temporal and spatial manner consistent with the possibility it facilitates aspects of dendritic spine development.</p>

<sec id="Sec7">
<title>Depletion of CARMIL3 reduces dendritic spine density</title>
<p id="Par17">Next the functional roles of CARMIL3 during spinogenesis were explored using CRISPR-mediated depletion strategies in vitro and in vivo. Based on the initial depletion screening data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>), we further characterized how loss of CARMIL3 alters the morphology of developing synapses at DIV8 and DIV16 in vitro. First, hippocampal neuron cultures from P0 Cas9 KI mice were prepared and infected with AAV-FLEx-tdTomato and either a negative control virus (AAV-empty sgRNA-Cre) or the CARMIL3 sgRNA virus to mutate the gene (MUT) by Indel formation and thus deplete CARMIL3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). CARMIL3 sgRNA virus had no effect on the density of dendritic filopodia or spines at DIV8 when compared to negative control treated neurons, suggesting either CARMIL3 is not required for the initial formation of these structures or that the depletion strategy at this early time point was ineffective (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b–d</xref>). However, at DIV16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>), a time point when the majority of developing excitatory postsynaptic structures are spines, there was a significant shift in the morphology of CARMIL3-depleted (MUT) neurons compared with control (WT) neurons. The density of dendritic spines was decreased and there were more filopodia-like protrusions in CARMIL3-depleted neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f, g</xref>). In contrast, mutation of CARMIL3 after the first week of synaptogenesis at DIV10 did not alter spine density at DIV16, suggesting that CARMIL3 may be important for the transition period between filopodia to spines (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7c–f</xref>). We note, however, that it is also possible the depletion strategy we employed is less effective between DIV10 and 16. To control for possible sgRNA off-target effects, we repeated the analysis of DIV0–16 depletion with a second independent sgRNA against CARMIL3. Neurons treated with this guide also displayed a reduced density of dendritic spines, independently confirming CARMIL3 facilitates spine development (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a, b</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>CARMIL3 depletion causes alterations in dendritic spine maturation. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of CRISPR-based depletion strategy of CARMIL3 in cultured hippocampal neurons. <bold>b</bold> Representative images of control (WT) and CARMIL3-depleted (MUT) neurons at DIV8.

<p id="Par18">We next tested whether the requirement of CARMIL3 for the development of normal spine density in vitro was also true in vivo. To test this, we intracortically infused P0 pups constitutively expressing Cas9 with AAV-FLEx-tdTomato and a novel HITI Gene Trap virus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>). AAV-HITI-P2A-Cre-STOP inserts a disruptive in-frame P2A sequence followed by Cre, allowing expression of Cre as a sensitive marker of neurons in which the CARMIL3 gene has been interrupted. Negative control virus, AAV-CreERT2, was co-injected with AAV-FLEx-tdTomato at P0 to sparsely label wild-type neurons in vivo following a single intraperitoneal tamoxifen (75 mg/kg) treatment at P7. Coronal brain sections were prepared from P14 mice and the dendritic spines were imaged for changes in density from CA1 apical dendrites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5i</xref>). Quantitative comparisons between control and CARMIL3 gene-trapped neurons demonstrated the depletion of CARMIL3 in vivo also leads to a significant 28% reduction in dendritic spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5j–l</xref>). Together, these data show that CARMIL3 is critical for the development of dendritic spines both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

<title>Depletion of CARMIL3 alters excitatory synaptic transmission</title>
<p id="Par19">Given the localization and necessity of CARMIL3 for spine development, we next tested whether disruption of CARMIL3 would lead to functional alterations in excitatory synaptic transmission. Hippocampal neurons were co-infected with three AAVs, AAV-Cas9, AAV-FLEx-tdTomato, and gene trap virus (AAV-CARMIL3 HITI-P2A-Cre-STOP) or negative control virus (AAV-empty sgRNA-Cre) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). This strategy resulted in sparse labeling of CARMIL3 gene-trapped neurons vs matched control neurons without depletion of CARMIL3, both expressing tdTomato. On DIV12–16, somatic whole-cell recordings from tdTomato-expressing neurons were used to pharmacologically isolate AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (AMPAR-mEPSCs or NMDAR-mEPSCs) and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Compared to control neurons, CARMIL3 gene-trapped neurons had a significant decrease in AMPAR-mEPSC amplitude (34%) and frequency (50%), measured as an increase in interevent interval (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b–d</xref>). In contrast, there was no significant effect of CARMIL3 disruption on NMDAR-mEPSCs (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8a–c</xref>). There was also no effect on mIPSCs (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8d–f</xref>), suggesting that CARMIL3 does not play a role at inhibitory synapses. Finally, CARMIL3 depletion did not alter the kinetics (rise or decay times) of AMPAR-mEPSCs, NMDAR-mEPSCs, or mIPSCs (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8g–r</xref>), suggesting there was no effect on the subunit composition of glutamate or GABA receptors present at synapses from CARMIL3-depleted neurons.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>CARMIL3 depletion results in functionally immature excitatory synapses. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of HITI gene trap method used to sparsely deplete CARMIL3 from cultured hippocampal neurons.

<p id="Par20">Because of the specific defect on AMPAR-mediated currents, we next analyzed the surface levels of AMPAR subunits at synapses. Cultured neurons were electroporated with GluA1 and GluA2 tagged with the pH-sensitive GFP variant supereclipitic pHlourin (SEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>) and then gene trapped as described above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>). Live imaging was conducted on DIV12–16 for SEP and tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>). There was a 51% reduction in the GluA1–GluA2 surface enrichment within dendritic protrusions from gene-trapped neurons compared with WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6g</xref>). This difference was driven by a reduction in surface enrichment specifically in dendritic spines, as filopodia in both groups had similarly low levels of enrichment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6h</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par21">Together, these experiments demonstrate CARMIL3 is specifically required for AMPAR-dependent excitatory synaptic transmission, but not for inhibitory synapse function. Furthermore, since the CARMIL3 gene trap did not alter NMDAR-mEPSCs, the AMPAR-mediated reduced frequency must be due to postsynaptic effects, with fewer synapses containing AMPA-type receptors at their surface.</p>

<title>CARMIL3 interacts with both capping protein and Wrp</title>
<p id="Par22">The combined results of our imaging and electrophysiology studies reveal that CARMIL3 is important for aspects of both morphological and functional synaptogenesis, but how CARMIL3 functions at a molecular level was unclear. CARMIL3 contains membrane and protein interaction domains that have been previously characterized in other CARMIL family members CARMIL1–2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). Prior functional studies of CARMIL1 demonstrate one of its main cellular functions is to recruit capping protein (CP) to sites of Arp2/3-dependent actin remodeling through a distinctive capping protein-binding domain that is conserved in CARMIL3 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>). siRNA knockdown of CP subunit Β2 in cultured neurons leads to a phenotype similar to CARMIL3 depletion, including reduced spine density and mEPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, suggesting the possibility that CARMIL3 facilitates CP recruitment and/or activity. We also noted that the CARMIL3 proline-rich region contained a sequence that is homologous to the WRP-SH3 domain-binding motif of WAVE1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, suggesting that in addition to binding CP, CARMIL3 may also directly interact with Wrp.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>CARMIL3 interacts with both Wrp and capping protein in developing synapses. <bold>a</bold> Schematic depicting domains of CARMIL3.

<p id="Par23">To first test these possibilities, we expressed V5-epitope tagged Wrp, CP subunit Β2, and HA epitope tagged CARMIL3 or CARMIL3 lacking the predicted Wrp-binding site (CARMIL3 ΔWrp) in HEK293T cells. CARMIL3 immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis revealed both Wrp and a small amount of CP co-immunoprecipitated (co-IP) with CARMIL3 when all three were co-expressed. Further, deleting the predicted Wrp-binding motif abrogated the co-IP between Wrp and CARMIL3, demonstrating the interaction between the two requires this motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>). Interestingly, CARMIL3 ΔWrp was better able to co-precipitate CP, suggesting that there may be competition between Wrp and CP to bind CARMIL3, which is consistent with the juxtaposed binding sites for CP and Wrp in CARMIL3. As predicted from CARMIL1, deletion of the homologous CP-binding region of CARMIL3 abolished CP but not Wrp co-IP (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). Moreover, co-IP between Wrp and CARMIL3 required the Wrp-SH3 domain, as deletion of this domain in WRP showed it was required for the interaction with CARMIL3 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par24">We next determined whether the interactions between CARMIL3, Wrp, and CP occur in vivo between the endogenous proteins. To test this possibility, we used HITI to epitope tag endogenous CARMIL3 with a c-terminal myc epitope by intracortically infusing P0 pups with AAV-CARMIL3 HITI-myc-P2A-mCherry vs negative control uninfected pups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>, top). At P7, whole brain lysates were prepared (input) and immunoprecipitated with myc nano-trap resin. While the expression level of endogenous CARMIL3-myc was too low to be detected in lysates, immunopurification resulted in a strong myc-immunoreactive band at the predicted 150 kDa size for CARMIL3 in HITI-myc-infected brain tissue. Western blot analysis of CARMIL3-myc vs negative control IP revealed that CARMIL3-myc co-precipitated with both endogenous Wrp and CP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>, middle panels). The ArpC3 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex did not co-precipitate with CARMIL3-myc, consistent with prior work suggesting the mammalian CARMIL proteins do not interact with Arp2/3 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>, bottom panel).</p>
<p id="Par25">Previous work has shown that for CARMIL1, the recruitment of CP to sites of actin remodeling is one of its important cellular functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Further, CP facilitates the generation of Arp2/3-dependent branched actin filament networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and both Arp2/3 and CP are critical for spinogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. As our data demonstrate CARMIL3 interacts with CP, we hypothesized that CARMIL3 may be required for facilitating the localization of CP to dendritic spines. To test this hypothesis, we depleted CARMIL3 using the CARMIL3 HITI gene trap strategy and immunostained for endogenous CP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d, e</xref>). Quantification of the percentage of dendritic spine protrusions immunoreactive for CP revealed a slight but significant decrease in CARMIL3 gene-trapped neurons when compared to control wild-type neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7f</xref>). The total levels of capping protein in dendrites were unaltered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7g</xref>). Thus, CARMIL3 binds CP and appears to facilitate CP localization to dendritic protrusions, which is known to be important for spinogenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par26">Here we report the proximity-based in vivo biotinylation (iBioID) of dendritic spine proteomes during their initial formation. The resulting quantitative proteomic analysis discovered 60 early synaptic candidate proteins. Remarkably, none of the proteins we report here were previously identified in prior proteomic studies of spine development based on traditional fractionations that are probably optimal for fully mature synapses rather than early developing synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, over half of the proteins we identified were not identified in prior proteomic studies of mature synapses, yet these unique proteins are predicted to mediate synapse adhesion and synapse formation. Thus, iBioID, by covalently labeling nascent synaptic proteins based on their proximity to probes targeted to these structures, is able to access proteomes difficult to enrich by traditional biochemical approaches. We validated our proteomics screen by utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 to target and deplete four candidates and found that three out of four altered the morphological formation of dendritic protrusions during spinogenesis. Labeling of endogenous proteins by HITI also strongly supported that our proteomics analysis identified regulators of dendritic spine formation. Thus, iBioID can be used for proximity biotinylation of key neurodevelopmental milestones in vivo.</p>
<p id="Par27">Dendritic spine maturation is one key milestone whose dysregulation is heavily implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. We note that 21% of the proteins we discovered in developing synapses either may be regulated by FMRP (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> (<italic>Ptpn11</italic>, <italic>Lrrc7</italic>, <italic>Lphn1</italic>, <italic>Lphn3</italic>, <italic>Grin1</italic>, <italic>Grin2b</italic>, <italic>Dab2ip</italic>, <italic>Ntrk2</italic>, <italic>Odz4</italic>, <italic>Grm5</italic>, <italic>Pkp4</italic>) or are directly implicated by gene mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders, including <italic>Erbb2ip</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, <italic>Cnksr2</italic> (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>), and <italic>Wrp</italic> (also known as <italic>Srgap3)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Interestingly, both Cnksr2 and Wrp are thought to modulate Rac-dependent signaling events that instruct actin cytoskeletal remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, which was also well-represented in the Wrp-BirA proteome dataset (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). One of the novel cytoskeletal proteins we discovered not previously implicated in spinogenesis was <italic>Lrrc16b</italic>, which encodes CARMIL3. In our initial CRISPR-based screen we found targeting of <italic>Lrrc16b</italic>/CARMIL3 significantly reduced dendritic protrusions during the period of synaptogenesis, suggesting it is important for modulating excitatory synapse formation.</p>
<p id="Par28">Little is known about CARMIL3, though its close family member CARMIL1 binds CP and regulates cellular actin filament networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, a key question was, how might CARMIL3 regulate the maturation of dendritic spines in developing neurons mechanistically? First, using HITI to tag endogenous CARMIL3 with antibody epitopes and track its expression via co-translation of mCherry, we found that CARMIL3 is expressed in cortical and hippocampal neurons during synaptogenesis and that it is localized to discrete patches along the dendritic shaft and filopodia or early spines. Thus, CARMIL3 protein is spatially and temporally positioned to modulate synapse formation.</p>
<p id="Par29">The notion that CARMIL3 localizes to synapses is further supported by our finding that it physically interacts with Wrp. We identified a motif in the proline-rich c-terminal region of CARMIL3 that is highly similar to the Wrp-SH3 domain binding motif of WAVE1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Our co-IP data and deletion mutagenesis analysis revealed that CARMIL3 associates with Wrp through this Wrp-binding motif and the SH3 domain of Wrp. We speculate that the interaction between CARMIL3 and Wrp further localizes CARMIL3 not just to the membrane, but to developing synapses as Wrp is highly enriched in dendritic filopodia and dendritic spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par30">Finally, we found endogenous CARMIL3 co-IPs with neuronal capping protein (CP) and our deletion mutagenesis data suggest that this interaction occurs via a CP-binding motif conserved in CARMIL1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. CP strongly influences actin cytoskeletal remodeling by binding to the barbed ends of actin filaments and thus limits their linear growth by preventing the addition of monomeric actin. Using in vitro assays with purified proteins, conflicting reports suggest CARMIL1 can either allosterically inhibit CP or weakly activate CP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par31">In cellular assays the role of the interaction between CARMIL family members and CP appears clearer. With CARMIL1 localizing predominately to membranes undergoing active protrusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, CARMIL1 also promotes actin network assembly by enhancing barbed-end capping activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. CARMIL family proteins are unlike other allosteric CP inhibitors in that CARMIL family members interact with CP at a region that is distinct from its actin-binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, strongly suggesting that they function to localize CP to sites of cellular actin dynamics. This finding is consistent with models proposing that capping of actin filaments leads to the biased binding of actin to Arp2/3, transforming actin filaments from linear to highly branched actin networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. During spinogenesis, filopodia transition to spines composed of highly branched networks of actin. Our data suggest that CARMIL3, via its ability to recruit capping protein during synaptogenesis, facilitates Arp2/3 activity, which we have previously demonstrated is also required for spine morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par32">The likelihood that CARMIL3-dependent recruitment of CP facilitates Arp2/3 activity during spinogenesis is further supported by our finding that depletion of CARMIL3 results in reduced AMPAR- but not NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic currents. We recently found that loss of Arp2/3-dependent actin remodeling also impairs the recruitment of AMPAR, but not NMDAR, during spine development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, depletion of CP also results in fewer spines and a reduced frequency of mEPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Together, the current and prior studies suggest a new mechanistic model in which spine development and AMPAR unsilencing is facilitated by a CARMIL3 and CP complex that may potentiate Arp2/3 activity, transitioning filopodia to fully functional spine synapses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Schematic of proposed CARMIL3 function during synapse development. (1) In the absence of CARMIL3 and capping protein, monomeric (G-actin) is preferentially added to the barbed (+) ends of filamentous actin (F-actin). (2) CARMIL3 bound to capping protein is recruited to the membrane of developing protrusions through its interaction with Wrp. (3) Capping protein binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments, preventing the addition of G-actin. (4) G-actin is now primed for nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex, which shifts the actin dynamics of the developing synapse from largely linear actin to a dense, branched actin network required for synaptic maturation</p></caption><graphic id="d29e1643" xlink:href="41467_2019_8288_Fig8_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par33">In summary, by leveraging iBioID to discover local proteomes enriched within developing excitatory postsynapses, we have uncovered a rich diversity of receptors, signaling, and adhesion molecules uniquely positioned to promote synaptogenesis. Our analysis of one novel protein we found, CARMIL3, demonstrates that it plays a specific role in spinogenesis by localizing CP to developing synapses, which we speculate triggers Arp2/3-dependent transitions to both morphologically and functionally mature spines. Future studies of this proteome during early development hold promise for revealing new insights in normal and maladaptive mechanisms of excitatory synaptic transmission.</p>

<p id="Par49">AAV-U6-CARMIL3Ctermsg1-HITI-myc-P2A-mCherry-SynI-Cre virus was intracortically infused into P0 Cas9 KI mice. Brain samples were collected at P7, P14, P21, and P28. Samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer, transferred to an epi tube, and spun down at max speed for 30 min on a tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed and was precleared with protein G agarose beads for 1 h. Beads were removed, and supernatant protein density was quantified with BCA. Equal protein volumes were added to anti-Myc beads (Chromotek, yta-10) and incubated overnight. Supernatant was removed, and beads were washed with 1 mL of IP Wash Buffer (10 mM Tris-CL, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA) for 10 min two times. Proteins were eluted off beads with 2× Sample Buffer incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Equal protein densities were run out on an SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-rad, 4561083) and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Successful transfer was verified with a Ponceau stain and membrane was blocked in fluorescent blot blocking buffer for 1 h (Rockland, MB-070) or Blocking Buffer (1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2% milk). Membrane was then incubated overnight in Rat anti-HA (Sigma, 3F10, 1:2000). Membrane was then washed three times with TBST for 10 min each wash and then incubated with either Alexa Fluor Goat anti-Rat (ThermoFisher, A-21096, 1:5000) or HRP anti-Rat (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, NA935, 1:5000). Blots were either imaged using the Li-Cor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System or autoradiography film (Genesee Scientific, 30–100). Original scans of blots are included (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>).</p>

<title>CARMIL3 gene trap morphology analysis</title>
<p id="Par53">HITI constructs were designed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In order to delete CARMIL3 and conditionally label neurons only where CARMIL3 had been depleted, the depletion guide from morphology analysis was used. Following the cut site, which interrupts CARMIL3 in the first coding exon, a P2A sequence followed by Cre and a STOP codon was inserted. This allows for the expression of Cre under the CARMIL3 promoter only when CARMIL3 has been replaced with Cre. P0 Cas9 KI mice that had been crossed with a CMV-Cre mouse (in order to express Cas9 constitutively in all cells) were intracortically infused with the CARMIL3 gene trap virus (AAV-U6-CARMIL3sg1-HITI-P2A-Cre-STOP) as well as AAV-CAG-FLEx-tdTomato. Control WT mice were injected with AAV-Cre-ERT2 and AAV-CAG-FLEx-tdTomato and then injected with tamoxifen at P7 to get sparse labeling as our lab had done previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. At P14, mice were perfused, the brains were cryosectioned, and prepped for immunostaining as described above.

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p id="Par54">Somatic whole-cell currents were recorded from cultured hippocampal neurons on DIV12–16 under a Zeiss Axio Examiner.D1 microscope. Patch pipettes (4–7 MΩ) were created from borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instrument) using a P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument). Pipette intracellular solution contained 135 mM Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 8 mM NaCl, 5 mM TEA-Cl, 5 mM QX-314, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM EGTA, and 0.3 mM Na2GTP (pH 7.3 with CsOH, 295 mOsm/L). Coverslips were superfused with artificial CSF (aCSF) containing 124 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM dextrose, 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 μM TTX (310 mOsm/L), continuously bubbled at room temperature with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. AMPAR-mEPSCs were recorded at −70 mV holding potentials in aCSF with the following modifications: 100 μM picrotoxin, 10 μM bicuculline methiodide, and 50 μM D-AP5. NMDAR-mEPSCs were recorded at −55 mV holding potentials in aCSF with the following modifications: 0 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 100 μM picrotoxin, 10 μM bicuculline methiodide, 20 μM CNQX, 50 μM glycine, and 2 μM strychnine. mIPSCs were recorded at 0 mV holding potentials in aCSF with the following modifications: 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 μM D-AP5, and 20 μM CNQX. No corrections were made for the 8.5–9.0 mV estimated liquid junction potentials of these solutions. Series resistance was monitored throughout all recordings with brief 5 mV hyperpolarizing pulses, and only recordings which remained stable over the period of data collection were used. Data were recorded with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), digitized at 50 kHz with a Digidata 1550 (Molecular Devices), and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. Five hundred currents per cell were manually detected offline using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft) with a detection threshold of 5 pA. Decay time constants were determined from mono-exponential fits of the average current decay using Clampfit (Molecular Devices). All drugs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Tocris. These experiments were performed blinded to the condition.</p>

<p id="Par55">Before plating, cultured neurons were electroporated with SEP-GluA1 and SEP-GluA2. Control and HITI gene trap viruses were added on DIV0 as described above. On DIV12–16, neurons were imaged live on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope in HEPES-buffered aCSF containing (in mM) 130 NaCl, 20 HEPES, 2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 <sc>d</sc>-glucose, 2.5 KCl, and 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.35. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed from background-subtracted images in ImageJ. Protrusions were classified as spines or filopodia as described earlier using the tdTomato fluorescence. SEP fluorescence was measured in an ROI at the tips of protrusions and their base in dendritic shafts. At least five protrusions were analyzed per dendrite.

Images were analyzed in ImageJ for the presence or absence of capping protein in dendritic protrusions. Total levels of capping protein in dendrites were analyzed using z-projections of the sum of fluorescence. An ROI containing the dendrites was creating by thresholding the tdTomato fluorescence and capping protein fluorescence was measured inside this dendrite region.

<title>Replication and statistics</title>
<p id="Par59">All <italic>n</italic> values are from at least three independently replicated experiments or biological samples such as mice or cultures. Sample sizes were generally a default of 3; however, if a larger sample size was utilized, a power analysis was performed following three replicates. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed in Excel (Microsoft) or SPSS (IBM). We compared independent sample means using <italic>t</italic>-tests and one-way ANOVAs as appropriate. Statistically significant <italic>F</italic>-values detected in the ANOVAs were followed by alpha-adjusted post-hoc tests (Tukey’s HSD). We confirmed necessary parametric test assumptions using the Shapiro–Wilk test (normality) and Levene’s test (error variance homogeneity). Violations in test assumption were corrected by transformations when possible; otherwise, the equivalent non-parametric tests were applied instead. Type-1 error rates for all tests were set at 0.05. For all bar graphs, center values represent mean, and error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).</p>
