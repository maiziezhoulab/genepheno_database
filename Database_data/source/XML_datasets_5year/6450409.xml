<abstract id="ABS1">
<p id="P1">The mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology and treatment of depression and stress-related disorders remain unclear, but studies in depressed patients and rodent models are beginning to yield promising insights. These studies demonstrate that depression and chronic stress exposure cause atrophy of neurons in cortical and limbic brain regions implicated in depression, and brain imaging studies demonstrate altered connectivity and network function in the brains of depressed patients. Studies of the neurobiological basis of the these alterations have focused on both the principle, excitatory glutamate neurons, as well as inhibitory GABA interneurons. They demonstrate structural, functional, and neurochemical deficits in both major neuronal types that could lead to degradation of signal integrity in cortical and hippocampal regions. The molecular mechanisms underlying these changes have not been identified but are thought to be related to stress induced excitotoxic effects in combination with elevated adrenal glucocorticoids and inflammatory cytokines, (as well as other environmental factors). Transcriptomic studies are beginning to demonstrate important sex differences and together with genomic studies are starting to reveal mechanistic domains of overlap and uniqueness with regards to risk and pathophysiological mechanisms with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These studies also implicate GABA and glutamate dysfunction as well as immunologic mechanisms. While current antidepressants have significant time lag and efficacy limitations, new, rapid acting agents that target the glutamate and GABA systems address these issues and offer superior therapeutic interventions for this widespread and debilitating disorder.</p>
