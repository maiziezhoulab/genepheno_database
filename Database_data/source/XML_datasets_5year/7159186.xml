<abstract>
<p>Hereditary hearing loss is challenging to diagnose because of the heterogeneity of the causative genes. Further, some genes involved in hereditary hearing loss have yet to be identified. Using whole-exome analysis of three families with congenital, severe-to-profound hearing loss, we identified a missense variant of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> in five affected members of one family showing a dominant inheritance mode, along with <italic>de novo</italic> splice-site and missense variants of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> in two sporadic cases, as promising candidates associated with hearing loss. Furthermore, we detected another <italic>de novo</italic> missense variant of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> in a sporadic case. <italic>SLC12A2</italic> encodes Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, 2Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporter (NKCC) 1 and plays critical roles in the homeostasis of K<sup>+</sup>-enriched endolymph. <italic>Slc12a2</italic>-deficient mice have congenital, profound deafness; however, no human variant of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> has been reported as associated with hearing loss. All identified <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variants mapped to exon 21 or its 3’-splice site. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis indicated that the splice-site variant generates an exon 21-skipped <italic>SLC12A2</italic> mRNA transcript expressed at much lower levels than the exon 21-included transcript in the cochlea, suggesting a tissue-specific role for the exon 21-encoded region in the carboy-terminal domain. <italic>In vitro</italic> functional analysis demonstrated that Cl<sup>−</sup> influx was significantly decreased in all SLC12A2 variants studied. Immunohistochemistry revealed that SLC12A2 is located on the plasma membrane of several types of cells in the cochlea, including the strial marginal cells, which are critical for endolymph homeostasis. Overall, this study suggests that variants affecting exon 21 of the <italic>SLC12A2</italic> transcript are responsible for hereditary hearing loss in humans.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Sounds are perceived by auditory sensory cells, owing to tissues surrounding them, including the cochlear lateral wall. Part of the cochlear lateral wall, the stria vascularis, is critical for production and maintenance of inner-ear fluid with a high potassium concentration, and for generating the positive voltage in the inner ear, important for sound perception, by stimulating secretion of potassium from marginal cells. The gene <italic>SLC12A2</italic> encodes a protein involved in sodium, potassium, and chloride transport essential for proper function of specific cells in the stria vascularis; however, human variants of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> have not previously been associated with hearing loss. By comprehensive genetic analysis of protein-coding sequences, we identified four candidate changes in <italic>SLC12A2</italic> in four families with congenital, severe-to-profound hearing loss. Intriguingly, all four genetic variants were either within or at the 3’-splice site of the exon 21 which encodes a part of the carboxy terminal intracellular domain of SLC12A2. Experiments in cultured cells showed that skipping or mutation of exon 21 significantly decreased chloride influx mediated by the SLC12A2 protein. Overall, our results strongly indicate that mutations influencing exon 21 of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> represent a novel mechanism underlying deafness in humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sensorineural hearing loss is one of the most common sensory disorders in humans, and its onset can be influenced by multiple environmental and genetic factors. Approximately 1 in 500 to 1,000 newborns has congenital sensorineural hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref001">1</xref>], and more than 100 genes have been reported as associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Hair bundles of auditory sensory cells (hair cells) in the mammalian cochlea are bathed in K<sup>+</sup>-rich endolymph at the apical membrane. Proper depolarization of hair cells is achieved via the influx of K<sup>+</sup> from the endolymph through a mechanotransduction channel located on the hair bundles in response to auditory stimuli. Production and maintenance of endolymph with a high K<sup>+</sup> concentration (&gt; 150 mM) and endocochlear potential (&gt; +80 mV) is primarily accomplished by the secretion of K<sup>+</sup> from the marginal cells of the stria vascularis in the cochlear lateral wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref004">4</xref>]. To achieve and maintain the unique composition of the endolymph, multiple energy-neutral ion transporters, such as Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and 2Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporters (NKCCs), are active in the lateral wall cells, along with active transport of K<sup>+</sup> by ion pumps, such as Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> ATPases, and voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref003">3</xref>]. Dysfunction of the genes contributing to homeostasis of the cochlear endolymph, such as <italic>ATP1A3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref005">5</xref>], <italic>KCNQ1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref006">6</xref>], and <italic>KCNE1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref007">7</xref>], leads to CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome (MIM: 601338), Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) 1 (MIM: 220400), and JLNS2 (MIM: 612347), respectively, which all have hearing loss as a major clinical feature. Inner-ear dysfunction, based on the failure to maintain endolymph homeostasis, has been proposed as “endolymphatic deafness” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref008">8</xref>]. Although less clearly elucidated, Cl<sup>−</sup> has also been recognized as important for proper cochlear function, since dysfunction of <italic>CLIC5</italic>, which mediates Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref009">9</xref>], or <italic>SLC26A4</italic>, a Cl<sup>−</sup>/I<sup>−</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> exchanger that mediates Cl<sup>−</sup> influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref010">10</xref>], leads to the autosomal-recessive hearing loss conditions DFNB103 (MIM: 616042) and DFNB4 (600791), respectively.</p>
<p>Genetic analyses of known deafness genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref013">13</xref>] can be applied for diagnostic tests, while whole-exome sequencing (WES) is effective for discovering novel disease-associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref015">15</xref>]. Using WES, we identified three variants of <italic>SLC12A2</italic>, which encodes Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, 2Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), in three independent families with segregating hearing loss. We also identified <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variant in the fourth family. The importance of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> in hearing has previously been reported in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref019">19</xref>], but not in humans. We conducted splicing assays and functional analysis of the identified variants <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the results support the pathogenicity of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variants in humans.</p>

<p>In family 1, the proband was a 7-month-old female infant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, III-1). The proband and her twin brother (III-2) both presented with congenital, profound hearing loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). The family exhibited an autosomal-dominant inheritance mode.

<p>In family 2, the proband was a 1 year, 5-month-old female toddler (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, III-2), who presented as a sporadic case of congenital, severe hearing loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). The proband could not hold her head up or maintain a sitting position until age 10 months, indicating a minor motor developmental delay.</p>
<p>In family 3, the proband was a 1 year, 10-month-old male toddler (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, III-2), who had congenital, profound hearing loss as a sporadic case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g001">Fig 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s001">S1H Fig</xref>). The proband could not hold his head up until 6 months old and only started walking alone at 1 year, 8 months, indicating borderline motor developmental delay.</p>
<p>CT of the temporal bones did not detect any anomaly of the inner, middle, or outer ears in any of the patients examined (family 1, III-1 and III-2; family 2, III-2; family 3, III-2). Visual inspection of the entire body, palpation of the head and neck, interview of affected individuals or their parents did not detect additional symptoms of multiple organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref020">20</xref>], global developmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref021">21</xref>], macrocephaly and epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref022">22</xref>], or schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref023">23</xref>], all of which have been reported to be associated with <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variants.

<p>For family 1, based on trio WES analysis, including samples from the proband (III-1) and the parents (II-1, II-4), we selected 38 coding and splice-site variants with low minor allele frequencies in population databases that co-segregated with hearing loss (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and methods</xref> for details, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s015">S4 Table</xref>). To narrow down these candidate variants, genes were classified into three categories and prioritized for analysis, as described in the Materials and Methods. No Tier 1 genes (previously identified deafness genes in humans; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s013">S2 Table</xref>) with autosomal dominant inheritance were among the candidate variants, and <italic>SLC12A2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref019">19</xref>] was the only Tier 2 gene (genes associated with hearing loss in mouse models; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s014">S3 Table</xref>) among the variants. Sanger sequencing identified a heterozygous variant of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> (c.2941G&gt;T), resulting in a D981Y amino acid change in I-4, II-3, II-4, III-1, and III-2, who had hearing loss, but not in the other subjects tested (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g002">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), indicating co-segregation of the variant with hearing loss, with the exception of I-3, who had hearing loss, but did not carry this variant. To further investigate the possible cause of hearing loss in I-3, we conducted sequencing analysis targeting coding exons of 154 deafness genes and candidate deafness genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref011">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s018">S7 Table</xref>) in this individual. The results indicated that he carried a heterozygous variant of <italic>MYH19</italic> (NM_002473:c.5765+9C&gt;G, rs201008102) associated with DFNA17 with uncertain pathogenicity; however, neither II-4 nor the proband (III-1) carried this variant, indicating that it did not co-segregate with hearing loss in the family. Hence, the cause of hearing loss in I-3 is unknown at present. Overall, although we cannot exclude other possibilities, such as linkage disequilibrium of the <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variant with a possible cryptic pathogenic change, or variants in unknown deafness genes, also present in I-3, which could be responsible for the disease, the <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variant was considered the best candidate for association with hearing loss.</p>

<p>For family 2, trio WES analysis identified five candidate variants in four genes (one variant each of <italic>SLC12A2</italic>, <italic>CASC1</italic>, and <italic>C5orf51</italic>, and 2 variants of <italic>SZT2</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s016">S5 Table</xref>). No Tier 1 gene was among the identified variants, and <italic>SLC12A2</italic> was the only Tier 2 gene. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the heterozygous c.2930‒2A&gt;G variant of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> in the proband reflected a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Human Splicing Finder ver3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref024">24</xref>] generated a prediction value for the altered acceptor site of −41.22%, well beyond the threshold (−10%), suggesting that inclusion of exon 21 is disrupted by the variant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008643.t001">Table 1</xref>). In this family, parenthood of the proband was investigated by counting the numbers of variants she inherited. We found that 98 and 103 of 217 protein-affecting variants with MAF &lt; 0.003 appeared to be derived from the father (II-3) and mother (II-4), respectively, confirming their parenthood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>For family 3, singleton WES analysis of the proband focusing on Tier 1 and 2 genes detected candidate heterozygous variants of <italic>TECTA</italic> (NM_005422.2: c.4495G&gt;C, MIM: 601543) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref026">26</xref>] among the Tier 1 genes and <italic>SLC12A2</italic> and <italic>ACAN</italic> (NM_001135.3: c.83C&gt;G) among the Tier 2 genes. <italic>ACAN</italic> has been associated with hearing loss in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref027">27</xref>]; however, it is associated with other diseases in humans (short stature and advanced bone age, with or without early-onset osteoarthritis and/or osteochondritis dissecans (MIM: 165800) and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (MIM: 608361 and 612813)). Sanger sequencing revealed that the <italic>TECTA</italic> and <italic>ACAN</italic> variants detected in the proband (III-2) appeared to be derived from the father (II-3) and the mother (II-4), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s017">S6 Table</xref>). The both parents had normal hearing; thus these variants are unlikely to be associated with hearing loss. The heterozygous c.2962C&gt;A (p.P988T) variant of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> was confirmed to be a <italic>de novo</italic> variant by Sanger sequencing, and considered the best candidate for association with hearing loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). In this family, parenthood was studied by comparison of two short tandem repeat (STR) markers among the proband and his parents, since the proband was subjected to singlet WES analysis and it was not possible to count the numbers of variants inherited from the parents. STR markers detected in the proband appeared to be derived from the parents (II-3 and II-4), confirming their parenthood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s003">S3B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>These three <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variants were considered the best candidates for causing hearing loss in the families. The wild-type (WT) sequences at the positions of each variant are highly conserved among 90 vertebrate species, and none of the variants were present in public population databases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008643.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In parallel to WES analysis, we conducted sequencing analysis focused on 154 deafness genes and candidate deafness genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s018">S7 Table</xref>) to subjects with hearing loss.

The position of E979 appeared to encode acidic glutamate or aspartate among vertebrate species; thus, polarity of the amino acid residue at this position was conserved. The proband did not show a motor developmental delay or inner ear malformation. STR markers detected in the proband appeared to be derived from the parents (II-1 and II-4), confirming their parenthood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s005">S5H Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Genomic analysis of human population databases revealed that <italic>SLC12A2</italic> is intolerant of functional variation (the z score for the constraint metric for missense variants is positive (2.4), and the probability of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> being loss of function-intolerant (pLI) is ≥ 0.9 (0.96), according to gnomAD version 2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref028">28</xref>]). These scores support the possibility that the missense variants detected in families 1 and 3 alter the function of SLC12A2.</p>

<title>Conservation of exon 21-encoded amino acid residues</title>
<p>Intriguingly, all four <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variants mapped to exon 21 or its 3’-splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Among the 27 exons within the <italic>SLC12A2</italic> genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), exon 21 consists of 48 base pairs and encodes 17 amino acid residues (including partial codons for two residues at each end) in the long cytoplasmic stretch of the SLC12A2 protein, after the 12 transmembrane regions. There are two known alternatively spliced transcripts of human <italic>SLC12A2</italic>: an exon 21-included transcript encoding a long isoform (NP_001037.1), and an exon 21-skipped transcript encoding an in-frame, 16 residue truncated isoform (NP_001243390.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). Therefore, the three missense variants were expected to affect the function of the long isoform, and the splicing variant was anticipated to lead to the excision of exon 21, leading to increased production of the truncated isoform.</p>
<p>Although residues E979, D981, and P988 are well conserved among SLC12A2 orthologs in vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1008643.t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s005">S5D Fig</xref>), multiple alignment of the eight SLC12A family proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) revealed that the residues encoded by exon 21 are unique to SLC12A2 and are not conserved, even in the most closely related proteins in this family, SLC12A1 (also known as NKCC2) and SLC12A3 (NCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref029">29</xref>].

<p>When HEK293T cells were transfected with the vector harboring the WT allele, RT-PCR detected three PCR products as reporter transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The longest product corresponded to the reporter transcript including both exon 21 and exon 22 of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> (filled arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), a shorter PCR product corresponded to the reporter transcript without exon 21 (open arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), and the shortest PCR product corresponded to a transcript containing neither exon 21 nor exon 22 (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The shortest product was also detected in the cells transfected with empty vector (mock), indicating that it was generated from the vector construct. When cells were transfected with vector harboring the c.2930‒2A&gt;G variant allele, the longest PCR product disappeared, whereas the two shorter PCR products remained detectable. These results strongly suggest that the c.2930‒2A&gt;G variant disrupts the inclusion of exon 21 in the <italic>SLC12A2</italic> transcript, resulting in expression of only the exon 21-skipped transcript from the variant allele.</p>
<p>We next explored whether both the exon 21-included and -skipped alternative transcripts of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> were expressed in cochlear tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that expression ratios of exon 21-included/skipped transcripts were dramatically different among mammalian tissues. In whole cochlea and lateral wall, exon 21-included transcript was expressed at significantly higher levels than the exon 21-skipped transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s007">S7A Fig</xref>), with ratios of exon 21-included/skipped transcripts similar to that in the choroid plexus; in these tissues, levels of the exon 21-included transcript were significantly higher than those in the cortex and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Further, expression of the exon 21-included transcript was significantly lower than that of the exon 21-skipped transcript in the cerebellum, with no significant difference detected in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Similar to the results using <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> tissues, exon 21-included transcript levels in cochleae dissected from a 3-year-old male <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic> were significantly higher than those of the exon 21-skipped transcript, while the exon 21-included transcript was expressed at significantly lower levels in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s007">S7B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the qRT-PCR results, RT-PCR analysis detected only exon 21-included transcript in whole cochlea and lateral wall samples from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic>, and predominant expression of the exon 21-included transcript in cochlea from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>fascicularis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s008">S8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s007">S7B</xref> Figs). Predominant to exclusive exon 21-included transcript expression was also observed in the choroid plexus, eye, spleen, liver, intestine, kidney, and ovary of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic>. By contrast, both transcripts were detectable in the cortex and cerebellum of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic>, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref031">31</xref>]. Similarly, both transcripts were detectable in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> brain, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref032">32</xref>]. Overall, expression patterns of <italic>Slc12a2</italic> in mammalian cochlea and central nervous systems determined by RT-PCR resembled those determined by qRT-PCR (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).

<title>Functional consequences of recombinant (rec) SLC12A2 variants</title>
<p>To determine the effects of the <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variants on Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, 2Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransport activity, we established HEK293T cell lines that heterologously expressed WT, mutated (D981Y or P988T), or exon 21 truncated (corresponding to p.977_992del) recSLC12A2 proteins in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was attached to the amino-terminus of each of these SLC12A2 constructs so that the ion transport activity of WT, mutated, and truncated recSLC12A2 proteins could be assessed by monitoring Cl<sup>−</sup> influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref034">34</xref>]. mTurquoise2 (mTq2) was constitutively expressed in these cell lines as a reference fluorescent protein. As cell suspensions were used for our Cl<sup>−</sup> influx assay, simultaneous measurements of YFP fluorescence (F<sub>YFP</sub>) and reference mTq2 fluorescence (F<sub>mTq2</sub>) allowed correction for fluctuations in F<sub>YFP</sub> between measurements that could be attributed to changes in the number of cells in the light path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Prior to measurement, all cell lines were incubated in a low Cl<sup>−</sup>-containing solution, which is essential for activating SLC12A2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref036">36</xref>]. The Cl<sup>−</sup> influx assay was initiated by the injection of a high-Cl<sup>−</sup> buffer. WT recSLC12A2-expressing cells showed biphasic Cl<sup>−</sup> influx kinetics, which was in stark contrast to the monophasic kinetics of empty vector-derived YFP-expressing cells (mock, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The monophasic Cl<sup>−</sup> influx kinetics that were apparent for the YFP-expressing cells indicated that the HEK293T cells retained endogenous Cl<sup>−</sup> influx activity. The time constant for this endogenous Cl<sup>−</sup> influx resembled the slower time constant (τ<sub>slow</sub>) observed for WT recSLC12A2-expressing cells (152 sec vs. 179 sec, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). A previous study also reported biphasic Cl<sup>−</sup> influx kinetics in SLC12A2-expressing cells, likely ascribable to deactivation of SLC12A2 upon Cl<sup>−</sup> influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref036">36</xref>]. Thus, we assessed the ion transport activity of recSLC12A2 and its variants, based on the Cl<sup>−</sup> influx rates determined within 15 sec after the injection of the high-Cl<sup>−</sup> solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). We found that the Cl<sup>−</sup> influx rate for each of the variants (D981Y and P988T) and the truncated recSLC12A2-expressing cells was significantly lower than that of WT recSLC12A2-expressing cells, with values statistically indistinguishable from those of YFP-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008643.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), suggesting that the Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, 2Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransport activity of SLC12A2 was significantly compromised in cells expressing each of these variants.</p>

<title>Association of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> with hearing loss in humans</title>
<p>In this study, we identified four candidate variants of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> in four families with sensorineural hearing loss. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrated that a splice-site variant at the exon 21 acceptor site (c.2930‒2A&gt;G) inhibited inclusion of exon 21 and increased generation of an exon 21-skipped transcript from the variant allele. Further, the exon 21-skipped transcript was expressed at very low levels in mammalian cochleae. HEK293T cells expressing recSLC12A2 proteins carrying each of the three variants showed significantly decreased Cl<sup>−</sup> influx activity. Moreover, we observed abundant SLC12A2 signals in the basolateral membrane of strial marginal cells and lateral wall fibrocytes in non-human primate cochlea, a distribution identical to that reported for rodent cochleae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref016">16</xref>], suggesting a conserved role for SLC12A2 in homeostasis of the endolymph by recycling K<sup>+</sup> from the perilymph to the stria vascularis in mammalian cochlea, including in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref004">4</xref>]. The congenital, severe-to-profound hearing loss in our patients is consistent with the phenotype of <italic>Slc12a2</italic>-deficient <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref019">19</xref>]. In addition to hearing loss, two of our patients (III-2 in family 2 and III-2 in family 3) presented with motor developmental delay. Since the patients with motor developmental delay caught up with expected milestones later, the feature was considered to be comorbid with vestibular impairment that could be compensated, unlike muscle, bone, or brain disorders, which cannot be compensated. Patients with hearing loss and symptoms derived from inner ear dysfunction have been categorized as having nonsyndromic hearing loss; for example, DFNA9 (MIM: 601369), DFNA11 (601317), and DFNB4 (600791) all exhibit vestibular abnormalities as a major clinical feature associated with hearing loss and are categorized as nonsyndromic hearing loss. Therefore, we propose that mutations in <italic>SLC12A2</italic> are associated with autosomal-dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss.</p>
<p>SLC12A2 is the entry site for Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and 2Cl<sup>−</sup> from the intrastrial space to the strial marginal cells in the cochlear lateral wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref004">4</xref>]. <italic>Slc12a2-</italic>deficient <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> show loss of scala media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref019">19</xref>], while homozygous <italic>Slc12a2</italic> deficiency results in loss of endolymph volume, collapse of the otic vesicles with functional sensory hair cells, and a vestibular disorder phenotype in <italic>Danio rerio</italic> larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref041">41</xref>]. The disrupted Cl<sup>−</sup> influx in cells expressing the three variants reported here strongly suggests that the mechanisms underlying hearing loss include, at least in part, impaired production of endolymph secreted from the strial marginal cells, attributable to decreased activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, 2Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporter.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, several reports have argued that <italic>SLC12A2</italic> is associated with other clinical features; for example, a heterozygous p.V1026Ffs*2 variant or a splice variant, affecting both exon 21-included and -skipped transcripts, might be associated with malformation of multiple organs without hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref020">20</xref>], or global developmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref021">21</xref>], respectively. Further, missense variants mapping to exon 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref022">22</xref>] or 17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref023">23</xref>] may increase the risk of morphological or functional disorders of the central nervous system. In addition, <italic>Slc12a2</italic>-deficient <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> exhibit hearing loss, vestibular defects, and additional symptoms, including small body size, hyper-excitability, and male infertility (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref029">29</xref>]). These additional phenotypes were not observed in the probands or in the other family members with hearing loss in this study. These differences could be attributable to the fact that all the candidate variants identified in this study are predicted to affect exon 21, without degeneration of the transcript. We speculate that the variants affecting the exon 21-encoded region without protein degeneration not only deteriorate cotransporter activity, but also affect an unrecognized function of SLC12A2, both of which are critical for hearing. This possibility awaits further investigation before firm conclusions can be drawn.</p>

<title>Difference in the inheritance pattern of hearing loss associated with <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variants between humans and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic></title>
<p>A discrepancy was noted between the results obtained with animal models and observations in our patients in the inheritance pattern of the hearing loss phenotype; our data indicate that heterozygous variants of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> are associated with hearing loss in humans, whereas <italic>Slc12a2</italic> is responsible for autosomal-recessive hearing loss in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref019">19</xref>]. One possible explanation for this difference is that the functional SLC12A2 derived from a single allele is not sufficient for normal hearing in humans, whereas it is sufficient in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic>; however, based on the assumption that <italic>SLC12A2</italic> is responsible for monogenic disease, the idea that haploinsufficiency of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> is associated with hearing loss is inconsistent with the fact that multiple loss-of-function variants of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> have been detected in subjects with multiorgan dysfunction and normal hearing (p.V1026Ffs*2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref020">20</xref>] or registered in ExAC and gnomAD databases (such as p.G55Vfs*5, Y257Cfs*10, Q435*, R482*, P988Rfs*4, K1007Sfs*29, Q1099Ifs*3, Y1111*, and R1133*) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref042">42</xref>], although the allele frequencies of all the loss-of-function variants are very low (the highest MAF among loss-of-function variants in gnomAD is 6.49 × 10<sup>−5</sup> for the p.G55Vfs*5 variant). All those nonsense and indel variants, including p.P988Rfs*4 in exon 21, are predicted to result in degeneration of the transcript by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref043">43</xref>]. Therefore, although the reason for intolerance to loss-of-function variants of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> in population databases remains unclear, haploinsufficiency does not appear to adequately explain the molecular mechanism underlying hearing loss caused by <italic>SLC12A2</italic>, without taking additional modifier factors into consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>An alternative explanation for the difference between human patients and <italic>Slc12a2</italic>-deficient mouse models is that variants affecting the exon 21-encoding region without degeneration of the transcript may alter as yet unidentified roles of SLC12A2, in addition to disrupting ion transport activity, leading to hearing loss as gain-of-function or dominant negative effect. It is intriguing to note that the expression level of the exon 21-skipped <italic>SLC12A2</italic> transcript was significantly lower than that of the exon 21-included transcript in mammalian cochlear tissues, unlike previous reports in brain tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref032">32</xref>]. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggest that the c.2930–2A&gt;G variant leads to expression of the exon 21-skipped transcript and increased overall expression levels of this exon 21-skipped transcript in the cochlea. The exon 21-skipped or altered isoform of SLC12A2 may have roles in addition to ion transport that are beneficial for the central nervous system, but unfavorable for the cochlea. <italic>Slc12a2</italic>-knockout mice have been generated by elimination of both the exon 21-included and -skipped isoforms, by disruption of exon 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref016">16</xref>], exon 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref018">18</xref>], or exons 9–11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref019">19</xref>]. All these knockout strains are reported to result in degeneration of both <italic>Slc12a2</italic> transcripts. Another <italic>Slc12a2</italic>-deficient mouse, with the c.2958dupA variant in exon 21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref017">17</xref>], results in absence of Slc12a2 signals in the cochlea, where the exon 21-included transcript is predominantly expressed. By contrast, the four variants found in our patients are considered to result in expression of the transcript without degeneration of the variant allele, or increased expression of the exon 21-skipped transcript, in the case of the c.2930–2A&gt;G variant. Therefore the consequences of these variants would be expected to differ fundamentally from those reported for previous mouse strains. Hence, to verify the role of the exon 21 variants of <italic>SLC12A2</italic> in hearing loss, generation and investigation of animal models carrying the equivalent variants is required.</p>
<p>The discrepancies between this study and a previous report demonstrating that the exon 21-skipped SLC12A2 isoform retains K<sup>+</sup> influx activity comparable to the exon 21-included SLC12A2 isoform, determined using Rb<sup>+</sup> in MDCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref032">32</xref>], may reflect methodological differences in the measurement of the activity of the exon 21-skipped SLC12A2 isoform.</p>

<title>Role of the exon 21-encoded region of SLC12A2</title>
<p>One possible mechanism of hearing loss by variants affecting exon 21 could be that they exert a dominant negative effect, in addition to resulting in decreased Cl<sup>−</sup> influx activity. SLC12A2 and other proteins in the SLC12A family are thought to reside on the plasma membrane as homodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref047">47</xref>] that form via association of the two carboxy-terminal domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref047">47</xref>]. Whether the WT and variant and SLC12A2 molecules could generate a heterodimer, and thereby alter ion transport activity relative to the WT homodimer, warrants investigation in the future.</p>
<p>Another possible mechanism that could underlie hearing loss caused by the variants affecting exon 21 is that they may affect targeting of SLC12A2 to the basolateral membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref037">37</xref>]. If variants affecting exon 21 alter the asymmetric distribution of properly functioning SLC12A2 on the strial marginal cells, this would affect its ability to secrete K<sup>+</sup> into the endolymph; however, the choroid plexus, which predominantly expresses the exon 21-included variant, exclusively harbors SLC12A2 in the apical microvilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref048">48</xref>], indicating that asymmetric distribution is not fully dependent on the exon 21-encoded region. Whether targeting of SLC12A2 to the apical or basolateral membrane in the strial marginal cells is affected by variants in the exon 21-encoded region of SLC12A2 will be investigated in future experiments.</p>
<p>A third possible explanation for the effects of the exon 21 variants is that they may influence more complex properties of the strial marginal cells, through interaction with other molecules. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that SLC12A2 can be positively or negatively regulated through interaction of its carboxy-terminal region with the K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporters SLC12A7 (KCC4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref049">49</xref>] and SLC12A9 (CIP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref050">50</xref>], respectively. Intriguingly, deficiency of <italic>Slc12a7</italic> causes progressive hearing loss in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref051">51</xref>]. Identification of partners that interact with the exon 21-encoded region of SLC12A2 may provide insight into the tissue-specific properties of the ion transporter isoforms, as well as the molecular pathology of hearing loss associated with <italic>SLC12A2</italic> variants.</p>
<p>The limitations of this study are as follows: 1) the small number of families investigated; additional cases and families, as well as careful clinical follow-up, are required to prove conclusively that <italic>SLC12A2</italic> is associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss; 2) lack of an animal model for investigation of the specific variants identified in this study; a mouse model carrying the <italic>Slc12a2</italic> variant equivalent to those identified in our patients should be generated and their phenotypes should be studied; 3) molecular effect of the variants on exon 21 is only partially explained by <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis; additional studies including transporter activity of the hetero dimers between WT and each variant, plasma membrane distribution in polarized cells, and identification of molecules associated with the exon 21-encoded region should be carried out.</p>
<p>In conclusion, whole-exome analysis or sequencing analysis targeting 154 deafness genes of four families with hearing loss identified <italic>SLC12A2</italic> as a novel candidate deafness gene. The molecular mechanism of hearing loss could include dysfunction of the cotransporter activity of SLC12A2 caused by the exon 21 variants, and may reflect other affected roles of the exon 21-encoded region. Future studies of the molecular regulatory mechanism of splicing of exon 21, and molecules associated with the exon 21-encoded region, may lead to a more precise understanding of the function of SLC12A2 in the inner ear, as well as of mechanisms underlying hearing loss, and provide insight for future development of drugs to treat hearing loss related to SLC12A2 dysfunction.</p>

<p>Medical histories and clinical information were obtained from probands and family members, when possible, by experienced otologists with the expertise in pediatric hearing loss (SM, NM, TM). All probands and/or their parents were interviewed to determine family history, onset of hearing loss, possible causes, progression, and comorbidity, and each individual underwent physical and otologic evaluations.

<title>Genetic analysis</title>
<p>Genomic DNA samples were extracted from blood collected from the probands and their family members.

<p>For families 1 and 2, genomic DNA was subjected to capture of whole-exome regions, using a Nextera Rapid Capture Exome kit (Illumina) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref053">53</xref>], and to massively parallel sequencing, using the HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina). Paired-end read sequences were checked for quality and mapped onto the human reference genome with decoy sequence (hs37d5) using BWE-mem (v0.7.5a), and variants and genotypes were called using the Genome Analysis Toolkit 3.4.46 (GATK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref054">54</xref>] and HaplotypeCaller, after removal of duplicated reads using Picard (v1.106).

Variants and genotypes were filtered and refined using the Variant Quality Score Recalibration workflow, followed by CalculateGenotypePosteriors and VariantFiltration, using previously obtained in-house population WGS data. In the case of the proband of family 3, whole-exome regions were captured using SureSelect Human All Exon v5 (Agilent Technologies) and sequenced using the HiSeq4000 platform (Illumina). Both procedures provided a mean sequence coverage of ≥ 100×, with &gt; 95% of target bases having ≥ 20× coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008643.s012">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify candidate pathogenic variants, changes considered to affect the encoded protein were filtered according to minor allele frequency (MAF) (≥ 0.001 for autosomal-dominant inheritance mode, ≥ 0.003 for X-linked and autosomal-recessive inheritance mode) in public databases: Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP142) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref056">56</xref>], 1000Genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref057">57</xref>], NHLBI Exome Variant Server (ESP6500) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref058">58</xref>], Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref042">42</xref>], gnomAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref028">28</xref>], and the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD) ver1.42 for Japanese subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref059">59</xref>]. In addition, variants from families 1 and 2 were filtered for variants from in-house data with MAF ≥ 0.003, while those from family 3 were filtered for variants with MAF ≥ 0.01 in 600 individuals and family members with or without congenital brain anomaly or hearing loss. The threshold MAF for autosomal-dominant variants was set to 0.001, according to the criterion of “automatically benign” variants for autosomal-dominant variants adopted by the CLINGEN hearing loss expert panel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref060">60</xref>]. The threshold MAF for autosomal-recessive variants was set to 0.003 in population databases and 0.005 in Japanese population databases, to avoid excluding an established pathogenic variant in <italic>CDH23</italic> (NM_022124: c.719C&gt;T) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref062">62</xref>], which is present at an exceptionally high MAF in Japanese population databases (0.00248139 in HGVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref059">59</xref>] and 0.00327511 in our in-house data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref055">55</xref>]).</p>

The effect of variants on splicing was predicted using Human Splice Finder 3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008643.ref024">24</xref>]. Candidate variants were validated by Sanger sequencing, using PrimeSTAR polymerase (TaKaRa BIO).
