<p>Awake fMRI detects the hypoconnectivity partially rescued by <sc>d</sc>-cycloserine treatment in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>MRI has potential as a translational approach from rodents to humans. However, given that mouse functional MRI (fMRI) uses anesthetics for suppression of motion, it has been difficult to directly compare the result of fMRI in “unconsciousness” disease model mice with that in “consciousness” patients. We develop awake fMRI to investigate brain function in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice, a copy number variation model of autism. Compared to wild-type mice, we find that <italic>15q dup</italic> is associated with whole-brain functional hypoconnectivity and diminished fMRI responses to odors of stranger mice. Ex vivo diffusion MRI reveals widespread anomalies in white matter ultrastructure in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice, suggesting a putative anatomical substrate for these functional hypoconnectivity. We show that <sc>d</sc>-cycloserine (DCS) treatment partially normalizes these anormalies in the frontal cortex of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice and rescues some social behaviors. Our results demonstrate the utility of awake rodent fMRI and provide a rationale for further investigation of DCS therapy.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common and heterogeneous disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication and restricted repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, and activities. Human genetics and animal model studies for ASD have rapidly progressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Among the etiology of ASD, copy number variation (CNV) is a well-known cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>), and a mouse model for human 15q11-13 duplication (<italic>15q dup</italic>) is the first CNV mouse model of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>). It is established that <italic>15q dup</italic> mice display abnormal behavior resembling ASD symptoms; poor social interaction, behavioral inflexibility, abnormal ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), and correlates of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). They also exhibit altered spine dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>) and impaired excitatory/inhibitory balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>) in the cerebral cortex, as well as long-term depression dysregulation and abnormal synaptic pruning in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). In addition to these phenotypes, <italic>15q dup</italic> mice show loss of gray matter volume relative to wild-type (WT) mice in several regions, including the hypothalamus, thalamus, inferior/superior colliculus, midbrain, and pons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Given the widespread gray matter atrophy and altered spine dynamics in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice, we hypothesized that these genetically altered mice would show corresponding alterations in resting-state functional connectivity and white matter ultrastructure, such as frontoparietal lobe and bilateral cortices.</p><p>Recent studies reveal that <sc>d</sc>-cycloserine (DCS), a <sc>d</sc>-serine analog, is effective in ameliorating autistic-like behavior or electrophysiological alterations associated with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). DCS may impart a regulatory effect on <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) hypofunction in ASD on the mammalian target of rapamycin activity, potentially resulting in the observed improvement in sociability. However, trials evaluating DCS provide varying levels of evidence of efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>), and it remains unclear whether the prosocial effects of DCS are accompanied by normalization of ASD-related functional connectivity deficits. We hypothesized that DCS would normalize aberrant networks of resting-state functional connectivity in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice, particularly connections to the frontal cortices. Investigating these hypotheses in ASD model mice remains challenging due to the difficulty in performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in awake rodents. To address this challenge, we developed an awake fMRI protocol for mice and used this technique to study the functional effect of DCS on <italic>15q dup</italic> mice.</p><p>While human fMRI is ubiquitous and a promising tool to investigate brain function noninvasively, mouse fMRI provides an important translational tool to bridge the gap between invasive research in disease model animals and clinical research in patients. However, compared to human fMRI, mouse fMRI is limited by the need for anesthesia to suppress body motion during fMRI scanning. Performing mouse fMRI studies under light anesthesia can ameliorate body motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>), but it remains unclear whether this light anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>) provides a reasonable characterization of a completely “awake” state of consciousness throughout acquisition of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) or task-based fMRI in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>). Awake mouse fMRI can therefore provide a fundamental technique to understand the link between circuits and behavior. In this study, combined with careful acclimation training and gentle fixation, we developed an awake mouse fMRI system without anesthetics to investigate alterations in brain function in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice. We conducted two awake fMRI paradigms; rsfMRI and task-based fMRI with other-odorant stimulation as a cognitive task because odor discrimination is an essential factor in social interaction in mice. Furthermore, we assessed whether DCS can improve sociability and normalize any potential deficits in brain function and activation in awake <italic>15q dup</italic> mice.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Physiological measurements, head motion, and electroencephalography</title><p>To enable fMRI acquisition in awake mice, we developed an apparatus for head immobilization, which comprised a head bar that was cemented to the animal’s skull and securely affixed to a head fixation frame (fig. S1, A and B). The immobilization apparatus physically restricted the potential for head movement along all planes. Mice were subjected to 4 days of training before the fMRI acquisition to acclimate to the head bar and fMRI setup, as acclimatization training minimizes acclimation training minimizes stress and anxiety during the acquisition interval (fig. S1C). To verify that adequate acclimation was achieved, we monitored three key physiological measures after each day of acclimation training. Daily monitoring showed that (i) heart rate was abnormally elevated on the first day of training, most likely indicating increased stress levels, but reduced to normal levels on the fourth day (fig. S1D); (ii) respiration rate did not significantly change across four training days (fig. S1E), consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>); and (iii) serum corticosterone levels, which provide an index of stress levels, were significantly elevated compared to levels without head immobilization but decreased to normal levels on the last days of acclimation training (fig. S1F). Normalization of these physiological measures by the end of training suggested that adequate acclimation to the head immobilization apparatus was achieved. There was no significant difference in the respiratory rate and heart rate between WT and <italic>15q dup</italic> groups (fig. S1G), indicating that acclimation training was also achieved in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice.</p><p>Light anesthesia (isoflurane) was administered to enable cementation of the head bar and MRI shimming. The fMRI acquisition commenced 10 min after cessation of isoflurane delivery. To ensure that 10 min was adequate for the effects of isoflurane to dissipate, we performed electroencephalography (EEG) on the frontal cortex throughout this 10-min interval, which indicated that the power of gamma frequency oscillations significantly increased after cessation of isoflurane delivery (fig. S2). We continuously observed EEG until 30 min after cessation of isoflurane with two mice, and the gamma EEG was similar to that at 10 min. This suggested the dissipation of anesthesia effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the heart rate increased from &gt;150 to &gt;450 beats/min in 10 min following cessation of isoflurane delivery. This is consistent with a previous work suggesting that 10 min is sufficient to recover from light isoflurane anesthesia, and blood isoflurane is cleaned in 8 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). Finally, we sought to verify that our head immobilization apparatus adequately suppressed any potential intrascan head movement. To this end, potential head movement associated with each fMRI volume was parameterized in terms of six displacement and rotation parameters (see Materials and Methods). Figure S3A shows these parameters for a representative animal. Given that the head bar was securely coupled to the head positioning apparatus (fig. S1, A and B), head motion was severely constrained along all planes from the first day of MRI training (fig. S3B).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Resting-state functional connectivity in WT and <italic>15q dup</italic> mice</title><p>We used our awake mouse fMRI system to investigate differences in resting-state functional connectivity between WT and <italic>15q dup</italic>-saline mice. To provide a whole-brain characterization of resting-state functional connectivity, the cortex was parcellated into 32 broad regions, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was measured between pairs of regionally averaged fMRI time series to yield a 32 × 32 connectivity matrix for each mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This matrix quantified the strength of functional connectivity between 496 distinct pairs of regions. The network-based statistic (NBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>) was used to identify pairs of regions for which functional connectivity strength significantly differed between WT and <italic>15q dup</italic> groups while controlling the familywise error rate. Hypoconnectivity in the <italic>15q dup</italic> group was evident in a widespread subnetwork that spanned all regions and a majority of connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). The most extensive reductions in connectivity strength according to the effect size were observed in the hindbrain [pons, dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), and regions including lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN)/locus coeruleus (LC)], thalamic nuclei (ThN), caudate putamen (CPu), and motor cortex (MC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). No evidence of hyperconnectivity was found in the <italic>15q dup</italic> group. Last, we sought to assess the test-retest reproducibility of the functional connectivity matrices mapped with our awake mouse fMRI system. To this end, two separate fMRI acquisitions for each of five WT mice were acquired across consecutive days, resulting in a total of 10 datasets. A connectivity matrix was mapped for each dataset, and the correlation between corresponding pairs of matrices was computed. This yielded a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.92 ± 0.01, indicating excellent test-retest reproducibility.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>NBS detect global hypoconnectivity in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Group-averaged connectivity matrices (Pearson correlation coefficients) in WT-saline (bottom, <italic>n</italic> = 15) and <italic>15q dup</italic>-saline groups (top, <italic>n</italic> = 10).

Excretions from stranger mice were used to generate the odor. First, we confirmed that odor stimulation evoked BOLD (blood oxygenation level–dependent) responses in the olfactory bulb, including the superior and lateral glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb (fig. S4, A to C), which is known to be activated by odor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Within the olfactory bulb and cortex, we did not find a significant difference in odor-evoked BOLD response between WT and <italic>15q dup</italic> groups. In the whole brain, the WT group showed a significant odor stimulation–evoked BOLD response in several regions including the hippocampus, ThN, hypothalamus, LC/LPBN, pons, and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). In contrast, the BOLD response in these regions did not significantly increase in the <italic>15q dup</italic> group compared with the WT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>).

Fractional anisotropy (FA) was assessed within each region of interest (ROI) to provide a generalized index of gray matter microstructure, which may characterize axonal loss and/or the effects of demyelination. This diffusion MRI index has long been used to successfully assess gray matter microstructure in both human MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>) and rodent MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). No significant between-group difference in FA was found [<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR)], although FA in most of gray matter appeared lower in the <italic>15q dup</italic> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Given this observation, we averaged FA across voxels comprising each of 16 gray matter regions, yielding regionally averaged FA estimates, with the aim of testing for regional gray matter demyelination or axon loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>). These regionally averaged FA estimates were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), modeling the main effects of gray matter region (16 regions) and group (WT and <italic>15q dup</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The main effect of group was significant, with FA reduced in the <italic>15q dup</italic> group, but the interaction between region and group was not significant. This suggested that gray matter FA reductions in the <italic>15q dup</italic> group were diffuse and widespread, as opposed to being circumscribed to particular regions. We also compared structural connectivity [FA and edge weight (EW)] between the same groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). Although there was no significant difference in structural connectivity between WT and <italic>15q dup</italic> groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 at FDR corrected), the averaged structural connectivity in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice was broadly smaller than WT mice.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>FA and structural connectivity in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Group-averaged FA maps in WT (top, <italic>n</italic> = 10) and <italic>15q dup</italic> mice (middle, <italic>n</italic> = 12) and differences of FA between WT and <italic>15q dup</italic> groups (bottom).

Awake fMRI can bridge the gap between preclinical animal models and clinical human studies. Here, we demonstrated abnormal brain function in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice using two types of fMRI experiments: rsfMRI and task-based fMRI with an odor stimulation task. The first type enables mapping intrinsic regional interactions, which is an anatomically defined set of brain regions that preferentially activates during introspection and shows abnormal activity in psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>) . On the other hand, fMRI using the odor stimulation task provides utility in understanding the cognitive process related to social behavior. Furthermore, in combination with these techniques, we demonstrated that administration of DCS can rescue social behavior and normalize some functional connectivity alterations seen in the frontal cortex of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice. These results clearly demonstrate the utility of awake mouse fMRI.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Utility of awake fMRI to study brain function in mice</title><p>General anesthetics such as isoflurane and medetomidine are commonly used in animal fMRI studies to suppress intrascan body movement. However, anesthetics evoke vasoactive modulation of BOLD signals and markedly alter neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>). Whether anesthesia alters functional connectivity remains controversial. Previous study suggests that light anesthesia preserves patterns of functional connectivity in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><italic>35</italic></xref>); however, others show differences in functional connectivity between awake and anesthetized states. The total power of BOLD oscillations is reduced as a consequence of sedation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>). Light sedation can modify the BOLD response and local field potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>). Anesthesia clearly depresses consciousness, even if residual brain function is comparable to an awake state. In addition, it is impossible to perform cognitive tasks under anesthesia. Collectively, fMRI under anesthesia, even with light anesthesia, is not identical to fMRI in a conscious state, and thus, rodent fMRI performed with the animal anesthetized narrows opportunities to comprehensively characterize brain function and connectivity. For this reason, we developed an awake fMRI system for mice that does not necessitate anesthesia, thus enabling mouse fMRI experiments that were analogous to human fMRI.</p><p>We used a low dose of isoflurane before MRI acquisition to enable installation of the head immobilization apparatus and positioner. Isoflurane has dose-dependent side effects on the cardiovascular system, for example, decrease of voluntary respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>). However, if the animals inhale a low dose of isoflurane over a relatively short interval (less than 10 min), then the animals can recover from these side effects within 10 min following cessation of isoflurane administration. A previous study reported that blood isoflurane was cleaned in 8 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). We verified that animals regained an awake state by showing that the power of gamma band oscillations recorded from the frontal cortex significantly increased in 10 min following isoflurane cessation (fig. S2).</p><p>Despite these advantages, several factors complicate the implementation of awake mouse fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). To acquire high-quality fMRI data in awake mice, two of the most important considerations are suppression of the head motion and minimization of animal stress. We developed a customized head positioner to minimize head motion (figs. S1 and S3) and used robust motion correction methods, e.g., ICA-AROMA (Independent Component Analysis–Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>) and framewise displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>), in addition to rigid body realignment. ICA-AROMA is one of the best performing head motion correction pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>) and does not require additional regression of the head motion realignment parameters because they are accounted for as part of the pipeline. We verified that the extent of head immobilization achieved with our customized apparatus was sufficient to severely limit the potential for intrascan head movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). Recorded MRI noise was not presented to mice in first 2 days of acclimation training outside of MRI scanner to avoid multiple unfamiliar stresses at the same time. Our result showed that mice were stressed even with circumstance of fixed head, without MRI noise, at first day (fig. S1). Animal handling is critical to reduce animal stress. For example, tail handling is known to induce greater urination and defecation during handling, compared with using cupped hands to handle animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"><italic>43</italic></xref>). Therefore, we used cupped hands to handle all animals and verified that by the last day of acclimation training, mice did not urinate during handling and rarely attempted to jump from the handler’s cupped hands. Animal stress was further minimized with the use of mouse earplugs to reduce scanner noise and painless fixation of the head bar. With these advances and procedures, we were able to complete acclimation training in 4 days, which is comparable to the length of acclimation required in rat studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have performed fMRI in awake rodents to assess responses to heat stimulation in TrpV1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44"><italic>44</italic></xref>) and fear conditioned stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>) and to investigate differences between awake and anesthetized states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>). Given that most genetically modified animals are mice, an integrated system to perform fMRI in awake mice is urgently required. This is the first study to demonstrate such a system and apply it to investigate altered brain function and connectivity in model mice of autism. We could provide important evidence for the utility of animal fMRI in future combination with other modalities, such as molecular biology, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral studies using circuit genetics.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional hypoconnectivity and disrupted FA in gray matter of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice</title><p>The <italic>15q dup-</italic>saline group showed widespread functional hypoconnectivity involving the entire cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), which was most pronounced within the forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) relative to the WT-saline group. This accords with human fMRI studies in ASD reporting marked reductions in functional connectivity between the frontal lobes and the rest of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45"><italic>45</italic></xref>). Human fMRI studies also indicate broad functional hyperconnectivity at the developmental stage of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46"><italic>46</italic></xref>) and broad functional hypoconnectivity in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47"><italic>47</italic></xref>). Functional connectivity abnormalities in ASD are therefore age dependent: hyperconnectivity in early development, followed by hypoconnectivity in adulthood. From a developmental perspective, the age of the mice studied here corresponds to early adulthood in humans. Regarding animal models, the phenotype and functional connectivity differ markedly between types of transgenic mice. For example, Fmr1<sup>−/y</sup> mice show robust hypoconnectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48"><italic>48</italic></xref>). Impaired prefrontal functional connectivity is a feature of other ASD mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>). We previously showed that synaptic remodeling was altered at the developmental stage of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>), and this enhanced hyperconnectivity and local circuit stabilization might explain ASD pathology.</p><p>We also investigated FA in the gray matter of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice using DTI, a macroscopic technique enabling estimation of the orientation and organization of the projection of the white matter tracts. FA, a general measure indexing fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination, showed widespread decreases in the <italic>15q dup</italic> group compared with the WT group. This provides a putative anatomical substrate for the observed functional hypoconnectivity, whereby aberrant formation of synapses and dendritic spines manifests as underfunctioning cortico-cortical connections in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49"><italic>49</italic></xref>). This accords with the reduction in FA and functional hypoconnectivity that we observed and supports previous work reporting gray matter alterations in a complementary autism mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Odor perception</title><p>Human fMRI experiments investigating face perception indicate that neural responses to other faces are distinct between individuals with ASD and healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50"><italic>50</italic></xref>). This suggests a neural basis for altered interpersonal interactions in the disorder. Akin to the visual system in humans, the olfactory system in mice is crucial to recognizing other mice and memorizing objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51"><italic>51</italic></xref>). Thus, in mice, olfaction may be considered more important to interpersonal perception, kin recognition, and bond formation than vision. In this study, we therefore considered an odor perception fMRI task to assess odor perception deficits in our mouse model. We found that the region encompassing LC/LPBN, ThN, and hypothalamus was activated in response to odor stimulation in WT mice, but these activations were absent in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The olfactory bulb was activated by odor stimulation both in WT and in <italic>15q dup</italic>-saline mice, indicating that <italic>15q dup</italic> mice show abnormalities in the processing of the odorant information rather than basic odor recognition and sensing functions supported by the olfactory bulb (fig.

In contrast to the olfactory bulb, we observed that <italic>15q dup</italic> mice showed a trend toward reduced activation in response to odor stimulation within the piriform cortex, compared to WT mice (<italic>t</italic> = 2.0 to 2.5). Given that habituation to the odorant stimulation reduces the BOLD response in higher-order olfactory regions, including the piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52"><italic>52</italic></xref>), future work should investigate this effect using alternative stimulation paradigms. Our previous positron emission tomography study using awake mice also showed decreased neural activity of DRN in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). The LC and DRN interact bilaterally through serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)], and the LC also has a noradrenergic projection to the cerebral cortex and ThN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53"><italic>53</italic></xref>). Given that the <italic>15q dup</italic> mice show lower 5-HT levels than WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>), the decrease of noradrenergic and serotonergic projections to the forebrain from the LC and the DRN may induce aberrant neuronal activity in the forebrain, including the cerebral cortex, ThN, and hypothalamus in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Relationship between <sc>d</sc>/<sc>l</sc>-serine concentrations and ASD symptoms</title><p>We found that serine concentration was significantly reduced in the frontal cortices of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice.

Several positive effects of DCS on ASD individuals have been reported, including rescue of social function and amelioration of stereotypies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Supporting these clinical reports, DCS treatment affects ASD-like social or stereotypic behavior in some animal models of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>).

All animal experimental procedures in the present study were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Animal Ethical Committee who followed institutional guidelines in Ajinomoto Co. Inc. and the Ethics Committee of RIKEN.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Surgery for awake fMRI</title><p>For awake MRI experiments, we performed cranioplastic surgery on the mice under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5% with air), as previously described (fig. S1A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44"><italic>44</italic></xref>). Briefly, cranioplastic acrylic cement was mounted on the skull with a male plastic luer fitting (Male Luer Integral Lock Ring Plug Closed, Japan), which connected to a custom-made head positioner to fix the mouse’s head during the MRI session without pain. After surgery, the mice were allowed to recover for more than a week.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>fMRI acclimation training</title><p>During surgery recovery, mice were accustomed to the handling method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"><italic>43</italic></xref>). The handler lifted the mouse with cupped hands and held the animal for around 30 s. This handling continued for at least 1 week. We confirmed that mice did not urinate and did not jump from the cupped hands during handling. Then, mice were trained for 4 days to acclimatize to the awake fMRI conditions before fMRI experiments. They were trained at the same time each day (10:00 to 18:00) to minimize the effects of circadian rhythm variations. During the first 2 days, a pseudo-MRI system consisting of a nonmagnet bore and a head positioner was used. The mice were anesthetized by 2% isoflurane with air for induction and 1.5% with air for maintenance while positioning them on the MRI apparatus and adjusting the magnetic homogeneity, as described in the MRI section below. The mice were set on the head positioner by fixing the cranioplastic acrylic mount. To reduce possible stress induced by scanning noise, we used earplugs designed to fit the mouse’s ears. The body was gently wrapped with paper towel so that they can move freely within the paper towel cover. Mice remained in the pseudo-MRI apparatus for 30 min on the first day and 90 min on the second day. For the next 2 days, mice were placed in an MRI system under the same conditions (except for odor stimulation) as those used for the MRI measurements (fig. S1B). Throughout the training, heart and respiration rate were confirmed to be in the normal range using an MR-compatible monitoring system (model 1025; SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY, USA).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>fMRI procedure</title><p>We used a Bruker Avance III System (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) with a 4.7-T/40-cm horizontal superconducting magnet with gradient coils (BGA12, 400 mT/m). A custom-made volume coil (30 mm in diameter) dedicated for the head positioner was used. The mice were anesthetized by 2% isoflurane with air for induction and less than 1.5% with air for maintenance while positioning them on the MRI apparatus and adjusting the magnetic homogeneity. Isoflurane was administered for no more than 10 min. The cranium of each mouse was then immediately immobilized in the dedicated volume coil by fixing the plastic luer fitting with a nonmagnetic stereotaxic apparatus. Magnetic field homogeneity was corrected using FASTMAP scout. Then, anesthesia was stopped to enable mice to awake. Mice awoke during the 10-min structural image scan. We confirmed that the respiration rate increased over 150 breaths/min following the 10-min recovery period. The fMRI acquisition then commenced. For odor stimulation, the odor was generated from the excretory products from stranger mice. In particular, excretory products were collected from three to five stranger mice. The stranger mice were isolated from the mice used for neuroimaging experiments. Excretory products were manually collected from the housing of the stranger mice after 1 week of housing and placed in the closed odorant box. The excretory products remained in the box for approximately 30 min before the MRI scan. At the commencement of scanning, the odorant box was connected to the odorant tube and air pump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). An animal mask was used to deliver the odor to the nose of each mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The odor stimulation protocol contained five stimulation blocks, each of which comprised a 10-s period of odor delivery, followed by a 120-s rest block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). During the “off” period, fresh air without any odor flowed to the mouse at the same rate as the flow of odor during the “on” period.</p><p>BOLD fMRI data were obtained using a T2*-weighted multislice echo planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: time of repetition, 2 s; echo time, 21 ms; field of view, 16 mm × 16 mm; acquisition matrix, 80 × 80 (200 μm × 200 μm/pixel); slice thickness, 1.0 mm; slice number, 15; number of volumes, 330 for resting state (11 min) and 345 for odor stimulation (11.5 min). While acquisition length is an important factor, we note that previous reports have successfully investigated functional connectivity using less than 300 volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>). The slices were positioned including the mPFC and the cerebellum (+3 to −12 mm from the bregma). Because it was difficult to adjust the B0 field homogeneity in the whole brain, from the olfactory bulb to the cerebellum, we investigated the activation in the olfactory bulb separately. For olfactory bulb imaging, slice number is equal to 5 (+5 to 0 mm from the bregma). Structural images were obtained using a multislice rapid acquisition with a relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence using the following parameters: time of repetition, 2500 ms; effective echo time, 60 ms; RARE factor, 8; acquisition matrix, 128 × 128; and four averages. To confirm that acclimatization training minimized stress, the respiratory rate was measured during the training.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Diffusion tensor imaging</title><p>Diffusion tensor images were acquired from fixed brain tissue. First, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and then intracardially perfused with 30 ml of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing heparin (1 U/ml), followed by 30 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After perfusion, whole brains were dissected and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, brains were washed with PBS and then incubated with PBS containing 2 mM ProHance and 0.02% sodium azide for 2 weeks. On the day before imaging, PBS was immersed to Fluorinert (FC-72, 3M) to equilibrate overnight at 4°C. Acquisition of DTI was conducted in the RIKEN Center for Brain Science in the support unit for Bio-Material Analysis in RIKEN Center for Brain Science, Research Resource Division. We used a 9.4-T Bruker Avance 400WB system (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) with a volume coil of 15 mm in diameter. A spin echo sequence with the following parameters was used: time of repetition, 260 ms; echo time, 18 ms; field of view, 12 mm × 8 mm × 7 mm; acquisition matrix, 120 mm × 80 mm × 70 mm (100 μm × 100 μm × 100 μm/pixel); δ = 3 ms; Δ = 8 ms; number of segments, 4; total scan time, 100 min. Symmetric diffusion gradients were applied with <italic>b</italic> = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> in 30 noncollinear directions and <italic>b</italic> = 0 s/mm<sup>2</sup> (A0 image) for the reference.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DCS injection</title><p>Intraperitoneal injection of DCS (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) or saline (0.9% NaCl in distilled water) was administered to <italic>15q dup</italic> mice. DCS was dissolved in saline. DCS (20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> body weight) or saline was administered 30 min before behavioral testing and image acquisition, consistent with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data analysis</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Preprocessing of images</title><p>SPM8 software (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, UK) was used for preprocessing, including slice timing correction, motion correction by realignment, coregistration of the functional image to a structural brain image, and spatial normalization of the functional data. After head motion correction, the functional volumes were normalized to template image, which are coregistered to the mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55"><italic>55</italic></xref>), using the default nonlinear registration algorithm implemented in SPM8. The data were then processed using ICA-AROMA to correct for any remaining head movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Odor stimulation task-based fMRI</title><p>Following preprocessing, the normalized images were smoothed with a Gaussian filter [full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 0.6 mm]. Statistical analyses for odor stimulation were conducted using SPM8. The smoothed images were high pass–filtered for 100 s. The regressor was constructed by convolving the hemodynamic response function to the box-car model (on/off stimulation). Framewise displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>) was computed and regressed at the first-level analysis to control for head motion. A threshold of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 (FDR-corrected at the cluster-wise level) was used to identify regional activation patterns associated with odor stimulation. To perform group inference, second-level (random effect) analyses were conducted by using the results of the first level analysis <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 (FDR-corrected at the cluster-wise level).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Resting-state functional connectivity</title><p>Framewise displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>) and time series derived from white matter, ventricles, and all gray matter were regressed because global signal is correlated with spontaneous, nonneuronal fluctuation of the blood flow. The residuals from this regression were used for all subsequent analyses. Detrending and bandpass filtering (0.01 to 0.1 Hz) were performed to exclude high-frequency components. Then, the processed images were smoothed with a Gaussian filter (FWHM = 0.6 mm). The Pearson correlation coefficient was computed between preprocessed and regionally averaged (32 regions) BOLD signals to yield a connectivity matrix for each mouse. The regions spanned the entire cortex and were drawn manually on the basis of the structural image corresponding to the mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55"><italic>55</italic></xref>). These 32 regions were selected on the basis of the regions related to the odor recognition and cognitive function.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Network-based statistic</title><p>The NBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>) was used to identify functional connections (pairs of regions) that significantly differed in connectivity strength (Pearson correlation) between groups. We considered six independent comparisons among WT-saline, WT-DCS, <italic>15q dup</italic>-saline, <italic>15q dup</italic>-DCS. To correct for the three independent comparisons, a significance threshold of α = 0.05/6 = 0.008 was enforced. For each comparison, a two-sample <italic>t</italic> test was performed independently for each distinct pair of regions (496 pairs) to test the null hypothesis of equality between groups in the mean Pearson correlation coefficient. This yielded a 32 × 32 matrix of <italic>t</italic> statistics. Connections with a <italic>t</italic> statistic threshold exceeding 3 were admitted to a suprathreshold graph, and connected components, referred to as subnetworks, were identified in this graph. The size of each subnetwork was measured as the number of suprathreshold connections that it comprised. To determine a familywise error–corrected <italic>P</italic> value for each subnetwork, permutation testing (5000 permutations) was used to generate a null distribution for the maximal subnetwork size. The <italic>P</italic> value for an observed subnetwork of the given size was estimated as the proportion of permutations for which the maximal subnetwork exceeded or equaled this size. To isolate subnetworks comprising the strongest effects, the <italic>t</italic> statistic threshold was increased from 3 to 6 in cases where widespread subnetworks were found for the lower threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The NBS provides control of the familywise error rate in the weak sense across the whole network; namely, the set of all connections. The <italic>P</italic> value associated with each subnetwork identified with the NBS was thus corrected for familywise errors across the whole network.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Modularity</title><p>Network modules were delineated in the 32 × 32 functional connectivity matrices constructed for each mouse. A consensus modular decomposition was also delineated for all mice (WT-saline, WT-DCS, <italic>15q dup</italic>-saline, and <italic>15q dup</italic>-DCS). The Louvain algorithm was used to identify modules, with the resolution parameter set to unity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56"><italic>56</italic></xref>). To account for degeneracy in the solution space, the Louvain algorithm was implemented for 100 independent trials for each mouse, and a consensus matrix across these trials was generated. Because of the stochastic nature of the algorithm, decompositions varied across trials. Each cell in the consensus matrix stored the proportion of trials for which a given pair of regions belonged to a common module. Elements in the consensus matrix that were below a value of 0.4 were set to zero. The Louvain algorithm was applied to the thresholded matrix (100 trials) to yield a consensus modular decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>). This process was iterated until the consensus matrices converged between successive iterations. To determine a modular decomposition for all mice, a consensus matrix was first constructed across all mice, where each cell in this matrix stored the proportion of mice for which a given pair of nodes belonged to a common module. The Louvain algorithm was then applied to this consensus matrix. The modularity <italic>Q</italic> score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57"><italic>57</italic></xref>) was used to quantify the extent to which each functional network was segregated into distinct modules. Higher <italic>Q</italic> scores indicate greater modular structure.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Dual-regression analysis</title><p>The REST toolkit (REST v1.8) and SPM8 were used to delineate the DMN. First, the preprocessed fMRI data were temporally detrended and bandpass-filtered (0.01 to 0.1 Hz). We used FMRIB Software Library (FSL) Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) for probabilistic ICA. The multisession temporal ICA concatenated approach was used for all mice in a temporally concatenated fashion for the ICA analysis. A total of 70 independent components were extracted from each analysis group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58"><italic>58</italic></xref>). Of the 70 independent components in each group, a representative network from a previous study was extracted, i.e., local cortical network, associated cortical network, subcortical network, limbic network, DMN, ThN, and cerebellum (fig. S5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48"><italic>48</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58"><italic>58</italic></xref>). DMN was selected for comparison using dual regression. We used dual-regression program (FSL 5.0.2.2) for between-subject analysis, allowing for voxel-wise comparisons of rsfMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58"><italic>58</italic></xref>).

These two mice not only had an identical genotype but also had the same age, sex, and similar body weight. In this test, a pair of mice was used as a sample. Images were captured at a rate of 2 per second by a charge-coupled device camera located above the field. An interaction time was defined as any period of time in which the two mice either contacted each other or remained separated by no more than two body lengths.
