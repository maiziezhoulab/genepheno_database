<p>Cohesin is associated with the developmental disorder Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Fujita et al. show that low levels of cohesin expression in the developing brain result in changes in gene expression that in turn lead to a specific and abnormal neuronal and behavioral phenotype.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Abnormal epigenetic regulation can cause the nervous system to develop abnormally. Here, we sought to understand the mechanism by which this occurs by investigating the protein complex cohesin, which is considered to regulate gene expression and, when defective, is associated with higher-level brain dysfunction and the developmental disorder Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS). We generated conditional <italic>Smc3</italic>-knockout mice and observed greater dendritic complexity and larger numbers of immature synapses in the cerebral cortex of <italic>Smc3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Smc3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice also exhibited more anxiety-related behavior, which is a symptom of CdLS. Further, a gene ontology analysis after RNA-sequencing suggested the enrichment of immune processes, particularly the response to interferons, in the <italic>Smc3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice. Indeed, fewer synapses formed in their cortical neurons, and this phenotype was rescued by STAT1 knockdown. Thus, low levels of cohesin expression in the developing brain lead to changes in gene expression that in turn lead to a specific and abnormal neuronal and behavioral phenotype.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that alteration of the chromosomal architecture leads to transcriptional changes during the formation of the neuronal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Misteli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takizawa and Meshorer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nord et al., 2015</xref>). Abnormal epigenetic regulation of gene expression during this period causes several developmental disorders of the nervous system, such as autism spectrum disorder and Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Urdinguio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourgeron, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cohesin is a highly conserved nuclear protein complex known to regulate not only higher-order chromatin organization, but also gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorsett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wendt et al., 2008</xref>). It is composed of four subunits (Smc1, Smc3, Scc3, and Scc1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Losada et al., 1998</xref>), which form a ring structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nasmyth and Haering, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nasmyth, 2011</xref>). During cell division, the cohesin ring binds sister chromatids together from S phase until the subsequent anaphase, thus ensuring proper chromosomal segregation during the cell cycle.</p><p>Furthermore, cohesin is expressed not only in dividing cells but also in postmitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wendt et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that cohesin may also have cohesion-independent functions. In yeast, cohesin helps establish the boundaries that prevent the spread of silenced chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Donze et al., 1999</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, Nipped-B, which is required to load cohesin onto DNA, mediates long-range activation of the homeobox genes <italic>cut</italic> and <italic>ultrabithorax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rollins et al., 1999</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that cohesin functions in axon pruning of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom-body γ neurons. Its disruption leads to axon pruning defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pauli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schuldiner et al., 2008</xref>), presumably through altered gene expression triggered by inhibition of cohesin, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking.</p><p>Cohesin also functions in the human central nervous system (CNS). Mutations that perturb its function, or those that affect the proteins that regulate it, cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krantz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tonkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Musio et al., 2006</xref>), a rare malformation syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, limb abnormalities, and distinctive facial features. Most of these mutations do not cause overt defects in cohesin itself or in chromosomal segregation, indicating that the disease phenotype does not result from defective cohesion. The developmental defects seen in humans might therefore be caused by altered gene expression due to the disruption of chromosomal architecture by malfunctioning cohesin; however, evidence for this hypothesis is lacking.</p><p>We postulated that epigenetic control of gene expression by cohesin is required for normal brain development and higher brain function. Here, we show that abnormally low cohesin expression in neurons caused abnormal dendrite and synapse formation in mice, which led to increased anxiety-related behavior in mice. Further, gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that genes associated with CNS development were altered in the cortex of <italic>Smc3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice. Thus, sufficient expression of cohesin must be present in the developing brain to ensure proper epigenetic control of several genes and a specific neuronal and behavioral phenotype. Cohesin thus acts as a global gene regulator and contributes to a phase of neuronal network formation.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Generation of conditional <italic>Smc3</italic>-knockout mice</title><p>Smc3 is the critical subunit to establish the ring structure of cohesin. We first investigated the expression of cohesin in terminally differentiated neurons by performing immunohistochemistry for Smc3 in mouse brain tissue. Brain sections from postnatal week 6 (P6w) mice were immunostained with anti-Smc3 and anti-NeuN. Smc3 was expressed ubiquitously in the brain in both NeuN-positive and NeuN-negative cells in all layers of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The expression profiles of <italic>Smc3</italic> and <italic>Smc1</italic> transcripts in the developing brain were also examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). The expression of both genes peaked at approximately embryonic day 15 (E15), when neuroblasts proliferate in the brain. Additionally, expression of both genes persisted in the brain until P8w, indicating that cohesin is expressed in post-mitotic neurons both during development and in adults.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of conditional <italic>Smc3</italic>-knockout mice.</bold> (A) Smc3 (red) and NeuN (green) staining in adult cerebral cortex (low-magnification image, left) and in layer II/III of the cerebral cortex (high-magnification image, right).

Targeted mutation of <italic>Smc3</italic> was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization and PCR of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). We initially deleted the gene using the CAG-Cre mouse (RBRC01828; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsumura et al., 2004</xref>), which expresses Cre recombinase in the embryo at the zygote stage. Among the resulting offspring, mice carrying the CAG-Cre transgene with a deleted copy of the <italic>Smc3</italic> allele (CAG-Cre; <italic>Smc3<sup>+/−</sup></italic>) were crossed with wild-type mice to remove the CAG-Cre transgene.

Moreover, mice with reduced cohesin expression exhibit heightened anxiety-related behavior. This phenotype is consistent with the part of symptoms of individuals with CdLS, who frequently exhibit intellectual disability, increased anxiety, and seizures. Furthermore, individuals with CdLS are frequently hyperactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berney et al., 1999</xref>), which was also observed in heterozygous <italic>Smc3</italic>-knockout mice during the dark part of the diurnal cycle in the home cage (Fig. S3, q and r). However, we could not detect the phenotype reflecting intellectual disability. To assess this point, we need to perform various behavior tests for learning and memory abilities. Because increased anxiety-like behavior was also detected in neuron-specific Smc3 heterozygous deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), the phenotype induced by decreased Smc3 may be caused by a cell-autonomous mechanism. Some anxiety-related behavior tests suggest increased anxiety in <italic>Smc3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice, whereas other tests, such as the elevated plus maze, did not indicate increased anxiety. These findings suggest that the specific neuronal network seems to be affected by Smc3 deficiency. Altered dendritic and synapse formation was also observed in the prefrontal cortex, which regulates higher-order brain function, suggesting that the phenotype of <italic>Smc3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice might be associated with disorganization in the prefrontal area.</p><p>In the current study, neuron-specific <italic>Smc3</italic> knockout led to enhanced dendritic complexity. Analysis revealed that the abnormal neuronal and behavioral phenotype was related to altered control of gene expression that resulted from insufficient levels of cohesion. This result provides clear evidence of a critical role for cohesin in postmitotic neurons and confirms the existence of a chromatid-cohesin–independent function of cohesin in CNS development. Reduced cohesin in the brain leads to defective epigenetic control of several genes and results in specific neuronal and behavioral phenotypes. This finding suggests the importance of tight epigenetic regulation by cohesin at a specific time point in the developing brain. Thus, we have demonstrated a new epigenetic role for cohesion that affects development of neuronal networks.</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests an association between dendritic abnormalities and higher-order brain function. Some genetic disorders, such as Down, Rett, and fragile X syndromes, are associated with dendrite and/or spine anomalies. In Down syndrome, dendrite branching and length are greater in infants compared with controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prinz et al., 1997</xref>), whereas branching, length, and spine density are all reduced in patients with Down syndrome (&gt;30 yr old) compared with age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takashima et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 1991</xref>). Dendritic arborization declines throughout life in individuals with Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1998</xref>). Although neuronal density in the neocortex of individuals with fragile X syndrome is not different from normal controls, dendritic spines appear long and tortuous with prominent heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudelli et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinton et al., 1991</xref>). These variable synaptic complexity phenotypes might be consequences of altered formation, maturation, or pruning of synapses. In our experiment, greater dendritic arborization in the cortex of <italic>Smc3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice might have resulted from deficient pruning of excess immature synapses or, alternatively, from compensating for fewer mature synapses. We cannot rule out the possibility that defective expression of factors that induce synapse formation could also have led to fewer mature synapses. To clarify these points, quantitative time course studies will be required.</p><p>We found that cohesin expression must be tightly controlled in the brain during development, and lower cohesin levels in the brain lead to global changes in gene expression at P7, which results in a specific neuronal and behavioral phenotype. Although the distribution change of cohesin in <italic>Smc3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice was modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>), the occupancy of cohesin inside DEGs was decreased, and this may lead to the disruption of precise gene expression during the development of CNS. Interestingly, the expression of immune response–related genes, especially those related to the “response to interferons,” was altered in the brains of <italic>Smc3<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Interferon-γ participates in the regulation of dendrite and synapse formation via STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore postulate that cohesin supports dendrite and synapse formation at least partially through the regulation of the response of interferon-γ.</p><p>Furthermore, the disruption of epigenetic regulation leads to the up-regulation of immune genes and abnormal synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). Deficiencies in the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3 result in greater expression of immune genes, including STAT1, and lead to abnormal long-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). The up-regulation of STAT1 may be associated with synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tropea et al., 2006</xref>).

Cells from patients with CdLS exhibit altered DNA methylation and cohesin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>).

These findings suggest that multiple genes contribute to these brain phenotypes and that cohesin strictly regulates the expression level of these genes.</p><p>In summary, decreased cohesin levels in mice led to defective dendrite and synapse formation in the brain and increased anxiety-like behavior. Many genes are transcriptionally controlled by cohesin, revealing a regulatory system of chromosomal architecture that is broadly responsible for neuronal network formation. Further studies will reveal specific temporal and spatial changes of chromosomal architecture during brain development.</p></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s11"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were bred and maintained in the Institute of Experimental Animal Sciences at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine.

To minimize the likelihood of animals falling from the apparatus, 3-mm-high Plexiglas walls surrounded the sides of the open arms. Arms of the same type were located opposite from each other. Each mouse was placed in the central square of the maze (5 × 5 cm), facing one of the closed arms. Mouse behavior was recorded during a 10-min test period.

The apparatus comprised a rectangular, three-chambered box with a lid containing an infrared video camera (O’Hara &amp; Co.). Each chamber was 20 × 40 × 22 cm. The clear Plexiglas dividing walls had small openings (5 × 3 cm) to allow access from the middle chamber into each side chamber. In a corner of each side chamber was a small, circular wire cage (11-cm height, 9-cm diameter, 0.5-cm space between bars) that allowed nose contact between the bars but prevented fighting. A habituation session was not performed in the apparatus. An unfamiliar C57BL/6J male mouse (stranger 1) that had no prior contact with the subject mouse was placed in the cage in one of the side chambers of the cage. The placement of stranger 1 in the left or right side of the chamber was systematically alternated between trials. The subject mouse was then placed in the middle chamber and allowed to explore the entire social test box for 10 min. The amount of time spent in each chamber and within 5 cm of each wire cage was measured with the aid of a camera fitted on top of the box. After the first test, each mouse was tested in a second 10-min session to quantify social preference for a new stranger. A second, unfamiliar mouse (stranger 2) was placed in the cage of the chamber that had been empty during the first 10-min session. The test mouse thus had a choice between the first, already-investigated unfamiliar mouse (stranger 1) and the novel unfamiliar mouse (stranger 2). As in the first test, the amount of time spent in each chamber and within 5 cm of each wire cage during the 10-min session was recorded.

White noise was used as the startle stimulus, and the duration was 40 ms for all trial types. The startle response was recorded for 140 ms (measuring the response every 1 ms) starting with the onset of the prepulse stimulus. The level of background noise in each chamber was 70 dB. The peak startle amplitude recorded during the 140-ms sampling window was used as the dependent variable. A test session consisted of six trial types (i.e., two for startle stimulus-only trials, and four for prepulse inhibition trials). The intensity of the startle stimulus was 110 or 120 dB. The prepulse sound was presented 100 ms before the startle stimulus, and its intensity was 74 or 78 dB. Four combinations of prepulse and startle stimuli were used (74–110 dB, 78–110 dB, 74–120 dB, and 78–120 dB). Six blocks of the six trial types were presented in a pseudorandom order such that each trial type was presented once within a block.

The cylinders were filled with water (23°C) to a height of 7.5 cm. A mouse was placed into the cylinder, and immobility and distance traveled were recorded over a 10-min test period. Images were captured at one frame per second. For each pair of successive frames, the area (pixels) within which the mouse moved was measured. When the area was below a certain threshold, the mouse was considered “immobile.” When the area equaled or exceeded this threshold, the mouse was considered “moving.” The optimal threshold was determined by adjusting it to the amount of immobility measured by human observation. Immobility lasting less than 2 s was not included in the analysis. Retention tests were administered 24 h after training.

The circular open field was elevated 75 cm from the floor. A black Plexiglas escape box (17 × 13 × 7 cm) with paper cage bedding on the bottom was located under one of the holes. The hole above the escape box represented the target. The location of the target was consistent for a given mouse but was randomized across mice. The maze was rotated daily, with the spatial location of the target unchanged with respect to the distal visual room cues, to prevent a bias based on olfactory or proximal cues within the maze. Three trials per day were conducted for six successive days. On day 7, a probe trial was conducted without the escape box to confirm that this spatial task was acquired based on navigation using distal environment room cues. One trial was conducted immediately after the probe test, and another probe trial was conducted 1 wk later. The number of errors to reach the target hole and the time spent around each hole were recorded using ImageBM software (see Data analysis).</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>T-maze spontaneous alternation task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohira et al., 2013</xref>)</title><p>The spontaneous alternation task was conducted using a modified T-maze apparatus and an automated video-tracking system (O’Hara &amp; Co.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shoji et al., 2012</xref>).

Areas P1 and P2 were the connecting passageways from the arms (A1 or A2) to the start compartment (S1). Mice were placed in S1 and immediately subjected to a forced-choice run (pseudorandomly assigned to either the left or the right arm). Mice were held in one of the arms (A1 or A2) for 10 s. The door was then opened so that the mice could return to the start area (S1). They were held in S1 for 3 s and then subjected to a free-choice run in which they were given access to both arms. This sequence (trial) was repeated 10 times per day (cut-off time 7,200 s). The intertrial interval was 60 s.

The samples were washed more than three times for 10 min each in 0.1 M phosphate buffer and then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at 4°C. Next, the samples were washed three times in distilled water for 10 min each. After en-bloc staining in 0.5% uranyl acetate in distilled water for 4 h to overnight, the samples were washed three times in distilled water for 10 min each. Samples were dehydrated using serial dilutions of ethanol (50%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100%) for 10 min each. Samples were then treated twice with propylene oxide for 20 min each and impregnated with 50:50 propylene oxide:epoxy resin overnight at room temperature. Finally, samples were impregnated with 100% epoxy resin, embedded in molds, and incubated for 48 h at 60°C. 1-µm semithin sections were then cut on an ultramicrotome (Reichert Ultracut E) and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue. From these, 80-nm thin striatal sections were cut on an ultramicrotome, mounted on 200-mesh copper grids, and poststained in 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water for 15 min and in Sato’s lead citrate stain for 7 min. Grids were examined by transmission electron microscopy (Hitachi H-7650). Images were acquired at 4,000× magnification using a Hamamatsu Photonics C4742-57-12ER CCD-based digital camera and Hitachi H-7650 control software, version 01.02. Postsynaptic densities were measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) by an observer who was blinded to the genotype of the samples.</p></sec><sec id="s38"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>The cDNA fragments of mouse IFN-γ were amplified by RT-PCR using previously described in situ hybridization primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>).

Serial sagittal sections, 16 µM thick were mounted on APS-coated glass slides (Matsunami Glass) and processed for in situ hybridization as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujiwara et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s39"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Mouse cortices were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1.0% NP-40, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell lysates were boiled in sample buffer for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (EMD Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and then incubated with primary antibody diluted in PBS-T containing 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. After washing in PBS-T, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies. An enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare) was used for detection.

The cDNA library was prepared using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit v2 (Illumina) for P1 samples, and TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Gold kit (Illumina) for P3–P21 samples. All RNA-sequencing experiments were run on an Illumina HiSeq-2000, and RNA samples were sequenced with four replicates for P1 samples and three replicates for P3–P21 samples, according to the standard Illumina protocol, to create 31–65 × 10<sup>6</sup> single-end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s42"><title>Read alignment and transcriptome processing</title><p>RNA-sequencing data analysis was performed with TopHat2 version 2.0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) and Cufflinks version 2.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trapnell et al., 2013</xref>).

LB1 (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% NP-40, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF). The cells were subjected to 10 strokes in a dounce homogenizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komata et al., 2014</xref>). Antibodies used for ChIP were as follows. Anti–histone H3 lysine-27 acetylation (H3K27Ac; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stasevich et al., 2014</xref>) and H3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) antibodies were provided by H. Kimura (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan). We also used antibody against Rad21, which has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Minamino et al., 2015</xref>). DNA from input and ChIP fractions were processed and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq-2000 system, according to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, DNA was sheared to an mean size of ∼150 bp by ultrasonication (Covaris), end-repaired, ligated to sequencing adapters, amplified, size-selected, and sequenced to generate single-end 66-bp reads. Sequenced reads were aligned to the mouse reference sequence (mm9) using Bowtie2 version 2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) with default options. After filtering duplicated reads, peak calling and ChIP-seq data visualization were performed by DROMPA version 2.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakato et al., 2013</xref>). To calibrate ChIP-seq data for Rad21, we used the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al. (2015)</xref>. The whole-cell extract from the mouse cortex was mixed with whole-cell extract from human RPE cells, and then ChIP was performed as described. Sequenced reads were aligned to mouse (mm9) and human (hg19) reference sequences. ChIP-seq profiles were multiplied by the occupancy ratio (OR) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). The OR is calculated as follows: OR = (W<sub>h</sub>IP<sub>m</sub>)/(W<sub>m</sub>IP<sub>h</sub>), where W<sub>m</sub> and IP<sub>m</sub> are the number of mapped reads to only the mouse genome from input and IP fractions; W<sub>h</sub> and IP<sub>h</sub> are the number of mapped reads to only the human genome from input and IP fractions.</p></sec><sec id="s45"><title>Cell culture and siRNA</title><p>Mouse <italic>Stat1</italic> siRNA (stealth siRNA; Invitrogen) was used for knockdown experiments. Negative control siRNA (Ambion) with no sequence similarity to mouse genes was used as a control siRNA.</p><p>P1 mouse cortices were isolated and dissociated with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mg/ml DNase1 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at 37°C. DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS was added, and the cells were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 4 min. Neurons were plated on poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine–coated chamber slides and maintained in DMEM/F12 medium containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. We obtained C57BL/6J mice (P1) from Japan SLC, Inc. The mice were bred and maintained in the Institute of Experimental Animal Sciences at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine. The neurons were transfected with siRNA using a 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza). The cells were washed and resuspended in room temperature Nucleofector Solution. The cell–Nucleofector solution complex and siRNAs were then gently mixed and transferred into a cuvette, followed by nucleofection. Knockdown efficacy was analyzed after 72 h by real-time PCR. For immunocytochemistry, the cells were cultured for 21 d and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were then permeabilized, and nonspecific sites were blocked by incubating with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA. The cells were incubated with anti-MAP2 (1:2,000; Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-PSD-95 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific) antibodies diluted in a blocking solution overnight at 4°C. The cells were then washed in PBS and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Because there was variability in PSD-95 punctate signals on neurons from the culture preparations, the number of PSD-95 signals from each group was normalized to the control group (<italic>Smc3<sup>+/+</sup></italic> neurons transfected with control siRNA).</p></sec><sec id="s46"><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Figs.
