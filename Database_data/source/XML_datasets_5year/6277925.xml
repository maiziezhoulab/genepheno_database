<abstract>
<p>Schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective (SZA), and bipolar (BP) disorder are
neurodevelopmental psychopathological conditions related, in part, to genetic
load and, in part, to environmentally induced epigenetic dysregulation of
chromatin structure and function in neocortical GABAergic, glutamatergic, and
monoaminergic neurons. To test the above hypothesis, we targeted our scientific
efforts on identifying whether the molecular epigenetic signature of postmortem
brains of patients with SZ, SZA, and BP disorder are also present in the brains
of adult mice born from dams prenatally restraint stressed (PRS) during
gestation. The brains of PRS mice, which are similar to the brains of patients
with SZ and BP disorder, show an ∼2-fold increased binding of DNMT1 to
psychiatric candidate promoters (glutamic acid decarboxylase 67, Reelin, and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor), leading to their hypermethylation, reduced
expression, as well as the behavioral endophenotypes reminiscent of those
observed in the above psychiatric disorders. To establish whether clozapine
(CLO) produces its behavioral and molecular action through a causal involvement
of DNA methylation/demethylation processes, we compared the epigenetic action of
CLO with that of the DNMT1 competitive inhibitor
<italic>N</italic>-phthalyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan (RG108). The
intracerebroventricular injection of RG108 (20 nmol/day per 5 days), similar to
the systemic administration of CLO, corrects the altered behavioral and
molecular endophenotypes that are typical of PRS mice. These results are
consistent with an epigenetic etiology underlying the behavioral endophenotypic
profile in PRS mice. Further, it suggests that PRS mice may be useful in the
preclinical screening of antipsychotic drugs acting to correct altered
epigenetic mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of new and effective drugs that also show reduced toxicity to treat
the complex symptomatology of schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective (SZA), and bipolar
(BP) disorder is impeded by the lack of pertinent diagnostic tools to assess disease
prodromes, progression severity, and beneficial drug responses. Additional
fundamental hurdles to the identification of new drugs to effectively treat SZ, SZA,
and BP disorder include an insufficient appreciation of the causal and developmental
mechanisms underlying the symptoms characteristic of these diseases. Moreover, the
inability to reproduce the complex nature of these disorders in laboratory animals
is an additional barrier to drug discovery.</p>
<p>SZ and related psychiatric disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders with a
significant epigenetic pathophysiology brought about by exposure to prenatal or
perinatal environmental insults, including stress, drugs, maternal infection, and
trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Khashan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">van Os et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Markham

2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Schizophenia Working Group of the
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Sekar et al., 2016</xref>). Epigenetic studies indicate that aberrant DNA
methylation profiles likely play an important neurodevelopmental role in psychiatric
disease pathogenesis and as a target for drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Mill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Ptak and
Petronis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Grayson and Guidotti,
2013</xref>). We have previously established that prenatally restraint-stressed
(PRS) mice exhibit SZ-like endophenotypic characteristics that can be used to
identify robust and efficacious antipsychotic drugs that normalize epigenetic
mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The frontal cortices of PRS mice, similar to those of SZ, SZA, and BP postmortem
brains, exhibit an epigenetic profile that includes an increase in Dnmt1 binding to
the glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (<italic>Gad1</italic>), Reelin
(<italic>Reln</italic>), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(<italic>Bdnf</italic>) promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Matrisciano
et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Dong et al., 2015b</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2018</xref>) and an enrichment of
5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at these same promoter regions
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Dong et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2016</xref>). These increases in promoter methylation are associated
with reduced levels of synapse-associated proteins, such as Bdnf and Reln (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Dong et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2016</xref>) and behavioral deficits that resemble aspects of the
positive and negative symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Jones et a.,
2011</xref>), and the cognitive impairment, detected in patients with SZ, SZA
and BP disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Murmu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Lisman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Fine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Ruzicka et
al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the enrichment of 5mC at the
<italic>Bdnf</italic>, <italic>Gad1</italic>, and <italic>Reln</italic>
promoters in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of PRS mice
correlates with the behavioral endophenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Dong
et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2016</xref>). Although
there is general agreement that altered epigenetic mechanisms play an important role
in the etiopathogenesis of SZ and BP disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Guidotti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Grayson and
Guidotti, 2013</xref>), little is known regarding the effects of drugs,
including typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs, on the epigenetic modifications
of GABAergic, glutamatergic, or monoaminergic neurons in the neocortices of patients
with SZ and BP disorder.</p>
<p>In the current study, we first replicated previous results on the hypermethylation of
Bdnf, Reln1, and Gad1 promoters in PRS mice. To validate the PRS mouse as a
reasonable epigenetic animal model for studying the actions of specific groups of
neuroleptic drugs acting on altered DNA methylation, we compared the effects of a
typical antipsychotic drug, haloperidol (HAL) [acting at dopamine receptor D2
(DRD2)], and two atypical antipsychotics: clozapine (CLO) [active at various
receptors including 5-hydroxytrptamine receptor (HTR) 1A, HTR2A, HTR2C, and
adenosine receptor A1 (ADORA1)] and risperidone (RIS) (active at DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2C,
and ADORA1 receptors) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Jarskog et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Meltzer, 2012</xref>) with the effects of
<italic>N</italic>-phthalyl-<sc>l</sc>-tryptophan (RG108), a recently identified
compound that selectively targets the catalytic domain of DNMT1 (for structure, see
the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Asgatay et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Animals and PRS Procedure.</title>
<p>All procedures were performed according to guidelines of the National
Institutes of Health for animal research and were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care Committee of the University of Illinois at
Chicago. Timed pregnant mice (Swiss albino ND4) were obtained from Envigo
(Indianapolis, IN). Pregnant dams were individually housed with a 12-hour
light/dark cycle and food and water available ad libitum. The pregnant mice
were left to habituate to the new housing conditions for 1 to 2 days and
were then randomly assigned to nonstressed (NS) or stressed groups. NS dams
were left undisturbed throughout gestation, whereas stressed dams were
subjected to repeated episodes of restraint stress, as described previously
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>). Experiments
were performed on mice between PNDs 60 and 85. Male mice were chosen for the
experiments because they exhibit more robust and consistent stereotyped
behavior, reduced social interactions, prepulse inhibition, and
fear-conditioning deficits than female mice. However, in a recent study
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Dong et al., 2018</xref>) we also
established that female PRS mice show more anxiety than male mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5">
<title>Drug Treatment.</title>
<p>CLO (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, Princeton, NJ), HAL (Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis,
MO), and RIS (Tocris Bioscience, Minneapolis, MN) were dissolved as
previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dong et al.,
2008</xref>). RG108 was dissolved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).</p>
<p>Drugs (CLO 5 mg/kg, HAL 1 mg/kg, and RIS 0.5 and 5 mg/kg) were administered
to PRS and NS mice at PND 60–75 subcutaneously twice daily for 5
consecutive days. It is noteworthy that drugs used in this study elicited
catalepsy (HAL), and sedation (CLO, RIS) which are maximal after
approximately 1 hour but disappear after 18 hours of washout when the
animals were resubmitted to the behavioral tests.</p>
<p>It should be noted that drug doses and duration of treatment were chosen on
the basis of preliminary studies showing that CLO (5 mg/kg) requires
multiple days of treatment to improve behavioral deficits and elicits
demethylation of hypermethylated Reln promoters in mice treated protractedly
with large doses of methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dong et al.,
2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Guidotti et al.,
2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Alachkar et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>RG108 is a noncompetitive antagonist of DNMT1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Asgatay et al., 2014</xref>). Because RG108 does not enter the
brain at sufficient concentrations due to the blood-brain barrier, it was
administered by intracerebroventricular infusion using an osmotic mini pump
connected with a brain infusion kit (Alzet; Durect Corporation, Cupertino,
CA). The pump delivered a 0.5 <italic>μ</italic>l/h solution
containing 100 nmols of RG108 in 10% DMSO in 72 <italic>μ</italic>l
for 5 days. Vehicle (VEH; 10% DMSO alone) was administered to corresponding
control groups using a similar pump delivery regimen. Behavioral tests were
conducted 18 hours after the last administration of RG108, antipsychotic
drug, or VEH.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6">
<title>Behavioral Tests.</title>
<p>Stereotyped rearing activity and social interactions were examined in
succession on the same day between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM. We selected PNDs
60–75 for behavioral testing because at this postnatal time, the
performance of the offspring was more reproducible and stable than the
performance measured at earlier developmental time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Matrisciano et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7">
<title>Stereotype Rearing Activity.</title>
<p>A computerized Animal Activity Monitoring System with VersaMax software
(AccuScan Instruments, Columbus, OH) was used for the quantification and
tracking of vertical activity in mice, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Matrisciano et al., 2013</xref>). The total
number of interruptions of the vertical sensors was taken as a measure of
stereotyped behavior. Activities were recorded for 15 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8">
<title>Social Interaction.</title>
<p>Social interaction was measured using the “Thee-Chambers
Apparatus” described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Social approaches were defined as the ratio of the sniffing time for the wire
cup enclosing the stranger mouse versus that for the empty cup. The
reliability of the measurements was assessed by correlating the scores of
different raters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9">
<title>Experimental Design.</title>
<p>For these experiments, we used three independent cohorts of mice. In the
first cohort, we compared CLO to HAL in six groups of mice: Group 1, NS mice
receiving VEH; Group 2, NS mice receiving CLO; Group 3, NS mice receiving
HAL; Group 4, PRS mice receiving VEH; Group 5, PRS mice receiving CLO; and
Group 6, PRS receiving HAL. In the second cohort, we have: Group 1, NS mice

<title>PFC Dissection.</title>
<p>A Jacobowitz mouse brain slicer matrix was used for the dissection of the

slices of 1 mm were mounted on a cold coverslip and disks of 1.5 mm in
diameter were punched from the frontoparietal motor and sensory cortices.

distinguish 5mC from the approximately 20% of methylcytosines in the brain
that are 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Wen et

Ct(meDNA − IP)]</sup> × 100%, where IP is
immunoprecipitation and meDNA is methylated DNA. The efficiency of methyl
DNA immunoprecipitation was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription

(methylated/hydroxymethylated and unmethylated DNA), as well as control
primers for the testis-specific H2B histone gene (TSH2B; which is methylated
in all somatic cells but not in testis), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

polyclonal anti-H3Kacetylated (H3Kac) (1:1000; Millipore-Sigma); monoclonal

were highly specific. After immunoblotting, only a single reactive band was
detected, and the corresponding molecular weight was that of expected

synthetic peptides resulted in a complete loss of signal. In all blots, the
optical density of the H3Kac, H3K4me<sup>3</sup>, and H3K27me<sup>3</sup>

<title>CLO, but neither HAL nor RIS, Corrects the Behavioral Endophenotype in
PRS Mice.</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> reports the high-affinity
neurotransmitter receptor profile of three antipsychotic drugs, CLO, HAL,
and RIS, each of which was tested for the ability to correct the behavioral
endophenotypes and the molecular abnormalities in PRS mice. We previously
established that PRS mice exhibit several behavioral alterations, including
increased stereotypy, deficits in social interaction time, hyperlocomotor
activity in an open field, and deficits in prepulse inhibition of acoustic
startle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Matrisciano et al., 2013</xref>).
The behavioral studies with PRS mice include increased vertical activity
(stereotyped behavior) and reduced social interaction. These tests were
selected because they produce limited distress for the animals that are then
used for subsequent biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>). For the behavioral experiments, young adult
(PND 60–75), NS, and PRS male mice were treated for 5 days with
either VEH or the drug under study and then withdrawn for 18 hours to
eliminate any acute effects of antipsychotic drugs on behavior. As shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, we replicated previous
reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>) that CLO
corrects the behavioral endophenotypes associated with PRS mice, whereas HAL
fails to do so. In addition, we observed that RIS (0.5 or 5 mg/kg) was
ineffective at reducing the increased stereotyped behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) or relieving the social
interaction deficit of PRS mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1B</xref>). To establish whether CLO produces its behavioral effects via
a causal control of DNMT-mediated promoter methylation, we compared the
epigenetic action of CLO with that of the DNMT1 competitive inhibitor RG108
in PRS mice. The intracerebroventricular infusion of RG108 (100 nmol/day for
5 days), similar to CLO (5 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days), corrects the
behavioral endophenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To establish the concept that Bdnf promoter methylation modulates the

DNA methylation enrichment at cytosines proximal to the transcriptional
start site of the Bdnf-ix promoter in the dorsal hippocampus of PRS mice. We
observed that the enrichment of cytosine methylation at the Bdnf-ix promoter
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) was not reduced in either
PRS or NS mice treated with HAL or RIS. In contrast, in a replication of our

target promoters (Bdnf-ix, Gad1, and Reln). Collectively, these data suggest
that CLO, unlike HAL or RIS, may limit DNA methylation, either by reducing
the expression of Dnmts, or more likely by interfering with Dnmt1-DNA

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we describe a neurodevelopmental, epigenetic mouse model for
psychiatric disease (the in utero stressed mouse or PRS mouse) that in the cerebral
cortex expresses an increased DNMT1 binding and 5-cytosine hypermethylation of
promoters (Reln, Gad1, and Bdnf) that represent the core epigenetic
pathophysiological signature underlying SZ, SZA, and BP disorders. This model
responds to the administration of CLO with striking behavioral and neuroepigenetic
improvements, whereas HAL and RIS fail to do so. The behavioral and molecular
effects of CLO are mimicked by the intracerebroventricular injection of the DNMT
inhibitor RG108 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Asgatay et al., 2014</xref>),
suggesting that PRS mice may help to identify novel families of neuroleptic drugs
capable of reducing DNA hypermethylation and correcting the behavioral
endophenotypes associated with these disorders.</p>
<p>Mice born from mothers stressed during gestation show that, as in humans,
environmental insults occurring at critical periods of central nervous system
development can trigger epigenetic modifications at psychiatric disorder candidate
genes, including <italic>Reln</italic>, <italic>Gad1</italic>, and
<italic>Bdnf</italic>, leading to their downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Khashan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">van Os et
al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Markham and Koenig
2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">McGowan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Cao-Lei et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Scheinost et al., 2017</xref>). These
epigenetic changes are paralleled by behavioral deficits that are phenotypically
reminiscent of those observed in psychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, the PRS mouse model has value as an
experimental epigenetic model for SZ, SZA, and BP disorder and can be useful for
screening potential new anti-SZ/SZA/BP disorder drugs for preclinical efficacy and
perhaps prophylactic intervention.</p>
<p>Despite the large numbers of preclinical and clinical efforts aimed at delineating
the role of major neurotransmitter receptors in the anti-SZ profile of different
classes of antipsychotic drugs, little is known regarding the role that these
receptors play in the regulation of the neurodevelopmental epigenetic pathology
underlying SZ and related psychiatric disorders. Here, we show that by investigating
the behavioral and molecular neuroepigenetic alterations induced by typical and
atypical neuroleptic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Jarskog et al.,
2007</xref>), it should be possible to identify or exclude the contribution of
each receptor or combination of receptors and their corresponding signal
transduction mechanisms to the regulation of altered chromatin remodeling events in
PRS mice.</p>
<p>For example, we compared two atypical (CLO and RIS) and one typical (HAL)
antipsychotic drug on the behavioral and molecular (chromatin remodeling)
alterations observed in PRS mice. We confirmed previous results that doses of HAL
that are capable of blocking DRD2 function and inducing extrapyramidal side effects
but do not have serotonin receptor affinity, fail to normalize the altered
behavioral endophenotypes or to reduce promoter hypermethylation in PRS mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, CLO, which binds with
high affinity to serotonin receptors but with low affinity to DRD2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), normalizes the altered endophenotypes
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and aberrant chromatin remodeling
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These data suggest that the effects of CLO are not mediated solely
by the blockade of DRD2 function.</p>
<p>To further clarify this issue, we studied RIS (an antipsychotic drug with high
affinity for both DRD2 and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2C, and ADORA1; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This atypical antipsychotic drug
failed to induce the restorative behavioral and molecular effects reported with CLO
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The lack of effects of HAL or RIS on the behavioral and molecular
neuroepigenetic endophenotypes of PRS mice support the concept that DRD2 as well
HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2C, and ADORA1 are not necessary to explain the corrective action
of CLO in our PRS mouse model. However, we cannot rule out a role for CHM1 receptors
at this point. The question of whether CLO modulates DNA methylation dynamics
bypassing specific neurotransmitter receptors by directly interfering with the
binding of DNMT1 to candidate SZ gene promoters or by activating DNA demethylation
processes also remains unresolved.</p>
<p>To establish whether the restorative effects of CLO on altered Dnmt1 binding and DNA
methylation processes are independent from their action on neurotransmitter
receptors and instead dependent on a direct action on DNA methylating and
demethylating enzymes and cofactors, we treated mice with RG108, a competitive Dnmt1
antagonist with no known neurotransmitter receptor agonist or antagonist affinity
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Asgatay et al., 2014</xref>). This drug reduces
the increased DNMT1 binding to the <italic>Bdnf</italic>, <italic>Reln</italic>, and
<italic>Gad1</italic> promoters, and also reduces the enrichment of 5mC to these
promoters and restores the behavioral deficits in PRS mice. To explain the
behavioral and biochemical action of CLO, we studied whether CLO, like VPA, could
alter histone post-transcriptional modifications. In addition, there has been at
least one report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Huang et al., 2007</xref>) showing
increased H3K4me<sup>3</sup> in the mouse cerebral cortex after CLO administration
(5 mg/kg) for 21 days. However, no CLO-mediated action on histones was detected with
the drugs and doses tested in our study. We also studied the effects of CLO on the
expression of DNMTs and TETs (ten 11 translocation family of proteins) and observed
that these enzymes are slightly increased in the cortices of PRS mice. CLO
normalizes the increased levels in the PRS mice but fails to change the basal level
of the enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In preliminary studies, we tested whether CLO has Dnmt1 inhibitory activity using
purified recombinant protein in vitro. CLO was ineffective at inhibiting Dnmt1
activity up to concentrations of 10<sup>−3</sup> M (unpublished data). Hence,
the mechanisms underlying the marked effects of CLO on DNA methylation are not yet
adequately explained.</p>
<p>Overall, the data suggest that drugs or conditions that reduce DNA methylation by
reducing DNMT levels, or by blocking DNMT binding or activity to SZ target genes may
be desirable or even required, either alone or in association with antipsychotic
drugs, to restore normal behavioral activity in PRS mice and likewise to provide
beneficial effects to patients with BP disorder, SZA, and SZ who have an underlying
epigenetic etiopathogenesis.</p>
<p>The PRS mouse model is insensitive to neuroleptic drugs (i.e., HAL, RIS) that do not
have an epigenetic action but is sensitive to drugs like CLO, VPA, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Matrisciano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dong et al., 2016</xref>), and RG108 (present results) because these
drugs modulate chromatin function. In this context, PRS mice behave like patients
with “antipsychotic-resistant” SZ, predicting treatment responses to
CLO and as yet unexplored neuroleptic agents. The above data support our scientific
premise that the PRS mouse represents a relevant model for studying interactions
between antipsychotic drugs and aberrant epigenetic mechanisms that underlie the
behavioral pathology associated with SZ, SZA, and BP disorder.</p>
<p>Collectively, the behavioral and biochemical data with neuroleptic drugs support the
hypothesis that the PRS mouse has value to screen for novel antipsychotic drugs with
improved clinical efficacy and lower side effect liability. Furthermore, the PRS
model theoretically has the potential for predicting treatment responses at specific
initial stages of the illness with particular attention to early disease detection
and possible prophylactic intervention.</p>
