<p id="Par1">The N-terminal domain (NTD) of the GluN1 subunit (GluN1-NTD) is important for NMDA receptor structure and function, but the interacting proteins of the GluN1-NTD are not well understood. Starting with an unbiased screen of ~ 1,500 transmembrane proteins using the purified GluN1-NTD protein as a bait, we identify Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) as a potential interacting protein. PCDH7 is highly expressed in the brain and has been linked to CNS disorders, including epilepsy. Using primary neurons and brain slice cultures, we find that overexpression and knockdown of PCDH7 induce opposing morphological changes of dendritic structures. We also find that PCDH7 overexpression reduces synaptic NMDA receptor currents. These data show that PCDH7 can regulate dendritic spine morphology and synaptic function, possibly via interaction with the GluN1 subunit.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are a subclass of glutamate-gated ion channels that are heterotetramers consisting two GluN1 subunits and two GluN2A-D/GluN3A-B subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. NMDARs are critical modulators of synapse formation and synaptic transmission. Dysfunction of NMDARs (hyperactivity or hypofunction) have been linked to various central nervous system (CNS) diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, including epilepsies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Each NMDAR subunit contains an extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD), ligand binding domain (LBD), transmembrane domain (TMD) and a cytoplasmic tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of GluN1 has been reported to regulate NMDAR subunit oligomerization and assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Functionally, GluN1 NTD is involved in modulating NMDA receptor gating and pharmacological properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. EphB receptors have been reported to bind GluN1-NTD and regulate excitatory synapse formation via this interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Other binding partners of GluN1-NTD remain to be discovered.</p>
<p id="Par3">The cadherin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules consists of more than 100 members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Protocadherins comprise the largest family within the cadherin superfamily, and consist of two major groups, depending on if the genes are clustered on the chromosome: clustered protocadherins and nonclustered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Non-clustered protocadherins (PCDHδ family) are predominantly expressed in the nervous system, and multiple members from this group have been shown to modulate axon/dendrite structure and function and have been reported to be possibly related to human neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. For instance, PCDH8 and PCDH10 (δ2 subfamily) co-localize with PSD95 and regulate dendritic spine density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. PCDH9 (δ1 subfamily) has been linked to autism spectrum disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, PCDH17 (δ2 family) to schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and PCDH19 (δ2 family) to epilepsy in females with mental retardation (EFMR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">PCDH7 belongs to the PCDHδ1 subfamily and is also called BH (brain, heart)-protocadherin because of its predominant expression in brain and heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In the brain, based on the RNA-seq data from sorted cells, PCDH7 is highly expressed in neurons and astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Despite the expression pattern, most studies on PCDH7 have focused on its role in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In recent years, a few studies have implied the role of PCDH7 in brain function: MeCP2 can bind to the promoter region of PCDH7 and down regulate its mRNA level, suggesting a possible link between PCDH7 and Rett syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>; genome-wide association studies (<italic>GWAS</italic>) show that PCDH7 is linked to epilepsies, is a risk factor for shorter sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and is associated with antipsychotic treatment response in schizophrenia patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. On the molecular level, in a proteomic analysis of synaptic clefts, PCDH7 was found in the excitatory synaptic cleft<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. All the data point to a potential role of PCDH7 in the brain and perhaps in synapses, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p id="Par5">Here we discover that PCDH7 is a potential binding partner of GluN1-NTD via an unbiased screen. We find that <italic>Pcdh7</italic> gene expression is colocalized with <italic>Grin1</italic> in neurons and find PCDH7 enriched in postsynaptic densities (PSDs). When overexpressed, PCDH7 causes “collapse” of dendritic spines and reduces NMDAR currents. In contrast knockdown of PCDH7 results in elongation of spines. Taken together, our findings reveal that PCDH7 is a synaptically localized, GluN1-interacting protein that regulates synapse morphology and function.</p>

<title>Identification of PCDH7 as a potential GluN1 interactor</title>
<p id="Par6">To identify binding partners of the GluN1-NTD, we used an unbiased screen of single-pass transmembrane proteins. This library of clones consists of about 1,500 genes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>) that were individually expressed in the COS-7 cells. We purified the NTD of GluN1 fused at the C terminus to the immunoglobulin Fc region for use as bait. The purified protein was incubated with the COS-7 cells expressing single-pass transmembrane proteins in two replicate experiments (two independent sets of plates). Binding was assessed by detecting the bait protein with fluorescently labeled antibody that recognizes the immunoglobin Fc. Based on the z-score cut-off of 5, out of the ~ 1,500 proteins screened, PCDH7 was the only specific hit that showed up on replicate plates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>A, left, one representative plate). There were 20 cadherins (including <italic>N</italic>-Cadherin) and 29 protocadherins included in the library of this screening and none showed binding to GluN1-NTD except for PCDH7. The only other proteins with significant signal were Fc receptors and ARMCX3 and TIE1 which were all considered non-specific because these proteins appear repeatedly as hits in screens with other unrelated bait proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>A, right).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Unbiased screen for GluN1-NTD binding partners. (<bold>A</bold>) left, one representative plate showing results from expression cloning screen with a library of ~ 1,500 single pass transmembrane proteins testing for binding to the purified NTD of GluN1 tagged with human-Fc. The screen was run with duplicate plates for all ~ 1,500 proteins. The <italic>x</italic>-axis shows 384 wells from a single representative plate.

</p>
<p id="Par7">To validate PCDH7 as an interacting protein of GluN1-NTD, we transiently overexpressed PCDH7 in HEK293 cells, and added either purified Fc-tagged GluN1-NTD or Fc-tagged PD-L1 as a negative control to the cells. After incubation, we stained the cells with FITC-conjugated Fc antibody and used flow cytometry (FACS analysis) to measure the FITC signal. The intensity of the FITC signal reflected the amount of Fc-tagged protein bound to the cell surface. Consistent with the screening results, GluN1-NTD bound to the cell surface of PCDH7-transfected cells, but not the untransfected cells. In addition, Fc-tagged PD-L1 protein did not bind to the PCDH7 overexpressing cells, suggesting the binding was specific between GluN1-NTD and PCDH7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>B).</p>
<p id="Par8">We were unable to show association of PCDH7 and GluN1 by coimmunoprecipitation (IP) experiments from CHO cells overexpressing GluN1/GluN2A together with PCDH7, or from mouse brain lysates (data not shown). It is possible that the interaction between PCDH7 and GluN1 is of too low affinity to be detected by these methods, or that the interaction depends on some quaternary structure that is disrupted by detergent solubilization of CHO cells or brain tissue.</p>

<sec id="Sec4">
<title>PCDH7 modulates Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibition of NMDA current</title>
<p id="Par9">The NTD of GluN1 subunit is involved in Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibition of NMDA current. In the presence of NMDA receptor agonists glutamate and glycine, GluN1/GluN2A receptors exhibit a biphasic Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibition curve with IC<sub>50</sub> values in nanomolar and micromolar ranges for the high affinity and low affinity binding sites, respectively. Deletion of GluN1-NTD results in significantly reduced Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibition of GluN1/GluN2 receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Given that PCDH7 can bind the GluN1-NTD, we tested whether PCDH7 affects Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibition using a CHO cell line that stably expresses GluN1 and GluN2A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. We transfected these GluN1/GluN2A expressing CHO cells with either GFP or PCDH7 + GFP, and recorded NMDAR currents from the transfected cells in response to application of glutamate/glycine and a series of increasing concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions. The baseline currents from GFP and PCDH7 transfected cells before Zn<sup>2+</sup> application were comparable (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). As expected we observed a biphasic Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibition curve in GFP transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>C, left), with nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> value corresponding to high affinity Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>C, top) and micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> value corresponding to low affinity Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>C, bottom). Expression of PCDH7 modestly but significantly decreased Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibition, shifting the Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibition dose response curve to the right compared to GFP alone: high affinity IC<sub>50</sub> shifted from 2 to 4 nM (p = 0.03) and low affinity IC<sub>50</sub> shifted from 79.5 to 165.3 μM (p = 0.04) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>C,D). Overexpression of PCDH7 also reduced the maximal inhibition caused by binding to high affinity Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites (63% vs. 74% inhibition) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>D). These results showing an effect on this NTD-dependent modulation of NMDARs support the hypothesis that PCDH7 interacts with GluN1 NTD.</p>

<title>PCDH7 is present in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mouse postnatal brain and is enriched in PSD fractions</title>
<p id="Par10">Next, we investigated the expression pattern of <italic>Pcdh7</italic> mRNA in mouse brain by in situ hybridization (ISH) with a non-isotopic assay. In adult mouse brain, using dual labeling ISH, we found that <italic>Pcdh7</italic> and <italic>Grin1</italic> were broadly expressed and co-localized in neurons, including in cell layers composed predominantly of excitatory neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>A). In addition, <italic>Pcdh7</italic> mRNA was also sometimes co-localized with inhibitory neuronal markers such as parvalbumin (<italic>Pvalb</italic>), somatostatin (<italic>Sst</italic>), vasoactive intestinal peptide (<italic>Vip</italic>), and Neuropeptide Y (<italic>Npy</italic>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>B).

<p id="Par11">We performed immunoblotting of mouse forebrain at different ages to examine PCDH7 at the protein level during development. PCDH7 protein increased postnatally, peaked around P14-P28, and continued into adulthood (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>C). The temporal expression pattern of PCDH7 protein was somewhat similar to the NMDA receptor GluN1, but was almost opposite of <italic>N</italic>-Cadherin. Protein fractionation experiments of mouse forebrain showed that PCDH7 was enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions, together with <italic>N</italic>-Cadherin, PSD95 and GluN1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>D). Proteomic studies have reported that PCDH7 is present in the excitatory synaptic clefts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that PCDH7 is concentrated in synapses, where it could interact with NMDARs.</p>

<title>Knockdown of PCDH7 changes dendritic spine morphology in dissociated neurons</title>
<p id="Par12">In order to understand the physiological function of the endogenous PCDH7, we examined the effect of knocking down PCDH7 in dissociated neuronal cultures. Because the commercially available antibodies we tested could detect overexpressed PCDH7 but were not sensitive enough to detect endogenous protein in neurons, we used heterologous cells to screen for effective PCDH7 targeting shRNAs. By screening four PCDH7 shRNAs using HEK293 cells overexpressing rat PCDH7, we found two shRNAs (shRNA_A and shRNA_C) that suppressed PCDH7 protein levels by more than 60% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>A). Dissociated neurons were transfected with either scrambled shRNA, or two distinct shRNAs targeting PCDH7 (together with GFP as a marker protein), and morphology and density of dendritic spines were analyzed. Neurons with reduced PCDH7 either by shRNA_A or shRNA_C showed similar phenotype with longer dendritic spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>B,C). We found that although the total dendritic spine density was not affected by PCDH7 knockdown, there was around 50% reduction in the density of typical spines (length &lt; 2 μm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>), and about a threefold increase in the density of longer spines (length &gt; 2 μm) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>D). While our image resolution precludes a quantitative morphological categorization of spines/protrusions, it is worth noting that a large portion of the longer “spines” appear filopodium-like.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Knockdown of PCDH7 induces morphological change of dendritic spines in dissociated neuronal cultures.

<title>Knocking down PCDH7 modestly increases dendritic spine length in hippocampal slices with no significant impact on NMDA current</title>
<p id="Par13">To study the role of PCDH7 in a more physiological environment, we used cultured hippocampal slices. Slices were biolistically transfected either with scrambled shRNA or PCDH7 targeted shRNAs. GFP was co-transfected with shRNAs to identify the transfected neurons. Consistent with the data in dissociated neuronal cultures, knocking down PCDH7 in slices resulted in slightly but statistically significantly longer spines without affecting the total spine density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>A,B). When the spine density of typical spines (&lt; 2 μm) and longer spines (&gt; 2 μm) were counted separately, there was a trend of decrease in the number of typical spines and increase in the number of longer spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>C). The effect size was smaller in cultured slices compared with dissociated cultures, which is not uncommon in this type of experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and could reflect stronger compensatory mechanisms in cultured slices.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Effects of knocking down PCDH7 in hippocampal slices.

Picrotoxin was added to the solution to block inhibitory current. NMDAR currents were measured 50 ms after stimulation to exclude contamination of AMPAR currents. Comparison of NMDAR currents from transfected and untransfected cells showed that knockdown of endogenous PCDH7 by either of two distinct shRNAs had no significant effect on the amplitude of the evoked NMDA current, although there was a trend towards a slight reduction in current (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>D). This negative result could mean that endogenous PCDH7 is not limiting in regulating NMDA current, or that the degree of knockdown of PCDH7 was insufficient to cause a phenotype.</p>

<title>Overexpression of PCDH7 induces morphological changes in dendrites and reduces NMDAR currents in cultured hippocampal slices</title>
<p id="Par15">We next investigated the effect of overexpressing PCDH7 in hippocampal slices. We biolistically transfected neurons with either cytoplasmic GFP alone or PCDH7 plus cytoplasmic GFP. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>A, neurons overexpressing PCDH7 had dilatations along the dendrites, whereas control neurons had normal spine structures. The morphological change caused by overexpressing PCDH7 looked somewhat opposite to that by knocking down PCDH7: longer spines by knockdown and “collapsed” spines by overexpression. Quantification showed that there were significantly reduced spine/dilatation density and length in PCDH7 overexpressed neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). We also recorded stimulation-evoked NMDAR currents from transfected and untransfected neurons. Transfection of GFP alone did not affect the NMDAR current amplitude (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>B, top), whereas overexpressing PCDH7 significantly reduced NMDAR current (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>B, bottom), which could reflect the collapse of dendritic spines and disruption of synaptic function.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Effects of PCDH7 overexpression in hippocampal slices.

<p id="Par16">To assess PCDH7 protein localization, we generated a PCDH7 construct tagged with GFP at its C-terminus. We co-transfected this GFP tagged PCDH7 with DsRed as a fill to show neuron morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>C). Similar to cytoplasmic GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>A) the DsRed signal showed the presence of multiple dendritic dilatations in neurons transfected with PCDH7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>C, middle). The PCDH7-GFP signal was found in a punctate pattern and was specifically localized to those dilatations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>C, left). To get more insight into the dilatations induced by PCDH7 overexpression, we co-transfected GFP tagged PCDH7 with tdTomato-tagged SHANK3, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, in cultured hippocampal slices. In PCDH7-expressing neurons, SHANK3 had a punctate expression pattern and was highly enriched in those dilatations and strongly co-localized with PCDH7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>D), suggesting that these dilatations might be synapse containing structures. Furthermore, we performed PCDH7 overexpression experiments in dissociated neuronal cultures so that we could stain for endogenous synaptic proteins. Overexpressed PCDH7 was localized to the dendritic dilatations and was partially colocalized with the presynaptic marker synapsin and postsynaptic marker PSD95 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>A,B). The functional aspect of these structures and how the dendritic morphology change alters NMDAR current remains to be characterized.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par17">Although GluN1 has been studied extensively, little is known about protein interactions mediated by its NTD. Here via an unbiased screen of ~ 1,500 single pass transmembrane proteins, we identified PCDH7 as a potential interactor. PCDH7 is predominantly expressed in the brain, and has been genetically associated with multiple neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Our <italic>ISH</italic> and biochemical data show that PCDH7 is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons and the protein is enriched in PSD fractions, which is consistent with the existence of PCDH7 in excitatory synaptic clefts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and supports the hypothesis that PCDH7 may play a role in synapse formation and/or function.</p>
<p id="Par18">Both overexpression and knockdown of PCDH7 significantly changed the morphology of dendritic structures. Overexpression of PCDH7 resulted in collapse of spines and abnormal dendritic swelling in which PCDH7 and synaptic proteins like SHANK3 were concentrated. In addition, when we transfected cultured hippocampal slices with GFP tagged PSD95, together with PCDH7 and DsRed, overexpressed PSD-95 was also localized to the dendritic dilatations (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>C), consistent with our finding that PCDH7 interacts with GluN1 and the well documented observation that PSD95 and Shank protein colocalize with NMDA receptors at synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This disruption of dendritic structure was accompanied by a reduction of NMDAR synaptic current. One possible hypothesis is that overexpression of PCDH7 might result in decrease of surface GluN1. Future study with a GluN1 antibody that is suitable for live staining of surface GluN1 would help clarify the mechanism underlying the reduced NMDAR current. On the other hand, knockdown of PCDH7 resulted in longer spines/protrusions. In dissociated neuronal cultures, significantly more of dendritic protrusions exceeded the typical spine length (2 μm), and some of them are filopodia-like, reminiscent of the report showing the elongation of dendritic protrusions after blockade of classic cadherins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Since dendritic filopodia usually represent transient dynamic structures that may turn into spines, this phenotype suggests that there might be more immature synapses, or higher spine motility in PCDH7-knockdown neurons, pointing to a stabilization role of PCDH7 in spines. Time-lapse live imaging of the neurons would help clarify these questions. The elongation of the spines was also significant in cultured slices, but the effect size was smaller, which could be due to either the difference in knockdown efficiency or difference in resilience to partial loss of PCDH7 in a more physiological environment. Theoretically, rescue experiments with shRNA-resistant PCDH7 would provide additional evidence supporting the specificity of the knockdown phenotype. However, as described above, overexpressing PCDH7 had strong effect on dendritic spine morphology in neurons, even with 10% of the amount of DNA normally used for transfection (data not shown). We believe that the effects of overexpression of the shRNA insensitive PCDH7 would overwhelm the effects of knockdown and thus give inconclusive answers. On the other hand, the observations that two distinct shRNAs both induced elongation of spines in dissociated neurons and slice cultures and that overexpression of PCDH7 caused the somewhat opposite “collapse” of spines suggests that the PCDH7 targeting shRNAs effects were most likely specific.</p>
<p id="Par19">Knockdown of PCDH7 did not affect NMDAR current in our experiments despite changing morphologies of dendritic spines. Since we were only recording from transfected neurons while stimulating presynaptic fibers impinging on those cells, and transfection was sparse in slice cultures, we were only evaluating the potential function of <italic>cis</italic> interaction of PCDH7 with NMDARs or other protein(s) in the postsynaptic site. Moreover, PCDH7 has been reported to bind to phosphatase PP1α via its cytosolic region CM3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and PP1α plays an important role in synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, PCDH7 might play a more important role in regulating synaptic plasticity than basal synaptic transmission. On the other hand, overexpression of PCDH7 changed Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibition sensitivity of NMDA current in a heterologous system, supporting a role of PCDH7 in direct modulation of NMDAR function and perhaps synaptic function under certain circumstances. Besides neurons, PCDH7 mRNA is also highly expressed in astrocytes. Previous reports have shown that astrocytic γ-Pcdhs are important for synaptogenesis and dendrite complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Whether astrocytic PCDH7 plays a role in regulating synapse formation awaits to be examined.</p>
<p id="Par20">While our data do not distinguish whether the effects of PCDH7 on synaptic function are due to the interaction with GluN1 that we identified, the demonstration of this potentially physiologically relevant interaction, and the characterization of synaptic effects of PCDH7 should provide the basis for future studies exploring mechanisms NMDAR protein interactions and regulation of synaptic function.</p>
