<abstract>
<p>There is increasing evidence that genetic risk variants for non-syndromic cleft lip/palate (nsCL/P) are also associated with normal-range variation in facial morphology. However, previous analyses are mostly limited to candidate SNPs and findings have not been consistently replicated. Here, we used polygenic risk scores (PRS) to test for genetic overlap between nsCL/P and seven biologically relevant facial phenotypes. Where evidence was found of genetic overlap, we used bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to test the hypothesis that genetic liability to nsCL/P is causally related to implicated facial phenotypes. Across 5,804 individuals of European ancestry from two studies, we found strong evidence, using PRS, of genetic overlap between nsCL/P and philtrum width; a 1 S.D. increase in nsCL/P PRS was associated with a 0.10 mm decrease in philtrum width (95% C.I. 0.054, 0.146; P = 2x10<sup>-5</sup>). Follow-up MR analyses supported a causal relationship; genetic variants for nsCL/P homogeneously cause decreased philtrum width. In addition to the primary analysis, we also identified two novel risk loci for philtrum width at 5q22.2 and 7p15.2 in our Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of 6,136 individuals. Our results support a liability threshold model of inheritance for nsCL/P, related to abnormalities in development of the philtrum.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Non-syndromic cleft lip/palate (nsCL/P) is a birth defect, primarily affecting the upper lip and hard palate. Individuals with nsCL/P and their unaffected family members sometimes present with other minor craniofacial anomalies and may have differences in facial morphology compared to the general population. Here, we investigate the shared genetic relationship between nsCL/P and facial morphology in a sample of around 6,000 Europeans from two different studies. We demonstrate that genetic risk factors for nsCL/P are associated with decreased philtrum width in unaffected individuals from the general population and that the relationship is likely causal. This finding is important because it demonstrates that nsCL/P, which is often treated as a dichotomous trait, may have a continuous dimension and offers insight into potential biological mechanisms that result in nsCL/P.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Orofacial clefts are malformations characterised by a failure of fusion between adjacent facial structures in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref001">1</xref>]. Cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P) is a sub-type of orofacial cleft, consisting of individuals presenting with a cleft of the upper lip, with or without a cleft of the palate. Approximately 70% of CL/P cases are non-syndromic, where the facial cleft is not accompanied by other apparent developmental or physical abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref002">2</xref>]. The non-syndromic form of CL/P (nsCL/P) is a multifactorial trait with both genetic and environmental risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref001">1</xref>]. A possible polygenic threshold model of inheritance is supported by the identification of more than 20 common genetic risk variants for nsCL/P from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref009">9</xref>] and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability estimates of around 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Facial morphology in the general population is also likely to be highly polygenic; genome-wide significant loci have been found for multiple facial phenotypes across diverse ethnic populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref014">14</xref>]. In some cases, the genes associated with normal-range variation in facial shape have also been implicated in nsCL/P (e.g. <italic>MAFB</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref012">12</xref>]. Likewise, previous studies using candidate SNPs have found overlap between nsCL/P risk loci and facial phenotypes in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref016">16</xref>]. For example, the strongest nsCL/P GWAS signal, intergenic variant rs987525 on chromosome 8q24, was found to be associated with more than half of the 48 facial phenotypes studied in a European population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref011">11</xref>] while in a Han Chinese population, rs642961 in <italic>IRF6</italic> (a major nsCL/P-associated gene) strongly predicted lip-shape variation in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref016">16</xref>]. However, associations between nsCL/P genetic variants and facial morphology were not consistently replicated, possibly because of methodological differences in measuring facial phenotypes or population differences between cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The use of individual markers to demonstrate genetic overlap between two phenotypes has notable limitations; a large number of statistical tests are introduced, and interpretation is difficult when some SNPs show an association and others do not. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) involve incorporating multiple markers, including those not reaching genome-wide significance, into a genetic score that serves as a proxy for a trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref017">17</xref>]. PRS have been previously shown to be suitable predictors for nsCL/P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref006">6</xref>] suggesting they can be used to estimate genetic overlap between nsCL/P and normal-range facial morphology.</p>
<p>Interpreting genetic overlap between nsCL/P and a facial phenotype is difficult because the development of the face and development of an orofacial cleft are largely synchronous. One possibility is that differences in the facial phenotype are a sub-phenotypic manifestation of genetic liability to nsCL/P (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007501.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). The inheritance of dichotomous traits can be modelled on the liability scale, where every individual has an underlying normally distributed liability to the trait determined by genes, environment and chance. Individuals above a liability threshold develop the trait, while increased liability may cause related phenotypic differences in individuals without the trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref020">20</xref>]. For example, increased liability to developing a cleft palate (CP) has been hypothesised to be associated with delayed movement of the palatal shelf, which may in turn result in a CP, dependant on other factors such as shelf and head width [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref020">20</xref>].</p>

<title>Liability threshold model for nsCL/P.</title>
<p>Shown is an illustration of a liability threshold model for nsCL/P. Every individual has a normally distributed liability to nsCL/P, determined by genes, environment and chance. Individuals over the liability threshold develop nsCL/P, with the area under the curve past the threshold equal to the trait incidence. We are hypothesising that liability to nsCL/P, specifically genetic liability to nsCL/P, may be associated with differences in facial morphology across the general population.</p>

</fig>
<p>In order to evaluate the coherence of the liability-related sub-phenotype model, we apply the principles of Mendelian randomization (MR). MR is an instrumental variable approach, testing causality of an “exposure” and an outcome by using genetic instruments to mimic a randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref021">21</xref>]. MR relies on several strict assumptions; firstly, genetic variants must be robustly associated with the exposure (in this instance, genetic liability to nsCL/P); secondly, the variants cannot influence the outcome through a pathway independent of the exposure; and thirdly, the variants should not be associated with confounders of the relationship between the exposure and the outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref022">22</xref>]. If these assumptions are met, bidirectional MR can be used to test the hypothesis that genetic liability to nsCL/P is causally related to facial morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>In the absence of large-scale publicly available GWAS summary data for nsCL/P, we used individual level genotype data from the International Cleft Consortium to Identify Genes and Interactions Controlling Oral Clefts (ICC) and GWAS summary statistics from the Bonn-II study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref008">8</xref>] to replicate the meta-analysis GWAS summary statistics from the previously published Ludwig et al 2012 GWAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref003">3</xref>]. Next, we investigated genetic overlap between nsCL/P and normal-range facial morphology in the general population, using PRS derived from the GWAS summary statistics. Finally, in the instance of genetic overlap, we used bidirectional MR to explore the relationship between nsCL/P and implicated facial phenotypes. A flowchart detailing the primary analyses is contained in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007501.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>.</p>

<title>Genome-wide association study and genetic proxy for nsCL/P</title>
<p>We performed a GWAS of nsCL/P using the TDT on 638 parent-offspring trios and 178 offspring duos of European descent, and then meta-analysed our results with GWAS summary results previously published on 399 cases and 1,318 controls in the Bonn-II study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref008">8</xref>]. This yielded comparable results to a previously published GWAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref003">3</xref>], which used a very similar data-set with slightly different quality control and analysis methods (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007501.s001">S1 Table</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We also evaluated the predictive accuracy of nsCL/P that could be achieved using different PRS constructed from these summary data by comparing the strength of association at different inclusion thresholds of the PTDT. We determined that including independent SNPs that surpass a P-value threshold of 10<sup>−5</sup> was the most predictive of nsCL/P liability in both European and Asian trios (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007501.s002">S2 Table</xref></bold>). Therefore, this threshold was used for generating polygenic risk scores from the meta-analysis summary statistics. SNPs included in the selected score are listed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007501.s003">S3 Table</xref></bold>.</p>

<title>The prediction of facial morphology using PRS for nsCL/P</title>
<p>Prior to testing the performance of our nsCL/P PRS on predicting facial morphology, we calculated the minimum genetic correlation required to detect an association between the PRS and the facial phenotypes. We found that the minimum genetic correlation required ranged from 0.17 to 0.28 with differences attributable to different heritability estimates across the facial phenotypes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007501.s004">S4 Table</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We evaluated the performance of our nsCL/P PRS for prediction of seven facial morphological traits. Facial distances used in the analysis are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007501.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold>. We found evidence of an association between the nsCL/P PRS and philtrum width in the ALSPAC children, where a 1 S.D. increase in nsCL/P PRS was associated with a 0.07 mm decrease in philtrum width (95% C.I. 0.02, 0.13; P = 0.014) (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007501.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We attempted to replicate this finding in the 3DFN study and found a consistent effect of 1 S.D. increase in nsCL/P PRS being associated with a 0.14 mm decrease in philtrum width (95% C.I. 0.07, 0.21; P = 1.7x10<sup>-4</sup>). Meta-analysing these results; indicated that a 1 S.D. increase in nsCL/P PRS is associated with a 0.10 mm decrease in philtrum width (95% C.I. 0.054, 0.146; P = 2x10<sup>-5</sup>).</p>

<title>GWAS of philtrum width</title>
<p>To generate SNP-philtrum width association information for MR analyses, we performed GWAS of philtrum width in both ALSPAC and 3DFN separately, before meta-analysing. The combined sample included 6,136 individuals of recent European descent. We identified two novel chromosomal regions associated with philtrum width with genome-wide significance at 5q22.2 (lowest P value for rs255877, P = 3.8x10<sup>-10</sup>), within the non-coding RNA intronic region of an uncategorised gene <italic>ENSG00000232633</italic>, and 7p15.2 (rs2522825, P = 1.4x10<sup>-8</sup>), an intergenic SNP near <italic>HOXA1</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007501.s005">S5 Table</xref></bold>). We found some evidence that the two lead SNPs may be eQTLs for nearby genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007501.s006">S6 Table</xref></bold>). The two lead SNPs of the genome-wide significant loci, rs255877 and rs2522825, were used as genetic variants associated with philtrum width in subsequent MR analyses. The GWAS summary statistics are available at the University of Bristol data repository, data.bris, at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.1kz9y0moa8sgj2lxlk53mdmlbj">https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.1kz9y0moa8sgj2lxlk53mdmlbj</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref023">23</xref>].</p>

<title>Bidirectional mendelian randomization</title>
<p>We used MR to investigate the possible causal mechanism that would give rise to the genetic overlap between nsCL/P and philtrum width.</p>
<p>Firstly, we determined whether genetic variants contributing to liability of nsCL/P cause changes in philtrum width, by testing SNPs strongly associated with nsCL/P for association with philtrum width. A 1-unit log odd increase in liability to nsCL/P was associated with a 0.11mm (95% C.I. 0.04, 0.19; P = 0.0036) decrease in philtrum width. Sensitivity analyses suggested there was no strong evidence for pleiotropy or heterogeneity and validated the consistency of the instrument. Leave-one-SNP-out analysis showed consistent effect estimates after exclusion of each SNP (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007501.t002">Table 2</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Secondly, we determined whether genetic variants associated with philtrum width also affect liability to nsCL/P, by testing two independent SNPs associated with philtrum width at genome-wide significance (derived in the ALSPAC and 3DFN cohorts) for association with nsCL/P. Utilising strong LD proxies (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007501.s007">S7 Table</xref></bold>), weak evidence was found of an association between philtrum width-associated variants and liability to nsCL/P (LogOR = 0.30; 95% C.I. -0.26, 0.86; P = 0.30). Sensitivity analyses for pleiotropy were limited, with only 2 SNPs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we used the MR-Steiger test of directionality to test the direction of effect between philtrum width and liability to nsCL/P. The results suggested that the true direction of effect is that genetic variants contributing to liability to nsCL/P cause changes in philtrum width (P &lt;10<sup>−10</sup>).</p>

<p>The rationale for interpretation of the bidirectional MR analysis is contained in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007501.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>. Strong evidence was found for genetic liability to nsCL/P causing decreased philtrum width, weak evidence was found for heterogeneity or assumption violations in the forward-MR, and weak evidence was found for the reverse-MR of philtrum width-associated variants on liability to nsCL/P. Therefore, we conclude that the most likely explanation for the genetic overlap between nsCL/P and philtrum width is that genetic liability to nsCL/P is causally related to decreased philtrum width.</p>

<title>Interpretation of bidirectional MR.</title>
<p>(A) <italic>SNPs associated with nsCL/P have a homogeneous effect on the facial phenotype with weak evidence for the reverse direction MR</italic>. We would conclude that genetic liability to nsCL/P causes both increased liability to nsCL/P (in conjunction with the environment and chance) and changes in the facial phenotype. (B) <italic>SNPs associated with nsCL/P have a heterogeneous effect on the facial phenotype</italic>. In this instance, there is weak evidence for genetic liability to nsCL/P causing changes in the facial phenotype because liability assumes a consistent effect. We would conclude that an unknown confounder Y affects the facial phenotype and liability to nsCL/P independently. (C) <italic>SNPs associated with nsCL/P have a homogeneous effect on the facial phenotype AND SNPs associated with the facial phenotype cause increased liability to nsCL/P</italic>. In this instance, there are two possibilities. The first possibility is that the genetic instruments for the facial phenotype are weak (e.g. only one SNP) and so the causal effect estimate of the facial phenotype on liability to nsCL/P is imprecise. The second possibility is that nsCL/P and the facial phenotype have a substantial genetic correlation, which would require further investigation. Here, the results of the Steiger test are useful, as they can infer the most likely direction of effect between nsCL/P and implicated facial phenotypes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this manuscript, we have shown that there is genetic overlap between nsCL/P and normal-range variation in philtrum width, and furthermore, that genetic risk SNPs for nsCL/P consistently cause decreased philtrum width in the general population. Notably there was weak evidence for genetic overlap between nsCL/P and upper lip width despite the observational correlation between the widths of the upper lip and philtrum.</p>
<p>There are two main implications of these results. First, our findings demonstrate the aetiological relevance of the formation of the philtrum to nsCL/P. The medial nasal and maxillary processes are responsible for development of the upper lip and philtrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref024">24</xref>]. Developmental anomalies within these processes may result in a cleft lip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref025">25</xref>] and our findings show that even when there is successful fusion, as in our study populations, the genetic variants which give rise to a CL/P cause decreased philtrum width. Secondly, the non-heterogeneous additive effect of common nsCL/P risk variants, on a related phenotype in the general population, supports a polygenic threshold model of inheritance for nsCL/P.</p>
<p>Although previous studies have looked at nsCL/P related sub-phenotypes, this study uses causal inference methods to more formally investigate the relationship. Our identification of phenotypic differences related to nsCL/P liability are consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref031">31</xref>] observing sub-clinical facial phenotypes in individuals with nsCL/P and their unaffected family members, particularly a previous study which observed reduced philtrum width in unaffected parents of individuals with nsCL/P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref031">31</xref>]. A polygenic threshold model of inheritance related to development of the philtrum is consistent with a previously proposed mechanism for the inheritance of cleft palate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref020">20</xref>], the identification of numerous common nsCL/P genetic risk variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref007">7</xref>] and estimation of a substantial SNP heritability for nsCL/P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref006">6</xref>]. We do not replicate associations between nsCL/P and other facial morphological dimensions found in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref031">31</xref>] using candidate SNPs but note that polygenic risk score methods are methodologically distinct and are used to investigate a different research question to single SNP analyses.</p>
<p>We extend the investigation of the association between nsCL/P and facial morphology in two important ways. We demonstrate that the association is present not only in unaffected family members but also in the general population, and use MR to demonstrate that this relationship is present on the liability scale. Conventionally MR is used to test possible causal effects of a modifiable continuous exposure such as cholesterol or alcohol on disease outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref033">33</xref>]. Here we exploit the principles of MR to test the threshold hypothesis, by inferring a causal relationship between genetic variants contributing to liability of nsCL/P and philtrum width in a non-clinical population. We interpret this causal relationship as evidence that smaller philtrum width is a sub-phenotypic manifestation attributable to the same genetic variants that cause nsCL/P.</p>
<p>In addition to investigating the relationship between facial morphology and nsCL/P, we also performed the first GWAS of philtrum width, and identified two novel genome-wide significant loci. Notably one of the loci, rs2522825 at 7p15.2, was associated with gene expression at several nearby genes in the homeobox gene family, which are known to play important roles in embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>The causal inference made in this study was achieved through the use of two independent cohorts as discovery and replication samples which greatly reduces the risk of false positives and demonstrates that results can be generalised to different populations. Detailed facial phenotyping data on a large number of individuals in our cohorts along with other detailed phenotype and genotype data enabled us to identify philtrum width as being the most relevant facial morphological feature from amongst seven biologically likely candidates. Statistical power does limit the detection of other features that may have mechanistic relationships with smaller effect sizes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007501.s004">S4 Table</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In this study, we combined CL/P and cleft lip only (CLO), however there is evidence suggesting that there are distinct aetiological differences between these traits, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref037">37</xref>] which could reduce our statistical power, and complicates interpretation. For example, the philtrum may be more related to CLO, but we did not have sufficient data to compare nsCL/P subtype differences. An additional limitation is that there are few well-characterised genetic risk loci for philtrum width, so our MR analysis testing if genetic variants associated with a narrow philtrum width also affect liability of nsCL/P, may be underpowered.</p>
<p>We conclude that genetic liability to nsCL/P is causally related to variation in philtrum width and that this finding supports a polygenic threshold model of inheritance for nsCL/P, related to abnormalities in development of the philtrum. Further research looking at the relationship between genetic liability for nsCL/P and severity of cleft would provide further evidence for the polygenic threshold model.</p>

<title>Bidirectional mendelian randomization analysis</title>
<p>A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using the TwoSampleMR R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref054">54</xref>], testing both the forward direction (the effect of genetic risk variants for nsCL/P on implicated facial measurements) and the reverse direction (the effect of genetic risk variants for implicated facial measurements on liability to nsCL/P). The Inverse-Variance Weighted method was used as the primary analysis. Several sensitivity analyses were performed to test the assumptions of MR; the heterogeneity test was used to measure balanced pleiotropy, MR-Egger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref055">55</xref>] was used to test for directional pleiotropy, the weighted median method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref056">56</xref>] was used to test if the result is consistent assuming that at least half of the variants are valid and the weighted mode method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref057">57</xref>] was used to test if the result is consistent assuming that the most common effect is valid. The Steiger test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref058">58</xref>] was used to determine the likely direction of effect.</p>
<sec id="sec028">
<title>GWAS summary statistics for nsCL/P and implicated facial phenotypes</title>
<p>MR analysis required relevant SNP association information with respect to both nsCL/P and implicated facial measurements. SNP information relevant to nsCL/P was extracted from the nsCL/P meta-analysis summary statistics, previously described.</p>
<p>For implicated facial phenotypes, GWAS were performed using PLINK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref043">43</xref>] in both ALSPAC (3,707 individuals) and the 3DFN study (2,429 individuals with genotype and face-shape data), using the same covariates as previously described in the polygenic risk score analysis. Summary statistics were then meta-analysed using METAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref049">49</xref>] with the combined sample including 6,136 individuals. SNP information relevant to implicated facial phenotypes was then extracted from the ALSPAC/3DFN meta-analysis summary statistics.</p>
<p>The ALSPAC/3DFN meta-analysis GWAS summary statistics of implicated facial phenotypes were subsequently analysed and functionally annotated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref059">59</xref>] with the potential overlap between philtrum-width associated SNPs and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) investigated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref060">60</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec029">
<title>Genetic risk variants for nsCL/P and implicated facial phenotypes</title>
<p>For the forward direction, genetic instruments for nsCL/P are SNPs that are strongly associated with nsCL/P. 6 well-characterised genome-wide significant nsCL/P SNPs in Europeans were taken from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Information on the 6 nsCL/P SNPs is contained in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007501.s010">S10 Table</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>For the reverse direction, genetic instruments for implicated facial phenotypes are SNPs that are strongly associated with the implicated facial phenotypes. We LD clumped (r2&lt;0.001 within 500KB) the ALSPAC/3DFN meta-analysis summary statistics to generate independent instruments for the MR analysis. LD proxies (r2&gt;0.9) were used for SNPs unavailable in the nsCL/P summary statistics and were generated using LDlink and LDproxy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref061">61</xref>] using the 1000 Genomes CEU/GBR populations as the reference panel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007501.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec030">
<title>Interpreting bidirectional mendelian randomization analysis</title>
<p>The results of the bidirectional MR and relevant sensitivity analyses were used to infer the likelihood of the liability-related sub-phenotype model. Three distinct possibilities were considered to explain the association between nsCL/P PRS and implicated facial phenotypes (which were detailed previously in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007501.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>).</p>
