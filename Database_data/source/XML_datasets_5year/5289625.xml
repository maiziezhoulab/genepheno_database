<abstract>
<p id="P2">To further resolve the genetic architecture of the inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, we sequenced the whole genomes of 4,280 patients at low coverage, and compared them to 3,652 previously sequenced population controls across 73.5 million variants. We then imputed from these sequences into new and existing GWAS cohorts, and tested for association at ~12 million variants in a total of 16,432 cases and 18,843 controls. We discovered a 0.6% frequency missense variant in <italic>ADCY7</italic> that doubles risk of ulcerative colitis. Despite good statistical power, we did not identify any other new low-frequency risk variants, and found that such variants explained little heritability. We detected a burden of very rare, damaging missense variants in known Crohn’s disease risk genes, suggesting that more comprehensive sequencing studies will continue to improve our understanding of the biology of complex diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic and debilitating diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that result from the interaction of environmental factors, including the intestinal microbiota, with the host immune system in genetically susceptible individuals. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 215 IBD associated loci that have substantially expanded our understanding of the biology underlying these diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. The correlation between nearby common variants in human populations underpins the success of the GWAS approach, but this also makes it difficult to infer precisely which variant is causal, the molecular consequence of that variant, and often even which gene is perturbed. Rare variants, which plausibly have larger effect sizes, can be more straightforward to interpret mechanistically because they are correlated with fewer nearby variants. However, it remains to be seen how much of the heritability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> of complex diseases is explained by rare variants. Well powered studies of rare variation in IBD thus offer an opportunity to better understand both the biological and genetic architecture of an exemplar complex disease.</p>
<p id="P4">The marked drop in the cost of DNA sequencing has enabled rare variants to be captured at scale, but there remains a fundamental design question regarding how to most effectively distribute short sequence reads in two dimensions: across the genome, and across individuals. The most important determinant of GWAS success has been the ability to analyze tens of thousands of individuals, and detecting rare variant associations will require even larger sample sizes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>. Early IBD sequencing studies concentrated on the protein coding sequence in GWAS-implicated loci<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> , which can be naturally extended to the entire exome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>. However, coding variation explains at most 20% of the common variant associations in IBD GWAS loci<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, and others have more generally observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> that the substantial majority of complex disease associated variants lie in non-coding, presumed regulatory, regions of the genome. Low coverage whole genome sequencing has been proposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> as an alternative approach that captures this important non-coding variation, while being cheap enough to enable thousands of individuals to be sequenced. As expected, this approach has proven valuable in exploring rarer variants than those accessible in GWAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, but is not ideally suited to the analysis of extremely rare variants.</p>
<p id="P5">Our aim was to determine whether low coverage whole genome sequencing provides an efficient means of interrogating these low frequency variants, and how much they contribute to IBD susceptibility. We present an analysis of the whole genome sequences of 4,280 IBD patients, and 3,652 population controls sequenced as part of the UK10K project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, both via direct comparison of sequenced individuals and as the basis for an imputation panel in an expanded UK IBD GWAS cohort. This study allows us to examine, on a genome-wide scale, the role of low-frequency (0.1%≤ MAF &lt; 5%) and rare (MAF &lt; 0.1%) variants in IBD risk.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Whole genome sequencing of 7,932 individuals</title>
<p id="P6">Following quality control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note and Supplementary Table 1-2</xref>), whole genome sequences of 2,513 Crohn’s disease patients (median coverage 4x) and 1,767 ulcerative colitis patients (2x) were jointly analyzed with 3,652 population controls (7x) sequenced as part of the UK10K project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We discovered 87 million autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 7 million short indels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note and Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We then applied support vector machines for SNVs and GATK VQSR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> for indels to distinguish true sites of genetic variation from sequencing artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note</xref>). We called genotypes jointly across all samples at the remaining sites, followed by genotype refinement using the BEAGLE imputation software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>. This procedure leverages information across multiple individuals and uses the correlation between nearby variants to produce high quality data from relatively low sequencing depth. We noted that genotype refinement was locally affected by poor quality sites that failed further quality control analyses, so we ran BEAGLE a second time after these exclusions, yielding a set of 73.5 million high quality sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1-3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Over 99% of common SNVs (MAF ≥ 5%) were also found in 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 Europeans, indicating high specificity. Among rarer variants, 54.6 million were not seen in 1000 Genomes, demonstrating the value of directly sequencing the IBD cases and UK population controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">We also discovered 180,000 deletions, duplications and multiallelic copy number variants (CNVs) using GenomeStrip 2.0<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, but noted large differences in sensitivity between the three different sample sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Following quality control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note</xref>), including removal of CNVs with length &lt; 60 kilobases, we observed an approximately equal number of variants in cases and controls, but retained only 1,475 CNVs. However, we still note a genome-wide excess of rare CNVs in controls (P=0.002), indicating that even after stringent filtering the data remains too noisy for meaningful conclusions to be drawn. We suggest that high coverage whole genome sequencing balanced in cases and controls will be required to evaluate the contribution of rare CNVs to IBD risk.</p>
<p id="P8">We individually tested 13 million SNVs and small indels with MAF ≥0.1% for association, and observed that we had successfully eliminated systematic differences due to sequence depth (λ<sub>1000_UC</sub> = 1.05, λ<sub>1000_CD</sub> = 1.04, λ<sub>1000_IBD</sub> =1.06, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), while still retaining power to detect known associations. While we estimate that this stringent quality control produced well calibrated association test statistics for more than 99% of sites, this analysis yielded many extremely significant p-values at SNPs outside of known loci (e.g. ~7,000 with p &lt; 10<sup>-15</sup>), 95% of which had an allele frequency below 5%. In contrast to GWAS, where routine procedures almost completely eliminate false positive associations, the heterogeneity of our sequencing depths makes it challenging to discern true associations from these data alone.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Imputation into GWAS</title>
<p id="P9">As noted by a previous study of type 2 diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> with a similar design, our WGS dataset alone is not well powered to identify new associations, even if all samples were sequenced at the same depth. We therefore built a phased reference panel of 10,971 individuals from our low coverage whole genome sequences and 1000 Genomes Phase 3 haplotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note</xref>), in order to use imputation to leverage IBD GWAS to increase our power. Previous data have shown that such expanded reference panels significantly improve imputation accuracy of low-frequency variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. We next generated a new UK IBD GWAS dataset by genotyping 8,860 IBD patients without previous GWAS data and combining them with 9,495 UK controls from the Understanding Society project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/">www.understandingsociety.ac.uk</ext-link>), all genotyped using the Illumina HumanCoreExome v12 chip. We then added previous UK IBD GWAS samples that did not overlap with those in our sequencing dataset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. Finally, we imputed all of these samples using the PBWT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> software and the reference panel described above, and combined these imputed genomes with our sequenced genomes to create a final dataset of 16,267 IBD cases and 18,843 UK population controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">This imputation produced high quality genotypes at 12 million variants that passed typical GWAS quality control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note</xref>), and represented more than 90% of sites with MAF &gt;0.1% that we could directly test in our sequences. Compared to the most recent meta-analysis by the International IBD Genetics Consortium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, which used a reference panel almost ten times smaller than ours, we tested an additional 2.5 million variants for association to IBD Because our GWAS cases and controls were genotyped using the same arrays, they should be not be differentially affected by the variation in sequencing depths in the reference panel, and thus not susceptible to the artifacts observed in the sequence-only analysis. Indeed, compared to the thousands of false-positive associations present in the sequence-only analysis, the imputation based meta-analysis revealed only four previously undescribed genome-wide significant IBD associations. Three of these had MAF &gt; 10%, so we carried them forward to a meta-analysis of our data and published IBD GWAS summary statistics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>.</p>

<title>Asp439Glu in <italic>ADCY7</italic> doubles risk of ulcerative colitis</title>
<p id="P11">The fourth new association (P = 9x10<sup>-12</sup>) was a 0.6% missense variant (p.Asp439Glu, rs78534766) in <italic>ADCY7</italic> that doubles risk of ulcerative colitis (OR=2.19, 95% CI =1.75-2.74), and is strongly predicted to alter protein function (SIFT = 0, PolyPhen = 1, MutationTaster = 1). This variant was associated (p=1x10<sup>-6</sup>) in a subset of directly genotyped individuals, suggesting the signal was unlikely to be driven by imputation errors. To further validate it we genotyped (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Online Methods</xref>) an additional 450 ulcerative colitis cases and 3,905 controls (p=0.0009) and looked it up in 982 ulcerative colitis cases and 136,464 controls from the UK Biobank (p=0.0189). A meta-analysis of all three directly genotyped datasets showed genome-wide significant association (p=1.6x10<sup>-9</sup>), no evidence for heterogeneity (p=0.19) and clean cluster plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). A previous report described an association between an intronic variant in this gene and Crohn’s disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, but our signal at this variant (P = 2.9x10<sup>-7</sup>) vanishes after conditioning on the nearby associations at <italic>NOD2</italic>, (conditional P = 0.82). By contrast, we observed that p.Asp439Glu shows nominal association with Crohn’s disease after conditioning on <italic>NOD2</italic> (P = 7.5x10<sup>-5</sup>, OR=1.40), while the significant signal remains for ulcerative colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, one of the largest effect single alleles associated with ulcerative colitis lies, apparently coincidentally, only 300 kilobases away from a region of the genome that contains multiple large effect Crohn’s disease risk alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">The protein encoded by <italic>ADCY7</italic>, adenylate cyclase 7, is one of a family of ten enzymes that convert ATP to the ubiquitous second messenger cAMP.

Here, cAMP modulates innate and adaptive immune functions, including the inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα, itself the target of the most potent current therapy in IBD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>. Indeed, myeloid-specific Adcy7 knockout mice (constitutive knockouts die in utero) show higher stimulus-induced production of TNFα by macrophages, impairment in B cell function and T cell memory, an increased susceptibility to LPS-induced endotoxic shock, and a prolonged inflammatory response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>.

<title>Low-frequency variation makes a minimal contribution to IBD susceptibility</title>
<p id="P13">The associated variant in <italic>ADCY7</italic> represents precisely the class of variant that our study design was intended to probe: below 1% MAF, OR ~2, and difficult to impute (only 1 copy of the non-reference allele was observed in the Phase 1 1000 Genomes, and INFO=0.7 when imputing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> from Phase 3), making it notable as our single discovery of this type. We had 66% power to detect that association, and reasonable power even for more difficult scenarios (e.g. 29% for 0.2% MAF and OR=2, or 11% for 0.5% MAF and OR=1.5). As noted by others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, heritability estimates for low frequency variants as a class are exquisitely sensitive to potential bias from technical and population differences. We therefore analyzed only the imputed GWAS samples to eliminate the effect of differential sequencing depth, and applied a more stringent SNP and sample quality control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). We used the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method implemented in GCTA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> and estimated that autosomal SNPs with MAF &gt; 0.1% explain 28.4% (s.e. 0.016) and 21.1% (s.e. 0.012) of the variation in liability for Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis, respectively. Despite SNPs with MAF &lt; 1% representing approximately 81% of the variants included in this analysis, they explained just 1.5% of the variation in liability. While these results are underestimates due to limitations of our data and the REML approach, it seems very unlikely that a large fraction of IBD risk is captured by variants like <italic>ADCY7</italic> p.Asp439Glu. Thus, our discovery of <italic>ADCY7</italic> actually serves as an illustrative exception to a series of broader observations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> that low-frequency, high-risk variants are unlikely to be important contributors to IBD risk.</p>

<title>The role of rare variation in IBD risk</title>
<p id="P14">Our low coverage sequencing approach does not perfectly capture very rare and private variants because the cross-sample genotype refinement adds little information at sites where nearly all individuals are homozygous for the major allele. Similarly, these variants are difficult to impute from GWAS data: even using a panel of more than 32,000 individuals offers little imputation accuracy below 0.1% MAF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. Thus, while our sequence dataset was not designed to study rare variants, it is the largest to date in IBD, and has sufficient specificity and sensitivity to warrant further investigation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Because enormous sample sizes would be required to implicate any single variant, we used a standard approach from exome sequencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, where variants of a particular functional class are aggregated into a gene-level test. We extended Derkach <italic>et al</italic>’s Robust Variance Score statistic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> to account for our sequencing depth heterogeneity, because existing rare variant burden methods gave systematically inflated test statistics.</p>
<p id="P15">For each of 18,670 genes, we tested for a differential burden of rare (MAF ≤ 0.5% in controls, excluding singletons) functional or predicted damaging coding variation in our sequenced cases and controls (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Online Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 8-9</xref>). We detected a significant burden of damaging rare variants in the well-known Crohn’s disease risk gene <italic>NOD2</italic> (P<sub>functional</sub> = 1x10<sup>−7</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>), which was independent of the known low-frequency <italic>NOD2</italic> risk variants (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Online Methods</xref>). We noted that the additional variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) that contribute to this signal explain only 0.13% of the variance in disease liability, compared to 1.15% for the previously known variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, underscoring the fact that very rare variants cannot account for much population variability in risk.</p>
<p id="P16">Some genes implicated by IBD GWAS had suggestive p-values, but did not reach exome-wide significance (P=5x10<sup>-7</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 10</xref>), so we combined individual gene results into two sets: (i) 20 genes that had been confidently implicated in IBD risk by fine-mapping or functional data, and (ii) 63 additional genes highlighted by less precise GWAS annotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 11</xref>). We tested these two sets (after excluding <italic>NOD2</italic>, which otherwise dominates the test) using an enrichment procedure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> that allows for differing direction of effect between the constituent genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 12</xref>). We found a burden in the twelve confidently implicated Crohn’s disease genes that contained at least one damaging missense variant (P<sub>damaging</sub> = 0.0045). By contrast, we saw no signal in the second, more generic set of genes (P=0.94, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">We extended this approach to evaluate rare regulatory variation, using enhancer regions described by the FANTOM5 project (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 13</xref>). Within each robustly defined enhancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, we tested all observed rare variants, as well as the subset predicted to disrupt or create a transcription factor binding motif<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. We combined groups of enhancers with cell- and/or tissue-type specific expression, in order to improve power in an analogous fashion to the gene set tests above. However, none of these tissue or cell specific enhancer sets had a significant burden of rare variation after correction for multiple testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 14</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P18">We investigated the role of low frequency variants of intermediate effect in IBD risk through a combination of low-coverage whole genome sequencing and imputation into GWAS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We discovered an association to a low frequency missense variant in <italic>ADCY7</italic>, which represents one of the strongest ulcerative colitis risk alleles outside of the major histocompatibility complex. The most straightforward mechanistic interpretation of this association is that loss-of-function of <italic>ADCY7</italic> reduces production of cAMP, leading to an excessive inflammatory response that predisposes to IBD. Previous evidence suggested that general cAMP-elevating agents that act on multiple adenylate cyclases might, in fact, worsen IBD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>. While members of the adenylate cyclase family have been considered potential targets in other contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, specific upregulation of <italic>ADCY7</italic> has not yet been attempted, raising the intriguing possibility that altering cAMP signalling in a leukocyte-specific way might offer therapeutic benefit in IBD.</p>
<p id="P19">In order to maximize the number of IBD patients we could sequence, and thus our power to detect association, we sequenced our cases at lower depth than the controls available to us via managed access. While joint and careful analysis largely overcame the bias this introduces, this is just one example of the complexities associated with combining sequencing data from different studies. Such challenges are not just restricted to low coverage whole-genome sequencing designs; variable pulldown technology and sequencing depth in the 60,000 exomes in the Exome Aggregation Consortium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> necessitated a simultaneous analysis of such analytical complexity and computational intensity that it would be prohibitive at all but a handful of research centers. Therefore, if rare variant association studies are to be as successful as those for common variants, computationally efficient methods and accepted standards for combining sequence datasets need to be developed.</p>
<p id="P20">We have participated in one such joint analysis by contributing to the Haplotype Reference Consortium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> (HRC), which has collected WGS data from more than 32,000 individuals into a reference panel that allows accurate imputation of low-frequency and common variants. Indeed, imputation into GWAS from the HRC is as accurate as low-coverage sequencing at allele frequencies as low as 0.05%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, so by far the most effective way to discover complex disease associations to variants in this range is to re-analyze the huge quantities of existing GWAS data with improved imputation. While projects like ours have provided wider public benefit through the HRC, there is little need for future low-coverage whole genome sequencing projects in complex disease.</p>
<p id="P21">Despite our study being specifically designed to interrogate both coding and non-coding variation, our sole new association was a missense variant. This is perhaps unsurprising, as the only previously identified IBD risk variants with similar frequencies and odds ratios are protein-altering changes to <italic>NOD2</italic>, <italic>IL23R</italic> and <italic>CARD9</italic>. More generally, the alleles with largest effect sizes at any given frequency tend to be coding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, and are therefore the first to be discovered when new technologies expand the frequency spectrum of genetic association studies. This pattern is further reinforced by the contrast between the tantalizing evidence we found for a burden of very rare coding variants in previously implicated IBD genes and the absence of any signal across the enhancer regions we tested. This distinction emphasizes how dramatically better we can distinguish likely functional from neutral variants in coding compared to non-coding sequence. For example, if we include all rare coding variants (MAF ≤ 0.5% in controls, N=136) in IBD genes the P-value is 0.2291, compared to P=0.0045 when using the subset of 54 coding variants with CADD ≥ 21. Therefore, the identification of rare variant burdens in the non-coding genome will require not only tens of thousands of samples to be sequenced, but also much better discrimination between functional and neutral variants in regulatory regions.</p>
<p id="P22">Nonetheless, it is likely that rare variants play an important role in IBD risk, and that many such alleles are regulatory, as is the case for common risk variants. The <italic>ADCY7</italic> association offers a direct window on a new IBD mechanism, but would probably eventually have been discovered through HRC imputation in existing GWAS samples, and is a relatively meager return compared to the number of loci discovered more simply by increasing GWAS sample size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>. Making real progress on rare variant association studies will require much larger numbers of deep exomes or whole genomes, especially if “ultra-rare” variants are as important in IBD as they are in, for example, schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, . Extrapolating<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> for <italic>IL23R</italic>, the IBD gene with the most significant coding burden (p=0.0005) after <italic>NOD2</italic>, we would require roughly 20,000 cases to reach genome-wide significance; as we noted above the challenge is even greater for non-coding regions where functional variants cannot currently be distinguished from neutral. Together, our discoveries suggest that a combination of continued GWAS coupled to new imputation reference panels, and large scale deep sequencing studies will be needed to complete our understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases.</p>

<title>Overview of our study.</title>
<p>Variants were called from raw sequence reads in three groups of samples, and jointly filtered using support vector machines. The resulting genotypes were refined using BEAGLE and incorporated into the reference panel for a GWAS-imputation based meta-analysis, which discovered a low frequency association in <italic>ADCY7</italic>. A separate gene-based analysis identified a burden of rare damaging variants in certain known Crohn’s disease genes.</p>

<title>Association analysis for the <italic>NOD2/ADCY7</italic> region in chromosome 16.</title>
<p>Results from the single variant association analysis are presented in gray, and results after conditioning on seven known <italic>NOD2</italic> risk variants in blue. Results for Crohn’s disease (CD) are shown in the top half, and ulcerative colitis (UC) in the bottom half. The dashed red lines indicate genome-wide significance, at α = 5x10<sup>-8</sup>.</p>

<p>Each point represents the contribution of an individual variant to our NOD2 burden test. Three common variants (rs2066844, rs2066845, rs2066847) are shown for scale, and the six rare variants identified by targeted sequencing are starred. Exonic regions (not to scale) are marked in blue, with their corresponding protein domains highlighted.</p>

<title>Burden of rare damaging variants in Crohn’s disease.</title>
<p>Each point represents a gene in our confidently implicated (green) or generically implicated (blue) gene sets. Genes are ranked on the x-axis from most enriched in cases to most enriched in controls, and position on the y-axis represents significance. The purple shaded region indicates where 75% of all genes tested lie. Our burden signal is driven by a mixture of genes where rare variants are risk increasing (e.g. <italic>NOD2</italic>) and risk decreasing (<italic>IL23R</italic>).</p>

<p>The black line shows the path through frequency-odds ratio space where the latest IIBDGC meta-analysis had 80% power. The purple line (imputed GWAS) and green line (sequencing) shows the same for this study. The earlier study had more samples but restricted their analysis to MAF &gt; 1%. Purple density and points show known GWAS loci, with our novel <italic>ADCY7</italic> association (p.Asp439Glu) highlighted as a star. Green points show a subset of our sequenced <italic>NOD2</italic> rare variants, and the green star shows their equivalent position when tested by gene burden, rather than individually.</p>
