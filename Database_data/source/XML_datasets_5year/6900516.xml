<title>Significance</title>
<p>The conserved proteasome-binding protein PI31 serves as an adapter to couple proteasomes with cellular motors to mediate their transport to distal tips of neurons where protein breakdown occurs. We generated global and conditional PI31 knockout mouse strains and show that this protein is required for protein homeostasis, and that its conditional inactivation in neurons disrupts synaptic structures and long-term survival. This work establishes a critical role for PI31 and local protein degradation in the maintenance of neuronal architecture, circuitry, and function. Because mutations in the PI31 pathway cause neurodegenerative diseases in humans, reduced PI31 activity may contribute to the etiology of these diseases.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Proteasome-mediated degradation of intracellular proteins is essential for cell function and survival. The proteasome-binding protein PI31 (Proteasomal Inhibitor of 31kD) promotes 26S assembly and functions as an adapter for proteasome transport in axons. As localized protein synthesis and degradation is especially critical in neurons, we generated a conditional loss of PI31 in spinal motor neurons (MNs) and cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). A cKO of PI31 in these neurons caused axon degeneration, neuronal loss, and progressive spinal and cerebellar neurological dysfunction. For both MNs and PCs, markers of proteotoxic stress preceded axonal degeneration and motor dysfunction, indicating a critical role for PI31 in neuronal homeostasis. The time course of the loss of MN and PC function in developing mouse central nervous system suggests a key role for PI31 in human neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p content-type="flushleft">The regulated breakdown of proteins is essential for cell function and survival. The ubiquitin−proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for the degradation of soluble intracellular proteins, whereas autophagy primarily serves to remove protein aggregates and damaged organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). UPS-mediated protein degradation involves 2 major steps: First, a protein is tagged with a chain of ubiquitin molecules, and then polyubiquitinated substrates are cleaved into small peptides by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Although protein homeostasis is thought to be a critical feature of neuronal circuit function, the major emphasis has been the importance of local protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). It has been suggested that local protein degradation in distal axons and dendrites is important for quality control of synaptic proteins, and also for plasticity and remodeling of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). However, in the absence of tools to selectively inhibit proteasomes at synapses, the precise role of local proteasome activity remains unclear.</p>
<p>Proteasome activity is regulated at multiple levels, including transcription of proteasomal proteins, assembly of subunits, posttranslational modifications, and the utilization of different regulatory particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). One structurally conserved proteasome regulator is PI31 (proteasome inhibitor of 31kD). PI31 was originally discovered based on its ability to inhibit hydrolysis of small peptides by 20S particles in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). Conversely, studies in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> yeast, and plants indicate that PI31 promotes protein breakdown in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). PI31 can be adenosine 5′-diphosphate-ribosylated by Tankyrase, and this modification promotes assembly of 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). PI31 also binds directly to Fbxo7/PARK15, a conserved F-box protein that is the substrate recognition component of an SCF E3 ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). Unexpectedly, loss of Fbxo7 causes cleavage and inactivation of PI31, reduced proteasome activity, and neuronal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). Significantly, impaired UPS function and mutations in Fbxo7/PARK15 are associated with neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>).</p>
<p>We recently showed that, in addition to its effect on proteasome assembly, PI31 is an adapter for neuronal proteasome transport, suggesting a key role in protein homeostasis and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). To examine the physiological function of PI31, we generated global and conditional knockout mouse strains and investigated how loss of PI31 affects 2 major types of neurons—spinal motor neurons (MNs) and cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). Spinal MNs reside in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, while their long axons, that can extend over 1 m in humans, innervate effector muscles at a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>). PCs are the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex. Their dendrites receive inputs from cerebellar granule cell (GC) parallel fibers and inferior olivary nucleus climbing fibers, while their axons project through the inner granular layer (IGL) of the cerebellar cortex, where mature GCs and Golgi interneurons reside, to synapse onto deep cerebellar nuclei neurons (DCNn) in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>). Both of these neurons are also involved in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy in the case of spinal MNs, and ataxias, autism, and cerebellar essential tremor in the case of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study reveals that PI31 is an essential gene, as knockout embryos died at mid to late gestation, although the development and differentiation of many embryonic cell types appeared normal overall. Strikingly, in both MNs and PCs of the cerebellum, conditional loss of PI31 function impaired protein homeostasis in neuronal processes; disrupted the architecture of synapses, axons, and dendrites; and compromised motor function. Importantly, degeneration of neuronal synapses and processes became progressively more severe with age, culminating in neuronal loss. Inactivation of PI31 in MNs and PCs recapitulated the progressive neuropathology and motor dysfunction of previously described mouse models of ALS and ataxia, respectively, and was reminiscent of the severe behavioral and anatomical defects associated with human spinal MN and PC neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>). Collectively, this work establishes a critical role for PI31 and protein degradation in the maintenance of neuronal architecture, circuitry, and function. Because mutations that impair PI31 function are thought to cause neurodegenerative diseases in humans, reduced PI31 activity may contribute to age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<title>Generation of PI31-Null Mice.</title>
<p>In order to examine the physiological role of PI31, we used 2 independent approaches to generate constitutive and conditional PI31 loss-of-function mouse mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). First, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce a 16-base pair (bp) deletion in exon 1 of the mouse PI31 gene. This resulted in a frame shift and a premature stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>A</italic>–<italic>C</italic></xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed that no PI31 protein was detectable in PI31<sup>CRISP/CRISP</sup> embryos, indicating that this allele is a null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). PI31<sup>CRISP/CRISP</sup> embryos appeared normal overall prior to embryonic stage E13.5. However, at E15.5, small size differences became detectable, and, by E18.5, reduced growth was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>). PI31<sup>CRISP/CRISP</sup> die perinatally, and we never observed any newborns. Histological analysis of these embryos indicated that many tissues and organs, such as heart, kidney, gut, muscle, and skin, developed normally overall and contained differentiated cells with appropriate morphology and patterning (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>). We conclude that PI31 function, unlike complete inactivation of proteasomes, is not universally required for the growth, differentiation, and survival of many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>).</p>

<p>Inactivation of PI31 results in embryonic lethality. Two independent approaches were used to generate constitutive and conditional PI31 loss-of-function mouse mutants. (<italic>A</italic>) CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to introduce a 16-bp deletion in exon 1 of the mouse PI31 gene. Alignment of WT and PI31<sup>CRISP</sup> mutant DNA sequences illustrates the extent of this deletion; the sequence of the targeting guide RNA is depicted in bold. The deletion causes a frame shift and generates a premature stop codon. (<italic>B</italic>) Schematic presentation of WT PI31 and PI31<sup>CRISP</sup> protein domains. The mutant protein derived from the PI31<sup>CRISP</sup> allele is predicted to retain the first 34 amino acids (encoded by nucleotides 1 to 102 of the PI31 coding sequence), followed by 40 missense amino acids and a premature stop codon (FP domain is required for homodimerization and heterodimerization with other PI31 molecules and\or the E3 ligase FBXO7; proline-rich domain is proline-rich unstructured domain; HbyX domain is a domain commonly found in modulators of proteasome activity and considered to be important for binding the 20S proteasome particle). (<italic>C</italic>) PCR analysis of WT and PI31<sup>CRISP</sup> DNA confirms the presence of a deletion in the PI31<sup>CRISP</sup> mutant. (<italic>D</italic>) PI31 protein levels were examined by Western blot analysis of brain extracts from E13.5 embryos.

<p>Because PI31 complete knockout mutants died at advanced embryonic stages, we generated conditional PI31 mutants in order to more carefully examine the role of PI31 in postembryonic cell types. For this purpose, we used the “knockout-first” (KOF) strategy which allows the production of reporter knockouts, conditional knockouts, and null alleles following exposure to the site-specific recombinases Cre and Flp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>). A PI31 KOF (PI31<sup>KOF</sup>) mutant line was generated from commercially available embryonic stem (ES) cells (Psmf1<sup>tm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu</sup>) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>F</italic></xref>. The lacZ insertion introduces a strong splice acceptor, which is predicted to cause severe truncation of the PI31 protein and eliminate domains critical for function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>F</italic></xref>). Similar to PI31<sup>CRISP/CRISP</sup> mice, PI31<sup>KOF/KOF</sup> mice are recessive embryonic lethal, and, by E15.5, embryos were hemorrhagic and smaller in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>G</italic></xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed that PI31 protein was not detectable in PI31<sup>KOF/KOF</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>I</italic></xref>). We conclude that both the PI31<sup>CRISP/CRISP</sup> and PI31<sup>KOF/KOF</sup> strains represent loss-of-function mutants in which expression of PI31 protein was successfully ablated, and that PI31 is an essential gene for mouse development. In order to generate conditional alleles for more in-depth analysis of PI31 function in specific postembryonic cell types, PI31<sup>KOF</sup> mice were bred with mice expressing FLP1 recombinase to generate a PI31 allele where the third exon is flanked by 2 loxP sites (PI31<sup>fl</sup> and Psmf1<sup>tm1c(EUCOMM)Hmgu</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>H</italic></xref>). PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice express normal levels of PI31, are viable and fertile, and appear completely normal. However, introduction of various Cre drivers successfully inactivated PI31 and led to tissue-specific loss of PI31 protein, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>J</italic></xref>.</p>

<title>Inactivation of PI31 Causes Neurological Defects, Proteotoxic Stress, and Reduced Proteasome Assembly.</title>
<p>We used PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice to investigate the physiological role of PI31 in different types of neurons. First, we crossed PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with CDX2-Cre mice to inactivate PI31 in the caudal part of the embryo. PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup> CDX2-Cre mice were viable, but, around P6, they began to develop progressive neuromotor phenotypes, characterized by spasticity, rigid muscle tone, strong tremor, and a severely impaired righting response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Movie S1</ext-link>). When these mice were picked up by their tails, they displayed hind leg clasping between episodes of tremor, a hallmark of neuromotor dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Mutant mice were only able to move using their front legs, since their hind limbs were hyperextended and paralyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Movie S1</ext-link>). These phenotypes became progressively more severe with age, and, by 3 to 4 wk, all mice died. We also noted that, although PI31 was deleted in all caudal tissues—including skin, muscle, and kidney—we did not observe any obvious phenotypes in these tissues.</p>

<p>Next, we looked for evidence that protein homeostasis was disrupted in PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup> CDX2-Cre mice. For this purpose, we used the FK2 antibody to detect accumulation of poly-ubiquitin (poly-Ub) proteins, which serves as a readout for proteasome function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r61">61</xref>). While no differences between control and PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup> CDX2-Cre were seen in protein extracted from muscle or kidney, we detected a clear and significant accumulation of poly-Ub proteins in spinal cord extracts from mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Highest levels of FK2 staining were seen in P9 mutant mice, at a time when motoric problems were apparent, but well before the peak of this phenotype and death of mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). These observations indicate that inactivation of PI31 in the spinal cord leads to defects in the degradation of poly-Ub proteins, consistent with impaired proteasome function. It was previously shown that PI31 can promote the assembly of active 26S proteasomes from 19S and 20S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether loss of PI31 affects the proteasome profile. For this purpose, we used Western blot analysis of native gels to analyze extracts from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from PI31<sup>KOF/KOF</sup> embryos and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2 <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). This revealed a small but significant reduction in the levels of single-capped 26S proteasomes, without substantial change of individual subunits (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2<italic>A</italic></ext-link>). It is worth noting that PI31-null MEFs were viable for extended periods in culture, indicating that these biochemical changes and the modest accumulation of poly-Ub conjugates in mutant MEFs under normal growth conditions did not have profound biological consequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2</ext-link>). We also saw induction of p62, which is a hallmark of proteotoxic stress (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2<italic>B</italic></ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>). Since p62 delivers poly-Ub aggregates to the autophagic machinery for degradation in lysosome, it is possible that this backup pathway can clear proteins escaping degradation in PI31-null MEFs sufficiently well enough to avoid overt biological consequences. We also treated MEFs with different concentrations of the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and MG132 to look for a role of PI31 under conditions where protein breakdown is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>). For both proteasome inhibitors, we observed that PI31-null MEFs survived less well (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2 <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></ext-link>). This reveals a modest but significant requirement for PI31 function in fibroblasts under stress conditions. Taken together, our results indicate that loss of PI31 causes decreased proteasome activity and reduces the breakdown of poly-Ub proteins, but that this has little biological consequence for many cell types. In contrast, neurons appear to be particularly sensitive to the loss of PI31 function.</p>

<title>Inactivation of PI31 in MNs Disrupts the NMJ and Models ALS Phenotypes.</title>

PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup> Hb9-Cre mice were initially viable but developed motor defects, kyphosis of the spine, and muscle atrophy by the age of 5 mo that became progressively more severe with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). External inspection of these mice revealed severe kyphosis due to atrophy and weakness of paraspinal muscles, and also overt motoric defects that recapitulate phenotypes described for mouse ALS models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Movie S2</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r67">67</xref>). Histological analysis of thoracic cross-sections of 5-mo-old PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup> Hb9<sup>cre</sup> mice revealed highly atrophied musculature in PI31 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>) and concomitant reduction in body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Next, we examined the architecture of the NMJ by staining MN axons with β3-tubulin/synapsin, and the postsynaptic muscle end plate with α-bungarotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Compared to age-matched controls, PI31 mutants displayed severe structural abnormalities, including presynaptic fragmentation of the NMJ, axonal tip swellings, and massive axonal sprouting that are all notable at the age of 5 mo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3 <italic>C</italic>–<italic>E</italic></xref>). These phenotypes recapitulate defects described for several other mouse ALS models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r68">68</xref>). The swelling of axonal tips was apparent in PI31-null MNs as early as 1 mo after birth and became progressively more severe with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). Interestingly, we did not detect any overt morphological abnormalities, or accumulation of poly-Ub proteins and p62 granules and changes in other ALS related proteotoxic markers (FUS1 and TDP43) in MN cell bodies at this stage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5</ext-link>). Moreover, conditional inactivation of PI31 in muscle did not cause any striking anatomical or behavioral phenotypes, even in mice that were aged up to 8 mo. Finally, we also observed accumulation of p62-positive aggregates at the NMJ of PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup> Hb9-Cre mice, but not in control littermates, indicating that loss of PI31 disrupts proteostasis in axon terminals of MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>). Notably, these phenotypes are remarkably similar to those caused by conditional inactivation of Rpt3, a critical component of the proteasome regulatory particle that is required for the degradation of most proteasome substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r69">69</xref>).</p>

<p>We also examined the role of PI31 in the cerebellum, as it provides an outstanding model for studying how proteotoxic stress impairs neuronal function, structure, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r70">70</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r71"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r72"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r73"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r74"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r75"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r76"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r77"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r78">78</xref>).

However, reactive microglia became detectable in the DCN of <italic>PI31</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>
<italic>Pcp2-Cre</italic> mice at P22, and gliosis became more severe at P30 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S8</ext-link>).</p>
<p>An increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and hypertrophy of astrocytes are markers of astrogliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r86">86</xref>). In the mouse cerebellum, GFAP mainly stains the Bergmann glia in the Purkinje and molecular layers, and astrocytes which are predominantly found in the white matter. For <italic>PI31</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>
<italic>Pcp2-Cre</italic> mice, the GFAP staining at P22 was very similar to their control littermates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S9</ext-link>). However, by P30, there was a dramatic increase in reactive astrocytes in the DCN, but not the Purkinje or molecular layers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S9</ext-link>). At P60, we observed some reactive astrocytes in the Purkinje layer, coinciding with the onset of PC loss. Collectively, these observations indicate that inactivation of PI31 causes progressive damage to PC axon terminals, which induces gliosis.</p>
<p>An extension of this analysis to older mice revealed that mutant PCs had lost almost all of their axon terminals in the DCN by the age of 10 mo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). We also observed axonal torpedoes, focal swellings on PC axons that have long been associated with cerebellar disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r87">87</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r88"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r89"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r90">90</xref>). In addition, at this time, there was a major reduction in PC number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). This striking loss of PCs upon inactivation of <italic>PI31</italic> is consistent with the motor defects revealed by gait analysis in these mice. Collectively, our results indicate that loss of PI31 initially impairs local protein homeostasis in axons and dendrites of PCs and disrupts their structure, and that, over time, this compromises cell survival.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p content-type="flushleft">In the present study, we addressed the physiological role of PI31 in mammals by generating complete and conditional PI31 mouse mutants. In contrast to the function implied by its original name, we provide compelling evidence for a role of PI31 in stimulating protein breakdown that is critical for maintaining synaptic structures and long-term survival of neurons. Interestingly, the first morphological defects caused by conditional inactivation of PI31, in both MNs and PCs of the cerebellum, were observed in the distal part of neurons, namely axons and synapses. These structural defects were accompanied by molecular proteotoxic stress markers (accumulation of Ub-GFP, poly-Ub proteins, and p62-positive granules) at the NMJ and in DCN. Importantly, symptoms became progressively more severe with age, culminating in the degeneration of axons and dendrites, and, eventually, cell loss; these morphological abnormalities were also associated with motoric problems, modeling ALS and cerebellar disorders, respectively. Overall, these observations suggest that PI31 activity is required for protein homeostasis in distal compartments of neurons.</p>
<p>A plausible mechanistic explanation for these defects comes from our recent finding that PI31 serves as an adapter protein to mediate fast axonal transport of proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). PI31 can directly bind to dynein light chain proteins and thereby couples proteasomes to cellular motors. Significantly, inactivation of PI31 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> blocks proteasome motility and disrupts synaptic protein homeostasis and structure. This function of PI31 is conserved from insects to mammals, since inactivation of PI31 in mouse hippocampal neurons impairs proteasome movement in axons as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). Although we have not yet been able to perform live-cell imaging analyses to directly demonstrate a requirement of PI31 for proteasome movement in mouse MNs or PCs, impaired transport of proteasomes in axons and dendrites provides an attractive explanation for the observed defects in protein homeostasis at nerve endings. Synapses are highly dynamic sites of active local protein synthesis, which has to be balanced by local protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r91">91</xref>). According to our model, inactivation of PI31 leads to a shortage of proteasomes at synapses, which, in turn, causes the accumulation of poly-Ub proteins and p62-positive aggregates. It appears that backup clearance mechanisms, such as autophagy and possibly also shedding of microvesicles/exosomes, can partially compensate for the loss of PI31-mediated proteasome activity in PI31 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r92">92</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r93"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r94"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r95"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r96">96</xref>). The latter would also explain the gliosis that we observed already at P30 in <italic>PI31</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>
<italic>Pcp2-Cre</italic> mice. However, even if backup clearance pathways are induced, neurons eventually succumb to defects in the absence of PI31 function.</p>
<p>Interestingly, conditional inactivation of PI31 in MNs resulted in kyphosis and ALS-like behavioral phenotypes comparable to inactivation of Rpt3, an essential component of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>). This is somewhat surprising, since Rpt3, unlike PI31, is an essential component of the proteasome regulatory particle. In the mouse embryo, complete inactivation of Rpt3 causes a much more severe phenotype (<italic>Rpt3</italic>-deficient mice die before implantation) than complete inactivation of PI31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r69">69</xref>). Unlike PI31, inactivation of Rpt3 primarily disrupted protein homeostasis in the MN cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>). We interpret this to indicate the importance of localized proteasome activity in axons and dendrites of neurons: Whereas Rpt3 function is required in every cellular compartment, including the nucleus and cell body, PI31-mediated proteasome transport appears to be particularly important for protein homeostasis in axons and dendrites. Since neuronal activity critically relies on proper synaptic function, it may be particularly sensitive to perturbation of synaptic protein homeostasis mediated by PI31. Moreover, it is also possible that proteasomes can be active independent of the main regulatory particle, at least to a certain degree and in some subcellular compartments. Together, the critical and conserved role of PI31 in proteasome transport, the accumulation of nondegraded poly-Ub conjugates and induction of proteotoxic stress in PI31 mutants, and comparison with Rpt3 inactivation in MNs all support a function of PI31 as a positive regulator of proteasome activity.</p>
<p>The activity of PI31 critically depends on Fbxo7, also termed PARK15 in humans, which encodes the substrate recognition component of an SCF E3 ligase complex and binds directly to PI31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). Conditional inactivation of PI31 in mice causes neuronal degeneration, and human mutations in Fbxo7/PARK15 are associated with neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r98">98</xref>). Strikingly, inactivation of Fbxo7 leads to severe reduction of PI31 protein and reduced proteasome activity in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). This suggests the possibility of a direct mechanistic link between PI31, reduced proteasome function, and human disease. However, a role for PI31 in mediating the proteasome impairment and neuronal degeneration observed in Fbxo7/PARK15 mutants was dismissed based on results from cell culture experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r99">99</xref>). The current study, together with the work of Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>), suggests that this topic deserves more careful examination. MEFs deficient for PI31 survived for extended periods of time, and we were unable to detect a major reduction of total proteasome activity in these cells. However, local defects in proteasome activity would not have been revealed by these approaches. When combined with proteasome inhibitors, inactivation of PI31 resulted in a small but significant reduction of cell survival. These findings are consistent with the reported role of the yeast PI31 ortholog to alleviate proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). We also saw that PI31-null MEFs had slight defects in proteasome assembly, as indicated by reduced numbers of single-capped 26S particles. Therefore, PI31 may regulate proteasomes by multiple mechanisms: through the assembly of functional 26S proteasomes from 19S and 20S particles, and via transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). In any event, it appears that neurons are particularly sensitive to the loss of PI31 function, and a neuroprotective role of PI31 should not be ruled out based on results with nonneuronal immortalized cells.</p>
<p>A neuroprotective role of PI31 was particularly obvious in MNs and PCs, 2 major types of neurons with long axons. Therefore, it is possible that large neurons are especially sensitive to the impairment of PI31-mediated proteasome transport, since they face a particularly challenging problem in allocating proteasomes to compartments where protein breakdown has to occur. Moreover, PCs are very sensitive to proteotoxic stress, and PC pathology is a common finding in cerebellar diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r79">79</xref>). Consistent with this, inactivation of PI31 in these cells caused proteotoxic stress as soon as these cells matured (P22), and it led to behavioral and anatomical defects that are characteristic for cerebellar diseases. These include progressively more severe loss of balance and defects in gait, which coincided with axonal swelling, torpedoes, gliosis, and, eventually, loss of PC bodies.</p>
<p>It is well known that protein clearance mechanisms decline during the aging process, and impairment of the UPS in neurodegenerative diseases has been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r100">100</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r101"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r102"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r103">103</xref>). Most of the attention in previous studies has been focused on the ability of aggregates to inhibit proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). However, aggregate-mediated proteasome inhibition cannot explain the failure to degrade poly-Ub proteins and accumulation of aggregates in the first place. We suggest that impaired activity of PI31, caused either by mutations affecting PI31 function (such as Fbxo7/PARK15) or through epigenetic mechanisms during the normal aging process, contributes to age-related neuronal degeneration. The mouse mutant strains described here provide powerful models to further investigate this possibility.</p>

<title>Mice.</title>
<p>In order to generate PI31 mutant using CRISPR\Cas9 technology, we have designed a single-guide targeting RNA that will target the mouse PSMF1 gene in the first exon right after the first Methionine (Psmf1a-1 CACCGAACGGCTACTATGCCTT, Psmf1a-2 AAACAAGGCATAGTAGCCGTTC). Targeting sequence was ordered as oligos and cloned into plasmid px330 (a gift from F. Zhang at Massachusetts Institute of Technology) that contains both Cas9 and the tracer RNA sequence. ES cells were transfected with this plasmid, and Surveyor assay was performed to assess targeting efficiency. Gene targeting resulted in 5 mutant lines, all of which were heterozygous for an indel in the PSMF1 gene. After sequencing the relevant genomic loci, we have decided to continue our research with one clone, which has a 16-bp deletion in the first exon (nt103 to nt118 of open reading frame) that results in a frame shift and a premature stop codon in the second exon (nt239). Homozygous mutants are not viable and die perinatal; hence, we used tissue from E13 homozygous mutant embryos (which are morphologically similar to wild types [WTs]) to test the presence of PI31 protein.</p>
<p>For the generation of conditional PI31 knockout (KO) mice, we have purchased commercially available ES cells (Psmf1<sup>tm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu</sup>). We sequenced these ES cells to validate that they harbor PI31 KO first allele with conditional potential. Chimeras were generated by injection of targeted ES cells into albino blastocysts purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (B6(Cg)-Tyr&lt;c-2J&gt;/J). Next, chimeras were crossed with B6 albino mice (B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J) from The Jackson Laboratory. Heterozygous transgene mice were then bred to mouse expressing FLP-1 recombinase gene under the direction of the human ACTB promoter (The Jackson Laboratory #005703), to create a mouse line where the third exon PI31 is flanked by 2 LoxP sites (PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup>). Conditional PI31<sup>fl/fl</sup> were generated using CDX2-Cre, Hb9-Cre, and Ubc-CreERt, purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.</p>

<title>Gait analysis.</title>
<p>The forepaws of each mouse were painted with nontoxic red paint, and the hind paws were painted with nontoxic blue paint, after which the mice were allowed to walk on paper along a 10-cm-wide by 76-cm-long corridor with 20-cm-high opaque walls. This was done 3 times for each mouse, and each parameter was measured for the 3 longest strides in the middle of a run. The footprint patterns were analyzed for 3 step parameters (all measured in centimeters). As per Carter et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r106">106</xref>), 4 parameters were measured: 1) Stride length was measured as the average distance of forward movement between each stride. 2) Hind-base width, or sway, was measured as the average distance between left and right hind footprints. These values were determined by measuring the perpendicular distance of a given step to a line connecting its opposite preceding and proceeding steps. 3) Distance from left hind footprint to right hind was measured to determine stance length.</p>

The brains were then embedded in Richard-Allan Scientific Neg-50 Frozen Section Medium, and 50-µm sagittal sections were made using a Leica CM 3050S cryostat.</p>
<p>The floating cryostat sections were permeabilized and blocked overnight in 1× PBS/0.3% Triton X-100/5% Normal Donkey Serum (NDS) at 4 °C. The sections were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies (detailed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic></ext-link>) diluted in 1× PBS/0.3% Triton X-100/5% NDS. Subsequently, the sections were washed 3 times for 20 min each in 1× PBS/0.3% Triton X-100/5% NDS and incubated overnight with Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in 1× PBS/0.3% Triton X-100/5% NDS at 4 °C. The sections were then washed 4 times for 30 min in 1× PBS/0.3% Triton X-100/5% NDS and then mounted with Molecular Probes ProLong Diamond antifade mounting medium. Images were captured on a Zeiss confocal LSM780 with Zen software. Images shown are single slices unless otherwise noted.</p>

<title>Quantification of Ub-GFP Fluorescence in Purkinje Axons.</title>
<p>Confocal images of cerebellar sections stained with anti-CALB1 to mark the PCs, and anti-GFP were taken with identical confocal settings (Zeiss confocal LSM780 with Zen software). These images were used for quantification of Ub-GFP in Purkinje axons (illustrated in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911921116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S6</ext-link>). In brief, the calbindin image was used to create an ROI with ImageJ software, which was then superimposed on the Ub-GFP image to measure the integrated density and area of the ROI. For each mouse, at least 3 images per DCN were quantified and averaged, and then the average integrated density/area of <italic>PI31</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>
<italic>Pcp2-Cre</italic> mice (n3) and the average integrated density/area of <italic>PI31</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> control sibling mice (n3) were determined. Excel was used to determine SD and statistical significance by 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> test.</p>
