<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0005">Defects in de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) can cause inborn errors of metabolism. Of particular interest, adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiency, an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism, has been observed in approximately 80 individuals to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0005">1</xref>] and is typically diagnosed by SAICA-riboside accumulation in biofluids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0010">2</xref>]. With advances in genomic sequencing and reduction in cost, it is likely that the number of diagnosed ADSL deficient patients will increase in the future. The phenotype of ADSL deficiency is variable and affects multiple systems, presenting as fatal neonatal, severe, or mild to moderate forms including features such as seizures, autistic traits, psychomotor retardation, respiratory failure, and microcephaly. This implies that there are significant alterations in gene expression in ADSL deficiency. The ADSL enzyme is a homotetramer and mutations in ADSL can result in altered tetramer stability or active site disruption resulting in reduced levels of enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0015">3</xref>]. In the most severe cases, enzyme activity may be reduced by as much as 75%.</p>
<p id="p0010">DNPS is one of the most ancient biochemical pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0020">4</xref>]. In mammalian DNPS, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is converted to inosine monophosphate (IMP) in ten enzymatic steps by six different enzymes. IMP is converted to either adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or guanosine monophosphate (GMP) via two additional enzymatic steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>). ADSL is a bifunctional homotetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the eighth step, forming aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) from phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide (SAICAR). It is also responsible for the final step in the conversion of IMP to AMP, specifically cleaving succinyladenosine monophosphate (SAMP) into AMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>). ADSL is thought to be an enzyme with straightforward and defined functions, however recent evidence suggests a more complicated cellular role.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>de novo purine synthetic pathway (DNPS). PRPP is the input small molecule and is converted by six enzymes in ten steps to IMP and is further processed to either AMP or GMP via two additional steps. ADSL is responsible for SAICAR to AICAR and SAMP to AMP. crADSL is the CRISPR generated HeLa cell line used in this study that lacks ADSL enzyme.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="p0015">The DNPS intermediates and products have multiple functions within the cell including energy production/regulation via ATP, GTP, and cAMP, cellular signaling, growth, and regulation of other pathways. Recently, the intermediate SAICAR was found to allosterically bind pyruvate kinase M isoform 2 (PKM2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0025">5</xref>], the dominant isoform present in tumors. PKM2 catalyzes the last and only irreversible step of glycolysis, forming pyruvate from phosphoenol pyruvate. The dominance of this isoform in tumors is thought to be the root of the Warburg Effect: the production of lactic acid and consequent metabolic reprogramming via aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0030">6</xref>]. PKM2 was also found to act as a co-regulator of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0035">7</xref>] by binding transcription factors. SAICAR binding to PKM2 is thought to activate a “moonlighting” PKM2 protein kinase activity that acts to directly alter transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0035">7</xref>]. However, this hypothesis is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0040">8</xref>]. SAICAR was also shown to bind both the dimeric and tetrameric forms of PKM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0045">9</xref>] although recent work suggests that the binding of SAICAR to the dimer promotes its pyruvate kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0045">9</xref>]. PKM2 was found to induce the hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1α) protein upon nuclear translocation of PKM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0050">10</xref>] which initiates angiogenic and tumorigenic-related events in the cell. SAICAR also accumulates in glucose starved conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0035">7</xref>] although the mechanism for this is not well understood.</p>
<p id="p0020">Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 was used to generate knock-outs of the enzymes involved in DNPS including ADSL (designated crADSL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0055">11</xref>]. The crADSL cells have approximately 1.7% ADSL activity compared to wild type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0055">11</xref>], accumulate SAICAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0060">12</xref>] and fail to grow in the absence of adenine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0055">11</xref>]. To investigate the utility of crADSL as a model for ADSL deficiency, RNA-seq was employed to determine transcriptome differences between crADSL and wild type HeLa (WT) cells cultured for 10 h in the presence/absence of adenine. RNA-seq is a tool that can provide a snapshot of global transcriptional activity and can aid in characterizing cellular response to mutations, nutrients, stressors, etc. Changes in gene transcription can be rapidly identified and parsed into various groupings, such as gene ontologies or characterized pathways and reactions. As an initial step in understanding alterations in gene expression in ADSL deficiency, we used RNA-seq to compare gene expression in wt HeLa and crADSL cells in the presence and absence of SAICAR accumulation.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p id="p0025">crADSL was constructed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0055">11</xref>]. HeLa cells (CCL-2) were purchased from ATCC (Manassass, Virginia, USA). Cells were grown on 60 mm TPP plates (Techno Plastic Products, AG, Switzerland) with regularly refreshed Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 30 μM adenine, and normocin (Invivogen). For purine deprivation experiments (hereafter referred to as starvation), complete medium with 30 μM adenine was exchanged two days and one day before starvation. Adenine is used as a nutritional supplement for DNPS experiments as it can be converted to AMP and GMP via enzymes not affected by DNPS knockouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0065">13</xref>]. Ten to twelve hours prior to starvation, medium was exchanged to DMEM 10% FCS with 100 μM adenine, a concentration of adenine that completely inhibits DNPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0070">14</xref>]. To induce starvation or control conditions, once plates reached ~50–70% confluence, medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% FCM (fetal calf macroserum is FCS dialyzed against saline using a 3.5 kDa barrier), normocin, with or without 100 μM adenine. For cell colony staining experiments, cells were plated in complete growth medium and then medium was exchanged for DMEM 10% FCM, normocin, with or without 30 μM adenine. Cells were fixed in 10% ethanol/3.5% acetic acid solution then stained using 0.1% crystal violet solution.</p>

<title>HPLC analysis of SAICAR metabolite accumulation</title>
<p id="p0030">At each time point, cell culture medium was aspirated and cells were washed once with 1 ml cold (4 °C) 1× PBS and then extracted with 500 μl cold (−20 °C) 80% EtOH. Plates were then thoroughly scraped and the cell material was transferred to microfuge tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 ×<italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C. Samples were dried using a Speedvac, then resuspended in 300 μl freshly prepared mobile phase (50 mM lithium acetate, 5 mM tetra butyl ammonium phosphate, 2% acetonitrile, pH 4.1). Cellular debris was pelleted by two rounds of centrifugation at 14,000 ×<italic>g</italic> for 20 min. Supernatant was frozen at −20 °C until analysis. Samples were transferred to HPLC vials and loaded in an autosampler kept at 10 °C over the course of the runs. Separation of SAICAR was achieved by HPLC–EC analysis similar to our previously described method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0075">15</xref>]. Briefly, separation was obtained using reverse phase HPLC–EC with a TSKgel ODS-80Tm C-18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm ID, 5 μM) protected by Tosoh Bioscience TSKgel guard cartridge. A column temperature of 33 °C was maintained throughout the analysis. Mobile phase was delivered at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Sample extracts and standards were kept at 10 °C and a 30 μl aliquot of each sample was injected using an ESA autosampler (model 542) using a 30 μl partial loop. After injection and separation, analytes were detected using a CoulArray HPLC system (model 5600A, ESA) with three electrochemical detector modules (four flow-through coulometric detectors in series per module for a total of twelve detectors). EC channels were set to a range of potentials from 0 to 900 mV in 100 mV increments, then 1200 mV and 0 mV. Autosampler temperature was kept at 10 °C over the course of runs. Sum of primary peaks area was used to measure analyte accumulation.</p>

<title>RNA-seq</title>
<p id="p0035">Cells were plated on the same day into 60 mm TPP dishes. Four biological replicates were cultured in purine rich or purine free (starvation) media conditions for 10 h as previously described in 2.1, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Final purification was performed via spin columns following the manufacturer's protocol (Machery Nagel), with 50 μl total volume DEPC treated water (Sigma). RNA was quantified by NanoDrop One (Thermo Scientific) and frozen at −80 °C. RNA quality assessment and RNA-seq was performed by The Genomics and Microarray Core Facility at the University of Colorado, Denver. mRNA libraries were constructed using the Nugen Universal Plus mRNA-Seq + UDI kit (cat # 9144–96), and 50 bp single read sequencing was performed employing the Illumina HiSEQ4000.

<p id="p0040">Computation was done on a Dell Precision T1700 computer with an Intel Core i7–4790 3.60 GHz CPU and 32 GB RAM running Linux Mint. The RNA-seq sequences, provided in FASTQ format by the Genomics and Microarray Core Facility at the University of Colorado, Denver, were aligned using hisat2 version 2.1.0 to the “genome_snp_tran” indexed human genome [<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, GRCh38 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="ir0005" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/infphilo/hisat2/data/grch38_snp_tran.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/infphilo/hisat2/data/grch38_snp_tran.tar.gz</ext-link>)]. Samtools 1.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0080">16</xref>] was used to sort entries in the sam file output from hisat2 and convert to bam format. The bam files were processed using the Cufflinks suite version 2.2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0085">17</xref>] with the “advanced” Cufflinks workflow: Cufflinks → Cuffmerge → Cuffquant → Cuffdiff. The Cuffdiff output was processed using CummeRbund 2.24.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0090">18</xref>] and various R and bash scripts (described or provided in Supplemental Material). For each mutant vs. WT comparison, the gene_exp.diff file was filtered for significant entries where FPKM values were FPKM ≥1 and log2 fold change values were log2 ≥ 1 or log2 ≤ −1 (i.e., 2-fold or greater). The 100 DEGs with the highest absolute log2 values (positive and negative) were combined to generate lists of 200 genes for subsequent ClueGO analyses. Comparisons of crADSL to WT in conditions lacking adenine (MM, or “minus to minus” comparison) and in adenine supplemented conditions (PP, or “plus to plus” comparison) were performed.</p>

Data sets were run pairwise using the crADSL plus adenine vs. WT plus adenine comparison (PP) and the crADSL minus adenine vs. WT minus adenine comparison (MM) with the DEG lists described above. Analyses were performed using default settings: the evidence code was set to “all”, and network specificity was set to “representative” with a 3 gene/term cut off, approximating GO levels 3–11. Terms and groups were divided into three categories (MM, PP, or Shared) based on whether most genes defining a term or group were enriched in the MM or PP comparisons, or an equal number of significant genes was obtained from both groups (Shared). Further, “slightly enriched” denotes enrichment by one gene, while “heavily enriched” denotes enrichment by two or more genes.</p>

<title>crADSL requires adenine for proliferative growth</title>
<p id="p0060">Cell growth and purine requirement were assessed for crADSL and WT HeLa cells. When starved long term for purines, crADSL cells showed detachment from the plate and cell death in adenine depleted (purine free) media. In adenine supplemented media, we observed that crADSL takes more time to attach after re-plating and grows more slowly than WT HeLa. WT HeLa showed proliferative growth in both adenine-supplemented and non-supplemented media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>). These results confirm a requirement for purine supplementation for crADSL for proliferative growth.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Adenine is required for proliferative growth of crADSL line.

<title>SAICAR accumulates in crADSL but not WT HeLa cells</title>
<p id="p0065">HPLC-EC analysis of metabolites from starved crADSL and WT cells was performed to characterize SAICAR accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0015">Fig. 3</xref>). In crADSL, the ADSL substrate SAICAR eluted at 50.1 min (Supplemental Fig. 1) with detectable accumulation at 6 h in starvation medium, but not in adenine supplemented medium, and continued until 10 h, the last time point measured. The ADSL product AICAR, which elutes at 24 min, was not observed and SAMP, the second substrate of ADSL, was not observed. This result is consistent with the DNPS pathway block due to ADSL inactivation.<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>SAICAR accumulates in crADSL cells in starvation conditions without adenine. crADSL cells were cultured in 100 μM adenine supplemented (blue) or adenine-free (orange) DMEM with 10% FCM for 10 h.

<title>crADSL and WT show DEGs in both adenine rich and depleted conditions</title>
<p id="p0070">In the experiments described below, purine deprived cells are labeled M and cells in supplemented medium are labeled P. RNA-seq analysis was performed to detect transcriptome changes by cell type and adenine supplementation. Entries with FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped) values &lt;1 were dropped (which removes low count statistical anomalies), and only ≥2-fold FPKM changes (log2 ≥ 1 or log2 ≤ −1) were retained with a <italic>p</italic>-value cut off of 0.05 using Benjamini-Hochberg correction in Cufflinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0085">17</xref>]. Comparison of crADSL to WT in conditions lacking adenine (MM, or “minus to minus” comparison) returns 1659 DEGs (Supplemental Tables 1, 2). A list of the 100 most positive and 100 most negative DEG log2 values was prepared and encompasses log2 value ranges of 8.823 to 2.311 and −2.593 to −8.788, respectively. Comparison of crADSL to WT in adenine supplemented conditions (PP, or “plus to plus” comparison) returns 1426 DEGs. A list of 100 most positive and 100 most negative DEG log2 values was prepared and encompasses log2 value ranges of 8.577 to 2.266 and −2.526 to −8.289, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0020">Fig. 4</xref>). For our generated full list of DEGs, there were 1144 shared genes and 282 (19.8%) and 515 (31.6%) unique identified genes respectively from the PP and MM comparisons.

<title>crADSL and WT HeLa DEGs: Enrichment in ontology terms and groupings in supplemented and starvation conditions</title>
<p id="p0075">Gene Ontologies (GO) are divided into three categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. Each category has a specific aim: biological process includes genes that contribute to completion of a biological objective, cellular component refers to gene product localization, and molecular function refers to the biochemical activity of gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0105">21</xref>]. The Reactome knowledgebase systematically maps gene products into pathway and reaction networks (or metabolic maps, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0110">22</xref>]). In our discussion of ontology and Reactome enrichment in the gene sets, term will be used for a singular ontology or Reactome annotation that shows enrichment due to genes associated with that specific component, pathway, process, reaction, or function. It is important to note that terms may be enriched in a single comparison; that however does not indicate that the term was not significant in the other comparison.</p>
<p id="p0080">In GO Biological Process, DEGs mapped to 95 shared terms in 27 groups (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Fig. 5</xref>, for details see Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3) The most notable among these are epithelial to mesenchymal transition with 29.65% of terms related to this group, amyloid fibril formation with 12.06% of terms associated, and actin nucleation at 7.04%. Other notable shared terms involve processes such as smooth muscle cell and heart structure development, neuron or brain associated function/development, bone mineralization, hormone processing, as well as interleukins, Wnt signaling, and tumor necrosis factor. In the PP comparisons, we see many overlaps within the shared groupings, however it should be noted that exit from mitosis, and transcription regulatory region DNA binding were heavily enriched terms. For the MM comparisons, we see mass overlap of terms associated with larger parent groups in the shared list, however Glycosaminoglycan catabolic process as well as some actin/myosin-based terms were heavily enriched while terms associated with TGFβ were mildly enriched.<fig id="f0025"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Notable processes identified via ClueGO analysis.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0025">Fig. 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="p0085">The Cellular Component ontology produced 6 shared terms in 4 groups (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Figs. 4, 5). Extracellular matrix, platelet alpha granule, as well as peroxisomal membrane were shared. Mild enrichment was noted in the PP comparison lamellipodium membrane and filopodium, while for the MM comparison with 4 terms in 4 groups centered around plasma membrane, golgi, and photoreceptors.</p>
<p id="p0090">Molecular Function ontology showed 9 shared terms in 8 groups (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Figs. 6, 7) in RNA binding at 22.22%, integrin binding at 11.11% Cell-cell adhesion, Laminin binding, and protein self-association type groupings. Mild enrichment in the PP showed 3 terms in 3 groups in Histone acetyltransferase activity, HMG box domain binding, and R-SMAD binding activity while MM has term enrichment in Aβ and TGFβ binding and lipoprotein particle receptor binding.</p>
<p id="p0095">The Reactome Pathway results showed 10 shared terms in 4 groups (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Figs. 8, 9) involved with kinase activity as well as antiviral mechanism by IFN-stimulated genes at 7.41% gene term association term and complement cascades. Collagen type terms were also strongly enriched in shared pairings due to COL15A1, COL25A1, COL3A1, and COL4A4 being present in both lists analyzed. There were no strong preferential associations in the PP list with 5 terms in 4 groups, however slight enrichment in the PP terms were seen in scavenger receptor ligands, EPH-ephrin repulsion, and signaling by PDGF. Immune system terms OAS antiviral response and IFNG response (with 33.33% and 5.43% gene term association respectively) were seen in the PP comparison. The MM comparison showed more interesting enrichment with 19 terms in 6 groups. Due to the TMOD1 and TNNT1 gene differential expression, striated muscle contraction was heavily enriched. HS-GAG metabolism and other terms associated with GAG were heavily enriched in the MM comparison due to differential expression of GPC5 and HSPG2. For genes slightly enriched in the MM comparison over the PP comparison, collagen related terms such as integrin, ECM proteoglycans, and NCAM, CRMPs and semaphorin, as well as post-translational modification were also slightly enriched in the MM comparison. Various interferon and antiviral terms were slightly enriched in the MM comparison.</p>
<p id="p0100">The Reactome Reactions results showed similar patterns as Pathways, with strong enrichment in the MM comparison over the PP comparison. Twenty terms in three groups were shared (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Figs. 10, 11) and centered around collagen with 90.0% term enrichment, granule membrane proteins, and platelet alpha granule with 5.0% each. The singular enriched PP term associated with IFNG was only slightly enriched. MM comparison revealed 17 terms in 6 groups. Heavily enriched terms in the MM comparison were associated with muscle contraction due to the TMOD1 and TNNT1 gene. GAG based tetrasaccharide linker terms were heavily enriched due to the presence of GPC5 and HSPG2. For terms that were slightly enriched in the MM comparison, we see once again interferon and immune-based terms as well as phosphorylation of CRMPs related terms due to the presence of DPYSL3 (CRMP4) in the MM gene list.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="p0115">In this study, we evaluated the dietary requirements and metabolite accumulation during purine starvation for crADSL, and we performed RNA-seq to compare the crADSL and WT HeLa transcriptomes in purine supplemented and starved conditions. Further, we performed qPCR to verify our RNA-seq results. Our results demonstrate that crADSL requires purine (adenine) supplementation for proliferative growth, SAICAR accumulates over a time course of ten hours during purine starvation, and we obtain many DEGs both by cell type and adenine supplementation.</p>
<p id="p0120">Previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0035">7</xref>] support the hypothesis that SAICAR accumulation should produce robust transcriptome changes via the “moonlighting” PKM2 protein kinase activity. It is important to note that their methods are limited to gene chip experiments and not evaluation of viable cells in culture. We observed changes in both PP and MM (SAICAR accumulating) conditions, which suggests that SAICAR accumulation and general ADSL deficiency both mediate transcriptome alteration. Our results show a greater number of DEGs in the MM versus PP comparison, which suggests that SAICAR may be regulating transcription activity, either by a PKM2-SAICAR co-regulation activity or some other mechanism. If PKM2 does act as a co-regulator of transcription, the PKM2-SAICAR complex may potentially activate a select subset of targets for this activity. Our current experiments suggest a SAICAR derived effect on transcription.</p>
<p id="p0125">In GO Biological Process, we obtained a robust group of terms including and related to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ). EMT refers to the process by which polar epithelial cells undergo biochemical changes that convert them to mesenchymal cells, which exhibit increased resistance to apoptosis and enhanced migratory and invasiveness properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0115">23</xref>]. EMT is important in embryogenesis, specifically during primitive streak formation as well as during neural crest formation. EMT in embryogenesis is orchestrated by the Wnt signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0115">23</xref>]. Consistent with the EMT related terms, we also observed Wnt signaling pathway in our shared comparison. Disruption in EMT might play an important role in the developmental and neurological phenotypes associated with ADSL deficiency (discussed below). EMT is also important in inflammation and cell migration. Upon trauma to basement membranes, epithelial cells can undergo EMT in response to inflammation from injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0120">24</xref>]. Our results show changes in genes in inflammation/interferon pathways, such as interferon signaling, and IL-1β secretion. Terms associated with interferon, inflammation, and immunity were present in the MM comparison, which suggests that these transcriptional changes are the result of SAICAR accumulation and supports the tentative hypothesis that ADSL deficiency may be an immunological disorder. It also suggests that ADSL deficiency and/or DNPS deficiency may play an important role in immune dysfunction in cancer.</p>
<p id="p0130">In our GO and Reactome analyses, many shared terms mapped to development associated groups. Since ADSL deficiency is a developmental disorder with phenotypes including dysmorphic features, cognitive deficits, seizures, and psychomotor retardation, it is possible that these terms may be relevant to a plausible explanation of phenotype. In addition, we observed an interesting enrichment in many muscle and movement type terms and groups. This is consistent with the high level of expression of ADSL in muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0125">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0130">26</xref>] and may be informative to the psychomotor retardation phenotype observed in ADSL deficiency. Our GO and Reactome results indicate that disruption to DNPS (and ADSL specifically) alters energy production and energy levels and sensing needs, which affect force generation in muscle cells.</p>
<p id="p0135">Cancer is characterized, among other features, by constitutive cellular division, alterations in cellular metabolism (Warburg Effect) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0135">27</xref>], collagen network restructuring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0140">28</xref>], metastasis and infiltration, and changes in immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0145">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0150">30</xref>]. Our results show enrichment for these and related terms, which suggests important roles for DNPS deficiency and/or SAICAR accumulation in these cancer-related processes. In addition to the collagen, integrin, EMT, actin, and ECM terms, our GO cellular component analysis showed enrichment for lamellipodia and filopodia. Filopodia employ integrins to produce finger-like protrusions preparatory to cellular migration. Filopodia formation is an important mechanism for cell migration and infiltration during tumor cell metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0155">31</xref>]. Recently, the role of ADSL in certain cancer types was probed suggesting a potential link in aggressive phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0160">32</xref>].</p>
<p id="p0140">While the scope of this manuscript is focused on the ontologies associated with DNPS and ADSL knockout, several individual genes were identified as of specific interest. Aberrations in ALPP, a placental alkaline phosphatase, have been implicated in spontaneous abortions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0165">33</xref>], and in some forms of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0170">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0175">35</xref>]. Twist1 is a transcription factor important for craniofacial and organ development during embryogenesis, most likely from mesoderm derived tissues, and has been identified in multiple types of tumors and involved in cancer metastasis, resistance to chemotherapy, and it can over-ride oncogene induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0180">36</xref>]. TUSC3 (tumor suppressor candidate 3) is associated with multiple functions including Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake, glycosylation and embryonic development, in addition to its tumor suppression function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0185">37</xref>]. IQGAP2 integrates Rho GTPase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin signals for cellular adhesion and cytoskeleton reorganization and was recently found to act as a tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0190">38</xref>]. DPYSL3 (CRMP4) is primarily a neuronal protein expressed during development and adult stages and is responsible for various tasks including cell migration, differentiation, neurite extension, and axonal regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0195">39</xref>]. It also has been found to play a role in some non-neuronal cancers in migration and metastasis, although the exact role is still being investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0200">40</xref>]. GATA3 is a transcription factor and regulator of numerous developmental pathways and has been found heavily associated with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0205">41</xref>]. OASL is a gene associated with viral response and immunity, with activation carried out by interferons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0210">42</xref>]. TGFβI is a ubiquitously secreted ECM protein with plausible participation in morphogenic, embryonic developmental, adhesive/migratory, tumorigenic, wound healing, and inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0215">43</xref>]. It is apparent with ontologies and gene variability that DNPS and ADSL provide an important context for the study of developmental and cancer biology.</p>
<p id="p0145">Individuals with ADSL deficiency have a mutated form of ADSL with reduced enzymatic activity. This implies reduced (but not halted) conversion of SAICAR to AICAR and is consistent with results from patient studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0005">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0015">3</xref>]. Due to a reduced rate of conversion of SAICAR to AICAR, we would expect transcriptome alteration due to persistent elevation in SAICAR and a reduction in the rate of DNPS. Here we present results detailing transcriptome changes in crADSL due to elimination of ADSL enzyme activity. Future studies will investigate differences between mutant forms of ADSL, and may employ specific cell lines to assess the effects of ADSL dysregulation in developmental, tumor, vascular and muscle biology. These cells and cells transfected with mutant forms of ADSL should provide an invaluable cellular model of ADSL deficiency.</p>
