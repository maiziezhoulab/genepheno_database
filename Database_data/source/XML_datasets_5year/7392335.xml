<abstract>
<p>Machine learning algorithms trained to predict the regulatory activity of nucleic acid sequences have revealed principles of gene regulation and guided genetic variation analysis. While the human genome has been extensively annotated and studied, model organisms have been less explored. Model organism genomes offer both additional training sequences and unique annotations describing tissue and cell states unavailable in humans. Here, we develop a strategy to train deep convolutional neural networks simultaneously on multiple genomes and apply it to learn sequence predictors for large compendia of human and mouse data. Training on both genomes improves gene expression prediction accuracy on held out and variant sequences. We further demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to apply mouse regulatory models to analyze human genetic variants associated with molecular phenotypes and disease. Together these techniques unleash thousands of non-human epigenetic and transcriptional profiles toward more effective investigation of how gene regulation affects human disease.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Human population genetic studies have highlighted thousands of genomic sites that correlate with traits and diseases that do not modify gene sequences directly, but instead modify where and when those genes are expressed. To better understand how these sites influence traits and diseases, and consider their relevance for drug development, we need better models for how DNA sequences determine gene expression. Recently, machine learning algorithms based on deep artificial neural networks have proven to be promising tools toward this end. In this work, we improve upon the state of the art model accuracy by combining training data from both humans and mice. Using these models, we can predict the effect of a genetic variant on gene expression in any tissue or cell type with available data. We further demonstrate that predictions for human variants derived from mouse training datasets are highly informative and offer unique insight into the genetic basis of gene expression and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Predicting the behavior of any nucleic acid sequence in any nuclear environment is a primary objective of gene regulation research. In recent years, machine learning approaches to directly tackle this problem have achieved significant accuracy gains predicting transcription factor (TF) binding, chromatin features, and gene expression from input DNA sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref007">7</xref>]. These models have been applied to study genetic variation in populations and generate mechanistic hypotheses for how noncoding variants associated with human disease exert their influence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref008">8</xref>]. Estimates for how mutations influence regulatory activity have also offered novel views into regulatory evolution and the robustness of genes to such mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved state of the art performance for many regulatory sequence activity prediction tasks in humans and other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref007">7</xref>]. The complexity of mammalian gene regulation and these models’ impressive but imperfect predictions suggest room for improvement remains. In particular, distal regulation by enhancers is incompletely captured by existing models, which do not attempt to consider sequence beyond ˜20 kb of transcription start sites (TSSs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref009">9</xref>]. Obtaining more training data is a reliable strategy to improve model accuracy. The research field continues to generate new functional genomics profiles, but these merely deliver additional labels for the existing sequence data; fitting more expressive and accurate models would benefit more from entirely new training sequences. Acquiring functional profiles for more humans will provide limited new training data because individual human genomes differ only slightly from each other. In reporter assays, large quantities of synthetic sequences can be profiled, but they are limited to short sequences and cell lines that cannot represent the full complexity of human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Non-human species offer a potential source of this desired additional training data. Regulatory sequence evolves rapidly, but TF binding preferences are highly conserved due to the drastic effect that modifying affinity for many thousands of binding sites would confer on the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref017">17</xref>]. Prior work studying cross-species machine learning of TF binding and chromatin marks indicates potential utility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref019">19</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that regulatory grammars across related species have enough in common that jointly training large models on vast data from multiple species will improve regulatory sequence activity models derived by machine learning. To explore this data source, we chose the mouse as a distant mammal with substantial functional genomics data available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to serving as a source of more genomic sequences, mouse experiments can explore biological states that are difficult or unethical to acquire in humans, e.g. profiling mouse development, disease, and genome modifications. If context-specific regulatory grammars are sufficiently conserved across species, then models trained to predict these mouse data may be able to impute human genome profiles to study human regulatory sequences and genetic variation. Although models trained on mouse will not match the performance of analogous human models, they may serve as useful approximations and produce novel variant annotations when the human data are unavailable.</p>
<p>In this work, we trained a deep multi-task convolutional neural network to jointly learn the complex regulatory grammars that determine TF binding, chromatin marks, and transcription using the ENCODE and FANTOM compendia of thousands of functional genomics profiles from hundreds of human and mouse cell types. We benchmarked single versus joint genome training and found that jointly training on human and mouse data leads to more accurate models for both species, particularly for predicting CAGE RNA abundance. We demonstrated that mouse regulatory grammars can be transferred across species to human where they continue to make accurate tissue-specific predictions. Applying this procedure to predict human genetic variant effects revealed significant correspondence with eQTL statistics and proved insightful for studying human disease.</p>

<title>Multi-genome training improves gene expression prediction accuracy</title>
<p>We applied the Basenji software and framework to predict functional genomics signal tracks from only DNA sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref005">5</xref>]. The neural network takes as input a 131,072(= 2<sup>17</sup>) bp sequence, transforms its representation with iterated convolution layers, and makes predictions in 128 bp windows across the sequence for the normalized signal derived from many datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). We applied an architecture that uses residual connections to alleviate the strain of vanishing gradients in deep network optimization and improve generalization accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref021">21</xref>]. Training on multiple genomes required several further developments (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). Most importantly, we modified the train/valid/test split of the genomic sequences to ensure that homologous regions from different genomes did not cross splits (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>); without this step, we might overestimate generalization accuracy.</p>

<title>Predicting regulatory sequence activity for human and mouse genomes.</title>
<p>We predict the regulatory activity of DNA sequences for multiple genomes in several stages (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). The model takes in 131,072 bp DNA sequences, encoded as a binary matrix of four rows representing the four nucleotides. We transform this representation with seven iterated blocks of convolution and max pooling adjacent positions to summarize the sequence information in 128 bp windows. Green and purple heatmaps represent convolution filter weights; red and white heatmaps represent pooled sequence vectors. To share information across the long sequence, we apply eleven dilated residual blocks, consisting of a dilated convolution with exponentially increasing dilation rate followed by addition back into the input representation. Finally, we apply a linear transform to predict thousands of regulatory activity signal tracks for either human or mouse. All parameters are shared between species except for the final layer.</p>

</fig>
<p>We assembled training data consisting of 6,956 human and mouse quantitative sequencing assay signal tracks from the ENCODE and FANTOM consortiums (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). These data describe regulatory activity across tissues and isolated cell types using several techniques—DNase and ATAC-seq to measure DNA accessibility, which typically mark TF-bound sites, and ChIP-seq to map TF binding sites and histone modification presence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref023">23</xref>]. The FANTOM data consists of RNA abundance profiling with CAGE, where the 5’ end of the transcript is sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref024">24</xref>]. These 5’ RNA profiles are independent of splicing and allow us to provide input DNA sequence without gene annotations, which would not be the case for RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref005">5</xref>]. In addition, we added several mouse datasets describing cell states that are unavailable for humans: (1) a single cell ATAC-seq atlas from 13 tissues clustered to 85 distinct profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref025">25</xref>] and (2) several TF and chromatin profiles obtained over 24 hour time courses in the liver to study circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s019">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>To measure the influence of multi-genome training on generalization accuracy, we trained three separate models on these data: one jointly fit to both human and mouse, one to human data alone, and one to mouse data alone. For each scenario, we fit the same model architecture and hyperparameters. We trained the models to minimize log Poisson loss and assessed accuracy by computing Pearson correlation between the predictions and observed signal for each dataset.</p>
<p>The joint training procedure improved test set accuracy for 94% of human CAGE and 98% of mouse CAGE datasets (binomial test p-values 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>), increasing the average correlation by .013 and .026 for human and mouse respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g002">Fig 2a and 2c</xref>). For DNase, ATAC, and ChIP, joint training improved predictions by a lesser margin relative to single genome training; average test set correlation increased for 55% of human and 96% of mouse datasets (binomial test p-values 3 × 10<sup>−11</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g002">Fig 2b and 2d</xref>).</p>

<title>Training on human and mouse data improves generalization accuracy.</title>
<p>We trained three separate models with the same architecture on human data alone, mouse data alone, and both human and mouse data jointly. For each model, we computed the Pearson correlation of test set predictions and observed experimental data for thousands of datasets from various experiment types. Points in the scatter plots represent individual datasets, with single genome training accuracy on the x-axis and joint training accuracy on the y-axis. For CAGE, training on multiple genomes increases test set accuracy on nearly all datasets for both (a) human and (c) mouse. (b,d) For DNase/ATAC/ChIP-seq, test set accuracy improves by a smaller average margin.

<p>Comprehensive breakdown across the various classes of functional genomics experiments revealed heterogeneous benefits across the ChIP-seq immunoprecipitation targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Predictions for the promoter mark H3K4me3 generally improved, but accuracy for the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 decreased slightly on average across cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), perhaps due to human and mouse genomes containing different repetitive elements that are silenced by the modification. We made use of annotations assigned to the human DNase collection by Meuleman et al. to split DNase accuracy comparisons by fifteen distinct organ systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref026">26</xref>]. Although several systems achieved significantly lesser or greater accuracy margins, deviations were small, and no clarifying patterns emerged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The datasets where single genome accuracy exceeded joint tended to be consistent across a second independent batch of training runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). ChIP-seq experiments in the cancer cell lines K562 and MCF-7 were significantly enriched in this set, suggesting that modeling these datasets may slightly suffer due to absence of an analogue across species or somatic mutation divergence from the reference genome.</p>
<p>Joint genome training delivers both more sequences and more annotations. To clarify which factor is more important for improving accuracy, we conducted additional training experiments in which we only modulated the number of human genome annotations. In this regime of ample data, holding out even half of the human datasets to reduce the number trained on did not reduce predictive performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). This implies that the joint model’s increased accuracy depends on also having the additional training sequences contributed by the second genome.</p>
<p>CAGE has several properties that may explain the observed benefit of having more training data from multiple genomes. CAGE signal has a larger dynamic range that spans orders of magnitude and more sophisticated transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that often involve distant sequences. Measured by gradient-based saliency analysis, the jointly trained model makes greater use of long range activating elements (&gt; 10 kb) to predict CAGE signal at TSSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that regulatory grammars are sufficiently similar across the 90 million years of independent evolution separating human and mouse so that their annotated genomic sequences provide informative multi-task training data for building predictive models for both species.</p>

<title>Regulatory sequence activity models transfer across species</title>
<p>Regulatory activity conservation across related species has been observed in genome-wide functional profiles of TF binding and histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref017">17</xref>]. In matched tissue samples, similar TFs are typically present and those TFs have highly conserved motif preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref027">27</xref>]. These findings suggest that a regulatory sequence activity model trained to predict for one species will also make usefully accurate predictions for matched samples from the other. This was recently demonstrated for enhancer annotations and histone modifications across a variety of mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref018">18</xref>]. To quantify this phenomenon for our models and data, we selected several diverse and representative tissues and cell types for which we could unambiguously match across species—cerebellum, liver, and CD4+ T cells. We extracted CAGE gene expression measurements from the TSSs for all human genes outside the training set and computed predictions for human and mouse versions of these tissues and cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). For this exercise, and those to follow, we used the jointly trained multi-task model and sliced out predictions of interest, but results were consistent for the model trained only on mouse data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Regulatory grammars are largely conserved across species.</title>
<p>(a) Tissue-specific regulatory grammars can be learned and transferred across species, exemplified here by CAGE and DNase data and predictions for cerebellum and liver. The “human predicted” tracks describe predictions for the human datasets displayed as “human observed”; “mouse predicted” tracks describe predictions for the matched mouse dataset. We scaled coverage tracks by their genome-wide means separately within all CAGE and all DNase/ATAC data. (b,d) Mouse predictions for cerebellum CAGE and DNase correlate strongly with human data. For CAGE, points represent the top 50% most variable TSSs. Data or predictions were quantile normalized to align sample distributions, log transformed, and mean-normalized across samples. For DNase, points represent the top 10% most variable genomic sites (less than CAGE because we consider the whole genome rather than TSSs). Data or predictions were similarly quantile normalized to align sample distributions and mean-normalized across samples. The statistical trends were robust to top variable threshold choice. Scatter plot lines represent ordinary least squares regressions. (c,e) These correlations are specific to the matched tissues and not shared by others.</p>

</fig>
<p>Across human gene TSSs, we observed cross-species prediction accuracy of 0.73 Pearson correlation for mouse predictions to human observed signal averaged across these samples. This approaches the 0.75 correlation for human predictions to human observed signal, but does suggest that some genome-specific activity exists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). To assess whether the model further captures and transfers tissue specificity, we normalized each TSS’s data or predictions by its mean across all CAGE datasets. Mean normalization removes correlation driven by accurate prediction of global cross-tissue activity. On this more challenging task, normalized mouse predictions achieved mean 0.40 Pearson correlation with normalized human data for the matched samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g003">Fig 3b and 3c</xref>). In contrast, normalized predictions compared to data from distinct tissues/cell types resulted in negative or near zero correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g003">Fig 3c</xref>). Thus, the model has learned tissue and cell type specificity beyond a baseline level and is able to transfer that knowledge across species.</p>
<p>We repeated these analyses with DNase accessibility profiles for the same tissues and cell types to assess how general this transferability is for different data. Because most sites lack activity, we selected the top 10% most variable. We observed the same statistical trends for accessibility—high correlation between mouse predictions and human data for matched samples (mean 0.84) and specificity in scaled comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g003">Fig 3d and 3e</xref>).</p>
<p>Less correlation for the mouse predictions relative to human predictions is expected because the human predictions are derived from training on the exact experimental sample (but different sequences), which may have its own unique attributes and biases. To gain further insight into this phenomenon, we plotted the human and mouse residuals against local GC% in a 1,000 bp window around the sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Indeed, we observed correlations between GC% and the residuals that were greater for the mouse versus human predictions. Thus, GC% calibration, or more sophisticated forms of domain adaptation, may be an interesting avenue to explore to further improve cross-species transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<title>Mouse-trained models elucidate human genetic variant effects</title>
<p>A driving goal of regulatory sequence modeling is to predict the effect of human genetic variants on gene expression and downstream phenotypes. For any biallelic variant, we can predict signal across the surrounding genomic sequence for each allele and derive a summary score for the variant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g004">Fig 4a</xref>). Here, we sum the signal across the sequence and take the difference between alleles. We can compute this score for every dataset using two forward passes of the convolutional neural network.</p>

<p>(a) We predicted the effect of human genetic variants on imputed regulatory signal trained on mouse single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC) cluster profiles. We scored variants by subtracting the signal from the minor allele from that of the major and summing across the sequence. (b) We used signed linkage disequilibrium profile (SLDP) regression to compare the cell type-specific variant effect predictions to tissue-specific eQTL summary statistics from GTEx. Cell type profiles correspond best with the expected tissues. (c) GTEx tissues correspond best with the expected cell types.

</fig>
<p>Models trained on mouse data allow one to predict the difference between how two human alleles would behave if they were present in the regulatory environment of mouse cells. Given the evidence that analogous human and mouse cells largely share regulatory grammars, we hypothesized that models trained on mouse data would be insightful towards understanding human regulatory variants’ function. To test this hypothesis, we studied the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) release v7a data of genotypes and gene expression profiles for hundreds of humans across dozens of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref029">29</xref>]. In previous work, we showed that variant scores derived from Basenji predictions corresponded significantly with GTEx summary statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref005">5</xref>]. Here, we conducted a similar analysis using signed linkage disequilibrium profile (SLDP) regression to measure the statistical concordance between signed variant effect predictions and GTEx summary statistics (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref008">8</xref>]. SLDP distributes a signed annotation (i.e. our scores) according to a given population’s LD structure and compares to a set of summary statistics. Using a permutation scheme, the method produces a signed Z-score that specifies the direction and magnitude of the relationship and a p-value describing its significance.</p>
<p>We focused on a dataset unique to the mouse—a single cell ATAC-seq atlas from 13 adult mouse tissues that reported 85 distinct cell types after clustering analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref025">25</xref>]. Merging aligned reads for each cell type cluster produced pseudo-bulk coverage profiles, which we trained to predict. We sliced predictions for these datasets from the model trained jointly on all human and mouse data. We first asked whether coverage tracks derived from clustering single cell assays are amenable to Basenji modeling. Predictions for held out sequences achieved Pearson correlation ranging from 0.43-0.84 in 128 bp windows for these 85 profiles, which is in line with predictions for bulk DNase/ATAC-seq.</p>
<p>Human variant predictions for these models generally exhibited a strong positive relationship on GTEx summary statistics, in line with prior observations that accessibility correlates with gene expression. Furthermore, cell type predictions aligned well with anatomical expectations. For example, variant predictions for cardiomyocytes have the strongest relationship with GTEx measurements in the heart and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g004">Fig 4b</xref>). From the opposite direction, GTEx measurements for the liver have the strongest relationship with variant predictions for hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g004">Fig 4c</xref>). These results further support the claim that human and mouse cells share relevant regulatory factors and that our procedure can project these factors across species from mouse experiments to human variants. For each pair of mouse ATAC cell types, we computed the correlation between their SLDP Z-scores across GTEx tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g004">Fig 4d</xref>). The correlations revealed expected structure, with clusters representing the blood, endothelial cells, neurons, among others.</p>
<p>Next, we asked whether these or any other mouse datasets were informative above and beyond available human datasets. Theoretically, we can add scores for every human dataset to the SLDP background model, forcing the statistical test for mouse dataset scores to consider only the residual variance in GTEx summary statistics (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). We implemented a far more computationally efficient close approximation, in which we added 64 principal components of the variant by score matrix for human datasets, which explained 99.9% of variance for CAGE and 99.3% for DNase/ATAC.</p>
<p>Even considering the human data, many mouse datasets still emerged as delivering orthogonal value by SLDP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Among CAGE data, developmental heart profiles from neonate and embryo stages had significant positive relationships with GTEx tibial artery (10 datasets with FDR <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05) and left ventricle (41 datasets with FDR <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05). These suggest that human adult heart gene expression depends on genetic variation that acts more prominently during early development, which is recovered more effectively by current data from mice. Among DNase/ATAC, variant predictions for the single cell hepatocytes and a 24 hour time course to profile circadian rhythms of genome accessibility in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref030">30</xref>] showed a significant positive relationship with the GTEx liver statistics (7 datasets with FDR <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05). GTEx samples were collected at a variety of day times, and previous work demonstrates that they can be ordered to recover circadian cycling genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref031">31</xref>]. Our result suggests that available human DNase profiles fail to recover this variance, but uniquely obtainable mouse time series do.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the improved accuracy of the jointly trained models on held out chromosome sequences would carry over to more effective variant analysis. To assess this, we computed SLDP Z-scores to GTEx tissues for all human and mouse CAGE and DNase datasets using models trained jointly or on single genomes. For both species, the jointly trained models achieved greater SLDP Z-scores than their single genome counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). Thus, multi-genome training leads to greater concordance between variant effect predictions and GTEx summary statistics.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared our variant effect prediction pipeline to an analogous state of the art pipeline called DeepSEA via SLDP Z-scores versus GTEx summary statistics for all tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref006">6</xref>]. We computed the difference between the two alleles for the same set of variant using the latest DeepSEA “beluga” model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref007">7</xref>]. We manually matched human DNase datasets between the two models, arriving on 100 unambiguous matched datasets. Z-scores from our cross-species Basenji model predictions were greater than those from the DeepSEA model predictions for 69.7% (permuting Basenji/DeepSEA labels p-value &lt;1 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). This result suggests that our regulatory variant annotation pipeline represents the current state of the art among this family of approaches for extracting information relevant to gene expression variation in human populations.</p>

<title>Mendelian disease variant classification</title>
<p>Having established the relevance and specificity of mouse dataset predictions for expression phenotypes, we asked whether these models could provide insight into the genetic basis of human disease. Mouse data has proven valuable for studying human genetic variants in previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref025">25</xref>], but these analyses were limited to studying variants in homologous sequences in their mouse genome context. The substantial regulatory sequence turnover between these genomes makes this limitation severe. Our predictive framework avoids this limitation by projecting the learned mouse regulatory grammar to the human genome setting for all variants via machine learning.</p>
<p>We assembled a set of 660 validated noncoding variants implicated in human disease from the HGMD and ClinVar databases that are &gt; 20 bp away from mRNA splice sites (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref033">33</xref>]. We constructed a set of negative variants that have matching nucleotide composition, with each variant located approximately 1000 bp from a pathogenic variant to control for genomic region (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). We trained random forest classifiers to distinguish variants from these two classes based on features derived from various sets of variant effect predictions in eight fold cross validation. We selected the default hyper-parameters of the scikit-learn 0.22 implementation after finding negligible accuracy gains were available by modifying them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref034">34</xref>]. However, due to the large number of features derived from the training datasets, setting the maximum features considered per decision tree split to <italic>log</italic><sub>2</sub> of the total number of features greatly improved the computational efficiency.</p>
<p>We compared ROC curves produced by models trained on variant predictions for only human datasets (trained jointly with mouse), only human datasets (trained alone without mouse), only mouse datasets, and both human and mouse datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g005">Fig 5a</xref>). To stabilize accuracy statistics, we repeated the cross validations and stochastic model fitting for 200 iterations and compared models with Mann-Whitney U tests. Human predictions from the model trained jointly produced more accurate classifiers than human predictions from the model trained alone, 0.817 to 0.810 AUROC (p-value 2 × 10<sup>−10</sup>). Adding the mouse predictions as features further improved accuracy to 0.821 (p-value 3 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). Thus, these results suggest that both the joint training procedure and addition of mouse dataset prediction features deliver value for classifying pathogenic noncoding variants. We provide a final random forest classifier trained on the entire variant set with the human and mouse features via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/calico/basenji">https://github.com/calico/basenji</ext-link> for other groups to apply and make use of.</p>

<p>(a) The line plots display ROC curves derived from classifiers trained to predict 660 validated noncoding pathogenic variants curated from the HGMD and ClinVar databases from a negative set chosen to control for nucleotide composition and genomic region. “Basenji/human1” uses variant features produced by a model trained on human only, while all other versions use a model trained jointly on both human and mouse. Using this jointly trained model, “Basenji/human”, “Basenji/mouse”, and “Basenji/human+mouse” produce variant features from predictions for human datasets, mouse datasets, and both human and mouse datasets respectively. For each feature set, we trained random forest classifiers in 200 iterations of eight fold cross validation. (b) We performed an analogous exercise using a set of 1524 variants fine-mapped to have high causal probability &gt; 0.95 for complex traits in the UK BioBank relative to variants with fine-mapped causal probability 0.001 − 0.01. Below, we display three example variants causally implicated to affect LDL cholesterol levels that have large Basenji scores for DNase-seq over a 24 hour time course in mouse liver.

<title>Complex traits GWAS variant classification</title>
<p>We further hypothesized that these variant effect predictions would deliver insight into noncoding variants highlighted by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits and common diseases. We focused our analysis on fine-mapped associations for 47 phenotypes (including 14 common diseases) measured in the UK BioBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref037">37</xref>]. 1524 variants had posterior probability &gt; 0.95 of causally affecting one of the phenotypes. We sampled an equal number of negative set variants from marginally associated variants that were determined to have low causal probability 0.001 − 0.01 in the same analysis. As above, we fit random forest classifiers on variant feature sets derived from various sets of models and predictions.</p>
<p>As with Mendelian disease variants, fine-mapped GWAS variants can be classified far beyond random guessing. Similar to above, we repeated 200 eight fold cross validation iterations of stochastic model fitting and compared models with Mann-Whitney U tests. Human predictions from a model trained jointly on human and mouse exceeded the accuracy of human predictions from a model trained alone (0.803 versus 0.800 AUROC, p-value 7 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). Adding mouse predictions further improved AUROC to 0.805 (p-value 2 × 10<sup>−3</sup>).</p>
<p>Although recently fine-mapped, most of these variants remain poorly understood. Given the insight above that mouse circadian liver profiles are informative above and beyond human datasets for GTEx liver summary statistics, we focused on variants associated with the related trait LDL cholesterol levels. To reveal regulatory context around these high causal probability variants, we performed saturation mutagenesis of their surrounding region.</p>
<p>rs12740374 emerged as a clear top hit, creating a CEBPA binding motif in the 3’ UTR of CELSR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g005">Fig 5c</xref>). GTEx liver statistics indicate that individuals with the minor allele T have increased expression of nearby genes CELSR2, SORT1, PSRC1, and ATXN7L2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref029">29</xref>]. Musunuru et al. validated the differential CEBPA binding and established that increased liver expression of SORT1 alters plasma LDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref035">35</xref>]. Thus, this variant offers a strong positive control for our analysis pipeline.</p>
<p>We identified several other compelling variants. rs17248748 is located in the first intron 6 kb from the TSS of low-density lipoprotein receptor LDLR. The variant has minor allele frequency 0.5% in the 1000 Genomes reference panel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref038">38</xref>], which is too rare to be thoroughly assessed by GTEx as an eQTL. The minor allele T creates a motif that matches the binding preferences of the TF HNF4A, which is a major regulator of liver development and circadian rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref040">40</xref>]. Coding variants in LDLR are known to cause Mendelian hypercholesterolemia, but noncoding variants have been far less studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref041">41</xref>]. Another hit, rs45613943, is located in an intron 13 kb downstream of the TSS of PCSK9. The minor allele C has 5% frequency in 1000 Genomes, and GTEx identified its association with decreased PCSK9 expression in whole blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref038">38</xref>]. The reference allele T forms a motif for the nuclear factor I family, which are general activating TFs implicated in a variety of cellular processes. Coding variants in PCSK9 also cause hypercholesterolemia, and their association with LDL has been thoroughly studied and confirmed by the success of PCSK9 inhibitor therapies to lower cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref041">41</xref>]. Together, these variants represent intriguing potential routes by which regulatory variation around critical Mendelian genes modulates their expression to more subtly influence related phenotypes.</p>

<title>Mouse-trained models highlight mutations relevant to human neurodevelopmental disease</title>
<p>Given the thorough developmental profiling in mouse, we hypothesized that these data might also be a useful lens through which to view human developmental disorders. We retrieved a recent dataset of 1902 quartet families from the Simons Simplex Collection with whole genome sequencing of a mother, father, child affected by autism, and unaffected sibling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref042">42</xref>]. In these data, the offspring have an average of 67 de novo mutations, which have a slight enrichment in promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref043">43</xref>]. Recent work demonstrated that variant effect predictions further differentiate autism probands from their unaffected sibling controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref044">44</xref>]. We hypothesized that predictions using models trained on mouse data would also distinguish the disease and perhaps provide additional insight via novel developmental profiles.</p>
<p>We applied the model to predict how each de novo mutation would influence signal in 357 mouse CAGE profiles of tissues and cell types. We filtered for variants within 50 kb of a GENCODE mRNA TSS, where we observed there to be a greater difference between probands and siblings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s013">S13 Fig</xref>), in line with previous analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref044">44</xref>]. We also observed there to be more signal present in negative variant effect predictions, which indicate mutations that disturb active regulatory elements, and scaled these scores by 10x before taking their absolute value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s014">S14 Fig</xref>). Mann-Whitney U (MWU) tests revealed significantly greater variant effect predictions in the probands versus sibling variant sets for 333 CAGE profiles at FDR &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g006">Fig 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s020">S2 Table</xref>). Variant effect predictions did not depend on the age of either parent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). The distribution of P-values for 13 datasets profiling whole body from embryonic and neonate developmental stages was less than the distribution of p-values for the other datasets (MWU p-value 7.7 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). These results were robust to the gene distance filter and negative variant effect prediction weight in a large range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s013">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s014">S14</xref> Figs), but statistical significance was markedly reduced without any gene distance filter. These experiments show all parameter combinations tested, but p-value magnitudes should be interpreted cautiously given the challenge of multiple hypothesis correction in an exploratory analysis with hyperparameters. Although many brain datasets were statistically significant by this test, these data did not collectively stand out among the other CAGE profiles.</p>

For each dataset, we computed a Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test between proband and sibling sets and corrected for multiple hypotheses using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Predictions for many datasets were enriched for greater values in the probands, driven largely by early developmental profiles. Each dataset’s x-axis position is the mean natural log over proband variants minus the equivalent over control variants.

<p>We examined the regions around variants predicted to have high impact.

YY1 has been implicated in processes that determine the three-dimensional positioning of promoters and enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref046">46</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that the variant modifies the enhancer regulation of this critical protein.</p>
<p>We observed similar results in Zhou et al.’s independent processing of these raw sequencing data, which resulted in nearly two fold fewer de novo variant calls due to different filters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s016">S16 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref044">44</xref>]. For these variants, 269 CAGE datasets were significant at FDR 0.05, whole body embryonic and neonate developmental stages had lesser p-values (MWU p-value 4.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), and brain datasets did not collectively emerge. For additional perspective, we also analyzed DNase and activating histone modifications H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac. For these data, variant effect predictions tended to be larger for proband variants, but the minimum q-value after Benjamini-Hochberg correction of all datasets together was 0.14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s016">S16 Fig</xref>). However, both the set of 259 early development profiles and the set of 144 brain profiles achieved lesser p-values than the rest (MWU p-value 7.7 × 10<sup>−4</sup> and 1.4 × 10<sup>−12</sup> respectively). The reduced signal in these data is likely attributable to CAGE’s more direct measurement of gene product. The Basenji model has no knowledge of coding sequence or ability to make predictions about coding influence. Nevertheless, we verified that variants overlapping coding sequence evaluated for their influence on gene regulation minimally affect the observations above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s017">S17 Fig</xref>). Finally, we also examined human predictions for context, and observed many significant CAGE datasets after FDR correction at 0.05, but no trends for tissue or developmental-specific sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s018">S18 Fig</xref>). Thus, as supported by the conditional SLDP regression to GTEx, the mouse developmental profiles appear to deliver novel information to this analysis.</p>
<p>These significant enrichments indicate that regulatory variant effect predictions may help classify disease at the individual level. For each individual, we computed a simple risk score by summing predictions for a leading developmental dataset mouse CAGE whole body embryonic stage E16. This score suggests more deleterious de novo variants for 54.7% of the probands versus their sibling controls (binomial test p-value 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008050.g006">Fig 6c</xref>). Thus, this approach is a strong candidate for inclusion with complementary feature sources from coding mutations and structural variation to continue to characterize this incompletely understood disorder.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we developed a multiple species training procedure to enable a deep convolutional neural network to train multi-task on 6956 functional genomics signal tracks annotating the human and mouse genomes. We observed that training jointly on both species produced models that make more accurate predictions on unseen test sequences relative to models trained on a single species. Regulatory sequence activity predictions for human sequences in mouse tissues correlate well with datasets describing the corresponding human tissues. Model predictions for altered regulatory activity of human genetic variants made with respect to mouse datasets have a strong statistical concordance with tissue-specific human eQTL measurements. Mouse machine learning models can be used to study human disease, exemplified by the beneficial addition of prediction features to disease variant classifiers.</p>
<p>We focused here on human and mouse because both species have been comprehensively studied with genome-wide functional genomics. Our observation that joint training on these two genomes improves prediction accuracy opens the possibility of more complex schemes for training on larger numbers of genomes. Given the substantial evolutionary distance between human and mouse, regulatory annotations for all mammalian genomes are likely to provide similarly useful training data. Primate genomes will be particularly interesting to explore; their tissues and cell types will more closely match those of human, but their highly similar sequences deliver less novelty. Prediction accuracy improved more for CAGE gene expression measurements than accessibility or ChIP-seq, which suggests that multiple genome training will be worthwhile for data with high regulatory complexity and distal interactions. Efforts to predict spatial contacts between chromosomes as mapped by Hi-C and its relatives fit this criteria, and we hypothesize that training sequence-based models on human and mouse data together will be fruitful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>Much prior work has revealed the similarity of regulatory grammars across species, but transferring knowledge gleaned from an accessible model organism (such as mouse) to another of interest (such as human) has remained challenging. Many existing approaches rely on whole genome alignments to transfer annotations from one genome to the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref048">48</xref>]. These approaches are constrained by the quality of the alignment, which is a notoriously challenging bioinformatics problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref049">49</xref>], and the limited proportion of each genome that aligns (40% for human and 45% for mouse). Here, we demonstrated an alternative approach, in which a machine learning model trained on the model organism data compresses the relevant knowledge into its parameters. The model can then be applied to predict activity for sequences from a different genome of interest. The strong tissue-specific statistical relationship between human genetic variant predictions from model parameters trained to predict mouse annotations and GTEx tissue-specific eQTLs highlights the successful nucleotide resolution of our cross-species transfer of learned regulatory grammars. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) contains tens of thousands of mouse functional genomics profiles, many describing experiments impossible in humans. For example, we included dozens of datasets describing mouse liver profiles over 24 hour time courses to study the circadian rhythms of gene expression and chromatin. Models trained to predict the data studied here, as well as open source software to compute these predictions and train new models on users’ own data, are available in the Basenji software package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref050">50</xref>].</p>

<title>Functional genomics data</title>
<p>In this work, we studied quantitative sequencing assays performed on human and mouse samples. Specifically, we focused on DNase and ATAC-seq profiling DNA accessibility, ChIP-seq profiling TF binding or histone modifications, and CAGE profiling RNA abundance derived from 5’ transcription start sites. Preprocessing these data effectively is critical to successful machine learning. Our primary preprocessing objective is to denoise the raw data to the relevant signal at fine resolution.</p>
<p>We largely followed the preprocessing pipeline described in prior research introducing the Basenji framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref005">5</xref>]. The standard pipeline through which experimental data flowed follows:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Trim raw sequencing reads using fastp, which can automatically detect and remove unwanted adapter nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Align reads using BWA to hg38 or mm10 and requesting 16 multi-mapping read positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Estimate nucleotide-resolution signal using an open source script (<italic>bam_cov.py</italic>) from the Basenji software that distributes multi-mapping reads using expectation maximization, normalizes for GC bias, and smooths across positions using a Gaussian filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>However, we diverted from this standard pipeline for all data available from the ENCODE consortium website, which is 4,506 human and 1,019 mouse experiments. These data have been thoughtfully processed using open source pipelines and are available for download at several stages, including log fold change signal tracks in BigWig format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref053">53</xref>]. Rather than reprocess these data without full knowledge of how replicate and control experiments match, we chose to use these signal tracks directly. The Seattle Organismal Molecular Atlas (SOMA) server provides a single cell mouse ATAC-seq atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref025">25</xref>]. These data are also available in log fold change BigWig format, and we similarly chose to use these rather than reprocess the single cell data. We clipped negative values in all such BigWig tracks to zero.</p>
<p>We applied several transformations to these tracks to protect the training procedure from large incorrect values. First, we collected blacklist regions from ENCODE and added all RepeatMasker satellite repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref054">54</xref>], which we found to frequently collect large false positive signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref055">55</xref>]. We further defined unmappable regions of &gt;32 bp where 24-mers align to &gt;10 genomic sites using Umap mappability tracks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref056">56</xref>]. We set signal values overlapping these regions to the 25<sup><italic>th</italic></sup> percentile value of each dataset. Finally, we soft clipped high values with the function <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) = <italic>min</italic>(<italic>x</italic>, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> + <italic>sqrt</italic>(<italic>max</italic>(0, <italic>x</italic> − <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>))). Above the threshold <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> (chosen separately for each experiment and source), this function includes only the square root of the residual <italic>x</italic> − <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> rather than the full difference. We manually chose <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> per experiment and source by inspecting the maximum values, aiming to reduce the contribution of rare very large values that one would not expect to generalize to other genomic locations. Via this procedure, we decided to clip all CAGE data with <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = 384, ENCODE with <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = 32, and GEO with <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = 64.</p>
<p>When replicate experiments profiling the same or related samples were available, we averaged the signal tracks. Altogether, the training data includes 638 CAGE, 684 DNase/ATAC, and 3991 ChIP datasets in human and 357 CAGE, 228 DNase/ATAC, and 1058 ChIP datasets in mouse. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s019">S1 Table</xref> describes all data with preprocessing parameters.

<title>Model architecture</title>
<p>We modeled genomic regulatory sequence activity signal as a function of solely DNA sequence using a convolutional neural network. Such deep learning architectures have excelled for many similar tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref006">6</xref>]. We follow our prior work in analyzing large 131 kbp sequences in order to consider long range interactions.</p>
<p>The first stage of the architecture aims to extract the relevant sequence motifs from the DNA sequence using the following block of operations:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Convolution width 5 (or 15 in first layer)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Batch normalization</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Max pool width 2</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We applied this block seven times so that each sequence position represents 128 bp, increasing the number of filters from an initial 288 by 1.1776x each block to 768 filters by the end. The GELU activation slightly outperformed the more common ReLU in our benchmarks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>The second stage of the architecture aims to spread information across the sequence to model long range interactions. In prior work, we applied densely connected dilated convolutions for this task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref005">5</xref>]. Here, we applied a related but more effective variation, which is related to a strategy applied for DNA sequence analysis in the SpliceAI system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref058">58</xref>]. Recent deep learning research has revealed that skip connections between layers where one layer’s representation is directly added to a subsequent layer’s representation relieve vanishing gradients and improve gradient descent training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, we applied the following series of operations:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>GELU activation</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Dilated convolution width 3, dilation rate <italic>d</italic>, 384 filters</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Batch normalization</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>GELU activation</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Convolution width 1, back to 768 filters</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Batch normalization</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Dropout probability 0.3</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Addition with the block input representation before step 1.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We applied this block eleven times, increasing the dilation rate <italic>d</italic> by 1.5x each time. Relative to the densely connected version, the dilated residual blocks lead to improved generalization accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008050.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In the final stage, we first transformed this 1024x768 (length x filters) representation of 128 bp windows with an additional width 1 convolution block using 1536 filters and dropout probability 0.05. To make predictions for either 5313 human or 1643 mouse datasets, we applied a final width one convolution followed by a softplus activation (<italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) = <italic>log</italic>(1 + <italic>e</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>)) to make all predictions positive. We attached a genome indicator bit to each sequence to determine which final layer to apply.</p>
<p>We trained to minimize a Poisson log likelihood in the center 896 windows, ignoring the far sides where context beyond the sequence is missing. The Poisson model is not technically appropriate for the log fold change tracks. However, by clipping negative values to zero, the distribution of values resembles that from our standard processing. Clipping to zero focuses attention on signal magnitude in regions where relevant signal is present and away from less relevant signal fluctuations in background regions. On a subset of data, we observed that using the log fold change track did not decrease accuracy or the utility of the model for genetic variant analysis.</p>
<p>We implemented the network in TensorFlow and used automatic differentiation to compute gradients via back propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref059">59</xref>]. We minimized with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on batches of 4 sequences. We stopped training when the loss on a validation set had not improved for 30 epochs and returned to the model weights that had achieved the minimum validation loss. We performed several grid searches to choose model and optimization hyper parameters for the following sets: (1) SGD learning rate and momentum; (2) initial convolution filters and convolution filter scaling rate; (3) dilated convolution filters and dropout rate; (4) final convolution filters and dropout rate.</p>
<p>Data augmentation describes a suite of techniques to expand the implicit size of the training dataset from the perspective of model training by applying transformations that preserve annotations to data examples. We tiled the 131,072 bp sequences across the chromosomes by 65,599 bp, representing a 50% overlap minus 63 bp in order to also shift the 128 window boundaries and max pooling boundaries. During training, we cycled over combinations of two transformations that maintain the relationship between sequence and regulatory signal while changing the model input: (1) reverse complementing the sequence and reversing the signal; (2) shifting the sequence 1-3 bp left or right. Both transformations improved test accuracy and reduce overfitting in our benchmarks.</p>

<title>Multi-genome training</title>
<p>Training on multiple genomes containing orthologous sequence complicates construction of holdout sets. Independently splitting each genome’s sequences would allow training on a human promoter and testing on its mouse orthologue. If the model memorized conserved elements of the sequence, rather than learning a general function, we might overestimate generalization accuracy.</p>
<p>We used the following procedure to minimize occurrence of this potential issue:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Divide each genome into 1 mb regions.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Construct a bipartite graph where vertexes represent these regions. Place edges between two regions if they have &gt;100 kb of aligning sequence in a whole genome alignment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Find connected components in the bipartite graph.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Partition the connected components into training, validation, and test sets.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We used the hg38-mm10 syntenic net format alignment downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref060">60</xref>]. Using this procedure, we set aside approximately 12% of each genome into validation and test sets respectively. Stricter parameter settings created a single large connected component that did not allow for setting aside enough validation and test sequences. We estimated that &lt; 1% of the validation and training set nucleotides have orthologous sequence from the other genome in the training set.</p>
<p>Another complication of training on multiple genomes arises from imbalance between each genome’s sequences and datasets. We extracted 38.2k human and 33.5k mouse sequences for analysis. We assembled batches of sequences from one genome or the other, chosen randomly proportional to the number of sequences from each genome. The overall loss function comprises a term for every target dataset summed, which leads to larger step magnitudes for batches of human sequences that are annotated with &gt;3 times more datasets. Explicit weighting could be applied to preference training towards a particular species, but we found this to be unnecessary in our experiments for good mouse performance.</p>
<p>Jointly training on both human and mouse data constrains the model slightly more than is ideal. We found that training on only one genome or the other after the full joint procedure improved validation set accuracy. We evaluated the model on the validation set after every epoch and stopped training after 10 epochs without improvement, returning to the previous model that achieved the minimum validation loss. The model studied here was fine-tuned for 8 epochs on the human data and 20 epochs on the mouse data.</p>

<title>GTEx SLDP</title>
<p>We predicted the effect of a genetic variant on various annotations by computing a forward pass through the convolutional network using the reference and alternative alleles, subtracting their difference, and summing across the sequence to obtain a single signed score for each annotation. We averaged scores computed using the forward and reverse complement sequence and small sequence shifts to the left and right. We computed scores for all 1000 Genomes SNPs, which we provide for download via instructions at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master/manuscripts/cross2020">https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master/manuscripts/cross2020</ext-link>.</p>

To assess statistical significance, we performed the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to correct for multiple hypotheses within each GTEx tissue.</p>

<title>ClinVar and Human Gene Mutation Database</title>
<p>We acquired a set of 15,751 pathogenic noncoding variants curated by di Iulio et al. from ClinVar and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref061">61</xref>]. These variants were enriched near splice sites, and many presumably influence splicing. As we do not position our method to predict splicing effects, we removed all variants within 20 bp of GENCODE v28 mRNA splice sites. We further noticed that the remaining variants often clustered together in the genome. To establish a set of variants that function independently, we grouped variants within 10 bp into sets and sampled one representative variant from each set. After applying these filters, 660 validated noncoding variants remained.</p>
<p>We sought a negative set of variants for training machine learning classifiers that roughly controlled for genomic region and nucleotide composition. Using the following procedure, we selected a negative example corresponding to each pathogenic variant. First, we considered positions shifted up and downstream in the genome by 1000 bp. From these anchor positions, we located the nearest reference nucleotide that matched the reference nucleotide of the pathogenic variant. We chose the shifted position that was closer to 1000 bp from the pathogenic variant position and broke ties randomly. Finally, we chose the alternative allele to match the pathogenic variant. Thus, each negative variant matches the nucleotides of a pathogenic variant, while being shifted as close to 1000 bp as possible.</p>

In the first model <italic>Dense</italic>, which achieved the previous best for these data in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref005">5</xref>], each layer takes all previous dilated layers as input, as opposed to taking only the preceding layer. In the second model <italic>Residual</italic>, introduced here, each layer takes only the previous layer as input, transforms it, and adds the new representation into the input before passing on. For each model, we computed the Pearson correlation of test set predictions and observed experimental data for thousands of datasets from various experiment types. (a) Training and validation loss curves for two replicates of the two architectures with random initializations and shuffled training examples. The top curves represent the training set and the bottom curves represent the validation set. Validation losses are less than training losses due only to stochasticity in the sequence splitting procedure. (b) Human and (c) mouse test set Pearson correlation for the best <italic>Dense</italic> versus <italic>Residual</italic> model.</p>

<title>Multi-genome model assigns greater saliency scores to distal TSS regions.</title>
<p>For 3,523 gene transcription start sites (TSS) that were not included in the training set, we computed saliency maps for the surrounding region using the model trained jointly on human and mouse (joint) and the model trained on human alone (single). The saliency map scores annotate 128 bp segments with a function of the model predictions’ gradient with respect to that segment’s vector representation after the convolutional layers and before the dilated convolutions share information across wider distances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref005">5</xref>]. Peaks in this saliency score detect distal regulatory elements, and its sign indicates enhancing (+) versus repressing (−) influence. (a) For each 128-bp segment, we computed the mean score across genes for liver CAGE. Patterns were consistent across CAGE datasets. (b) For segments greater than 10 kb from the TSS, the mean multi-genome model scores are greater than their single genome counterparts. This suggests that distal enhancer elements are more effectively used to predict gene expression.</p>

<title>Multi-genome training accuracy across experiment types.</title>
<p>We trained the same architecture on human data alone and both human and mouse data jointly. For each model, we computed the Pearson correlation of test set predictions and observed experimental data for human CAGE, DNase, and ChIP-seq datasets. Points in the scatter plots represent individual datasets, with single genome training accuracy on the x-axis and joint training accuracy on the y-axis. We considered these accuracy comparisons, broken down by experiment class for the 24 most frequent experiments. Within the various categories, the improvement differed slightly. For example, H3K4me3 increased by 0.006, but H3K9me3 decreased by 0.007. Enhancer marks H3K4me1 (-0.004), H3K27ac (0), and P300 (-0.001) were stable or unimproved.</p>

Pearson R improves by an average of 0.006 across all of these DNase datasets. Within the various categories the improvement differed slightly. “Musculoskeletal” datasets improved by 0.008, which was significantly greater than the remainder by Mann-Whitney U test with p-value 2<italic>e</italic> − 7. In contrast, “Connective” datasets improved by 0.004, which was significantly less than the remainder with p-value 1<italic>e</italic> − 10.

<title>Multi-genome training harms generalization accuracy for some human ChIP-seq datasets.</title>
<p>To further explore human ChIP-seq datasets that performed worse during multi-genome training relative to single genome training, we trained two independent replicates for both training modes. For the single genome training, we took the average of the two replicates. (a) For the multiple genome training, we plot the ChIP-seq test set PearsonR for replicate 1 minus the single genome PearsonR versus that for replicate 2. Dataset accuracy was consistent across replicates, and some ChIP-seq datasets consistently achieved lower accuracy after multi-genome training. (b) The table displays the 20 datasets with the largest decrease in test set accuracy after multi-genome training. Datasets describing (a) ATF4/CREB binding (known co-factors), (b) K562 cells, and (c) MCF-7 cells performed significantly worse according to Mann-Whitney U comparisons of the sets of 16, 476, and 129 datasets respectively. Histograms consider the average of test set PearsonR for multi-genome training minus the average for single genome training.</p>

<title>Additional human datasets do not improve generalization accuracy.</title>
<p>We designed several experiments to explore whether more datasets alone improve the models, rather than the datasets and novel sequence offered by the mouse genome. We split all human datasets into eight, four, three, or two folds. For each fold, we held out those datasets and trained a model only on the remainder. We trained four replicate models from random initializations on the full data for comparison. For the three fold experiment, we repeated the procedure with a unique random split twice. For the two fold experiment, we repeated the procedure with a unique random split three times. For each dataset, we averaged test set accuracy for the training runs that did train on it, each of which had a different portion of the datasets held out. Above, we scatter plot average test set accuracy for each of the 5,313 datasets for the full data versus the held out data runs for each experiment. If it were true that adding more annotations benefited model training and accuracy, then these models would suffer from the held out targets and show reduced accuracy relative to the full model. Instead, for each experiment with hold outs up to half of the datasets, these models achieved slightly greater mean accuracy than the full data model.</p>

Mouse predictions correspond to mouse datasets matched and compared to human datasets For CAGE, we considered the top 50% most variable TSSs, where data or predictions were quantile normalized to align sample distributions, log transformed, and mean-normalized across samples. For DNase, we considered the top 10% most variable genomic sites (less than CAGE because we consider the whole genome rather than TSSs), where data or predictions were similarly were quantile normalized to align sample distributions and mean-normalized across samples. The statistical trends were robust to most variable threshold choice. Tissue-specific cross-species accuracy depends only slightly whether the mouse model was trained jointly with human data (left column) or alone (right column).

In each plot, points represent CAGE datasets, from which a predicted activity difference can be assigned to each variant. We scaled negative variant scores by 10 before taking the absolute value. In each row, we filtered for variants within the specified distance of a GENOCODE mRNA TSS. On the x-axis, we plot the mean natural log score for all proband variants subtracted by the mean natural log score for all sibling variants. On the y-axis, we plot the <italic>log</italic><sub>10</sub> p-value from comparing proband to sibling scores using a Mann-Whitney U test. Variants nearby TSS contain more signal than those that are very far from genes, which may nonetheless have nonzero CAGE predictions due to enhancer RNA activity. At the most strict distance threshold of 30kb, the x-axis difference between probands and siblings continues to grow, but the y-axis significance is decreased by the smaller number of remaining variants. The Zhou et al. datasets are robust to the filter distance, but the An et al. datasets only reach FDR q-values &lt; 0.1 with TSS filters &lt; 500 kb (which keeps 90% of variants) and decrease as the filter distance tightens around TSS.</p>

<p>We predicted the influence of de novo variants found in proband and sibling whole genomes sequences processed by An et al. for mouse datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1008050.ref043">43</xref>]. Variant predictions are derived from a representative dataset of “whole body, embryo E16” profiled by CAGE that has significantly greater effect score for probands relative to their sibling controls. We transformed the raw variant predictions similarly to the main analyses by scaling negative variant scores by 10 before taking the absolute value and further adding a pseudocount of one and taking the natural logarithm to improve the stability of the scores for the visualization. Regression analysis indicates no dependency of the scores on the mother or father’s age at birth. This result matches that of Zhou et al. in their analysis of a separate processing of these data.

<p><bold>Reviewer #1: </bold>In the manuscript “Cross-species regulatory activity sequence prediction” by David Kelley the author presents modifications and applications of his previously developed deep convolutional neural network based framework, basenji, to predicting regulatory sequence activity when jointly considering human and mouse data. The manuscript evaluates the extent to which predictions within a species can be improved by doing multi-task training across species. The manuscript also evaluates how well models trained to predict mouse activity perform when applied to predict activity in human sequence. Models trained using mouse data are then applied to predict the effect of genetic variants and are then related eQTLs in GTEx and de novo variants from autism whole genome sequencing (WGS) data.</p>
<p>Figure 5a appears to be reporting a major result though I am surprised the text is not highlighting the significance of what is being reported. In Fig. 5a the author is reporting case control differences with multiple of their mouse CAGE predictive models at a p-value better than 10^-6 with at least one model getting a p-value better than 10^-7. In contrast, in two recent high profile papers considering the same autism WGS data, in somewhat analogous analyses (Supplementary Fig. 4 from Zhou et al Nature Genetics, 2019 and Fig 1e from An et al, Science 2018) did not get p-values better than 10^-4 despite conducting an order of magnitude more statistical tests. Zhou et al Nature Genetics, 2019 also used a deep learning sequence based prediction strategy. There are a number of differences in how these analyses were conducted so it is hard from what is presented to know what is driving this large improvement in p-values. (I am assuming here the y-axis in Fig 5a is in base 10 scale though that was not explicitly noted)</p>
<p>Given that this has the potential to be a major result, I think the author should present more analyses and information allowing a reader to better understand the result, its relationship to previously reported results in the literature, and be convinced of the biological significance of the result as opposed to being driven by something technical. I have a number of comments/suggestions in this regard:</p>
<p>i) Can the author explain why the p-values appear to be substantially more significant for the mouse CAGE data in Fig. 5a than for the human CAGE data in Sup. Fig. 8 even though the application of the model is within human? Maybe looking at the correlation of predictions for corresponding brain predictions between human and mouse and/or whether anything can be said about the specific variants better predicted using data from one species or the other would help with this.</p>
<p>ii) Is the author currently including protein coding variants in the p-value calculations? If so what happens to the p-values if protein coding variants are excluded from the analysis? Protein-coding variants are known to already have a strong detectable association with ASD so it would be less interesting if the signal is coming from protein coding variants.</p>
<p>iii) An et al, Science 2018 corrected for parental age in computing p-values. If the author corrected for parental age what would happen to their reported p-values?</p>
<p>iv) Zhou et al, Nature Genetics 2019 used a different set of de novo mutational calls from An et al, Science 2018 and used here, with a notable difference of excluding variant calls overlapping repeat elements. If the author applies their predictions on the same set of de novo mutation calls from Zhou et al what p-values result?</p>
<p>v) Are these strong p-values unique to CAGE data or can they also be seen in chromatin data?</p>
<p>vi) To what extent can the author’s predictions recall case de novo mutations at high precision? This type of evaluation could be more relevant than a p-value across the full distribution since the expectation with de novo mutations is that their contribution is through a smaller number of larger effect variants</p>
<p>vii) The methods states “We filtered these variants for SNPs”. Can the author provide more details of what SNP list was used for filtering, how many variants were filtered, and whether this is causing difference with previous analyses?</p>
<p>viii) The author should provide as a supplementary data or a file on a website that provides their scores for each de novo mutation based on each CAGE dataset</p>
<p>Another major comment I have about this manuscript is that I think the author should evaluate the extent to which improvements for human predictions when training with mouse is occurring because of the diversity of sequence space the mouse provides as motivated in the introduction, or if a similar or better improvement would be seen by using an equivalent number of additional datasets from human. The author only used ENCODE and FANTOM5 data in human so is far from exhausting the available data sets on regulatory activity collected directly in human as there are large datasets from other consortium (e.g. Roadmap Epigenomics, Blueprint) and databases that provide uniform reprocessing of major data repositories (e.g. ChIP-atlas and ReMap). The framework the author is proposing might actually make more sense when the primary interest is in a mammal with far less functional genomics data available than mouse or human.</p>
<p>Additional comments</p>
<p>*There are similarities between what the author is doing here and Chen et al, PloS Comp 2018. The authors cite that manuscript in the results section, but I think the author should acknowledge this prior work and clarify the contribution of this manuscript to prior work up front in the introduction.</p>
<p>* On page 10, the authors say their procedure can suggest high level annotations for 6/9 of the unknown single cell clusters. Is this leading to different/better suggestions than using nearby gene expression of cluster peaks?</p>
<p>* The methods could be more detailed/precise in places. For example, how was the threshold t_c chosen? Another example, it is stated “We found that training several epochs on only one genome or the other after the full joint procedure improved validation and test set accuracy.” How many epochs did the author actually use for this final step and how was it determined?</p>
<p>* It is stated “Stricter parameter settings created a single large connected component that did not allow for setting aside enough validation and test sequences”. This does not directly address whether the current settings are adequate to avoid the memorization issue</p>
<p>* page 12 line 239, “negative predictions” used before explaining “negative predictions” at the bottom of the page</p>
<p>*there are ? in sup. Fig 1 and 2 legends</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold> The author proposed a deep convolutional neural network based model for cross-species regulatory sequence activity prediction. The author trained the model with both human and mouse genomic data and showed that the jointly trained model achieves better performance as compared to the individually trained model. Next, the experiments were designed to show that the model trained in mouse could help reveal human genetic variant effects. Specifically, the author demonstrates that by training a model with a mouse species-specific data, scATAC-seq, it would help better characterize the effects of variants in human as compared to the model trained on other existing data in the human. This may suggest the potential of this work for generalizing patterns learned from one species to another. However, there are a few major problems with this work.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>1. In terms of methodology, it lacks novelty. The strategy is simply concatenating two datasets from different organisms and making sure that homologous sequences appear in the train/test set together. This is hardly a new computational development effort. The author also said that a novel transfer learning approach was developed, but it seems that this is just training the model on mouse dataset and predicting on the human dataset, which is not exactly transfer learning. There are no methods such as domain adaption developed for the specific problem. This is more like a cross-species validation/assessment rather than a transfer learning approach.</p>
<p>2. In the first section of the results, the author compared the performance of a jointly trained model versus the model trained with the independent dataset. However, there are existing methods for cross-species/cross-cell type functional genomic signal prediction. For example, Chen et al. PLOS Computational Biology 2018 (PMID: 30286077) and also Lan et al. Int J Mol Sci. 2019 (PMID: 31336830). Although the setting is not exactly the same because one is binary classification while this one is regression, it is rather straightforward to adapt those methods to the setting in this work. The comparison with existing methods is lacking.</p>
<p>3. For the third subsection in Result. The author showed the importance of the orthogonal information brought in by the mouse scATAC signal by including the principal components of human signals in the background model. The results showed that the mouse signals can be important, but the level of importance is still not clear. It would be interesting to design the experiment when the human signal and mouse scATAC signal are jointly tested. This would help to quantitatively analyze the importance of this orthogonal information by comparing the Z-score from the human signal and mouse signal. If in this test the mouse signal consistently shows up at the top, then it can demonstrate the usefulness of this method to generalize signals from another organism to the human better. I think that this needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>Figure 1,3,4 are barely readable. The font size is really small and thin.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold> In this manuscript, the author demonstrates the superior performance of a deep convolutional neural network trained on both human and mouse gene regulatory sequences compared to models trained on data from a single species. Furthermore, the predictions from both the joint model and the mouse model were able to predict the effect of human variants, suggesting the generalization of the approach. In general, the manuscript is well written and easy to follow. The author performed an extensive analysis across a variety of genomic data and demonstrated the possible use of other species data in improving the understanding of human genetic variants. The results presented in the manuscript have many merits and also raise a few questions as follows.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that CAGE eRNA profile prediction improves more than prediction of other functional genomics features from ENCODE/Roadmap. Are there substantial differences between functional genomics profiles or cell types of origin in terms of the improvement provided by the method introduced here?</p>
<p>Line 102–108. To me “regulatory programs” implies the particular combinatorial patterns of many regulatory elements that drive specific patterns of gene expression. Thus, in my view, it is not necessarily true that the regulatory programs themselves are conserved, but rather that the components of these programs are conserved. To extend the “program” analogy further: human and mouse may have different regulatory programs, but these programs are written in the same language.</p>
<p>In the last Results section “Mouse-trained models highlight mutations relevant to human neurodevelopmental disease”:</p>
<p>- The predictive power of summing the negative predictions in the neonate cerebellum dataset at predicting cases from controls (Figure 5C) seems quite poor. Is it possible to benchmark this performance with the deep learning model used in Zhou et al. Nature Genetics 2019 (PMID: 31133750)?</p>
<p>- In the cross-specifies prediction, such as Figure S5d, the mouse model’s prediction is worse than human predictions. Have you analyzed the sequences that the mouse model failed to predict? Could it be partially driven by the very different GC content landscape in the mouse genome compared to the human genome?</p>
<p>- The result section emphasizes that the mouse-trained model can be applied to understand human disease. While this point is true, given the abundance of human data and potentially better performance of human model (Figure S8) in this autism cohort, it would be useful to also demonstrate that incorporation of mouse data with the human data helps. More specifically, demonstrate that the human predictions from the human-mouse joint model is better than the human predictions from the human only model.</p>
<p>- As a final general comment, the impact of the manuscript would be stronger if (especially in the applied sections of the Results) the authors could compare to other state-of-the-art machine-learning-based methods for regulatory variant interpretation.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>The Introduction (Lines 25 – 32) does not fully cover the previous literature on the prediction of genomic data using multiple species. in paragraph. The author did mention some previous work in the Results section (Line 114). It would be better to cover this background more fully in the Introduction and to cite other relevant work, such as Cohn et al. 2018 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/264200v2">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/264200v2</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Line 20. The author mentioned that “Individual human genomes differ only slightly from each other, so acquiring functional profiles for more humans is unlikely to provide this boost.”</p>
<p>I don’t necessarily agree with the point. Although small percentage of the genome differs between individuals, the total amount genetic variants is large and gives rise to the diversity of human phenotypic traits and diseases. I would acknowledge that multiple different ways of obtain more training data may be helpful.</p>
<p>Line 191 – 210. In Figure S6, is the mouse single cell ATAC-seq dataset used in the SLDP? I didn't see any of the mouse scATAC data sets among the significant ones.</p>
<p>Figure 3c,e: It would be helpful to use a simpler color map with white at 0 and a gradient to a single color to represent positive values and to a different single color for negative values. See: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-data/9781492031079/ch04.html">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-data/9781492031079/ch04.html</ext-link></p>
<p>Line 297–299. This claim is not accurate. This manuscript is not the first to propose that machine learning models can be used to extract relevant features independent of alignability to apply across species. In other words, previous approaches for applying machine learning methods to infer regulatory activity and functional genomics feature profiles across species do not all rely on alignability of the underlying sequences.</p>

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p>
<bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold>
</p>
<p>
<bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: In the revised manuscript of “Cross-species regulatory sequence activity prediction” I felt my previous comments were partly addressed. I still have some comments on the manuscript.</p>
<p>1. I previously raised the point about whether the increased predictive power was due to unique information in mouse sequence data, or whether comparable predictive performance increase could be obtained from incorporating additional human data. I pointed out that there are many additional sources of human data not being used. In response, the author showed there was basically no impact on predictive performances when downsampling the current set of human data to 7/8 the size.</p>
<p>I did not find this analysis fully satisfying for two reasons. One reason is that holding 1/8 of the human data sets out amounts to 664 human data sets, while there was 1,643 mouse data sets used, thus the comparison of value of additional human vs. mouse data is confounded by the number of data sets. The other reason is that the analysis is effectively assuming the current human data being considered is representative of all available human data, which is likely not the case. I expect that when one gets data from an additional source, even if it is from the same species, it will contain more new information compared to data obtained in the same way as the data being currently considered.</p>
<p>2. The procedure for the autism analysis was changed to remove variants not within 50kb of a TSS, and to weigh negative predictions 10 times more than positive predictions. I did not suggest either of those specific changes. While the p-values improved (when everything is compared in log10 space), it is now more difficult to interpret the p-values. The reason is that I assume there was some type of multiple testing going on in selecting these parameters, but that procedure was not described and any additional tests were not reflected in a multiple testing correction, but should be. Also, I think it would be informative to report as was done in the original submission how well the scores does directly without going through this filtering and reweighting. The reported predictive performance at the individual level for the top variant feature might also be inflated by multiple testing issues.</p>
<p>3. Related to the previous point, in the original submission there was emphasis on brain being the important cell/tissue type, but now the emphasis is on earlier development stages and the brain does not standout. It is concerning the biological conclusions are that sensitive to these specific parameter choices. Further raising concern, the text mentions ‘whole body embryo E16’ being the leading dataset, but according to Supplementary Table 2, ‘whole body embryo E16’ is third most significant and ‘urinary bladder, adult’ is actually the most significant.</p>
<p>4. The author asked for clarification on the point about parental age. An et al described in their paper their procedure for controlling for parental age and provide parental age annotations with it. Zhou et al did not correct for parental age, but did show that parental age was not correlated with their score. While the author’s score might not be correlated with age, that was not shown. Zhou et al not seeing a correlation with parental age for their score, does not imply that the authors’ scores is not correlated with parental age, though does make that possibility more likely.</p>
<p>5. On the point about annotating unknown clusters from Cusanovich et al. I don’t think its been shown that the author’s procedure is actually leading to better annotations opposed to being willing to annotate a cluster when there is still more uncertainty. For example for cluster 5.6, a number of different brain regions rank highly in Fig. 4b of the author's manuscript, but from the tissue type annotations of the cluster in Fig 2d of Cusanovich et al, it was already clear this cluster was related to the brain.</p>
<p>6. I felt the added comparison with EIGEN and FunSeq2 is confounding two different questions. One question is whether the features produced by Basenji add value to variant prediction over features considered by other variant prioritization methods. The other question is whether there is an advantage to integrating a set of features in task-specific ways that is optimized for the evaluation of the task. Only the Basenji features were integrated in task-specific ways, but it is possible integrating the features of EIGEN or FunSeq2 in a way that is optimized for the evaluation would have led to even better performance than what is being reported for Basenji features.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The author addressed my major concerns on the performance evaluation by including an extra section of the comparison with DeepSEA, another state-of-the-art machine learning-based model for regulatory variant interpretation, which demonstrates the advantage of this approach. The author elaborated on the differences of this work's object with the goal of the existing work and released the noncoding variant prediction results which clarify the contribution of this work. The author did improve the quality of the figures to a certain extend. However, I still think the font size of Figure 1,3,4 is too small. The authors and the editors should work together to ensure the quality of the figure.</p>

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p>
<bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold>
</p>
<p>
<bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Unless I am misunderstanding something, I believe the author is making a basic error that is causing in part an unsupported biological conclusion to be reached in the Autism analysis.</p>
<p>I previously raised concern that early development was being emphasized as being relatively important, while under a different setting of the parameters it wasn’t. Additionally I was concerned that the emphasis was being placed on early development when ‘urinary bladder, adult’ was the most significant hit for the An et al Mouse data sets.</p>
<p>The author in the text and response is saying the conclusions were robust to two different processings of the data. However, despite what the author is saying in the text and the response, for the Zhou et al data, based on what is in Supplementary Table 2 the p-values actually appear less significant for embryo/neonate CAGE data than other CAGE data.</p>
<p>I computed the median p-values for 218 embryo/neonate data CAGE data sets and 139 non-embryo/neonate CAGE data sets (note the text said it was 219 vs. 138 so there is a discrepancy of one) and obtained the following:</p>
<p>Median Zhou et al embryo/neonate: 0.020</p>
<p>Median Zhou et al not embryo/neonate: 0.009</p>
<p>Median An et al embryo/neonate: 0.002</p>
<p>Median An et al not embryo/neonate: 0.006</p>
<p>Additionally, even for An et al data I don’t think it is accurate to describe embryo/neonate datasets as being ‘prominent among these associations’ as I am not seeing them in the top part of the rankings of the most significant CAGE data.</p>
<p>In terms of the issue I raised of not stating which multiple tests were performed and correcting for it, instead of doing that the author declared the analysis an exploratory analysis. As the author acknowledged in the response the hypotheses selected to test were based on following previous significant analyses on the same data, thus because of that bias it would be challenging to formally correct for the multiple testing anyway. The author also presented a robustness analysis for the parameters, though that analysis was limited in that the selected parameter values were always one of the extreme values in the analysis. Additionally the analysis was shown for only the two slices of the grid of hyper-parameter values that had at least one selected value opposed to the entire grid. The author may want to consider expanding the robustness analysis with these considerations, but this is a minor point.</p>
<p>In terms of the issue of evaluating on additional human data, I agree with the author given the effort that the author says would be involved to investigate it, it is likely not worth the effort.</p>

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p>
<bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold>
</p>
<p>
<bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold>: The author modified the association of embryonic and neonate developmental states from the previous version of the manuscript to just be whole body and now states: “Whole body profiles from embryonic and neonate developmental stages were prominent among these associations.”</p>
<p>I still think the author is making an overstatement in saying whole body embryonic and neonate developmental is prominent. For example based on the An et al processing only two of the 13 whole embryo and neonate development stages were in the top 20 and based on the Zhou et al only one was in the top 20. The author does report there is a statistically significant difference in p-values based on a mann whitney test, but I think the word ‘prominent’ implies something stronger. Additionally the statistical significance is based on assuming all the observations are independent, which is debatable since there is likely a heavy overlap in the locations of the peaks from the 13 whole embryo and neonate experiments.</p>
<p>In the response the author states</p>
<p>“However, I want to clarify that the manuscript does state exactly which multiple tests were performed, helping to address the reviewer’s original concern”</p>
<p>I may have missed it, but I am not seeing this stated explicitly. The author does show in the supplement the range of parameter values for one parameter when holding the other one to the selected value, and vice versa. In the original submission the author used a combination of parameter values such that neither parameter value is a currently selected one. I am not seeing it stated, which combination of parameter values were explored or even that combinations other than those shown in the supplement were considered.</p>
