<p id="Par1">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease causing motor neuron death, but a complete cure has not been developed and related genes have not been defined in more than 80% of cases. Here we compared whole genome sequencing results from a male ALS patient and his healthy parents to identify relevant variants, and chose one variant in the X-linked <italic>ATP7A</italic> gene, M1311V, as a strong disease-linked candidate after profound examination. Although this variant is not rare in the Ashkenazi Jewish population according to results in the genome aggregation database (gnomAD), CRISPR-mediated gene correction of this mutation in patient-derived and re-differentiated motor neurons drastically rescued neuronal activities and functions. These results suggest that the ATP7A M1311V mutation has a potential responsibility for ALS in this patient and might be a potential therapeutic target, revealed here by a personalized medicine strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">DNA sequencing technologies have evolved in high throughput manners to generate tremendous volume of data inexpensively, since the development of Sanger sequencing in 1977<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Now, personalized whole genome information can easily be obtained via next-generation sequencing (NGS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Such advances suggest that individualized treatment might be possible in genetic disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In previous studies, rare disorder-linked mutations were discovered using family based whole genome or exome sequencing for autism, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, and Parkinson’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In biological research, pathogenicity in individual patient can be determined via in vitro disease modeling using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from the patient, which reflect full genetic information of the patient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, programmable nucleases, including CRISPR-Cas (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, and CRISPR-associated) nucleases, enable single nucleotide substitutions very accurately at desired target sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Through targeted gene editing of known disease variant in patient-derived iPS cells via CRISPR-Cas nucleases, pathologic metabolisms, such as signaling pathway, transcripts change, and functional rescue of a gene have been investigated for Huntington’s disease, cardiac disease, and ALS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; or Lou Gehrig’s disease), an adult onset neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the loss of motor neurons (MNs), muscle weakness, and death from respiratory failure within 3 years from the onset of symptoms for half of all patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Most cases are sporadic; only about 10% of individuals with ALS have a familial history. Since mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (<italic>SOD1</italic>) gene were first revealed to cause ALS disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, mutations in over 20 other genes have been linked to ALS. Until now, variants on <italic>SOD1</italic> gene have deeply been studied from patient-derived iPS cells using CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases. Comparison studies between MNs differentiated from ALS patient-derived iPS cells and MNs from <italic>SOD1</italic> gene corrected cell lines revealed that functional changes by <italic>SOD1</italic> mutations induce neurodegeneration and aberrant gene expression, resulting in vulnerable oxidative stress, altered protein response pathway, ER stress, and mitochondrial defect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In more than 80% of ALS cases, however, the responsible genes for ALS still remain unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is an important need to elucidate additional ALS-relevant genes from ALS patients.</p>
<p id="Par5">Because of rapid improvements in DNA sequencing, iPS cells, and gene editing technologies, investigations of the relationship between genotype and phenotype in each patient can be realized. In this study, we combined the whole genome sequencing (WGS) and CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing technologies to identify disease linked mutations in an ALS patient, as well as to verify the disease relevance of the mutation in patient-derived iPS cells, suggesting the strategy of personalized medicine.</p>

<title>Trio-based WGS identifies responsible variants in a patient</title>
<p id="Par6">In the case of a patient of Jewish origin who was diagnosed with bi-brachial type sporadic ALS disease in his sixties, we tried to identify susceptibility genes for personalized ALS treatment. Because the patient had no mutations in the previously reported genes related to ALS, we carried out a trio-based WGS study of this patient and his healthy parents to identify genetic mutations causing ALS. The whole workflow of WGS data analysis is summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>, and detailed pipelines are described in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>. The trio WGS data were analyzed based on pedigree information in X-linked, recessive, or de novo genetic mode; we excluded the possibility of autosomal dominant inheritance because the patient’s parents were healthy. We annotated called variants in each inheritance mode, and prioritized according to the order of severity from Sequence Ontology (SO) and the degree of pathogenicity from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Common variants frequently observed in panels of the normal population were filtered out. Next, we evaluated functional importance and prioritized following two workflows in parallel. First, we selected variants with rare allele frequencies (&lt;0.1%) in the Ashkenazi Jewish population that were predicted to be functionally high impact based on the order of severity as defined by SO (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>). Among 21 selected variants, we prioritized 7 that were located in functional gene networks using both direct (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>) and indirect (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">3</xref>) network-prioritization methods based on 126 ALS-related genes registered in the ALS genetic database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>). Second, we selected possible pathogenic variants using two in silico analysis tools, Polyphen-2 and SIFT, according to the ACMG guidelines. We evaluated the pathogenic impact of each variant on the function and structure of the corresponding protein and then prioritized 2 variants with higher pathogenic scores (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">5</xref>). From the above two independent criteria, we obtained 9 candidate variants that were possibly pathogenic in ALS.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Filtering strategy to identify pathogenic mutation.</title><p>Trio whole genome sequencing was performed for the patient and his healthy parents to annotate inherited and de novo mutations. Candidate variants were prioritized according to measures of functional importance including allele frequency, high impact consequences, or in silico analysis. Variants were further prioritized using network-based prioritization or pathogenity scores. Nine variants were determined to be high priority; this list was narrowed down by review of related diseases, predicted genomic function, and selection of candidates with zygosity analysis. The final candidate mutation, ATP7A M1311V, was selected after a review of literature for neurodegenerative disease.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e737" xlink:href="42003_2020_755_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par7">We excluded four of the nine variants because of predictions that they were related to conditions other than neurodegenerative disease and because they were located in non-functional domains of the genes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">6</xref>). For the remaining five variants, we performed genotyping to determine a zygosity of each gene variant using Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>). The results revealed that variants in <italic>DTX1</italic> and <italic>NOTCH2</italic> were false positive; i.e. each site only contained wild type sequence rather than frameshift or missense variant that was expected from WGS. And the variants in <italic>GFRA2</italic> and <italic>GART</italic> were identified to be heterozygous; i.e. one allele in each site had wild type sequence. On the other hand, <italic>ATP7A</italic> located on the X chromosome had a mutated variant only likewise to WGS data, identified to be hemizygous because the patient is male<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Throughout the prioritization process, we selected the <italic>ATP7A</italic> variant as a strong candidate for causing the disease. The ATP7A protein, a transmembrane P-type ATPase, has a well-characterized role in maintaining intracellular copper (Cu) concentrations, which are essential for regulating the activity of Cu-dependent enzymes that function in oxidation/reduction reactions, signaling pathways, and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par8">In conclusion, the filtering steps described above indicate that the M1311V mutation in the <italic>ATP7A</italic> gene may be causative in the etiology of ALS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). The <italic>ATP7A</italic> gene is X-linked and we found that the mother of the ALS patient in question was a carrier of the M1311V mutation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">3</xref>). Our selection is further supported by previous studies showing that abnormal Cu homeostasis increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in cellular damage, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and by other studies showing that several <italic>ATP7A</italic> variants are linked with neurodegenerative diseases such as Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, and X-linked distal spinal muscular atrophy type 3, which show similar symptoms as ALS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>).</p>

<title>CRISPR-mediated gene correction in patient-derived iPS cells</title>
<p id="Par9">The best way to prove correlation between the ATP7A M1311V mutation and the ALS disease in the patient is to compare the phenotype of patient-derived neurons containing the ATP7A M1311V mutation against that of corrected neurons, because the two cell types would have identical backgrounds except for the ATP7A mutation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). To generate ATP7A-corrected cell lines, we first constructed iPS cells, named ATP7A-M1311V, from the patient’s fibroblasts. Then, we transfected CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease into the iPS cells along with single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) as the donor DNA for gene correction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">5</xref>). We initially measured a correction rate of 0.4% from the bulk iPS cells via targeted deep sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, so we repetitively divided them into small populations of cells. After five repeated clump passages, we ultimately obtained two completely corrected iPS cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>), named ATP7A-Cor1 and ATP7A-Cor2.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>CRISPR-mediated gene correction of the ATP7A M1311V mutation and construction of patient-derived isogenic iPS cell lines.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Overview of our personalized medicine approach. <bold>b</bold> Strategy for correction of the ATP7A M1311V mutation in patient-derived iPS cells using CRISPR-Cas9.

<p id="Par10">To investigate the side effects by CRISPR-Cas9, we examined the mutations at predicted potential off-target sites that had 1–3-nt mismatches or 1-nt DNA or RNA bulges using Cas-OFFinder software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> in the two corrected cell lines. We performed targeted deep sequencing for 14 sites but detected no significant off-target effects (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">9</xref>). In addition, we checked whether the gross organization of the chromosomal DNA of the ATP7A-Cor lines was damaged during the gene editing process using karyotyping. Both ATP7A-Cor lines showed normal karyotype morphologies, as did ATP7A-M1311V (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the gene corrected sequence in differentiated cell type, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and MNs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>), indicating that CRISPR-mediated gene correction gave no substantial effects to the iPS cells.</p>

<title>Gene correction of the ATP7A M1311V leads to improvement</title>
<p id="Par11">To compare the pathologic phenotype and neuronal function of the ATP7A-M1311V and ATP7A-Cor lines, we next differentiated the ATP7A-M1311V, ATP7A-Cor1, and ATP7A-Cor2 lines to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and measured lysyl oxidase (LOX) activities and ROS levels in each case. LOX is a Cu-dependent enzyme that is activated by Cu transported by ATP7A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Compared to the ATP7A-M1311V-NPC line, ATP7A-Cor1-NPC and ATP7A-Cor2-NPC showed increased LOX activities and produced lower ROS levels that were comparable to those from control NPCs from a healthy donor (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">6</xref>). These results support the premise that <italic>ATP7A</italic> gene correction may improve ATP7A function and ALS pathology in NPCs.</p>
<p id="Par12">Given this evidence, we further differentiated one of the corrected NPC lines, ATP7A-Cor1-NPC, as well as ATP7A-M1311V-NPC and the control NPCs, to MNs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>), as follows. NPCs were initially purified using a cell surface marker, polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), to eliminate non-neuronal cells from cell population of neural rosettes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Most PSA-NCAM positive NPCs consistently showed to retain high level of neural cell markers, Nestin and Tuj1 in each cell line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b, c</xref>). NPCs were differentiated in motor neuron differentiation medium for 3 weeks and ultimately exhibited a motor neuron positive marker, Isl1/2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d, e</xref>). To determine whether gene correction of ATP7A-M1311V affect neurite complexity, we measured the expression level of a neuronal marker, microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2), in each line by immunostaining and also visualized nuclei by 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. The quantitative differentiation ratios calculated by comparison of the DAPI and MAP2 positive areas indicated that ATP7A-M1311V-MN showed reduced MAP2 level compared with ATP7A-Cor1-MN, which showed similar efficacy as the control line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f, g</xref>), implying declined regulating of neuritic maintenance and microtubule networks in dendritic morphologenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> in the ATP7A-M1311V line and recovery from this effect in the ATP7A-Cor1 line.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Gene correction of the ATP7A M1311V mutation results in improvement of pathophysiology.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Time table showing differentiation protocol used for NPC from patient-derive iPS and MN from NPC.

<p id="Par13">For each set of differentiated MNs, we measured the concentration of released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a measure of cell damage. LDH release was higher in ATP7A-M1311V-MN than in the control MNs, whereas release was significantly decreased in ATP7A-Cor1-MN, comparable to the level in the control MNs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h</xref>). We next measured the cell viability and ROS levels after treatment with glutamate, which acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter to generate action potentials. Although glutamate plays an essential role in the nervous system, it can also exert a neurotoxic effect, causing free radical production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein aggregation, especially in ALS-derived MNs. Cell viability measurements showed that only 80% of ATP7A-M1311V-MN cells survived under glutamate treatment compared to the untreated condition, whereas most ATP7A-Cor1-MN cells survived, similar to the control MNs, indicating rescue of the glutamate vulnerability in ATP7A-Cor1-MN (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">7</xref>). The ROS products significantly accumulated in ATP7A-M1311V-MN cells under basal conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3i</xref>) and when they were treated with glutamate (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">7</xref>), whereas the ROS level was reduced in ATP7A-Cor1-MN cells, similar to that in the control MNs, also supporting the concept of cell function recovery in ATP7A-Cor1-MN. To further confirm whether mitochondria-related function was rescued in the corrected MN lines, we measured mitochondrial membrane potentials linked to the ROS generation using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) assay. In line with above results of ROS, ATP7A-M1311V-MN cells showed impaired mitochondrial membrane potentials, whereas the TMRE level was recovered in ATP7A-Cor1-MN cells similar to the control MNs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3j</xref>). Taken together, we confirmed the differences in cell viability, cellular function and neurite complexity between ALS patient-derived cells and ATP7A gene-corrected cells.</p>

<title>Improvement of neuronal activity in gene-corrected MNs</title>
<p id="Par14">To further compare neuronal properties, 8 weeks after MN differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>), we performed electrophysiological analyses for each single neuron cell and four types of action potential (repetitive, adaptive, single, and no firing) were defined and classified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). Compared to the control MN population, in which most cells showed firing action potentials, half of the ATP7A-M1311V-MN cells showed non-firing action potentials. However, to our surprise, most ATP7A-Cor1-MN cells showed firing action potentials and the relative proportions of the firing patterns were very similar to those of the control MNs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). We found that ATP7A-M1311V-MN cells showed the loss of voltage gated sodium current and had smaller voltage gated potassium currents compared to the ATP7A-Cor1-MN cells and the control MNs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d, e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">8</xref>), which explains why half of the ATP7A-M1311V-MN cells showed non-firing action potentials. These results strongly suggest the recovery of neuronal activity in ATP7A-Cor1-MN compared to ATP7A-M1311V-MN cells.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Action potential and current traces of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels in gene-corrected MNs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Morphology of neural precursor cells (NPCs) after differentiation for 8 weeks for electrophysiology experiments.

<p id="Par15">One potential concern about our results is that the pluripotency and differentiation of iPS cells might have affected the function of the resulting MNs. To address this issue, we constructed induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) from the patient’s fibroblasts (ATP7A-M1311V-iNSC) via direct conversion (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">9</xref>) and compared them with control iNSCs from a healthy donor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. We found that the ATP7A-M1311V-iNSC population showed no difference in the proliferation rate compared to the control iNSCs, but showed lower cell viability, lower LOX activity, and elevated ROS under basal cell conditions, similar to the results from the experiments with iPS cells described above (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">10</xref>), supporting our conclusion that the ATP7A M1311V mutation has a potential responsibility for ALS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par16">In this study, we revealed that the X-linked ATP7A M1311V mutation has a potential responsibility for ALS in one male ALS patient by comparing WGS results with his healthy parents. Considering various factors including genetic mode, mutation type, allele frequency, and published literature, it is acceptable that ATP7A M1311V has high functional impact on neurodegenerative disease. ATP7A plays a role in Cu transport and maintenance of Cu homeostasis that is critical for proper neurological function such as axonal outgrowth, synapse integrity, and neuronal activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Homology modeling of ATP7A, which consists of transmembrane regions (MA, MB, and M1-M6) and cytosolic N-, P-, and A-domain, indicates that M1311 residue is located next to the ATP binding site in core cytosolic P-domain, which induces conformational changes during copper transport process. The M1311 residue has hydrophobic interaction with residues on P- and A-domain, and also has hydrogen interaction with residues on P-domain. In homology model with M1311V mutation, the mutated residue seems to break hydrophobic contacts or hydrogen bond interaction depending on the orientation of valine and surrounding residues (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">11</xref>). From the molecular modeling study, we hypothesized that ATP7A M1311V mutation disturbs internal interactions between residues on A- or P-domain, and thereby negatively affects the function of Cu binding and its transporting of ATP7A proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, which may cause neurodegenerative mechanism in the patient. Alternatively, our results showed that the gene correction of ATP7A M1311V dramatically improves the neuronal morphology and function, which strongly supports the hypothesis.</p>
<p id="Par17">To date, many researchers have worked to reveal interactions between genetic variants and disease phenotypes. Recently, genome-wide quantification analyses have shown that rare mutations are found in normal tissue, whereas risk variants from neurodevelopmental disorder patients are common genetic variants, implying that non-rare genetic variants may cause genetic disease in some patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In this study, we showed that correction of the ATP7A M1311V mutation can rescue the function of MNs derived from cells of one ALS patient of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. However, the ATP7A M1311V allele frequency is not rare in Ashkenazi Jews (0.01991), whereas it is rare in other ethnic populations (0–0.0003) such as European, Asian, Latino, and African. Because ALS is known to be a multifactorial disease and over 100 genes are intricately involved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, the <italic>ATP7A</italic> gene may act as one crucial component in an ALS-related network and the ALS disease may be caused by a combination of other disease factors such as genetic defects of other variants in a patient’ genome, altered transcripts, and epigenetic and environmental factors together with ATP7A M1311V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. In our results of trio-based WGS, the patient had many genetic variants in addition to the variants in <italic>ATP7A</italic>. Although we prioritized the ATP7A M1311V mutation as a strong candidate for ALS pathogenesis because of its higher pathogenic score and the X-linked recessive mutation, we could not exclude other variants completely, which might be a further study. From one deep individual study, we suggest that a non-rare genetic variant in an ALS patient has a potential to be responsible for the disease. Furthermore, in the case of this ALS patient, ATP7A M1311V might be a potential therapeutic target, elucidated by our personalized medicine strategy.</p>

<p id="Par18">This study includes one trio family (affected patient and unaffected parents) of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Tissue sample was obtained by Gary Bassell and Chadwick Hales and the healthy donor sample was kindly provided by Zachary T. McEachin at Emory University. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Severance Hospital approved this study (IRB approval number: 4-2012-0028).</p>

<sec id="Sec10">
<title>Whole genome sequencing (WGS)</title>
<p id="Par19">Steps in the WGS analysis for the unaffected parents and the affected patient, such as alignment, variant calling, annotation, and candidate variant selection, are summarized below and detailed in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood. A library of DNA fragments was constructed using a TruSeq PCR-free Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). Paired-end sequencing of the library was performed using rapid run v2.0 (Illumina) chemistry on a GiSeq 2500 (Illumina) sequencer according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The genome was sequenced to a mean read depth of &lt;30X.</p>
<p id="Par20">Raw FASTQ format sequences were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using BWA-MEM and generated to BAM file format. PCR duplicates were removed, known alleles were marked (dbsnp version 138, b37), and defined intervals were targeted for local realignment, after which indels were realigned with default options. We then additionally filtered for aligned files with MQRankSum (Z-score from Wilcoxon rank sum test of Alt vs. Ref read mapping qualities) &lt; −12.5, ReadPosRankSum (Z-score from Wilcoxon rank sum test of Alt vs. Ref read position bia) &lt; −8.0, QD (Quality of Depth) &lt; 2.0, FS (Phred- scaled <italic>p</italic>-value using Fisher’s exact test to detect strand bias) &gt; 60.0 or FS &gt; 200, and MQ (RMS Mapping Quality) &lt; 40.0. After filtering, the following numbers of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) remained: 4,667,802 for the affected patient, 4,641,608 for the unaffected father, and 4,643,959 for the unaffected mother.</p>
<p id="Par21">Mutations were called from the alignment files using GATK haplotype caller following GATK Best Practices recommendations. The VCF files produced by the pipeline use reference allele based on the positive strand of hg19 in the REF field, and variants were shown in the ALT field.</p>
<p id="Par22">Relatedness was tested for the trio by comparing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) concordance between the patient and parents using vcftool. We carried out variant analysis based on pedigree information. X-linked variants were selected if they were present in the patient and mother, but not in the father. De novo variants were chosen if the variants were only present in the patient and not in either parent or by using the TrioDeNovo program. After this analysis, 3517 X-linked variants, 10,754 autosomal recessive variants, and 19,959 de novo variants remained. We annotated each variant type using snpEff and panels of normal populations such as the 1000 Genome Project (1KGP) and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC).</p>

<sec id="Sec11">
<title>WGS data analysis</title>
<p id="Par23">We selected functionally important variants with high or moderate impacts in SO. For variants in coding regions, we selected those with functional importantance, such as missense, nonsense, and splicing variants. We next selected rare variants by excluding alleles with a global minor allele frequency &gt; 5% in dbSNPv135, a global minor allele frequency in 1KGP &gt; 2%, a minor allele frequency in ExAC &gt; 5%, and a minor allele frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population &gt; 5% in gnomAD r2.0.2.</p>
<p id="Par24">We then followed the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics to prioritize variants. Those variants passing the pathogenicity predictions were annotated using SIFT and PolyPhen-2 scores. We used two algorithms to predict the impact of protein sequence variants for missense variants. SIFT is based on sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acids, and PolyPhen-2 is based on eight sequence and three structure predictive features. Possibly damaging SNVs (PDSs) were extracted from these datasets. We then reviewed existing literature on neurodegenerative diseases, protein structures, and pathways. These steps yielded information on a variant’s functional importance, predicted the resulting damage to protein function, and indicated biologically relevant pathways. In addition to prioritization, we manually checked for alignment quality with Integrated Genomic Viewer (IGV, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv">https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv</ext-link>) and cBioPortal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/mutation_mapper.jsp">http://www.cbioportal.org/mutation_mapper.jsp</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Network-based gene prioritization</title>
<p id="Par25">To prioritize the selected genes with functionally important variants, we performed a network-based gene prioritization method that propagates functional scores via a network model. There are two approaches for network propagation, which are direct neighbor and network diffusion. The former can transmit the functional score only by direct links in the network model. The representative algorithm is naïve Bayes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, in which the score of a particular node label is the sum of the network edge weights of all of the connected neighbors for the same label. The latter can diffuse the functional score throughout the entire network, typically by Gaussian smoothing (GS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. The GS algorithm finds an optimal solution in which it achieves a minimal difference between the initial and final scores of a labeled gene, and also between the label score of a gene and each of its neighbors.</p>
<p id="Par26">In our study, we first chose the STRING v10.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> database as the base network model. STRING v10.5 includes direct (physical) interactions, as well as indirect (functional) interactions such as co-expression, shared selective signals across genomes, text-mining of the scientific literature, and transfer of interaction knowledge between organisms based on gene orthology. Using high-confidence (confidence score &gt;0.7) links of STRING v10.5 and genes known to be linked with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">3</xref>) collected from the database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, we prioritized the ALS candidate genes by both network propagation approaches, and selected ALS candidate genes with functionally important variants (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">5</xref>).</p>

Briefly, Sendai reprogramming vectors (CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were transduced into 30,000 fibroblast cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The next day, the culture medium was replaced with a neural reprogramming medium (RepM-Neural: Advanced DMEM/F12 and Neurobasal medium were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 and supplemented with 0.05% AlbuMAX-I, 1× N2, 1× B27 minus vitamin A, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 0.11 mM β-mercaptoethanol, all from Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cells were cultured for 18–21 days. During reprogramming, a chemical cocktail including 0.2 mM NaB (Sigma), 3 μM CHIR99021 (Tocris), and 0.5 μM A83-01 (Tocris) was added to the medium before use.

<p id="Par29">Discovery studio 2018 software (Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, Discovery Studio Modeling Environment, Release 2018, San Diego: Dassault Systèmes, 2018.) was used for our protein structure modeling study. An ATP7A homology model was created using the 2.75 Å X-ray crystal structure of P1B-ATPase (E2P state) from Legionella pneumophila (PDB ID 4BBJ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

Initially, 20 homology models were created and validated using the DOPE score and Ramachandran plot. Validated structures were then selected for methionine residue interaction analysis. Ten models for the ATP7A M1311V mutant were then created, and the effects of the mutation on interactions between residues were analyzed. Images were rendered using PyMOL software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">www.pymol.org</ext-link>) and Discovery Studio 2018 software.</p>

<title>Establishment of gene-corrected isogenic iPS cell lines</title>
<p id="Par32">The iPS cell lines from the patient and a healthy donor were established by Zachary T. McEachin using CytoTune-iPS Sendai Reprogramming Kits. To produce the normal <italic>ATP7A</italic> sequence, patient-derived iPS cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Cas9 and sgRNA targeting the ATP7A M1311V mutation with the appropriate single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) as a donor DNA. On day 3, transfected iPS cells were detached with ReLeSR™ (Stem Cell Technologies) and split for clump passage accompanied by serial dilution. When colonies containing round-shaped iPS cells were formed at around 7–14 days, they were detached using ReLeSR™. A small proportion of cells from colonies was harvested for targeted deep sequencing, and the leftover cells were transferred for further expansion. To prepare genomic DNA, cell pellets were resuspended in 50–100 μl of Proteinase K extraction buffer [40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) (Sigma), 1% Tween-20 (Sigma), 0.2 mM EDTA (Sigma), 10 mg of proteinase K, 0.2% nonidet P-40 (VWR Life Science)], incubated at 60 °C for 15 min, and heated to 98 °C for 5 min, and the genomic DNA was amplified and analyzed by targeted deep sequencing. Colonies with high frequencies of homology-directed repair (HDR) were picked for repeated clump passage accompanied by serial dilution and genotyping. As the HDR frequency was increased through this process, colonies containing the normal <italic>ATP7A</italic> sequence were established. Karyotyping was conducted at Gendix, Inc (Seoul, South Korea).</p>
