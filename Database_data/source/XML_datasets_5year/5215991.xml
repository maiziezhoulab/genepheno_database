<abstract>
<p id="P1">Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are common, complex and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders. Cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for ASD pathogenesis have been proposed based on genetic studies, brain pathology, and imaging, but a major impediment to testing ASD hypotheses is the lack of human cell models. Here, we reprogrammed fibroblasts to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons from ASD individuals with early brain overgrowth and non-ASD controls with normal brain size. ASD-derived NPCs display increased cell proliferation due to dysregulation of a β-catenin/BRN2 transcriptional cascade. ASD-derived neurons display abnormal neurogenesis and reduced synaptogenesis leading to functional defects in neuronal networks. Interestingly, defects in neuronal networks could be rescued by IGF-1, a drug that is currently in clinical trials for ASD. This work demonstrates that selection of ASD subjects based on endophenotypes unraveled biologically relevant pathway disruption and revealed a potential cellular mechanism for the therapeutic effect of IGF-1.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P2">Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) comprise a group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders that affect more than 1% of children in the United States. ASD is characterized by impaired social interaction and limited and repetitive interests and behavior at its core. ASDs are phenotypically and etiologically heterogeneous, making it challenging to uncover the underlying genetic, pathologic and cellular pathophysiology. Family history and twin studies suggest that, at least in some cases, these disorders share genetic roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Mounting evidence proposes that heritable and <italic>de novo</italic> genetic variation plays a significant role, but these studies also demonstrate striking genetic heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Neuropathological imaging and gene expression studies of postmortem brains from ASD patients have revealed disruption of developmental and proliferation gene networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Recent studies integrating ASD candidate genes with spatiotemporal coexpression networks demonstrate that gene expression converge on the transcriptional regulation in pyramidal, glutamatergic cortical neurons during mid-fetal human development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. One relevant observation in ASD pathophysiology has been the occurrence of macrencephaly and altered growth trajectory with early overgrowth and later normalization in a subset of affected individuals. An increase in brain size in autistic individuals in the first three years of life precedes the first clinical signs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and excess neuron numbers are reported for abnormally enlarged young ASD brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Excess cortical neuron numbers and patches of abnormal cortical organization and cell migration are pathologies that also implicate mid-fetal development as being crucial in ASD pathophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Gene expression changes in postmortem brain overlap with developmentally regulated genes involved in cortical patterning as well as in cell cycle, proliferation and neural differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Taken together, these observations highlight the relevance of early fetal brain development factors in the pathophysiology of ASD.</p>
<p id="P3">One of the major impediments to ASD research is the genetic and brain pathological heterogeneity that makes it difficult to produce relevant animal and cell models. Reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state by over-expression of specific genes has been accomplished using human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are attractive models for understanding complex diseases and disorders with heritable and sporadic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Although iPSCs have been generated for monogenetic ASD diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, the demonstration of disease-specific pathogenesis in complex and heterogeneous disease such as sporadic ASD is a current challenge in the field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, extending the iPSC modeling technology beyond monogenetic ASD to the study of non-syndromic forms of autism could uncover molecular and cellular pathways that overlap among many forms of autism, leading to a better understanding of the disease and potentially developing novel ASD biomarkers and targets for therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">We reasoned that ASD patients sharing a common phenotype, early developmental brain enlargement ranging from mild to extreme macrencephaly, might also share underlying molecular and cellular pathway dysregulation. We therefore pre-selected ASD infants and toddlers who displayed this phenotype, including pre-selection that provided a range from mild to extreme that enabled generalization of results to ASD beyond those with pure and extreme macrencephaly. We took advantage of reprogramming technologies to generate iPSCs from a cohort of ASD patients who displayed brain overgrowth early in life. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from ASD-iPSCs displayed altered proliferation resulting from dysregulation of a β-catenin/BRN2 transcriptional cascade. As a consequence, we observed that ASD-derived neurons formed fewer excitatory synapses and matured into defective neuronal networks with less bursting. Importantly, all ASD patients showed improved network strength after treatment with IGF1 (a drug that is currently in clinical trial for ASD), but the levels of improvement were unique to the patients, revealing a potential novel assay to pre-screen patients for future clinical trials. Together, our results suggest that, when stratified into measurable endophenotypes, idiopathic ASD can be modeled using iPSC technology to reveal novel cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying brain abnormalities.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects">
<title>Patient ascertainment</title>
<p id="P5">Subjects were recruited through the UCSD Autism Center of Excellence from a pool of volunteers formerly included in previous brain imaging studies. Control subjects were selected randomly from lists of typically developing individuals who had had an MRI scan when they were toddlers. ASD subjects were selected from lists of ASD subjects who had been identified and diagnosed with ASD and MRI scanned when they were toddlers; from among these potential ASD subjects, we selected those with larger than normal average total brain volume as compared to typically developing toddlers. The ASD subjects demonstrated a behavioral presentation consistent with autism as defined by the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; APA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Assessment of the history and presence of the disorder was achieved via standardized behavioral, cognitive, and functional assessments, including the appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scale, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), the Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R), and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). Participants in the control group had no history of psychological, genetic, or other disorder. This project was approved by the Ethics Committees of the institutes at which the study was conducted. After a complete description of the study, written informed consent was provided by the parents.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>CNV (Copy-Number Variation) analyses</title>
<p id="P6">High-confidence CNV calls were made using the CNVision pipeline as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In brief, patients and controls were genotyped using the Illumina 660W array. Probe intensity signals were analyzed to make CNV calls using e types of software PennCNV, QuantiSNP and GNOSIS. High-confidence calls were made by merging the prediction output of these 3 different algorithms. Rare events were defined based on the database of genomic variants (DGV) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dgv.tcag.ca/">http://dgv.tcag.ca/</ext-link>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Exome sequencing</title>
<p id="P7">Fibroblasts derived from the 8 ASD individuals were cultured. DNA was extracted and exome libraries were generated for each line using Nextera Rapid Capture Exome kit from Illumina. Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 Pair-end sequencing was conducted (read length=100bp), resulting in 308,082,362 reads in average for each library. Short reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using BWA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and Samtools <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Mutations were first filtered based on the reading depth (D&gt;=10), alignment quality (q&gt;=20) and base quality (Q&gt;=30), and 4712088 variants passed filtering. Next, we used two different software programs, ANNOVAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and IlluminaVariantStudio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://https://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/datasheets/datasheet_illumina_variantstudio_software.pdf">https://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/datasheets/datasheet_illumina_variantstudio_software.pdf</ext-link>) to annotate the variants. The results from ANNOVAR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and IlluminaVariantStudio were very similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1A</xref>), so we further analyzed variants found in the IlluminaVariantStudio only. There were a total of 485 stop-gains and 103 stop losses found in all ASD lines, but several variants were found in multiple lines. Therefore, a total of 275 unique stop gain/loss mutations were detected, of which 222 were listed in dbSNP while 53 rare mutations were not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1B</xref>). We further filtered the 58278 missense variants found in IlluminaVariantStudio by PolyPhen and SIFT scores. Of these, 3403 variants were considered both “deleterious” in SIFT and “probably damaging” in PolyPhen. Again, several of these variants were found in multiple patients, so the total number of unique “deleterious” and “probably damaging” SNVs was 1829. Of these, 1564 were found in dbSNP while 265 rare variants were not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1C</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Cellular reprogramming</title>
<p id="P8">IPSCs were obtained from skin fibroblasts of ASD patients and controls, collected by the UC San Diego Autism Center of Excellence. Briefly, fibroblasts were transduced with retroviruses containing <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>KFL4</italic>, and <italic>MYC</italic> to induce overexpression of these genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Two days after transduction, the cells were transferred to a co-culture system with murine embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) maintained with DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, CA), 20% Knockout Serum Replacement (Invitrogen, CA), 1% non-essential amino acids, and 100 μM beta-mercaptoethanol and treated with 1 mM valproic acid (Sigma) for 5 days. The iPSC colonies were identified after approximately 2 weeks in this culture system, transferred to Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated plates, and maintained in mTeSR media (Stem Cell Technologies). To avoid potential variability caused by retroviral insertions in the genome, the experiments were performed with at least 2 independent iPSCs clones.</p>

<sec id="S7">
<title>Karyotype</title>
<p id="P9">Standard G-banding karyotype analyses were performed by Cell Line Genetics (Madison, WI).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Neural differentiation</title>
<p id="P10">The iPSC colonies were plated on Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated plates and maintained for 5 days in mTSeR medium (Stem Cell Technologies). On the fifth day, the medium was changed to N2 media [DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 1× N2 supplement (Invitrogen) and 1× B27 supplement (Invitrogen). After 2 days, the colonies were removed from the plate and cultured in suspension as EBs for 2 weeks using NPC medium with dorsomorphin during the entire procedure. The EBs were then gently dissociated with accutase (Gibco), plated on Matrigel-coated dishes, and maintained in NBF medium (DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 1× N2, 1× B7 supplements, 20 ng/mL FGF2 and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). The rosettes that emerged after 3 or 4 days were manually selected, gently dissociated with accutase, and plated in dishes coated with 10 μg/mL poly-ornithine and 5 μg/mL laminin. This NPC population was expanded using NBF medium. To differentiate the NPCs into neurons, the cells were re-plated in the absence of FGF2, with regular medium changes every 3 or 4 days.</p>

<sec id="S9">
<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p id="P11">Cells were washed once with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes. After washing with PBS and blocking with 10% Donkey serum, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (blocking solution), cells were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 16 hours at 4°C. Primary antibodies used were: anti-Pax6 (Covance PRB-278P); anti-Sox1 (R&amp;D, AF3369); anti-Otx2 (Milipore, AB9566); anti-Vimentin (abcam, RV202) anti-phospho-Histone H3 (Sigma, H0412); anti-Ki67 (Novocastra NCL-Ki67p); Anti-Brn2 (Santa Cruz, cs6029) anti-Brn2 (2R2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>; anti-Ngn2 (Santa-cruz, sc-19233); anti-Mash1/Ascl1 (BD 556604 and Chemicon AB5696s); anti-NKX2.1 (Novacastra, TTF-1-L-CE); anti-Olig2 (Millipore, AB9610); anti-Tuj1 (Covance, MMS-435P) and anti-Doublecortin (Santa Cruz, cs-8066); anti-GABA (Sigma, A2052), anti-Map2AB (Abcam, ab5392). After PBS washes, cells were incubated with labeled secondary antibodies for 60 minutes. Nuclei were stained after incubation with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 5 minutes. The slides were mounted using prolong-gold (Invitrogen, P36930).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S10">
<title>Proliferation and LiCl treatment of NPC lines</title>
<p id="P12">After NPCs grew close to confluence (4~9 days), the cell number in each well was counted using a cell counter (Invitrogen countess automated cell counter). The population doubling time was inferred for each well based on the culture time and the ratio between input and harvest. Differences in doubling time between LiCl-treated and untreated conditions in each NPC line were compared using 2-tail t test. Also, doubling time differences between LiCl-treated and untreated conditions were tested for all 5 autistic lines (treated=27, non-treated=28) and all 5 control lines (treated=11, non-treated=10) using the two-tail t test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S11">
<title>Cell cycle analysis</title>
<p id="P13">Monolayer-adherent NPCs were harvested, washed with PBS, resuspended in PBS and fixed for 1 hour in 4°C in 100% ethanol (−20°C). Cells were collected, resuspended in PBS containing 100 μg/ml RNase A for 30 minutes in 37°C, and stained with 1 mg/ml propidium iodide solution (10 mg / 1×10^6 cells stained) for 2 hours at 4°C. For each sample, 50,000 cells were collected in the appropriate gate for analysis on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S12">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="P14">NPCs cultured as monolayers were washed with cold PBS. Protein was extracted with 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, # 1 836 153). Lysates were centrifuged for 25 minutes at 15,000 rpm at 4°C.

Cells were fed once a week and measurements were taken before media changes. Recordings were performed in a Maestro MEA system and AxIS software (Axion Biosystems) using a bandwidth with a filter for 10Hz to 2.5kHz cutoff frequencies. Spike detection was performed using an adaptive threshold set to 5.5 times the standard deviation of the estimated noise on each electrode. Each plate rested for 5 minutes in the Maestro Instrument, and then was recorded for 10 minutes to calculate the spike rate per well. Multi-electrode data analysis was performed using the Axion Biosystems Neural Metrics Tool, and an active electrode was considered once 5 spikes occurred over the length of 1 minute (5 spikes/min). Bursts were identified in the data recorded from each individual electrode using an adaptive Poisson surprise algorithm. Network bursts were identified for each well; using a non-adaptive algorithm requiring a minimum of 10 spikes with a maximum inter-spike interval of 100ms.

The RNAs were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 with 50bp paired-end reads, generating 50 million high quality sequencing fragments per sample on average. We first utilized TopHat2 aligner to align the reads against the human reference genome from the 1000 Genomes Project (i.e., human_g1k_v37), and then summarized the read counts to Genecode11 union-exon gene models using htseq-count (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/count.html">http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/count.html</ext-link>).

<title>Identification of genetic variants in macrencephaly ASD individuals and controls</title>
<p id="P28">We recruited 8 ASD Individuals with quantitative MRI-validated early brain enlargement ranging from mild brain enlargement to macrencephaly and 5 age/gender-matched control individuals for skin biopsies and phenotypic characterization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The ASD donors displayed larger brain size compared to the normal average brain size of typically developing control subjects at any given age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Copy Number Variation (CNV) analysis, using DNA extracted from the donors’ whole blood did not show the presence of any rare structural variant known to be associated with ASD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). A small duplication involving intron 2 of the <italic>NLGN</italic>1 gene was detected in one ASD case; however, this event has also been reported in typically developing controls (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dgv.tcag.ca/">http://dgv.tcag.ca/</ext-link>). Exome sequencing was performed on DNA from the 8 ASD fibroblasts. Variants were called by two pipelines (lluminaVariantStudio and ANNOVAR) that allowed for the detection of variant alleles with higher frequency, since we reasoned that both rare and common variants may contribute to the ASD phenotypes. Using these criteria, more than 50,000 total variants (58866 and 53101 from each of the two pipelines) in all 8 libraries were found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1A</xref>). Since both pipelines gave similar results, we focused our analysis on stop-gain, stop-loss and non-synonymous variants identified by the lluminaVariantStudio pipeline. A total of 275 unique stop gain/loss mutations were detected, of which 222 were listed in dbSNP while 53 rare mutations were not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1B</xref>). Filtering the non-synonymous variants that were considered both “deleterious” in SIFT and “probably damaging” in PolyPhen, a total of 1829 unique variants were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1C</xref>).

These three missense variants were predicted to be damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen algorithms. No mutations were found in 2 alleles of a single gene in any patient (i.e., all variants were heterozygous).

<title>iPSC-derived NPCs from ASD Individuals with early brain overgrowth display rapid proliferation</title>
<p id="P31">Our recent analyses showed that iPSC-derived neural cell types could recapitulate human fetal cortical development and thus could be used to model this developmental stage in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We used our previous published protocol to generate NPCs from iPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> in the presence of Noggin. Briefly, we initiated neural differentiation by plating 1-week-old embryoid bodies (EBs) treated with Noggin. After a week in culture, EB-derived rosettes became apparent in the dish. Rosettes were then manually collected, dissociated and re-plated. The NPCs derived from rosettes formed a homogeneous population after a few passages from ASD individuals and controls, and continued to proliferate in the presence of FGF2 as adherent monolayers.</p>
<p id="P32">We hypothesized that an alteration of the rates of NPC proliferation could result in early brain overgrowth. Proliferation was measured in (2 clones per line) by calculating the population doubling time from plating at passages 3 to 7 (P3-7) in continuous culture, and the doubling times of all ASD and control lines were pooled to calculate averages. From P4, the population doubling time decreased in ASD NPCs from all 8 Individuals compared to NPCs from all 5 controls, reaching statistical significance at P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Surprisingly, all ASD NPC clones proliferated faster than all control NPC clones. Cell cycle analysis at P6 revealed that shortening of G1 and S phases was the main reason for the decrease in the population doubling time, with no change of G2-M phase length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Double labeling for Ki67 and pHH3 revealed an increased percentage of Ki67<sup>+</sup> (cycling cells) in ASD relative to control NPCs, whereas the percentage of pHH3<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> (G2-M phase mitotic cells) was unaffected in autistic NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). After patient and control age-matching correction, we performed pair-wise correlations between brain size (volume) and NPC proliferation and doubling time. We observed a positive correlation with NPC proliferation and an inverse correlation with NPC doubling time across all samples (ASD and controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). Strikingly, proliferation (represented by percentage of Ki67 positive cells) is robustly significant in its correlation with brain volume, suggesting that it may be proliferation that specifically contributes to the large brain early on in ASD. These findings demonstrate that iPSC-derived NPCs from ASD Individuals with macrencephaly proliferated faster than those derived from controls and NPC proliferation is correlated increase in brain volume. To our knowledge, this is the first time that clinical data is significantly correlated to an iPSC-neural phenotype and open the doors for potential use of vitro assays as diagnostic tools for complex multigenic disorders such ASD.</p>

<title>β-catenin/BRN2 transcriptional activity regulates proliferation of NPCs from ASD individuals</title>
<p id="P33">Based on the genomic analyses of the ASD individuals, we hypothesized that the alterations in the canonical Wnt pathway might govern the aberrant proliferation in ASD-derived NPCs. To test our hypothesis, we examined Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activity using TOP-flash assays and found that β-catenin transcriptional activity was indeed reduced in ASD NPCs compared to control NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). Activation of canonical Wnt signaling with 5 mM LiCl, which inhibits GSK3β-mediated degradation of β-catenin, elevated β-catenin transcriptional activity in both ASD and control NPCs. However, β-catenin transcriptional activity was significantly reduced in LiCl-treated ASD NPCs compared to control NPCs, suggesting that the cause of reduced β-catenin transcriptional activity is downstream of GSK3β. While the elevation of β-catenin transcriptional activity with LiCl treatment in ASD NPCs is modest, LiCl treatment was able to rescue the overproliferation defects on ASD NPCs. Importantly, since the level of Wnt transcriptional activity required for normal proliferation is currently unknown, it is conceivable that a moderate increase of Wnt is sufficient to rescue abnormal over proliferation in ASD. In our experiments, LiCl treatment increased Wnt transcriptional activity by over 2 fold on ASD NPCs and that is potentially sufficient to elicit normal proliferation. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling with Wnt3A resulted in a marked but non-significant elevation of β-catenin transcriptional activity in both control and ASD NPCs, with a similar trend of reduced β-catenin transcriptional activity in the ASD NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). Notably, NPCs derived from the patient with the heterozygous stop-gain mutation in <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, Arch, displayed the weakest responses to LiCl and Wnt3a stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). To determine if this reduced β-catenin transcriptional activity was responsible for the growth defects displayed, we repeated the proliferation experiment in ASD-derived and control NPCs in the presence and absence of LiCl. In the absence of LiCl, all ASD-derived NPC lines displayed faster growth (reduced doubling times) than all control NPC lines. LiCl treatment slowed the growth of ASD-derived NPCs close to doubling times of control NPCs, whereas the growth of control NPCs was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>). These findings indicate that the reduced β-catenin transcriptional activity played a functional role in the accelerated proliferation found in ASD-derived NPCs.</p>

To test if BRN2 levels were similarly affected in NPCs from ASD patients with early brain overgrowth, we performed immunocytochemistry for BRN2 on ASD and control NPCs.

To examine whether exogenous BRN2 rescued the increased rate of proliferation observed in ASD NPCs, we transfected CAG-BRN2 into control and ASD NPCs and performed immunocytochemistry for BRN2 and Ki67. Transfection efficiency was similar between control and ASD NPCs (around 45%). The number of DAPI<sup>+</sup> cells (as an index of proliferation) in ASD NPCs was similar to controls after BRN2 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2I, J</xref>). The expression pattern of BRN2 and Ki67 in the BRN2 transfected ASD NPCs resembled that of control NPCs, providing additional support for the direct regulation of proliferation of autistic NPCs by BRN2. These data also suggest that partially conserved pathways regulate proliferation of NPCs in a mouse model of social behavior and ASD-derived NPCs from patients with early brain overgrowth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2K</xref>).</p>

To confirm the specificity of glutamatergic neurons in our cultures, we demonstrated that VGLUT1 puncta were mostly adjacent to the postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95) protein, a postsynaptic glutamatergic marker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). The distribution of puncta densities for both Synapsin and VGLUT1 displayed a distinctly increased number of ASD neurites with lower densities and an increased number of control-derived neurites with higher densities, corroborating the defect in glutamatergic synapses. We also found significant differences in the area size of synaptic puncta between the 2 groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3H, I</xref>).</p>
<p id="P37">A decrease in the number of excitatory synapses may directly affect other neurotransmission systems in ASD cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. To investigate whether the expression of neurotransmitters was affected in ASD-derived neurons, we performed a qPCR array of 84 neurotransmitter receptors-related genes in both ASD and control neurons. Interestingly, we detected a tendency for GABA-related and neuropeptide Y receptors to be down-regulated in ASD-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). In this experiment, only the subunits GABRQ and NPY2R were significantly down-regulated in ASD compared to control neurons. We then investigated the expression of 86 different gene indicators for different developmental stages of neural differentiation, neurotransmitters maturation and cortical layer formation using the Fluidigm Biomark qPCR Dynamic Array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). We detected down-regulation of the GABA receptor GABRR1, plus other relevant neurotransmitters and synapse-related genes, such as KCNA1, TH, PHOX2A and DRD3, in ASD neurons. In contrast, genes related to early stages of neural differentiation, such as NEUROG3, FOXG1, SOX10 and P2RY2, were significantly up-regulated in ASD. Together the results described above indicate that, while ASD neurons initiate an earlier differentiation program, ASD neurons do not mature as extensively as controls.</p>

<title>Network defects in ASD-derived neurons</title>
<p id="P38">Next, electrophysiological recordings using single-cell patch clamp were used to investigate the functional properties of iPSC-derived neurons 6 weeks after differentiation. Spontaneous action potentials were observed in control and ASD-derived neurons. However, no difference was observed in the frequency of spontaneous action potentials between iPSC-derived neurons from control (4.3 ± 1.2Hz, n = 21) and ASD (3.0 ± 0.7Hz, n = 27, <italic>p</italic> = 0.3) cultures. iPSC-derived neurons further exhibited spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), with comparable amplitudes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.7) between control (26.5 ± 2.6pA, n = 20) and ASD (27.7 ± 2.6pA, n = 32) cultures. Likewise, no significant difference was found in terms of mean sEPSC frequency (control: 7.6 ± 1.4Hz, ASD: 5.3 ± 1.0Hz, <italic>p</italic> = 0.2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A-D</xref>). Despite the lack of significant sEPSC frequency differences between control and ASD neurons, there was a trend of lower frequencies in ASD cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4E</xref>). Both control and ASD-derived cells exhibited characteristics of functional neurons, including transient voltage-gated sodium and potassium currents evoked by voltage-step depolarizations and action-potentials generated following depolarizing current injections.</p>
<p id="P39">Next, we analyzed spike activity within the neuronal networks by multielectrode arrays (MEA). Connectivity defects have been commonly observed in postmortem ASD brains, but connectivity cannot be studied during early stages of embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Unlike single-cell patch clamp recordings, MEA allow for the dynamic interrogation of how human-derived neurons behave in circuits. We plated paired control and ASD NPCs to mature in MEA dishes and recorded their activity over time. After 30 days, the total number of spikes in control and ASD neuronal networks was similar. As the cultures matured, the number of spikes increased in control neurons but the numbers of spikes in ASD did not, leading to a significant difference between ASD and control networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-C</xref>). After 50 days, we also detected a reduction in the number of synchronized bursts, i.e., spikes that were not singular or random (sequential 10 spikes over 100 ms) in the ASD cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). While the number of network bursts was variable at 30 days of maturation, with a tendency toward more synchronized events in control neurons, within 50 days of maturation this difference was 6 times higher in control compared to ASD neurons and highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P40">We then treated the cells with IGF1, a drug that has been previously shown to rescue synaptic deficits in other ASD monogenetic syndromes such as Rett and Phelan-McDermid Syndromes, and is currently in clinical trials for idiopathic ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. When IGF1 was used during the differentiation process, we observed an increase in the number of GABAergic neurons in all ASD-derived cultures, but no effect in controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4 F-I</xref>). We next used IGF1 to treat mature neuronal cultures after differentiation, starting on day 35 of differentiation. Collectively, ASD patients displayed a tendency to improve neuronal spike number that became significant at day 72 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, when we looked at individual patients’ response to the drug, while most patients improved the neuronal activity, Apex did not show any response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4J</xref>). Further investigation should clarify the mechanistic reasons for such drug response variation, but nonetheless, the assay may have the sensitivity to pre-screen patients for future clinical trials. To address the involvement of stabilization of Wnt-β-cat pathway in NPCs and the consequence effect on neuronal function, we treated NPCs with LiCl and assessed the differentiation by quantifying the number of GABAergic neurons after 4 weeks of differentiation and also analyzed neuronal functional maturation using Multi Electrode Array (MEA) technology. Interestingly, treatment of NPCs with LiCl did not improve the percentage of GABA positive cells 4 weeks after differentiation or improved MEA activity on ASD neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4I and S4K</xref>). Hence, contrary to IGF1 treatment, LiCl treatment (and consequent stabilization Wnt-β-catenin pathway and rescue of NPC proliferation) does not affect neuronal function significantly, suggesting that there are multiple pathways involved in the ASD phenotypical deficit or that stabilization of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway is also required at the early stages of differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. These results demonstrate an impairment followed by a partial rescue with IGF1, but not LiCl of network formation in ASD-derived neuronal cultures.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing in neural cells identifies altered gene expression in macrencephaly ASD individuals</title>
<p id="P41">Strong evidence implicates a convergence of pathways at the transcriptome level in postmortem brains from ASD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Therefore, we performed RNA sequencing analysis in iPSCs and in iPSC-derived NPCs and neurons to evaluate whether any convergent transcriptional alterations could be identified to be associated with early brain overgrowth in ASD during development in this in vitro model. At the transcriptome level, samples were explicitly separated into 3 distinct clusters by cell-type differences based on the top 2 principal components, strongly supporting the reproducibility of our iPSC generation and neural differentiation procedures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A, B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P42">We first conducted a standard differential expression (DE) analysis to evaluate individual gene expression pattern changes at the NPC and neuronal stages. We identified 71 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in ASD compared to controls at the NPC stage and 154 genes at the neuronal stage, which by hierarchical clustering clearly distinguished(the ASD cell lines from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). The expression fold changes of the top dysregulated genes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>. Of note, while the expressions of both <italic>CTNNB1</italic> (coding for β-catenin) or <italic>POU3F2</italic> (coding for BRN2) mRNAs were reduced, neither was significantly altered in ASD-derived NPCs, although β-catenin activity in the canonical Wnt pathway is primarily regulated at the post-transcriptional level. To reveal the biological pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes, we performed GO enrichment analysis. We found that the up-regulated genes in ASD progenitors were significantly enriched for GO category of brain development, which agrees with the observations of the high NPC proliferation rate and differentiation defects in ASD cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C, D</xref>). At the neuronal stage, the up-regulated genes in ASD were enriched for the GO categories related to extracellular matrix, whereas the down-regulated genes were significantly enriched for the GO categories of cilium and axoneme, consistent with the observed synaptic dysregulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E, F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P43">To explore the network organization of the transcriptome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, we next applied a Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to provide a higher order view of the biological processes altered in the patient cells. Given the substantial transcriptomic alterations in the patient-derived neurons, we mainly focused on determining the gene co-expression organizations at the neuronal stage. We identified 17 gene co-expression modules in the assigned co-expression network (each labeled in a different color). We also observed a striking clustering pattern of the case-associated genes and known ASD susceptibility genes (curated from SFARI database), respectively, upon the identified co-expression structure by plotting the module assignment under the gene clustering dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E, F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P44">Comparing the expression patterns of the modules between ASD and controls (see Methods), we found 4 modules that were significantly associated with ASD status (FDR &lt;0.1): brown, tan, purple, and magenta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S10</xref>). Remarkably, known autism candidate genes were significantly enriched in these autism-correlated modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table S11</xref>). Genes that were commonly affected by ASD-associated CNVs were overrepresented in the brown module (OR=1.5, enrichment p-value=0.02), whereas the tan module was enriched for genes known to be affected by ASD-associated protein-disrupting and missense rare de novo variations (RDNVs) (OR=1.6, p-value=0.02). Because co-expressed genes imply co-regulation, our results provide further evidence for the suggested convergent transcriptional regulation in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P45">Since ASD NPCs exhibited abnormal differentiation phenotypes, we evaluated whether there were dynamic expression changes in patient cells upon differentiation. Our analysis identified 35 genes showing significant differences in their expression trajectories between ASD NPCs and controls in the progenitor to neuron transition (p&lt;0.005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). These genes were significantly enriched for voltage-gated cation channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>), including CACNG5, KCNA6, KCNC2, and KCNIP2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G and H</xref>, those channel genes were up-regulated in control cells, but this increase was attenuated in the ASD cells. These data further implicate voltage-gated cation channel dysregulation in ASD neural differentiation, consistent with decreased excitatory glutamatergic synapses, likely affecting synaptic transmission.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P46">The use of iPSCs to study genetic disorders is a powerful tool to dissect molecular and cellular pathways implicated in disease pathology during early stages of human neurodevelopment. However, modeling highly complex idiopathic disorders such as ASD is challenging due to a high level of heterogeneity in the patient population. Here, we took advantage of iPSCs derived from a carefully clinically characterized cohort of ASD patients who have an anatomical phenotypic trait that occurs in about 20-30% of idiopathic ASD: an early developmental enlargement of brain volume, including macrencephaly, that is frequently associated with poor prognosis. Recent evidence suggests that abnormal brain growth and organization in ASD are underway by mid-fetal life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and continue during the first few years of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. The ASD patients recruited here had their brain scans between the ages of 2 and 5 years, confirming the anatomical phenotype. Their brain volumes ranged between 3.3% and 23.5% (median=12%, mean=12.5%) above the normal average for age when compared with large samples of age-matched control subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P47">We hypothesized that the increased brain volume and neuron numbers found in ASD might result from increased rates of proliferation in neural progenitors. Consistent with this hypothesis, NPCs derived from iPSCs of such autistic patients displayed rapid rates of proliferation when compared to NPCs derived from non-affected typically developing individuals, a finding that also supports the cell cycle dysregulation/proliferation theory proposed to explain early brain overgrowth in some ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Interestingly, all ASD-derived NPCs displayed faster proliferation than all control-derived NPCs. This cellular phenotype results from alterations in a canonical Wnt-β-catenin/BRN2 transcriptional cascade. In further support of this iPSC-derived NPC phenotype, we found that <italic>Dvl</italic> mutants displayed adult social behavior abnormalities and transient brain overgrowth during embryonic deep layer cortical neuron formation mediated by a similar β-catenin/Brn2/Tbr2 transcriptional cascade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Transient activation of the canonical Wnt pathway <italic>in utero</italic> normalized the adult social behavior deficits in <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant mice. Thus, common transcriptional mechanisms that include β-catenin and BRN2 appear to regulate NPC proliferation in a mouse model with social and repetitive behavioral deficits and a cellular model of human autism. Cross-talk between the Wnt and insulin signaling pathways has been demonstrated in different disorders such as diabetes and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. IGF-1 has been shown to stimulate the β-catenin pathway through signaling cascades involving the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K)/Akt and the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Since LiCl treatment of ASD NPCs stabilized cell proliferation via inhibition of GSK-3 and subsequent increase in β-catenin levels, it is feasible to hypothesize that stimulation of IGF-1 pathway could potentially rescue proliferation deficits in developing ASD NPCs. Future studies will elucidate the mechanistic nature of the relationship between WNT and IGF1 pathways in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p id="P48">Finally, stop-gain mutations were found in the canonical Wnt pathway genes <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>FZD6</italic>, while a novel missense mutation was found in <italic>DVL2</italic>, and two more common missense variants listed in dbSNP in <italic>FRZB</italic> and <italic>WNT10B</italic> were also detected, consistent with an important role for the canonical Wnt pathway in the pathogenesis of brain enlargement in ASD. It is known that Wnt signaling controls NPCs proliferation and differentiation in a temporal and context-dependent fashion during brain development. Early in neurogenesis, Wnt stimulation results in NPC proliferation, whereas later in development Wnts induce neuronal differentiation by promoting terminal neurogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Moreover, the same transcription factors may have opposing effects in different cell types. Finally, a missense mutation was found in <italic>PTEN</italic> (rs181113165) in one patient, consistent with a role for this gene in ASD brain growth trajectory and Wnt signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Taken together, these findings indicate that increased proliferation rates found in NPCs are the likely cause of abnormal prenatal numbers of cortical neurons in the genesis of autism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P49">These proliferation abnormalities were associated with abnormalities in differentiation. The percentage of excitatory NGN2<sup>+</sup> NPCs was reduced, whereas markers of inhibitory precursors present in the subpallium (MASH1, DLX2 and NKX2.1) were up-regulated in ASD compared to control NPCs. Interestingly, a decrease of NGN2+ NPC did not resulted in an increase in GABAergic neurons, but ASD neuronal cultures have a significant reduction in inhibitory neurons. When examining excitatory synapses, ASD-derived neurons also displayed decreased Vglut1 puncta density. This imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory neurons could also explain our network results during neuronal maturation in the MEAs, where we detected a significant reduction in the amount of spontaneous activity in ASD neurons, leading to a pronounced deficiency in network connectivity that was ameliorated with addition of IGF1. IGF-1 is a naturally occurring neurotrophic factor essential for brain development and plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. In the CNS, IGF-1 binds to its receptor (IGF1R), and activates MAP Kinase and PI3 kinase pathways, which are both involved in synaptic function and plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. IGF1 treatment of rodent neurons in vitro resulted in an increase in neuronal outgrowth, as well as increased expression of Synapsin1, a pre-synaptic marker responsible for regulating neurotransmitter release, and post-synaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), a scaffolding protein responsible for proper synapse and receptor formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. While the precise mechanisms through which IGF1 induces changes in synaptic proteins and improve neuronal function in ASD cultures remain to be elucidated, one possibility is that it acts indirectly on neurons through the activation of IGF1R and its many neurotrophic downstream cascades. Another possibility is that IGF1 contributes to the increase in synaptic markers by acting on glial cells and improving maintenance of synapses. Future studies will reveal and dissect precise pathways downstream of IGF1 during different stages of neuronal development and neuronal circuit maturation in ASD.</p>
<p id="P50">The proliferation and maturation defects displayed by ASD patient-derived NPCs and neurons are consistent with early brain overgrowth, but the dramatic in vitro phenotypes are perhaps greater than one would expect based on the pathological and MRI studies of ASD brains so far reported. In support of our data, a recent study with macrocephaly ASD also revealed high level of NPC proliferation in another four ASD individuals, which may be due to a deficiency in FOXG1-mediated pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Thus, it is conceivable that the phenotypes are amplified <italic>in vitro</italic> due to the lack of tissue architectural constraints that occur during <italic>in vivo</italic> development. However, it is unclear if these proliferation and differentiation defects result from macrencephaly, ASD or both. The consistency in proliferation and differentiation phenotypes shared among the ASD-patient derived cells in these two studies suggests that these findings are relevant to ASD pathology. Future studies will be needed to clearly distinguish these possibilities; using normocephalic ASD-patient derived NPCs and neurons as well as iPSC models of macrencephaly without ASD.</p>
<p id="P51">In summary, we have used a selected group of individuals with mild to extreme macrencephaly to address a specific hypothesis about the origin of ASD: namely, that a specific, early developmental brain enlargement might be generated from an underlying molecular and cellular pathway dysregulation. We employed patient-derived iPSCs to investigate this hypothesis and found that NPCs derived from this cohort displayed increased proliferation and abnormal differentiation, consistent with this hypothesis. Our data support the hypothesis that proliferation of NPCs is tightly regulated during mammalian brain development and that abnormalities of proliferation can lead to a long lasting differentiation abnormalities and defects seen in ASD.</p>
