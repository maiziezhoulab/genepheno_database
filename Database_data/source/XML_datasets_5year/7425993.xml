<abstract>
<p>Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) is pseudokinase involved in intracellular regulatory processes and has been implicated in several diseases. In this article, we report that human <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter contains a 33-bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) and characterize the heterogeneity and function of this genetic element. Analysis of human populations around the world uncovered the existence of alleles ranging from 1 to 5 copies of the repeat, with 2-, 3- and 5-copy alleles being the most common but displaying considerable geographical differences in frequency. The repeated sequence overlaps a C/EBP-ATF transcriptional regulatory element and is highly conserved, but not repeated, in various mammalian species, including great apes. The repeat is however evident in Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. Reporter plasmid experiments in human cell culture reveal that an increased copy number of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter 33-bp repeat results in increased transcriptional activity. In line with this, analysis of whole genome sequencing and RNA-Seq data from human cohorts demonstrates that the copy number of <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter 33-bp repeats is positively correlated with <italic>TRIB3</italic> mRNA expression level in many tissues throughout the body. Moreover, the copy number of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat appears to be linked to known <italic>TRIB3</italic> eQTL SNPs as well as <italic>TRIB3</italic> SNPs reported in genetic association studies. Taken together, the results indicate that the promoter 33-bp VNTR constitutes a causal variant for <italic>TRIB3</italic> expression variation between individuals and could underlie the results of SNP-based genetic studies.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The current article is devoted to a previously undescribed genetic element residing in the promoter region of human <italic>TRIB3</italic> gene and consisting of a variable number of tandemly repeated 33-bp segments. We found that human genome contains from 1 to 5 copies of the repeat and that the copy number distribution varies in human populations around the world. Importantly, an increased number of copies associated with increased expression of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> gene in many tissues of the body, giving rise to variation in <italic>TRIB3</italic> gene expression between individuals. Mechanistically, the 33-bp segment possesses the ability to activate transcription, and it becomes more potent as it is repeated. The 33-bp segment is repeated in Neanderthals and Denisovans, but not in great apes or other mammals, suggesting that the expansion of the 33-bp unit in the <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter occurred after the split of the hominin and chimpanzee lineages. The TRIB3 protein participates in multiple biological processes as a regulatory factor and is linked to several diseases. Thus, the importance of our study is to shed light on a new mechanism determining <italic>TRIB3</italic> expression level variation between individuals, and, more generally, to highlight how tandem repeat variations can serve as regulatory variants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The pseudokinase Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) is known to interact and modulate the function of several transcription factors, protein kinases, ubiquitin ligases and other proteins (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref001">1</xref>]). Through these interactions, TRIB3 has been reported to participate in processes such as the regulation of cellular stress response and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref005">5</xref>], megakaryocytopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref006">6</xref>], metabolic adaptation to nutrient-limiting conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref007">7</xref>], and to mediate cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref013">13</xref>]. Moreover, TRIB3 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including type 2 diabetes and its complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref018">18</xref>], Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref020">20</xref>] and several types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref023">23</xref>]. Recently, two novel associations relating <italic>TRIB3</italic> genetic variants to disease have been described. Lorenzi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref024">24</xref>] identified a link between <italic>TRIB3</italic> and the stereotypical pattern of gray matter loss in Alzheimer’s disease, and Yamada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref025">25</xref>] identified <italic>TRIB3</italic> as a susceptibility locus for ischemic stroke in an exome-wide association study. Therefore, there is a considerable interest to improve our understanding of mechanisms which govern human <italic>TRIB3</italic> expression and its variation between individuals.</p>
<p>Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) are defined as continuously located repeated DNA sequence motifs with the unit size ≥7 bp. VNTRs evolve as a result of recombination or replication slippage events and there are about ten thousand polymorphic VNTRs in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref026">26</xref>]. It has been found that the unit copy number polymorphism of these loci can have a significant impact on the properties of genes, including gene expression level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref028">28</xref>]. Due to the repetitive nature of VNTRs, the analysis of their structure by short-read high-throughput sequencing is complicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref029">29</xref>]. In the current article, we report that the human <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter contains a 33-bp VNTR and characterize this genetic element using a k-mer counting approach to analyze short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) data as well as search for sequencing reads spanning the VNTR region for direct allele detection. As a result of the analyses, we uncover that alleles with a higher number of the 33-bp repeat copies generate higher levels of <italic>TRIB3</italic> expression and that variation in the copy number of the 33-bp repeat could represent the causal variant for a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP-s) that have been linked to variation in <italic>TRIB3</italic> expression level in various tissues of the body.</p>

<p>The GRCh38 human reference genome contains 3 copies of this repeating element, spanning positions 380,879 to 380,977 of chromosome 20. To assess the copy number heterogeneity of this repeat, a PCR amplicon using primers flanking the VNTR was designed. Analysis of genomic DNA from commonly used human cell lines reveals several examples of heterozygosity at the 33-bp repeat, with alleles of 2 and 5 copies present in HepG2, 3 and 5 copies in Colo205, and 2 and 3 copies in H1299 and SaOS2; in the case of K562 cells, only the 3-copy allele is detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the copy number variation of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeats in a general population, we utilized sequencing data and DNA samples from the biobank of the Estonian Genome Center of University of Tartu (EGCUT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref032">32</xref>]. A 150-bp read length WGS data set comprised of &gt;2000 individuals from the Estonian population was used to estimate allele frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref033">33</xref>]. From the 150 bp reads, alleles up to 4x33bp were called by searching for spanning reads; since alleles with ≥5 copies of the 33-bp repeat cannot be fully spanned with 150 bp read length, partial spanning was accepted and any reads supporting &gt;4x33bp were designated 5x33bp. The results reveal that in the Estonian population, alleles with 2, 3 or 5 copies of the repeating element all appear to be quite frequent, with 5x33bp being the most common (allele frequency 0.42), followed by 3x33bp (0.34) and 2x33bp (0.23) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). This analysis further uncovered that alleles with 1 or 4 copies of the repeating element also occur, albeit at an allele frequency of less than 1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>A selection of individuals carrying the rare (1 or 4 repeats) alleles of the 33-bp repeat based on the WGS were subjected to follow-up PCR analysis, along with examples of individuals carrying the common alleles (2, 3 or 5 repeats). The results of PCR product gel electrophoresis confirmed the occurrence of the 1x33bp and 4x33bp alleles in these individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). We additionally sought to uncover potential alleles with &gt;5 copies of the 33-bp repeat by using a k-mer counting technique (described below) on the EGCUT WGS data set; however, PCR-based follow-up of 11 highest ranking individuals (33-bp copy number estimates ranging from 6.13 to 6.69) revealed all of them to be 5x33bp homozygotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008981.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Similarly, searching for sequencing reads containing a full coverage of four 33-bp repeats and, at either end of that, partial matches for additional 33-bp copies (indicative of a hypothetical ≥6x33bp allele) did not uncover any individuals from the EGCUT WGS data set.</p>

<p>Remarkably, the high-coverage genomes of Neanderthal and Denisovan hominins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref037">37</xref>] reveal that the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 5’ regions of these extinct archaic humans contain an allele with at least three copies of the 33-bp repeat, while the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 5’ regions of the great apes chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan contain only single copy of this 33-bp segment, similarly to the other mammalian orders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Thus, the data suggests that the tandem repeat expansion of the 33-bp segment seen in the human <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter occurred after the divergence of the hominins and the great apes but before the divergence of the three branches of hominins. The scarcity of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomic data does not allow a more detailed analysis of these populations. Interestingly, the currently available high-coverage Denisovan genome contains a single nucleotide variation (SNV) in position 10 of the third copy of the 33-bp repeats (heterozygous, C/A). A matching SNV has been reported in modern humans as well, however it is a highly rare variant (rs867414698; gnomAD study-wide alternative allele frequency 0.0021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref038">38</xref>]).</p>
<p>As the genetic variation in modern humans tends to cluster with geographic origin, we also assessed the WGS data generated by Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref039">39</xref>] for <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat alleles, using the approach described above for EGCUT data. The results, based on approx. 800 individuals spanning 54 geographically distinct world populations, reveal considerable variation in allele frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In many Asian, European and Middle Eastern populations, the 3x33bp and 5x33bp alleles are both quite frequent and can rank as the most common allele in a population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The 2x33bp allele appears at a particularly high frequency in some American populations, while the Oceanic populations show nearly exclusively the 3x33bp allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For the 1x33bp and 4x33bp alleles, African populations display a noticeably higher incidence compared to populations from other continents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). To evaluate how much of the copy number variation in the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat can be explained by population structure, we calculated the multi-allelic fixation index <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub>, as defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref040">40</xref>], for pairwise comparisons between the seven superpopulations in HGDP.

<title><italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter variants containing more copies of the 33-bp repeat show increased transcriptional activity</title>
<p>The conservation of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter 33-bp repeat sequence throughout diverse mammalian orders suggests functional importance. In the center of the 33-bp segment, at positions 14 to 21, resides a motif TT(G/A)CATCA, which corresponds to a transcriptional regulatory motif termed the C/EBP-ATF response element (CARE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). CARE-s mediate gene activation in response to cellular stresses such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, nutrient deficiency and viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref042">42</xref>]. A key transcription factor for driving CARE-dependent gene expression is considered to be Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), acting as a heterodimer with various C/EBP factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>To study whether the copy number of 33-bp repeats affects <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter activity, we generated luciferase reporter constructs which differ by the number of 33-bp repeats. The constructs contain human <italic>TRIB3</italic> gene segments up- and downstream of the 33-bp repeats (580 bp and 10 bp, respectively). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, the plasmids contain either two copies (plasmid TRIB3-2x33-pGL3) or five copies of the 33-bp repeat (TRIB3-5x33-pGL3), and both plasmids differ from the GRCh38 reference genome by six common SNPs that are listed in the Materials and Methods. The plasmids were transfected into HepG2 human hepatoma cells and the cells were either left untreated or treated with tunicamycin, an inducer of endoplasmic reticulum stress, with arsenite, an inducer of oxidative stress, or with glucose-free growth medium, to induce nutrient deficiency.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, the plasmids containing the <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter fragments are strongly stress-responsive, upregulating the expression of reporter gene in all three treatments. The largest increase is observed in tunicamycin-treated cells, while arsenite exposure and glucose starvation result in slightly lower activation of reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Importantly, in the cells transfected with plasmid TRIB3-5x33bp-pGL3 and exposed to stressors (tunicamycin, arsenite or glucose-free medium), the reporter activity is significantly higher than in the cells transfected with TRIB3-2x33-pGL3 and exposed to the same treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Additionally, the 5-repeat allele also demonstrates increased luciferase activity compared to the 2-repeat allele in unstressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>To compare the full series of discovered copy number variants of the 33-bp repeat, a second set of luciferase reporter plasmids was prepared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), containing 1–5 copies of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat surrounded by flanking sequences that are identical to the GRCh38 reference genome (e.g., regarding SNPs in the region). To broaden the scope of the study, these plasmids were tested using the H1299 human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line and the overexpression of ATF4 was included as a treatment. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, in the control cells as well as in the cells subjected to arsenite stress or overexpression of ATF4, the strength of the luciferase reporter signal positively and significantly correlates with the number of 33-bp repeats in the transfected reporter plasmid. Notably, increasing the 33-bp copies from 1 to 5 leads to approximately 5-fold increase in transcriptional activity under conditions that stimulate CARE activity (arsenite and ATF4 overexpression), indicating that transcriptional output increases quite steeply as a function of the 33-bp copy number. Thus, the results demonstrate that increased copy number of the 33-bp repeat results in elevated <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter activity.</p>

<p>To study the effect of <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat copy number variation on the gene expression level in the human body, we turned to data sets with RNA-Seq and WGS data from the same individuals. To effectively use WGS data with read lengths &lt;150 bp (e.g., 100 bp, in which case a read cannot reliably span even 3x33 bp), we switched to a k-mer counting based approach for quantifying the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat copy number. The k-mer method estimates the average <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat copy number across each individual’s two alleles by querying the WGS reads for the occurrence of 25-mer oligonucleotides derived from the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp segment sequence, normalizing the counts to those of 25-mers derived from sequences neighboring the 33-bp repeat region.</p>
<p>We first analyzed individuals from the EGCUT cohort, where blood RNA-Seq has been performed for a subset of individuals analyzed by WGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref044">44</xref>].

<p>We searched literature for SNPs that are located in the vicinity of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat region and that have been noted as significant or suggestive in genetic association studies, including GWAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref046">46</xref>], UK Biobank PheWAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref047">47</xref>], linkage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref048">48</xref>] and other types of genetic association studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref051">51</xref>]. This uncovered 5 SNPs that have been associated with phenotypes, including several blood and nervous system traits or diseases, in genome-wide or more tightly focused studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Analysis of the 5 association study lead SNPs in GTEx WGS data reveals positive as well as negative associations between the SNP alternative allele and the copy number of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g006">Fig 6</xref>), indicating that the lead SNPs could be tagging various alleles of the 33-bp repeat. Further, GTEx RNA-Seq data from phenotype-relevant tissues reveals that these SNPs are linked to <italic>TRIB3</italic> gene expression with directionality that is in line with their association to <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008981.g006">Fig 6</xref>), indicating that 33-bp repeat alleles could underlie the effects of these SNPs on <italic>TRIB3</italic> expression level in tissues relevant to the reported trait or disease.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current era of human genetic studies, powered mainly by short-read sequencing and SNP microarrays, VNTRs have been addressed comparatively less than other types of variants due to technological constraints. Nevertheless, more than a hundred thousand polymorphic tandem repeats have been described that localize within or near genes in the human genome, representing considerable potential to alter the protein coding or regulatory sequences of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref052">52</xref>]. In the current article, we characterize copy number variation in a 33-bp tandem repeat localized to the promoter region of human <italic>TRIB3</italic> and uncover that alleles with a higher copy number of the 33-bp repeating element lead to elevated <italic>TRIB3</italic> gene expression level.</p>
<p>The human reference genome (GRCh38) contains 3 identical tandemly repeating elements of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp VNTR. Alleles with 2 or 5 copies are also relatively frequent in many human populations. Crucially, this 33-bp region that has been repeated in humans contains a highly conserved sequence element, which likely accounts for the effect of 33-bp VNTR copy number variation on <italic>TRIB3</italic> mRNA expression level. Previous functional studies of the human <italic>TRIB3</italic> (as well as mouse <italic>Trib3</italic>) promoter sequences have identified that a C/EBP-ATF composite motif, which rests within the highly conserved part of the 33-bp repeat, represents a crucial transcription factor binding site for driving <italic>TRIB3</italic> mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref053">53</xref>]. A key factor shown to bind to this site is ATF4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref053">53</xref>], a bZIP transcription factor with several known roles in physiology and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref056">56</xref>]. Thus, <italic>TRIB3</italic> alleles with more copies of the 33-bp repeat can convey increased expression of <italic>TRIB3</italic> by having more copies of the C/EBP-ATF binding site, a positive regulatory element, in their promoter. In support of this, we find that the overexpression of ATF4 is sufficient to induce <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter reporter constructs, and that the responsiveness to ATF4 (fold induction) increases steadily as the number of 33-bp repeats in the construct is increased step-wise from 1 to 5 copies, the range of natural variation.</p>
<p>Our finding that the great apes do not contain repeated copies of the 33-bp segment in the <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter, while the archaic hominin branches Neanderthal and Denisovan do, allows us to estimate the time window when the VNTR evolved. The ancestors of hominins and chimpanzees split about 6 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref057">57</xref>], and present-day humans diverged from Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages about 800,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref058">58</xref>]. Thus, the expansion of the 33-bp segment in <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter occurred within approximately 5 million years separating these two branching points of human evolution. All five of the copy number variants which we found in the current study are already present in the HGDP populations living in Africa, the ancestral home continent of modern humans, and the alleles 1x and 4x, the incidence of which is very low in most HGDP populations, are noticeably more frequent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, the results suggest that all allelic variants ranging from 2x to 5x evolved before the migration of modern humans out of Africa, which, according to the earliest fossil evidence currently found, started about 200,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref060">60</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies using knockout and overexpression models of mouse <italic>Trib3</italic> have led to TRIB3 being implicated in several biological processes <italic>in vivo</italic> (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref061">61</xref>]). Promisingly, some of these results line up with significant or suggestive phenotypes from human genetic association studies. For example, enforced overexpression of <italic>Trib3</italic> in mouse adipose tissue has been reported to inhibit weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref062">62</xref>], and the human SNP rs6051546 alternative allele is associated with increased 33-bp repeat copy number, elevated <italic>TRIB3</italic> mRNA level in adipose tissue, and suggestively (p = 3.47e-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref047">47</xref>] with reduced obesity. Several mouse and cellular models have implicated increased TRIB3 in neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref064">64</xref>], and in humans, SNP associations with information processing speed (p = 1.68e-7; rs6051520) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref050">50</xref>] and Alzheimer’s disease (p = 6.01e-3; rs62191440) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref049">49</xref>] correlate with the expected effects of <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat copy number on <italic>TRIB3</italic> gene expression level in brain tissue. The SNP rs62191440 has received attention as a proxy for rs4813620 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.656 in 1000G EUR), which was reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref024">24</xref>] to be associated with <italic>TRIB3</italic> expression in human brain tissues, but [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref065">65</xref>] found that Alzheimer’s disease status may affect this association. Human genetic association studies also link <italic>TRIB3</italic> to red blood cell parameters (p = 9.6e-8; rs11696299) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref047">47</xref>], and we also uncovered a link to the 33-bp repeat copy count for this lead SNP. It has recently been reported that in mouse <italic>Trib3</italic> plays a role in red blood cell production; however, the effect appears to be complex, with alternate consequences under steady-state and myeloablative challenge conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref066">66</xref>].</p>
<p>The results of our study allow to propose that a tandemly repeated polymorphic 33-bp repeat element in the human <italic>TRIB3</italic> gene gives rise to variation in <italic>TRIB3</italic> expression levels between individuals by multiplying the number of C/EBP-ATF binding sites in the <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter. Further, this variation in the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp VNTR copy number appears to explain a number of SNP eQTLs for <italic>TRIB3</italic> expression in various tissues and could possibly also underlie <italic>TRIB3</italic> SNP effects from genetic association studies. Since the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp VNTR copy number is imperfectly associated with SNPs, direct genotyping of the alleles of the VNTR in large-scale study groups could allow for the discovery of stronger associations to human phenotypes.</p>

<title>Analysis of human <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter 33-bp repeat copy number by PCR</title>
<p>To study the human <italic>TRIB3</italic> promoter 33-bp repeat copy number in the genomic DNA of human cell lines and EGCUT biobank human DNA samples, DNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5’-CCACTTCCGCTGCGAGTCTCGTG-3’ and 5’-CCCGAGGGCATCAGACGGCG-3’, which bind to the regions flanking the repeats. In addition to the repeats, the PCR products contain fragments up- and downstream of the repeats (23 bp and 33 bp, respectively). The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2.5% agarose gel and, in several cases, Sanger sequencing was also carried out, which confirmed that the products contain the human TRIB3 33-bp repeats.</p>

<title>Human <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat copy number analyses from whole genome sequencing reads</title>
<p>Whole genome sequencing data was obtained from the Estonian Biobank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref033">33</xref>], the Human Genome Diversity Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref039">39</xref>], and the GTEx project (v8 release) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>A k-mer counting approach was used to estimate the diploid allelic average copy number of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat from WGS reads. A list of 25-mer oligonucleotides was created from the genomic sequence of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat and its 5’ and 3’ flanking sequences using the glistmaker program of the GenomeTester4 package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008981.ref067">67</xref>] with step of 1 bp, and k-mer frequencies were extracted from the list with the program glistquery from the same package. The following formula was then used for calculating the VNTR copy number: median from 10 repeat unit k-mers / max (median from 29 VNTR 5’ flank k-mers; median from 29 VNTR 3’ flank k-mers).</p>
<p>For direct detection of specific <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat alleles from 150 bp WGS reads, reads mapping to ±10 kb of the <italic>TRIB3</italic> 33-bp repeat were extracted for further analysis by text matching. Alleles with 1 to 4 copies of the 33-bp repeat were detected by searching for reads fully spanning the repeat region and additionally covering 6 bp of the 5’ and 3’ flanking regions, with a maximum allowed edit distance of 2 bp compared to the expected sequence. As the 5x33bp allele cannot be spanned by a 150 bp read, reads with partial coverage of 5 copies of the 33-bp repeat element were accepted, requiring a minimum repeat element fragment of 6 bp and a maximum edit distance of 2 bp. For each sample, alleles with &lt;2 detection counts were excluded. Samples showing more than two alleles were excluded.
