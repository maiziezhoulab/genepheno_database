<abstract>
<p>RICH2 knockout (RICH2 KO) mice exhibit neophobia in the novel object test. To gain further insight into their anxiety-related phenotype, we subjected these mice to additional behavioral tests to elucidate whether the behavioral abnormality in these mice is a consequence of reduced exploratory motivation, and whether the neophobia is linked specifically to objects or also present for other modalities. RICH2 KO mice engage in normal exploration in a novel environment, suggesting that the anxiety-related phenotype is not due to reduced exploratory drive. Increased fear response was not observed using novel olfactory cues, but restricted to objects. Given that the amygdala is an important brain region mediating anxiety-related behaviors and a prime target for anxiety-related therapeutics, and RICH2 is a Rho-GTPase activating protein (GAP) regulating synaptic spine plasticity via small GTPases, we analyzed spine formation, morphology and receptor composition in amygdala. We found disinhibition of RhoA in the amygdala of RICH2 KO mice, along with a decreased ability for actin polymerization and a reduction in mature spines. However, we detected increased neuronal activation in the amygdala evidenced by c-fos labeling. Thus, we conclude that despite unaltered baseline activity, RICH2 KO mice show heightened amygdala response after exposure to objects, which, however, does not result in homeostatic strengthening of excitatory synapses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RICH2 (RhoSAP: RhoGAP synapse associated protein) is a protein highly enriched in the post-synaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses. It was identified as an interacting partner of SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3) at synaptic spines and to harbor a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain through which it participates in signaling cascades of small GTPases of the Rho family (cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), Ras -related C3 botulinum toxin substrates 1 (RAC1), and Ras homologous member (RhoA); Raynaud et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Knockout (KO) of RICH2 was previously reported to result in specific behavioral phenotypes including a fear of novel objects, increased stereotypic behavior and impairment of motor learning in mice (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>). In particular, although anxiety in general was not increased in RICH2 KO mice, object neophobia was highly significant. As specific phobias such as irrational fear of objects have been reported in individuals suffering from psychiatric disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but rarely in mouse models, RICH2 KO mice are an interesting model to investigate the underlying molecular processes of these behaviors.</p>
<p>The amygdala is a key brain structure involved in processes of fear memory acquisition and storage, but also modulates fear-related learning in other brain structures, such as the cortex and the hippocampus (Ehrlich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2009</xref>). In humans, increased activation of the amygdala has been observed in response to angry and contemptuous faces in Generalized Social Phobia (Stein et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2002</xref>), during emotion processing in anxiety-prone subjects (Stein et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2007</xref>), and in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Liberzon and Sripada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2008</xref>). Activation of the amygdala influences cognitive processes, perception, selective attention and explicit memory (Steimer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2002</xref>). Amygdala activation was further related to specific phobias, although the right amygdala seems to play a bigger role in this process (Fredrikson and Furmark, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2003</xref>). Additionally, the amygdala may be critical for learning the valence of novel objects from the emotional expressions of others (Blair et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2008</xref>). In monkeys, it has been shown that lesions of the amygdala disrupted emotional behavior to a set of novel objects (Zola-Morgan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">1991</xref>). Especially hyperactivity of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been associated with excessive/unreasonable fear to a specific object or situation (Forster et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2012</xref>; Felix-Ortiz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In rodents, increased activation of the amygdala has been associated with freezing behavior (Holahan and White, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2002</xref>) and the processing of aversive stimuli, as well as the consolidation of information that leads to the formation of a specific phobia (File et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1998</xref>).</p>
<p>However, object neophobia has only been described in few mouse models so far. For example Neuroserpin KO mice show a neophobic response to novel objects (Madani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2003</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.</p>
<p>Here, we specifically investigated the anxiety phenotype of RICH2 KO mice in more detail on behavioral and cellular level. On cellular level, an increase in multi-spine synapses (branched spines) in the hippocampus and cerebellum along with alterations in receptor composition and actin polymerization caused by a disinhibition of synaptic RAC1 was reported in RICH2 KO mice (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>). However, so far, no analysis of amygdala was performed. Thus, here, we investigated whether the observed neophobia is associated with an increased activation of the amygdala and whether an increased activation is caused by synaptic alterations associated with abnormal actin polymerization driven by small GTPases, such as reported before in hippocampus and cerebellum of RICH2 KO mice (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>).</p>
<p>On behavioral level, we investigated whether avoidance of objects in an open field might be caused by a general reduction in locomotor and exploratory activity in RICH2 KO mice. Further, we investigated, whether not only objects, but also other novel stimuli such as odors elicit avoidance behavior and increased anxiety.</p>

<title>Animals and Housing Conditions</title>
<p>Generation of the RICH2 KO mouse has been described before (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>). Briefly, KO mice were generated by the insertion of a gene-trap vector causing an additional genomic deletion within RICH2. For behavioral experiments, 70-day old male mice (RICH2<sup>+/+</sup>, RICH2<sup>−/−</sup>, backcrossed for more than 10 generations on C57BL/6J background) were transferred from the animal facility to the behavioral experiment room and habituated for 10 days to the new housing conditions. All animals were housed individually upon arrival in plastic cages under standard laboratory conditions (maintained at 22°C, with lights automatically turned on/off in a 12 h rhythm (lights on at 7 am)) and provided with food and water available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Heterozygote mice were used for breeding, thus WT and RICH2 KO mice were littermates.</p>
<p>Behavioral experiments were preformed between 9 am and 6 pm. Prior to the behavioral experiments, mice were habituated for 1 h to the test room. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals issued by the Federal Government of Germany and approved by the Regierungspraesidium Tuebingen and the local ethics committee at Ulm University (ID Number: 0.103 and 1146).</p>

<sec id="s2-3">
<title>Behavioral Testing in the Open Field</title>
<sec id="s2-3-1">
<title>Novel Odor Recognition</title>
<p>The test was conducted in the open field arena (50 × 50 cm). The arena was constructed of white Plexiglas. Mice were first habituated to the open field arena (without any odor inside) for 30 min and placed back into the home-cage for approximately 1–2 min. In the meantime, two drops of water (100 μl) were placed in the arena, approximately 4 cm from the sidewall. The mouse was placed back into the same arena facing the opposite side of the objects and allowed to freely explore the setting for 10 min. After this acquisition period, the mouse was placed back into the home cage. The water drops were replaced with the same amount of banana-flavored water and the mouse was placed in the arena again. The mouse explored the arena freely for 10 min and was recorded. Afterwards, one of the banana-flavored water drops was replaced with an almond-flavored water drop, while the mouse was in the home cage. Then again the mouse was allowed to freely explore the arena and a video was recorded for 10 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-3-2">
<title>Novel Object Exploration</title>
<p>Like novel odor exploration, each mouse was allowed to explore an open field arena for 30 min as habituation phase. Afterwards, two identical objects were placed in the arena at the same position as the water drops. The mice were allowed to freely explore the objects for 10 min. After this acquisition period, mice were placed back in the home cage. Afterwards, one of the identical objects was replaced with a white playmobil® horse and the mouse was allowed to freely explore for 10 min. Finally, in the last acquisition phase, the horse was replaced with another novel object and the mouse was allowed to freely explore for 10 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-3-3">
<title>Quantification of Open Field Behavior</title>
<p>Videos were acquired using a CCD camera (Conrad CCD camera S/W). Activity parameters such as distance traveled, time spent in the object zone vs. time spent in the non object zone, zone transition etc., during all of the different test sessions were scored using the video tracking software EthoVision XT (Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands).</p>

<sec id="s2-4">
<title>Isolation of Amygdala from Whole Brain</title>
<p>The amygdala was isolated from the whole brain according to Zapala et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2005</xref>). Briefly, two coronal cuts were made at approximately Bregma −1 and −2.75. The section was put down with the caudal side facing up and incisions were made in a triangular shape both at the right bottom and left bottom, avoiding hippocampus. These brain tissues contained amygdala and further procedures were carried out according to the desired experimental protocol. For brain sectioning, sections from Bregma −2.8 (approximately) were used for staining and histological procedures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-5">
<title>Western Blot-Analysis</title>
<p>Western blot experiments were performed using PSD-enriched P2- and nuclear fractions of the amygdala. The amygdala brain regions were isolated from three males WT and three RICH2 KO mice (P70–P80) and were dissolved in HEPES buffer (10 ml buffer/gram tissues; 10 mM HEPES; 0.32 M Sucrose, pH 7.42; Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche)). Tissues were homogenized using sonication to obtain crude homogenate. The crude homogenates were centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 15 min at 4°C, resulting in nuclear fraction (P1) and soluble supernatant (S1). The S1 fractions were further centrifuged at 11,400 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. Subsequently, the pellet or synaptosomal fraction (P2) was dissolved in ice-cold HEPES buffer. The protein concentration was measured using Bradford analysis and 10 μgof protein was loaded on PAGE in 4× SDS sample loading buffer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-6">
<title>Real-Time PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from WT and RICH2 KO mice amygdala using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and protocol. cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and DNA amplification using polymerase were carried out simultaneously via Transcriptor One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Roche, Germany), using RICH2 genotyping primers (WT/KO: 5-AGC TAG CAG ACG CTT CAA GG-3, WT: 5-CCA ACA AAG CTG AAA GCA CA-3, KO: 5-CAC ATC CAT GCT GAG GAT GA-3). The amplified products were visualized using gel electrophoresis.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title>
<sec id="s2-7-1">
<title>Fluorescent IHC</title>
<p>Cryosections (thickness 16 μM) were thawed and fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min in a hydrated box. Then the sections were washed three times in 1× PBS for 5 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% triton in 1× PBS for 1 h. Afterwards, the slices were washed again three times with 0.05% triton in 1× PBS, 10 min each time. Later blocking of antigens was done using an incubation with 10% FCS for 2 h. Then, the slices were incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, the slices were washed with 0.05% triton in 1× PBS for 10 min, followed by incubation with secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution at 37°C for 2 h in dark. After washing three times, 15 min each with 1× PBS containing 0.05% triton, the slices were incubated 5 min with PBS containing DAPI, and after a final washing step with ddH<sub>2</sub>O for 5 min, slices were mounted with VectaMount (Vector Laboratories).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-7-2">
<title>c-Fos Staining</title>
<p>Thirty minutes after the behavioral experiments, the mice were sacrificed via cervical dislocation. Brains were taken out and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Brain sections (30 μM thickness) were prepared and fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h. After washing three times with 1× PBS 5 min each, the sections were permeabilized with 0.2% triton in 1× PBS solution for 45 min. Then, the slices were washed three times with 1× PBS, 5 min each. Afterwards, the slices were incubated in 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 1× PBS solution for 20 min. After three washing steps, blocking was done using 2% goat serum in 1× PBS. Next, the slices were incubated with c-Fos antibody (purchased from Synaptic Systems) 1:5000 diluted in blocking solution at room temperature overnight. The following day, the slices were incubated with secondary goat anti rabbit antibody for 1 h after three washing steps (1× PBS). After the incubation, the slices were washed three times again with 1× PBS and later incubated in 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution (10 mg DAB in 100 ml 1× PBS, with 200 μl NiCl and 30 μl 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Then, slices were first washed three times in 1× PBS; later washed with 70% (once), 90% (once) and 100% (twice) ethanol, for 5 min each time. Finally, the slices were washed with xylene three times, 5 min each and mounted with Entellan (Merck Millipore). The sections were scanned using a BZ-X700 from Keyence.</p>

<title><italic>In Situ</italic> Hybridization</title>
<p><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization was performed according to protocols described previously (Boeckers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1999</xref>; Laube et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2002</xref>). The brain tissues were first frozen, cryo-sliced with 8 μm of thickness and then frozen on Super Frost Plus slides. The sections were stored at −70°C. Transcripts encoding RICH2 were detected with antisense oligonucleotide purchased from MWG Eurofins (Ebersberg, Germany) directed against the 5′ and 3′ ends of the mRNA: TGA GCT TCT TGT GTG TGC TGT GGG ACA CCT GTT T.</p>

<sec id="s2-9">
<title>Golgi Staining</title>
<p>Golgi staining was performed on whole brains from WT and RICH2 KO animals (<italic>n</italic> = 5 for each group, age p70–80) using the FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit (FD NeuroTechnologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In order to obtain the 3D overview of the dendritic spines, <italic>Z</italic> stack images of Golgi stained slices were made with a BZ-X700 from Keyence. For a general overview of the cell, 40× magnification was used and to zoom into individual dendrites, 63× magnification was used. 10–15 stacked images were taken at 40× magnification and 20–25 stacked images were taken at 63× magnification (0.1 μm per z-stack). For the quantification of spine density, the length of the dendrite was measured using the freehand lines tool from ImageJ. Then, the number of spines was documented for the respective length of the dendrite. In total, 429 (WT) and 450 (KO) μm of dendritic length were quantified in this way. The total number of spines for unit length was calculated for each animal and averaged for each group. The spine morphology was quantified based on the length, width and head-to-neck ratio of each distinct spine and the spine assigned to a morphological category. The criteria for each spine morphological category (filopodia, thin, stubby and mushroom spines) were: filopodia (length &gt; 2 μm), thin (length &lt; 1 μm), stubby (length: width ratio approx. 1:1, no spine neck visible), mushroom (width &gt; 0.6 μm; Risher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2014</xref>). Spine morphology was assessed from primary dendrites. For better visualization of the 3D view of spines, scrolling through the different stacks was done. In total 101 spines (for WT animals) and 94 spines (for KO animals) were categorized. Each morphological category was quantified as percentage of total spines for each animal and averaged for each group.</p>

<title>RhoGAP Assay</title>
<p>RhoGAP assays were performed on P2 lysates of brain amygdala from WT and RICH2 KO animals using the RhoGAP Assay (BK 105, Cytoskeleton) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and protocol. The absorbance was measured using a Cytation 3 microplate reader from BioTek. Upon converting the GTP-bound active small GTPases to GDP-bound inactive small GTPases, RhoGAPs liberate phosphate. The generated free phosphate can be quantified using the Cytophos reagent, which is provided with the kit. To evaluate the GAP activity of tissue lysates, a standard curve was generated using different concentrations of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The tissue lysates from WT and KO amygdala were incubated with GTP and Cytophos. Then, the absorbance was measured and plotted on the standard curve, and thus, the GAP activity of each lysates was quantified. The small GTPases (RhoA, RAC1, CDC42, RAS p21) were provided with the kit. To determine the GAP activity of the lysates on each small GTPase, the corresponding GTPase was incubated with and without lysates (as a control), along with GTP. Later the liberated phosphate was quantified using Cytophos. The absorbance in presence of lysates (both WT and KO) and control state (Ctrl) is presented as bar graph.</p>

<title>RICH2 is Expressed in Amygdala Neurons</title>
<p>RICH2 KO mice used in this study have been characterized before and a <italic>Rich2</italic> specific genomic knock-out confirmed by several experimental approaches (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>). RICH2 is a protein predominately expressed in the brain (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>). Within the brain, expression analysis reveals the presence of <italic>Rich2</italic> mRNA in amygdala (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization using adult WT brain further confirms expression of <italic>Rich2</italic> in the amygdala (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Further, RICH2 was detected on protein level through analysis of lysates of several brain regions by Western blot. RICH2 expression was found in cortex and hippocampus as reported before, but also in lysate from amygdala region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). To control successful isolation of amygdala, detection of Arp1 as marker protein (Zirlinger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2001</xref>) was used (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). RICH2 was found mainly co-localizing with HOMER1, a marker for glutamatergic excitatory post-synapses in the amygdala (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Thus, given the presence of RICH2 in amygdala, altered amygdala circuitry through abnormal RICH2 signaling at synaptic spines may contribute to the increased behavioral inhibition in response to novel objects as observed previously.</p>

<title>Specific Object Neophobia in RICH2 KO Mice</title>
<p>RICH2 KO mice were shown to display significantly decreased object approaches in a novel object test before (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>). Given that this behavioral inhibition may be the consequence of a general reduction in the motivation to explore, we tested this hypothesis by examining levels of exploratory activity during the habituation phase of two test paradigms, an olfactory test and a novel object test.</p>
<p>We detected a slight but not significant decrease in locomotor behavior in RICH2 KO mice during the habituation phase for the novel object and novel odor test (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Thus, except from a slight reduction in locomotion, possibly due to increased anxiety/freezing in RICH2 KO mouse, exploratory behavior in the habituation phase was not different between WT and RICH2 KO mice. Reduced approach behavior in subsequent tests therefore cannot be explained by reduced exploratory activity in RICH2 KO mice.</p>

<p>To investigate the response of RICH2 KO mice compared to WT mice elicited by the presence of objects, and novel objects with specific shape, we measured exploration in a familiar environment using the novel object exploration test (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B–K</xref>). During the habituation phase, no innate side preference was detected in RICH2 KO or WT mice in both test paradigms, the object test and test with exposure to novel odors (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,C</xref>). After habituation, two identical objects were placed in an open field. RICH2 KO mice showed a decrease in the distance traveled in response to the presence of the objects compared to WT mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Replacement of a familiar object with a novel object—either in horse shape or alternative inorganic shape as the first object, similarly elicited a significant reduction in the distance traveled of RICH2 KO mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). There was no significant difference observed in the response regarding the type and shape of the objects (one-way ANOVA: WT <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,12)</sub> = 3.212; <italic>p</italic> = 0.076; RICH2 KO <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,12)</sub> = 3.322; <italic>p</italic> = 0.071).</p>
<p>The number of transitions was reduced as a trend in presence of the identical objects and novel horse objects, and significantly in presence of the novel object (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). The number of entries into the zone around the object (object zone) was decreased in RICH2 KO mice or almost absent (horse object; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). There was no significant difference observed in the response regarding the type and shape of the objects (one-way ANOVA: WT <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,12)</sub> = 0.361; <italic>p</italic> = 0.704; RICH2 KO <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,12)</sub> = 0.808; <italic>p</italic> = 0.469).</p>
<p>The decreased locomotion and entries into object zones was accompanied by a significant increase in freezing in RICH2 KO mice (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G,H</xref>). The time spent in object zones was decreased (identical objects and horse object, and significantly for novel object) in RICH2 KO mice compared to WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). Compared to the time spent in the object side of the arena, RICH2 KO mice spend more time in the non-object side as WT mice (horse object and novel object, seen as trend; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J,K</xref>). There was no significant difference observed in the response regarding the type and shape of the objects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>: one-way ANOVA: WT <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,16)</sub> = 0.277; <italic>p</italic> = 0.841; RICH2 KO <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,16)</sub> = 0.159; <italic>p</italic> = 0.922, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>: WT <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,12)</sub> = 0.236; <italic>p</italic> = 0.793; RICH2 KO <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,16)</sub> = 1.245; <italic>p</italic> = 0.323; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>: WT <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,16)</sub> = 2.218; <italic>p</italic> = 0.126; RICH2 KO <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,16)</sub> = 2.428; <italic>p</italic> = 0.116). Thus, the results confirm increased anxiety in response to objects in RICH2 mice.</p>
<p>Next, to further assess whether the observed increase in behavioral inhibition is caused only by objects, or also other novel stimuli, we exposed RICH2 KO mice to several olfactory cues that are normally not aversive for mice (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>). WT and RICH2 KO mice were exposed to water (control), banana, and almond (test) odors for 10 min. No significant difference for water, banana and almond in the distance traveled (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), the number of transitions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), the entries into object zones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), and time spent in object zones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>) was detected between RICH2 KO mice and WT in response to novel odors. Thus, anxiety in RICH2 mice is triggered by objects but not by olfactory cues.</p>

<title>Altered Activation of Amygdala Neurons in RICH2 KO Mice in Response to Novel Objects</title>
<p>To assess whether the amygdala plays a role in this behavioral abnormality of RICH2 KO mice, we measured the activation state of amygdala neurons 30 min after the novel object test by quantification of c-fos staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Expression of c-fos is an indirect marker of neuronal activity, as c-fos expression is increased in active neurons (Cruz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2013</xref>), and it has been reported that an increase of cFos expression occurrs 30 min after neuronal activation (Szyndler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2009</xref>; Zhong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2014</xref>). We have focused on the BLA (the lateral and basal nuclei together), since it was shown that lesions in the BLA are able to attenuate taste neophobia (Lin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2009</xref>; Gómez-Chacón et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2012</xref>), and diminish neophobic responses (Nachman and Ashe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1974</xref>), especially in presence of additional hippocampal pathology (Aggleton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1989</xref>). The BLA may modulate memory consolidation in recently active synapses in efferent brain regions (McReynolds et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2014</xref>), and food presented in a novel way, elicits avoidance in rats that is positively correlated with the percentage of BLA area (Kiyokawa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2017</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Our results show that the expression of c-fos is significantly increased in the BLA of RICH2 KO mice compared to WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Thus, it is possible that RICH2 KO mice suffer from a hyper-activation of amygdala neurons. This increased activation may be caused by altered input into amygdala and/or altered post-synaptic plasticity and synapse maturation in signal receiving neurons in the amygdala. In the central amygdala (CeA) c-fos expression was also slightly increased in RICH2 KO mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). As control, the hippocampal CA3 region was measured and no significant differences in the expression of c-fos were detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).</p>

<title>Altered Synaptic RhoA Signaling in the Amygdala of RICH2 KO Mice</title>
<p>Thus, next, to investigate the underlying mechanisms causing abnormal activation of amygdala neurons, we measured the activity of small GTPases. RICH2 has RhoGAP activity and thus is able to promote GTP hydrolysis and thereby inactivate Rho GTPases such as RhoA, RAC1 and CDC42 (Raynaud et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2014</xref>). Previously, we have shown that loss of RICH2 leads to disinhibition of RAC1 in the hippocampus, thereby promoting spine growth and the formation of multiple spine synapses via increased actin polymerization (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>). However, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, activity of RICH2 was also reported for RhoA (Raynaud et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2014</xref>). Thus, we analyzed whether effects of RICH2 KO on Rho GTPases can be detected in amygdala lysate. In this assay, the small G-protein is incubated in presence of GAP (i.e., RICH2 in amygdala lysate) and GTP. Subsequently, GTP hydrolysis is quantified via CytoPhos reagent by measurement of the amount of phosphate generated through determination of absorbance. A reduction in hydrolysis using lysate of RICH2 KO mice compared to WT in presence of RhoA, RAC1, CDC42 or RAS p51 would indicate activity of RICH2 for the corresponding small GTPase protein. The results show that the GAP activity is higher for WT lysates compared to RICH2 KO lysates, suggesting that the deletion of RICH2 has reduced the GAP activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="fnmol-10-00180-g0005"></graphic>
</fig>
<p>To investigate which Rho GTPase family members is affected most by RICH2 KO in the amygdala, we added the small G protein RhoA, RAC1, CDC42 and RAS p21 to the lysate (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B–E</xref>). In the presence of RhoA, the absorbance of WT lysates is higher than that of RICH2 KO lysate, which indicates that RICH2 is acting as a GAP for RhoA in amygdala (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). There was no difference between WT and RICH2 KO lysates in the presence of RAC1 and CDC42 suggesting that RAC1 and CDC42 are not target G proteins for RICH2 in amygdala (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>). Similarly, no difference between WT and RICH2 KO lysates was found in the presence of RAS p21 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Deletion of RICH2 leads to a significant increase of RhoA protein at synapses in the amygdala (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>) that may be specific to synapses or reflecting a general increase of RhoA levels. The expression levels of RAC1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>) and CDC42 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>) were unaltered. We thus conclude that in amygdala, RICH2 shows preferential GAP activity for RhoA. RICH2 deletion leads to a disinhibition of RhoA. Together with an increase in total RhoA protein, the results hint towards an increase in RhoA signaling at synaptic spines in the amygdala of RICH2 KO mice.</p>

<title>Altered Spine Morphology and Actin Polymerization in the Amygdala of RICH2 KO Mice</title>
<p>Given that small GTPase signaling is involved in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines and that altered spine morphology has been reported in other brain regions in RICH2 KO mice (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>), we next assessed, whether actin polymerization is also affected at synapses in the amygdala of RICH2 KO mice (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,B</xref>). Amygdala P2 lysates from WT and RICH2 KO animals were used in an ELISA based actin polymerization assay. The results show that lysate from amygdala of RICH2 KO mice induces actin polymerization to a significantly lower amount compared to lysate from WT mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The fluorescent intensity of actin signals at synapses in the amygdala, however, were not significantly less in RICH2 KO mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Thus, the total levels of actin were not altered in contrast to the polymerization rate.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="fnmol-10-00180-g0006"></graphic>
</fig>
<p>Given that disinhibition of RhoA is associated with repressed maintenance and elongation of spines (Tashiro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2000</xref>), we next evaluated synapse density and morphology. To that end, we performed Golgi staining of brain sections from WT and RICH2 KO mice. As in other brain regions before Sarowar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>), we could not detect differences in spine density in RICH2 KO compared to WT mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). This is confirmed by experiments using IHC, where we could not detect significant differences in the density of immunoreactive puncta for postsynaptic marker proteins such as HOMER1 and SHANK3 and the presynaptic marker BASSOON (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). The morphology of spines, in contrast, is significantly altered. The number of mature (represented by the categories mushroom and stubby spines) synapses is decreased in RICH2 KO mice, while the number of immature (represented by the categories filopodia-like and thin) spines is increased. The decrease in mature spine was due to the decrease in mushroom shaped spines, without alteration in stubby shaped spines. The increase in the immature spines results from an increase in filopodia-like spines, without alteration in thin shaped spines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Along with morphological differences, the protein composition of spines in amygdala shows alterations in RICH2 KO compared to WT mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). Using Western blot experiments, we detected a significant increase in PSD95. It was shown that most filopodia–spine structures contain PSD95 clusters even though these spines have thin spine heads (Okabe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2001</xref>; Fan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2011</xref>) and PSD95 is additionally localized to the dendritic shaft. The increase in PSD95 may thus not be conflicting with a loss of mature spines.</p>
<p>Increased activity of the amygdala, as shown before, may be expected to lead to homeostatic changes in synapse numbers and synaptic strength. However, in the amygdala of RICH2 KO mice, a shift from mature to immature synapses, no change in synapse density, and decreased synaptic actin polymerization was observed. Thus, to better understand the observed phenotype, we quantified the expression of immediate early genes in the amygdala of RICH2 KO mice under baseline conditions. Given that an increased number of c-fos positive neurons had been shown in response to novel objects before, it might be possible that activity of the amygdala is increased in general in RICH2 KO mice. Therefore, we measured IEG protein levels under baseline conditions but were unable to detect a significant difference in the expression of c-FOS and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein; (ARC; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref>). A significant difference was detected in the expression of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Therefore, we closer investigated the activation status of CREB. Phosphorylation activates CREB and pCREB promotes transcription in cells by recruitment of the co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP). The amount of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) was slightly reduced in RICH2 KO mice and thus the ratio of pCREB/CREB not significantly different between RICH2 KO and WT mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus, we conclude that amygdala activity of RICH2 KO mice is only increased in response to objects, and loss of RICH2 may impair the translation of synaptic activity into lasting synaptic alterations in the amygdala of mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While anxiety is a mental state elicited in anticipation of threat, phobia is a persistent, abnormal, and irrational fear of a specific thing or situation. The ability to regulate fear responses to initially threatening cues once the value of such cues changes is critical to emotional health (Cisler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>). This regulation can be achieved through a broad range of processes, such as learning that a stimulus does not pose a threat, and is key to survival. The amygdala plays an active role in this modulation of fear responses.</p>
<p>Our present work focuses on further characterizing the RICH2 KO mouse that has been reported to display neophobia (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>). RICH2 is a protein with RhoGAP activity. The Rho GTPases are a large sub group of small GTP binding proteins. RhoA, RAC1 and CDC42 are members of this family. The activity of these Rho GTPases is tightly regulated via the actions of several GAPs, GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) proteins (Koh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006/2007</xref>; Tcherkezian and Lamarche-Vane, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2007</xref>). In an <italic>in vitro</italic> study, it was shown that RICH2 is able to promote GTP hydrolysis and thus is able to theoretically inactivate RhoA, RAC1 and CDC42 (Raynaud et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2014</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic>, deletion of RICH2 has been associated with disinhibition of RAC1 in hippocampus and cerebellum of mice (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>), which was accompanied by spine enlargement, which is in line with the reported role of RAC1 in actin dynamics within dendritic spines (Nakayama et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2000</xref>; Tashiro and Yuste, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2004</xref>; Sarowar and Grabrucker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2016</xref>). RAC1 and CDC42 promote dendritic arbor growth, spine formation and maintenance whereas RhoA inhibits such activity (Newey et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>RICH2 is also expressed in the post-synaptic compartment in amygdala neurons. Here, focusing on amygdala, we have detected over-activation of RhoA in RICH2 KO mice. In line with this, RICH2 KO mouse display less mature spines in the amygdala along with an increase in thinner, immature spines.</p>
<p>However, we observed that more neurons of the amygdala were activated in RICH2 KO mice, evidenced by an increase of amygdala c-FOS staining, after exposure to novel objects. The increase in c-FOS positive neurons is correlated to an increased neuronal activity in this brain region, which might be caused by alterations in other brain regions of RICH2 KO mice, such as an increase in multi-spine synapses, increased NMDAR levels, and increased mESPC amplitude and area in hippocampal neurons of RICH2 KO mice (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>). Further, in cerebellum, an increase in multi-spine synapses was detected. Thus, given that the RICH2 KO mouse analyzed here is not an amygdala-specific conditional KO mouse, it may be possible that due to an increase in neuronal output in brain regions projecting into the amygdala, amygdala neurons of RICH2 mice show hyper-activation. Further, the lack of RICH2 in other brain areas may contribute to the neophobia of RICH2 KO mice.</p>
<p>Our findings are in line with previous reports showing that over-activation of the amygdala results in increased anxiety behaviors. In rodent models of anxiety, behavioral inhibition, a state characterized by increased vigilance and heightened autonomic arousal has been observed in response to novel environments and stimuli (Archer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1973</xref>). However, behavioral inhibition has also been reported in anxious children (Kagan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1988</xref>). Especially activation of neurons in the BLA is known to elicit freezing behavior (Power and McGaugh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2002</xref>), as seen increased in RICH2 KO mice.</p>
<p>In the amygdala, information can be processed by intrinsic networks but also through interactions with other brain regions to integrate sensory inputs, and ultimately generate fear response outputs. In particular, we detected increased neuronal activity in the BLA. The BLA consists of a majority of glutamatergic projection neurons, most likely expressing RICH2, and a minority of local GABAergic interneurons (McDonald, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Although other parallel inputs and outputs exist (Sah et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2003</xref>), one of the main flows of information within the amygdala follows a serial path in the direction of the main internuclear projections (Pitkänen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2000</xref>). There, the BLA serves as the major sensory interface, receiving sensory information from the thalamus and cortex. The medial subdivision of the CEm serves as the principal output station. Thus over-activation of the BLA may result from increased activity in upstream brain regions.</p>
<p>On behavioral level, we could confirm the phenotype observed previously (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>), where we could not detect elevated anxiety in general using an Elevated Plus Maze, or signs of decreased exploratory behavior. Exploratory behavior measured by the number of rearings was also comparable to WT mice. Additionally, using a Porsolt forced swim test, we have shown before that the RICH2 KO mice do not display decreased motivational levels (Sarowar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2016</xref>). Thus based on previous data and the results reported here, we conclude that RICH2 mice show a specific aversion to novel objects. The fear was not present, when novel odors were presented to RICH2 KO mouse. Further, we have not seen significant differences dependent on the shape of the object. Both, inorganic highly symmetrical shapes and also organic shapes (horse) elicited the same response. Upon presentation of a novel object, both the novel object and the already known object were avoided. This indicates that RICH2 KO mice do not habituate to objects presented in the open field during the duration of the experiments. This is in line with findings that taste neophobia evoked more c-FOS immunoreactivity than a familiar taste in the BLA (Lin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2012</xref>). However, in WT mice, once the taste becomes familiar, c-FOS signals normally decrease.</p>
<p>Thus, one reason for the development of neophobia in RICH2 mice may be a lack of synaptic plasticity necessary for learning to distinguish between threatening and neutral objects and the habituation towards novel stimuli. Due to RICH2 regulating RhoA signaling in the amygdala, the increased neuronal activation may not be translated into proper synaptic changes in the amygdala of RICH2 KO mice. Although more neurons are activated, the amount or activation status of the IEG ARC, c-FOS and CREB present in the amygdala of RICH2 is not increased accordingly, and thus, the average level/activity per active neuron may even be reduced. Indeed, it has been shown before that RhoA, RAC1 and CDC42 are implicated in regulating transcriptional activation by Serum Response Factors (SRF) in fibroblasts (Hill et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1995</xref>). In neurons, Megakaryoblasic Acute Leukemia-1 (MAL/MKL1) is regulated downstream of the RhoA signaling pathway. G-actin depletion releases MAL to translocate to the nucleus (Tabuchi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2005</xref>), where MAL binds SRF. <italic>Srf</italic> conditional brain specific knockout mice showed defects in spine morphology (Stritt and Knöll, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2010</xref>). Although it is unclear whether RhoA-SRF signaling may play a role in activity-dependent circuit rewiring in the amygdala glutamatergic neurons in association with plasticity, our results hint towards this possibility. Therefore, hyper activation of RhoA and the resulting inability to perform actin based synapse modifications, may ultimately prevent habituation to novel stimuli such as objects.</p>
<p>The specificity of the fear for objects may result from increased activation of neurons in brain regions delivering input coding for specific sensory modalities into the amygdala. This in turn implies that in WT mice under physiological conditions, the brain region specific activity of RICH2 for GTPases of the Rho family may provide a mechanism of crosstalk balancing activity between circuits connecting different brain regions.</p>
