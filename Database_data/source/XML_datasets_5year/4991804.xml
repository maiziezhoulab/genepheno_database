<abstract>
<p>Alternative pre-mRNA splicing expands the coding capacity of eukaryotic genomes, potentially enabling a limited number of genes to govern the development of complex anatomical structures. Alternative splicing is particularly prevalent in the vertebrate nervous system, where it is required for neuronal development and function. Here, we show that photoreceptor cells, a type of sensory neuron, express a characteristic splicing program that affects a broad set of transcripts and is initiated prior to the development of the light sensing outer segments. Surprisingly, photoreceptors lack prototypical neuronal splicing factors and their splicing profile is driven to a significant degree by the Musashi 1 (MSI1) protein. A striking feature of the photoreceptor splicing program are exons that display a "switch-like" pattern of high inclusion levels in photoreceptors and near complete exclusion outside of the retina. Several ubiquitously expressed genes that are involved in the biogenesis and function of primary cilia produce highly photoreceptor specific isoforms through use of such âswitch-likeâ exons. Our results suggest a potential role for alternative splicing in the development of photoreceptors and the conversion of their primary cilia to the light sensing outer segments.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Vertebrates possess extraordinarily complex nervous systems that are formed by hundreds of different types of neurons. This neuronal diversity is achieved in part through the expression of specific sets of genes. In addition, neurons use alternative splicing to a much higher degree than other cells to produce neuronal variants of broadly expressed proteins. Here we characterize the transcriptome of a single neuronal type, the vertebrate photoreceptors. We find that photoreceptors similar to other neurons utilize large number of alternative exons. Surprisingly, the splicing profile of photoreceptor cells and the factors that control it diverge from those of central nervous system and inner retinal neurons. We find multiple examples of genes producing photoreceptor specific splicing variants that completely replace the broadly expressed protein isoforms. Several of these genes participate in the formation of the primary cilium and the elaborated outer segments that are needed for light perception. Our work implies that alternative splicing may enable photoreceptors to acquire their characteristic shape and perform their light sensing function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vertebrate nervous systems contain numerous types of neurons with characteristic morphology, connectivity, electrophysiological properties, and neurotransmitter signatures. Single cell transcriptome profiling studies reveal dozens of distinct gene expression profiles in the central nervous system (CNS) and the retina, suggesting that neuronal cell identity is established and maintained by specific gene expression programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref001">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref005">5</xref>]. A limitation of the single cell approaches is the relatively low coverage of the transcriptome that is biased towards the 3'-end of the transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref006">6</xref>]. The depth and distribution of the reads produced by the current single cell transcriptome profiling approaches do not allow the reliable assessment of the levels of transcript isoforms produced by alternative splicing. Thus, the posttranscriptional layer in the regulation of gene expression in neurons, which is required for the normal development and function of the CNS, remains hidden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref007">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a major mechanism for generating protein diversity in vertebrates. In particular, neurons use alternative splicing for generating protein diversity to a significantly higher degree than any other cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref014">14</xref>]. Characteristically, neurons broadly utilize microexons that are defined by different groups as being no longer than 27nt or 51nt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref015">15</xref>]. The neuronal splicing program and the inclusion of neuronal microexons are governed by splicing factors belonging to several families of RNA binding proteins: PTBP, ELAVL, NOVA, KHDRBS, SRRM and RBFOX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref016">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref019">19</xref>]. With the exception of PTBP1, these proteins have high expression levels in neurons and are not expressed or have limited expression outside of the nervous system. PTBP1, which represses splicing of neuronal exons outside of the nervous system, is replaced by the PTBP2 in the early stages of neuronal differentiation.</p>
<p>Retinal photoreceptor cells provide an intriguing model to study how gene expression programs shape the cell structure and properties. Photoreceptors have a distinct morphology with a characteristic light sensing organelle termed the outer segment. The photoreceptor outer segment is a sensory cilium with an elaborate structure of membrane stacks. Surprisingly, the genes involved in the biogenesis and maintenance of the photoreceptor cilium are ubiquitously expressed in all ciliated cells. Recently, isoforms for two of these proteins, Arl6 (BBS3) and Ttc8 (BBS8), were shown to be preferentially expressed in photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref020">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref023">23</xref>]. The retinal variant of Arl6, a Ras related GTP-binding protein, is required for the survival of zebrafish photoreceptor cells and disruption of the gene in mice results in retinal defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref021">21</xref>]. These findings raise the possibility that photoreceptor cells are at least in part shaped by post-transcriptional processes such as alternative pre-mRNA splicing.</p>
<p>Here we use animal models to characterize in depth the alternative splicing profiles of photoreceptor cells, a sensory neuron type. We find that photoreceptors express a characteristic splicing program that includes a set of highly photoreceptor-specific isoforms. Surprisingly, key neuronal splicing regulators are either not expressed or downregulated in photoreceptor cells. We show that Musashi 1 (MSI1) promotes the splicing of photoreceptor specific exons as part of a combinatorial mechanism that controls splicing in photoreceptor cells.</p>

<title>Isolation the photoreceptor transcriptome</title>
<p>To identify the features of the retina transcriptome that are specific to photoreceptor cells we analyzed the transcriptomes of retina samples from wild type and Aipl1 knockout mice by RNA-Seq. AIPL1 is a molecular chaperone that is required for photoreceptor survival and by postnatal day 30, the retina of Aipl1(-/-) mice is devoid of photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref024">24</xref>].

In a comparison between the transcriptomes of Aipl1(-/-) and wild type retina, transcripts with higher expression levels in photoreceptors will appear downregulated in the Aipl1(-/-) sample due to the altered cell composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Conversely, transcripts expressed at higher levels in the inner neurons will show elevated expression levels in the Aipl1 knockout retina.</p>

<p>We validated our approach by performing gene level expression analysis and tracking the levels of transcripts specific to photoreceptors. We identified 5377 genes with more than 2 fold difference in their expression level between Aipl1(-/-) and wild type retina (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s009">S1 Table</xref>). In the Aipl1 knockout, we observed loss of genes known to encode photoreceptor-specific transcription factors, (e.g. NR2E3, NRL), proteins involved in phototransduction, (e.g. RHO, CNGA1, PDE6B), and photoreceptor morphogenesis (e.g. PRPH2, ROM1, FSCN2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s009">S1 Table</xref>). The genes with higher expression in the wild type retina compared to the Aipl1 knockout, showed enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) categories directly related to photoreceptor development, structure and function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s010">S2A and S2B Table</xref>). This enrichment is consistent with the loss of photoreceptor cells in the Aipl1 knockout. The genes with lower expression levels in the wild type retina were part of broad GO categories related to organ development, neuronal cell structure and function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s010">S2A and S2C Table</xref>). Thus, the gene level expression data demonstrates that comparing the retinal transcriptome of Aipl1 knockout with that of the wild type retina correctly identifies the transcripts characteristic to photoreceptors.</p>

<p>We next determined the inclusion levels of alternative exons in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s011">S3 Table</xref>). Hierarchical clustering shows that the retinal samples form a separate cluster with a splicing profile in part related to that of other neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Similar to central nervous system samples, the retina utilizes a significant number of microexons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We analyzed the differences in exon inclusion levels between the wild type retina the retina of the Aipl1 knockout. Approximately 40% of the differentially spliced exons between wild type and Aipl1 knockout retina were not annotated in the GRCm38 mouse genome assembly. The large number of novel exons prompted us to use Cufflinks to carry out guided transcriptome assembly based on the ENSEMBL GRCm38 annotation and our RNA-Seq data. We then repeated the analysis of the differential splicing using the updated annotation and identified 540 differentially spliced exons in 372 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s011">S3 Table</xref>). Of these, 318 exons showed higher inclusion levels in wild type retina and 222 had lower inclusion levels. Alternative exons in the Bsg and Ttc8 (Bbs8) genes that are known to be used exclusively in photoreceptors were among the exons with higher inclusion levels in wild type retina, verifying that our approach correctly identifies photoreceptor-specific exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref025">25</xref>]. We used RT-PCR to test 18 alternative exons that showed differences in inclusion level between 10% and 90% in our RNA-Seq data. All differences in exon inclusion level that were predicted by RNA-Seq were confirmed by the RT-PCR experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Exons in multiple genes such as Cep290, Cc2d2a, Cacna2d4, Prom1 and Kif1b showed large differences in inclusion levels between the wild type and Aipl1(-/-) retina consistent with a âswitch-likeâ splicing pattern. Similar to the Bsg and Ttc8 exons, these âswitch-likeâ exons appear to be included at high levels in photoreceptors and skipped in all other tissues we examined (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g002">2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The photoreceptor splicing pattern we inferred may be due in part to splicing changes in the neurons of Aipl1(-/-) retina in response to the loss of the photoreceptors. To rule out this scenario we analyzed by RT-PCR the inclusion levels of 18 alternative exons in flow sorted rod photoreceptors. The inclusion levels of the majority of the tested exons in rod photoreceptors (17 out of 18) were in concordance with the inferred photoreceptor splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). As expected, the levels of the predicted photoreceptor-specific variants were higher in the isolated photoreceptors compared to the whole retina sample, where the signal is derived from a mixed cell population.</p>
<p>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the mouse tissue panel based on the inclusion levels of the exons differentially spliced in photoreceptors places the retina along with the other neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In this clustering the profile of the Aipl1(-/-) retina is more closely related to that of the CNS samples than the wild type retina. The expression of a distinct splicing profile by the photoreceptor cells is likely responsible for the separation of the Aipl1 knockouts from the cluster containing the wild type retinal samples.</p>
<p>As cone photoreceptors comprise only 3% of the retina, it was unclear if the splicing profile we discovered is shared between photoreceptors of different types or if it is specific to rod photoreceptors. To determine if rods and cones share the same splicing program we analyzed the splicing in the retina of Nrl knockout mice by RT-PCR. Disruption of Nrl, a rod-specific transcription factor leads to the conversion of all rod photoreceptors into cone like cells that present the characteristic ultrastructural, histological, molecular and electrophysiological features of cone photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref027">27</xref>]. All tested exons, with exception of an exon in the Glb1l2 (Galactosidase, Beta 1-Like 2) gene, showed identical inclusion levels in the wild type and Nrl knockout retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Thus, rods and cones share largely the same splicing program.</p>
<p>We next carried out gene ontology enrichment analysis to determine if alternative splicing in photoreceptors modifies particular processes or cellular components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s012">S4 Table</xref>). Several of the enriched categories point to a significant impact of alternative splicing on the cytoskeleton of photoreceptor cells. Apart from the cytoskeleton we see enrichment of genes in broadly defined categories that are partially related to cell differentiation and neurogenesis, demonstrating that alternative splicing modifies multiple systems and processes in the photoreceptor cells.</p>

<title>The photoreceptor splicing program is executed prior to photoreceptor morphogenesis</title>
<p>To gain insight into the developmental mechanisms that control splicing in photoreceptors, we analyzed exon inclusion levels in a panel of published retinal RNA-Seq datasets from wild type mice and genetic models that disrupt normal photoreceptor development. In addition to the Aipl1 and Nrl knockouts described above, these models include a Crx knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref028">28</xref>], a Crx-dominant negative (Crx-DN) mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref029">29</xref>], and the RD10 mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref030">30</xref>]. Deletion of Crx or expression of the CRX-DN protein block the transcription of the genes involved in phototransduction and the development of the outer segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref031">31</xref>]. The RD10 mutant, similar to the Aipl1 knockout, loses its photoreceptors in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref030">30</xref>]. The wild type samples included retina from postnatal day 2, which contain early post-mitotic rod photoreceptor progenitors, and fully developed retina from juvenile and adult animals (postnatal days 21 and 50).</p>
<p>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the exons differentially spliced in photoreceptors revealed two major clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). One cluster is formed by samples derived from the Aipl1 knockout and the RD10 mutant retinas, both devoid of photoreceptor cells, and includes the postnatal day 2 retina samples. A second cluster is formed by the adult wild type retina, the Nrl and Crx knockouts, and the Crx-DN mutant. This clustering of the Crx knockout and Crx-DN mutant, which do not form mature photoreceptors, with the wild type retina shows that the alternative splicing in photoreceptors is controlled independently of the known transcriptional regulators of photoreceptor morphogenesis.</p>

<p>At postnatal day 2 the rod photoreceptors are at the stage of immature progenitors. Interestingly, the splicing profile of the postnatal day 2 retina does not cluster with the samples containing undeveloped photoreceptors that are derived from Crx knockout and Crx-DN retinas at postnatal day 21. The segregation of the postnatal day 2 retina from the juvenile Crx knockout and Crx-DN retina suggests that the photoreceptor splicing program is established in the post-mitotic photoreceptor progenitors prior to morphogenesis of the outer segment. To characterize the temporal control of alternative splicing during photoreceptor differentiation we analyzed by RT-PCR the inclusion levels of four photoreceptor specific exons in the Ttc8, Prom1, Cep290 and Cc2d2a genes between postnatal days 0 and 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). All four exons showed low levels of exon inclusion between postnatal day 0 and postnatal day 2. The inclusion levels of the four exons steadily increase thereafter, reaching half maximum at postnatal day 8, when the photoreceptor outer segments begin to develop. Thus, the shift towards photoreceptor specific isoform expression is initiated in the postmitotic photoreceptor progenitors in advance of the final stages of photoreceptor cell morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref032">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref034">34</xref>].</p>

<title>Motifs for several RNA binding proteins are enriched in proximity to exons differentially spliced in photoreceptors</title>
<p>To determine if a specific subset of splicing regulators bind in proximity to the exons differentially spliced in photoreceptors we performed motif enrichment analysis. For this purpose we used the position weight matrices (PWM) from the Cis-BP-RNA database that describe the sites recognized by RNA binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref035">35</xref>]. As these matrices are derived by aligning 7-mers, they fail to represent the true binding site for certain RNA binding proteins that recognize significantly shorter, 3 to 4 nucleotides long, sequences. To correct this deficiency we substituted the matrices for PTBP, NOVA, MBNL and MSI proteins with matrices corresponding to the sequences recognized by their RNA binding domains, i.e. YCU/UCY for PTBP, YCAY for NOVA, YGCY for MBNL, and UAG for MSI1.</p>
<p>Intronic sequences surrounding the differentially spliced exons showed enrichment of binding sites for several RNA binding proteins compared to the sequences surrounding exons whose inclusion levels were the same in wild type and Aipl1 knockout retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s013">S5 Table</xref>). We observed enrichment of RBFOX and EIF2S1 binding sites, and marginal, but statistically significant enrichment of Nova binding sites downstream of exons with lower inclusion levels in photoreceptors. The enrichment of binding sites for the cytoplasmic EIF2S1 protein is likely due to similarity of the sequence it recognizes (WGCAUG) to the binding site of the RBFOX splicing factors (UGCAUG). Weak, but statistically significant enrichment of PTBP binding sites was observed upstream of all differentially spliced exons, regardless if they were included at higher rate or skipped at higher rate in photoreceptors compared to inner neurons. Musashi binding sites were enriched downstream of exons with higher inclusion levels in photoreceptors. ELAVL binding sites were partially depleted in exons with higher inclusion levels in photoreceptors and enriched in exons with lower inclusion levels in photoreceptors. Exons that had lower inclusion levels in photoreceptors showed enrichment of binding sites recognized by the KHDRBS, A1CF, LIN28, MEX3 and RBM41 proteins, all of which bind to A/U rich sequences. Binding sites for two SR proteins, SRSF2 and SRSF9, which recognize G/A rich sequences, were depleted in these exons.</p>

Thus, we tested if a higher number of PTBP, NOVA, MBNL and MSI motifs are found in clusters located in proximity to the exons that are differentially spliced in photoreceptors. PTBP binding sites in clusters containing at least 5 motifs spaced by less than 2 nucleotides were significantly enriched upstream of all differentially spliced exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s004">S4</xref> Figs). Such clustering of PTBP motifs is consistent with the well characterized mode of binding of the PTBP proteins to RNA. MSI binding sites in clusters containing at least three UAG motifs spaced by 10 to 15 nucleotides were enriched up to 8 fold downstream of the exons with elevated inclusion levels in photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

NOVA binding sites were also enriched in clusters downstream of exons with lower inclusion levels in photoreceptors compared to inner neurons.

<p>We used immunofluorescence staining to characterize the distribution of RBFOX, NOVA, PTBP, KHDRBS, and ELAVL proteins in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). We were unable to test SRRM4 due to the lack of antibodies suitable for immunofluorescence. In agreement with the RNA-Seq data, RBFOX and NOVA1 proteins were not expressed in the photoreceptor cells`. The RBFOX and NOVA proteins act as splicing activators when bound downstream of alternative exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref041">41</xref>]. Thus, the lack of RBFOX and NOVA expression in photoreceptors is consistent with the enrichment of their binding sites downstream of the exons with lower inclusion levels in photoreceptors compared to inner neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>The PTBP proteins show the expected expression pattern with PTBP1 present in the nuclei of Mueller glia cells, while PTBP2 is expressed in the neurons and photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The absence of PTBP1 from the retinal neurons and photoreceptors releases the splicing of alternative exons carrying PTBP binding sites within the upstream intron. These exons can then be included at different level depending on the cell type, explaining the enrichment of PTBP1 binding sites upstream of exons that can be either up- or down- regulated in photoreceptors compared to inner neurons.</p>
<p>The ELAVL (Hu) proteins are expressed throughout the retina, with lower levels in photoreceptors, consistent with the expression differences determined by RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>The KHDRBS family of RNA binding proteins includes the ubiquitously expressed KHDRBS1 (Sam68), and two orthologues, KHDRBS2 (Slm1) and KHDRBS3 (SLM2, T-STAR), which in the CNS are expressed in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref042">42</xref>]. Consistent with its ubiquitous expression, KHDRBS1 can be detected thought the retina. In contrast, the KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 proteins were expressed only in the neurons of the inner retina, but not in photoreceptors. The KHRDBS3 protein expression is most likely suppressed posttranscriptionally as the KHDRBS3 mRNA levels are uniform throughout the retina (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006256.t001">Table 1</xref>). Accordingly, the 3'-UTR of KHDRBS3 contains conserved binding sites for microRNAs from the miR-96/miR-182/miR-183 cluster which is expressed in photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref043">43</xref>]. The enrichment of KHDRBS binding sites in the downregulated exons is consistent with at least one previous report showing that KHDRBS3 binds to exonic splicing enhancers to activate exon inclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref044">44</xref>].</p>

<title>The Musashi proteins directly regulate splicing</title>
<p>MSI binding site enrichment in the downstream intron is associated with increased inclusion levels of the alternative exons in photoreceptors. The MS1 and MSI2 proteins are expressed throughout the retina and consistent with previous reports show mostly cytoplasmic localization in the inner neuronal layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref045">45</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref047">47</xref>]. As an adaptation to low light environment, the heterochromatin of mouse rod photoreceptors is packed in the center of the nucleus and the nucleoplasm is pushed to the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref049">49</xref>]. This morphology makes DNA staining unsuitable for identifying the boundaries of the nucleus. Thus, to determine if the Musashi proteins are present in the nuclei of photoreceptors, where they can regulate splicing, we decorated the nuclear envelope with anti-Lamin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). The Lamin staining of 4Î¼m retinal sections showed that MSI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g005">Fig 5</xref>) and to lesser degree MSI2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s006">S6A Fig</xref>) are present in the nuclei of photoreceptor cells, where they are located in the periphery and are excluded from the heterochromatin core. We also examined the localization of the Musashi proteins in the photoreceptors of Nrl(-/-) mice. The nuclear morphology of the photoreceptors of these mice makes it easier to distinguish the nuclear and peri-nuclear compartments by fluorescent microscopy. Similar to the wild type retina, high levels of MSI1 protein were observed in the nuclei of photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). MSI2 can also be detected in the photoreceptor nuclei, albeit its levels are higher in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s006">S6C Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To test if the Musashi proteins can promote inclusion of an alternative exon when bound downstream of it we used a splicing reporter that has two lambda phage BoxB RNA hairpins engineered downstream of an artificial alternative exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref050">50</xref>]. The loop of the BoxB hairpin is specifically bound by the lambda N-peptide. Consequently, proteins tagged with the lambda N-peptide are tethered to the BoxB elements on the reporter pre-mRNA. Cotransfection of the reporter with Musashi lambda-N fusions increased inclusion of the reporter exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). The effect of Musashi on splicing is completely abolished in a reporter containing G to A point mutations in the two BoxB elements that disrupt binding of the lambda-N peptide. To test if the effect of MSI1-lamda-N fusion is specific we cotransfected the BoxB reporter with lambda-N fusions for three well characterized splicing factors, PTBP1, SRSF4 and TRA2B. None of these splicing factors increased the inclusion level of the test exon when tethered downstream of it, demonstrating that this is an effect specific to the MSI1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s007">S7C Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>The Musashi proteins promote Ttc8 exon 2A inclusion in photoreceptors</title>
<p>To determine if the Musashi proteins regulate splicing in photoreceptors we turned to the photoreceptor specific exon 2A in the Ttc8 (Bbs8) gene. We previously mapped two 100nt sequence segments in the introns immediately adjacent to exon 2A that act in concert to promote the splicing of this exon in photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref023">23</xref>]. Deletion mutagenesis showed that these segments contain multiple redundant cis-acting sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref023">23</xref>]. The D4 segment located immediately downstream of exon 2A carries two clusters of Musashi binding sites, each containing three UAG motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Within 320nt of the downstream intron immediately adjacent to exon 2A we find two more clusters containing three and four UAG motifs, respectively. In contrast, the 350nt section of the intron immediately upstream of exon 2A contains four Musashi binding sites, approximately the number of UAG triples that would be expected in random sequence of this size. To determine if the Musashi proteins can bind specifically to the D4 segment we used biotinylated RNA corresponding to this element to pull-down RNA binding proteins from retinal extracts. We also performed the pull-down with the other regulatory element, D3, and with segment D2, which is not required for splicing of exon 2A in photoreceptors. The binding was competed with non-biotinylated RNA, either of the same sequence or different sequence of the same length. In this pulldown experiment the Musashi proteins bind specifically to segment D4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). In contrast, segments D2 and D3, each of which contains a single UAG motif, had low affinity for the Musashi proteins and the binding was completely blocked by competitor RNA.</p>

Relative exon inclusion levels with standard error are shown below each lane. The minigene is designed to produce GFP when the alternative exon is skipped or RFP when the exon is included. The wild type minigene is shown on the right. High RFP and low GFP expression in the photoreceptors indicates that the exon is included in the mature transcripts from the minigene. The inner neurons, marked with yellow arrows, express almost exclusively GFP, an indication that the exon is skipped.

<p>To determine how MSI1 binding downstream of exon 2A affects its inclusion levels in the retina we used a reporter minigene designed to produce GFP when the exon is skipped and RFP when the exon is included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref051">51</xref>]. We mutated all 15 Musashi binding sites in the downstream intron of the minigene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Both the wild type and mutant minigenes were co-transfected with MSI1 expression construct in N2A cells. MSI1 promoted the inclusion of the wild type exon 2A but had no effect on the mutant minigene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g007">Fig 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). To determine if the MSI binding sites are required for splicing of Ttc8 exon 2A in photoreceptor cells, we electroporated the wild type and mutant minigenes in the retina of neonate mice. We allowed the photoreceptors to develop and analyzed the splicing of the minigene transcripts in the retina by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence at postnatal days 16 and 20, respectively. As we have shown previously, the wild type Ttc8 exon 2A is included at high levels (98%) in the photoreceptors and is excluded from the mature transcripts in the inner neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g007">Fig 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s007">S7B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref023">23</xref>]. Consistent with a role for MSI1 in directing splicing in photoreceptors, the inclusion level of exon 2A in the transcripts of the mutant minigene was reduced to approximately 38%.</p>

<title>MSI1 promotes the inclusion of photoreceptor specific exons</title>
<p>The enrichment of Musashi binding sites downstream of exons with elevated inclusion levels in photoreceptors suggests that multiple alternative exons should be regulated by the Musashi proteins in addition to Ttc8 exon 2A. To test this prediction, we expressed flag-tagged MSI1 in N2A cells and analyzed by RT-PCR the splicing of eleven endogenous transcripts containing exons with elevated inclusion levels in photoreceptors. MSI1 caused statistically significant increase in the inclusion levels of seven of the eleven exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Inclusion levels of five of these exons, including Ttc8 exon 2A of the endogenous Ttc8 gene, increased by at least 10% in response to MSI1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The smaller amplitude of the effect of Msi1 transfection on the inclusion levels of the endogenous Ttc8 exon 2A compared to the minigene transcripts is likely due to the transfection efficiency, which was approximately 40% in these experiments. Among the exons coordinately regulated by the MSI1 are four âswitch-likeâ exons in Ttc8, Cep290, Cc2d2a and Prom1. All four genes encode ubiquitously expressed proteins that are involved in ciliary biogenesis and function. Ttc8, Cep290, Cc2d2a and Prom1 are also required for the development and maintenance of the photoreceptor outer segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref052">52</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref054">54</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The lack of comprehensive gene expression profiles of defined neuronal subtypes is a major obstacle to understanding how the neuronal diversity of the vertebrate CNS is established. To delineate the gene expression and alternative splicing programs of a single neuronal subtype we turned to the vertebrate retina. The high abundance of rod photoreceptors in the mouse retina allowed us to isolate the characteristic features of their transcriptome by comparing the Aipl1 knockout model of retinal degeneration to wild type mice.</p>
<p>The deduced splicing profile of photoreceptor cells is related to the spicing profiles of retinal and CNS neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006256.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Alternative splicing in neurons is known to be regulated by SRRM4 and members of the PTBP, RBFOX, KHDRBS, NOVA and ELAVL families of RNA binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref016">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref019">19</xref>]. Strikingly, photoreceptors do not express RBFOX, NOVA, KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 proteins, express lower amounts of ELAVL proteins and have markedly lower Srrm4 transcript levels. In light of these data, the switch from PTBP1 to PTBP2 expression during development emerges as a major determinant of the alternative splicing program that is shared between neurons and photoreceptor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>In the absence of a âmasterâ regulator of splicing specific to photoreceptors, the characteristic splicing program of these cells is likely determined by a unique combination of splicing factors with broader expression.</p>
<p>We show that Musashi 1 (MSI1) promotes the splicing of exons with elevated inclusion levels in photoreceptors. The Musashi proteins are notable for their expression in stem cells, where they are involved in stem cell maintenance and cell fate determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref057">57</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref059">59</xref>]. The best characterized function of Musashi is the regulation of mRNA stability and translation through binding to the 3â-UTR of the target transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref058">58</xref>]. In the retina, the subcellular localization of the Musashi proteins varies during development and in mature neurons the two proteins are confined to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g004">Fig 4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref045">45</xref>]. Here we show that MSI1 is present not only in the cytoplasm but is also abundant in the nuclei of photoreceptor cells, where it controls alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Our findings contrast recent studies of the Musashi activity in the central nervous system and glioblastoma, where the cytoplasmic localization of the Musashi proteins confines their function to control of mRNA stability and translation and limits their impact on splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref061">61</xref>]. Control of the subcellular localization of MSI1 provides a mechanism that can produce the characteristic splicing program of photoreceptors in the absence of a photoreceptor-specific RNA binding protein. Similar mechanisms that involve redistribution of RNA binding proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm are known to control alternative splicing in response to external stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref062">62</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref064">64</xref>]. While playing a significant role in promoting inclusion of photoreceptor specific exons, MSI1 is clearly not the sole determinant of the photoreceptor specific splicing program. The absence from photoreceptors of the RBFOX, NOVA and KHDRBS2/3 proteins also contributes to the differences in alternative splicing between photoreceptors and neurons as indicated by our motif enrichment analysis. Our results suggest that the characteristic splicing program of the photoreceptor cells may be determined by a unique suite
of splicing factors with broader expression that can combinatorically form different exon recognition complexes depending on the sequence of the underlying RNA substrate. Such combinatorial control of splicing is a well-established paradigm and was recently demonstrated to control "switch-like" splicing events during reprograming of primary fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref066">66</xref>]. Further research will be needed to directly demonstrate the combinatorial control of the inclusion of photoreceptor specific exons and identify the factors beyond MSI1 that are involved in this process.</p>
<p>At present it is unclear how most of the alternative exons we identified affect protein function or to what degree alternative splicing shapes the properties of the photoreceptor cells. One exception is the 14nt exon 8 in the Arl6 (BBS3) gene, which has high inclusion levels in photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g001">Fig 1</xref>). ARL6, a Ras family GTP-binding protein, is part of a network of proteins involved in the development and maintenance of primary cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). The exon 8 containing isoform of ARL6 is required for normal vision in zebra fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref021">21</xref>]. The vision phenotype of mice lacking Arl6 exon 8 has not been reported in detail, however gross histological examination and immunofluorescent staining of the retina show that the inner segments of photoreceptors are disorganized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref021">21</xref>]. Several other components of the protein network that ARL6 is part of are also differentially spliced in photoreceptors. Four of these genes, Cep290, Cc2d2a, Ttc8 and Prom1 contain âswitch-likeâ exons that produce isoforms highly specific to photoreceptors (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g008">8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g001">1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref023">23</xref>]. Strikingly, the splicing of these âswitch-likeâ exons is coordinately regulated in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006256.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) and their inclusion is promoted by MSI1.</p>
<p>The photoreceptor splicing program is activated in the postmitotic progenitors, prior to the onset of outer segment development. A transcription factor cascade starting from Crx homeobox protein that is critical for photoreceptor morphogenesis is also activated during the same developmental time frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref068">68</xref>]. Interestingly, alternative splicing in photoreceptors is not affected in the Crx knockout animals and in the Crx dominant negative mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006256.ref029">29</xref>]. Thus, the developmental switch to photoreceptor specific splicing is independent of the established transcriptional mechanism that activates the expression of photoreceptor specific genes.</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrate that photoreceptors express a characteristic splicing program that encompasses hundreds of alternative exons and affects the transcripts of multiple genes that are critical for vision.</p>

Binding sites carrying at least 90% match to the scoring matrices were counted in the exons and in 200nt segments of the introns immediately adjacent to the exon. Binding sites for orthologues recognizing highly similar sequences, e.g. RBFOX1, 2 and 3 proteins, KHDRBS1, 2 and 3 proteins, etc. were pooled together. Binding that overlap by more than 50% were counted as a single site. Two single tailed hypergeometric tests were used to determine the significance of the binding site enrichment/depletion in each segment. The hypergeometric test p-values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hohberg's procedure. To assess if there is an enrichment of clustered binding sites, the analysis for MSI, PTBP, ELAVL and NOVA was repeated after excluding the binding sites not located within a cluster. Clusters were defined by two parameters: minimum number of binding sites necessary to form a cluster, ranging from 2 to 5; and the maximum spacing between them, ranging from 0nt to 30nt. The enrichment analysis was carried out for each pair of minimum binding site count and maximum spacing parameters.</p>

Western blot (right), shows abundant expression of all four fusions. The expected band for each fusion is indicated by an asterisk.</p>

<title>New exon discovery within MATS.</title>
<p>Junction reads that map on one end of an exon in annotated transcripts are used to identify novel exons. A novel exon is defined by two sets of junction reads of at least 10 reads per set, one anchored on the left and a second one anchored on the right to a known exon, that map within a predefined distance (300nt) from each other.</p>
