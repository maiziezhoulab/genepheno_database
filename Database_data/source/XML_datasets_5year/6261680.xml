<p id="P3">Genetic analyses have linked MicroRNA-137 (<italic>MIR137</italic>) to neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). MiR-137 plays important roles in neurogenesis and neuronal maturation, but the impact of miR-137 loss of function <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unclear. Here we show the complete loss of miR-137 in the mouse germline (gKO) or nervous system (cKO) leads to postnatal lethality, while heterozygous gKO and cKO mice remain viable. Partial loss of miR-137 in heterozygous cKO mice results in dysregulated synaptic plasticity, repetitive behavior, and impaired learning and social behavior. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that the miR-137 mRNA target, Phosphodiesterase 10a (Pde10a), is elevated in heterozygous KO mice. Treatment with the PDE10A inhibitor papaverine or knockdown of Pde10a ameliorates the deficits observed in the heterozygous cKO mice. Collectively, our results suggest that <italic>MIR137</italic> plays essential roles in postnatal neurodevelopment, and that dysregulation of miR-137 potentially contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous and non-coding single-stranded ~22-nucleotide RNAs, many of which are evolutionarily conserved. Based on sequence complementarities, miRNAs target mRNAs and regulate posttranscriptional gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. With a high degree of spatial and temporal specificity, miRNAs regulate neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and circadian rhythm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Thus, miRNAs could orchestrate neuronal development and plasticity by modulating complex gene networks. The perturbation of miRNA expression could potentially contribute to the etiology of human diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p id="P5">Previous meta-analyses combining genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from 17 separate studies identified a locus on chromosome 1p21.3 to be highly associated with schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. MIR137 resides in this locus, which encodes microRNA-137 (miR-137). Intriguingly four other loci achieving genome-wide significance identified in the same studies contain the genes predicted to be regulated by miR-137. Moreover, <italic>MIR137</italic> is also associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD); such as in a large-scale copy number variation (CNV) analyses of ASD patients, the risk pathogenic CNV overlap with the loci containing <italic>MIR137</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Besides schizophrenia and ASD, <italic>MIR137</italic> has been linked to bipolar disorder as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. These findings together suggest that miR-137 contributes to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, whether the dysregulation of miR-137 leads directly to the phenotypes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders remains to be determined.</p>
<p id="P6">Previously published works have demonstrated the critical roles of miR-137 in neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, and dendritic morphogenesis during neurodevelopment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. More recently, using induced human neurons, the overexpression of miR-137 impairs synaptic plasticity and learning and memory in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The minor allele associated with schizophrenia can increase <italic>MIR137</italic> expression, suggesting that miR-137 gain of function might be associated with this disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, little is known about the <italic>in vivo</italic> impact of the loss of miR-137, which is critical given that the microdeletions of <italic>MIR137</italic> are linked to ASD in multiple reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">In this study, we generated a miR-137 conditional allele to investigate the impact of miR-137 loss of function <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that miR-137 is critical for postnatal mouse development. Partial loss of miR-137 leads to the dysregulation of synaptic plasticity, altered repetitive or stereotyped behaviors, and impaired sociability/social novelty preference. Combining large-scale proteomic analyses with gene expression profiling identified the mRNAs that miR-137 post-transcriptionally regulates. By overlapping with the known genes linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, we found a significant enrichment of ASD-associated genes among miR-137 targets. One of the miR-137 mRNA targets, Phosphodiesterase 10a (PDE10A), is significantly upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic> upon partial loss of miR-137. A specific PDE10A inhibitor, papaverine, can ameliorate the deficits associated with the partial loss of miR-137. Additional shRNA-mediated knockdown of Pde10a results in similar rescue effects, supporting that the increased expression of Pde10a is responsible for the observed abnormalities. These results together highlight the critical roles of <italic>MIR137</italic> in postnatal neurodevelopment and suggest that the dysregulation of miR-137 contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.</p>

<title>Loss of miR-137 in germline and nervous system leads to postnatal lethality</title>
<p id="P8">To generate miR-137 knockout mice, we designed a targeting vector to disrupt the <italic>Mir137</italic> gene via homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells, where two loxP sites were inserted upstream (~2 kb) and downstream (~0.6 kb) of the <italic>Mir137</italic> gene, and derived mice carried the floxed allele of miR-137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). By crossing with either Zp3-Cre or Nestin-Cre line, we deleted <italic>Mir137</italic> in the germline or nervous system and generated the heterozygous miR-137 global knockout (gKO) and conditional knockout (cKO) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). MiR-137 wild-type (<italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> or <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup>), heterozygous (<italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/–</italic></sup> or <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic>) and homozygous (<italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> or <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic>) mice were used in our following analyses. We found significantly reduced levels of mature miR-137 in the brain upon the loss of <italic>Mir137</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The deletion of <italic>Mir-137</italic> did not affect the expression of an adjacent gene, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (<italic>Dpyd</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). The complete loss of miR-137 (gKO) resulted in postnatal lethality in <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> mice, which survived up to postnatal day 21 (P21), while the partial loss of miR-137 did not affect the survival rate of <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/–</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). Comparing to <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates, <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/–</italic></sup> mice showed few differences in body and brain weight; while the body and brain weights were significantly decreased in <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">To examine whether the loss of miR-137 resulted in impaired embryonic and early postnatal development, we performed timed mating using heterozygous mice. We collected embryos at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) and found few morphological differences among <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>, <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/–</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). At the early postnatal stage (P0), <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> mice were similar in terms of size and weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), but the differences were usually observed as early as P7 (data not shown), suggesting a postnatal effect of miR-137 loss-of-function. At P14 the major organs (heart, liver, lung, and kidney) of <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> mice are smaller than those of their <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/–</italic></sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Major organ sections stained with H&amp;E (haematoxylin and eosin) showed no apparent morphological differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">In miR-137 cKO mice, miR-137 was deleted specifically in the nervous system to more accurately reflect the neuronal phenotype; we found the mature miR-137 expression in brain significantly reduced in <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice compared to the littermate control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Also, we observed similar postnatal lethality in homozygous miR-137 cKO (<italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic>) mice during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), strongly suggesting that the phenotypes in miR-137 gKO mice are from the loss of miR-137 in the nervous system. Therefore, we mainly focused on using miR-137 cKO mice to understand the <italic>in vivo</italic> roles of miR-137 in the brain.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Loss of miR-137 results in the dysregulation of synaptic plasticity</title>
<p id="P11">PSD-95 and Synaptophysin immunohistochemistry staining was performed using hippocampal or cortical tissues from miR-137 cKO mice at the age of P18 to determine whether the loss of miR-137 influences synaptic growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. We observed in both hippocampal and cortical tissues, the relative fluorescence intensities and protein levels of PSD-95 and Synaptophysin increased in <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice when compared to their <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup> siblings, indicating the overgrowth of synapse upon loss of miR-137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a–c</xref>). Also, we performed the Caspase-3 staining in brain sections of miR-137 cKO mice at different developmental stages (P0, P18, and P60), but did not see any significant change in Caspase-3 expression between <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice, indicating that partial loss of miR-137 has limited impact on neuronal viability/apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). To further examine the spine structure <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed Golgi staining in <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice and analyzed their dendritic spines in the hippocampal CA1 region. The spine densities of basal and apical spines were significantly increased in the <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice compared to the littermate control, indicating the loss of miR-137 results in synaptic pruning deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).

<title>Partial loss of miR-137 leads to the deficits in learning and memory</title>
<p id="P12">Given the link of miR-137 to neuropsychiatric disorders, we then determined whether the loss of miR-137 led to any behavioral abnormalities relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. We subjected miR-137 cKO/gKO mice to a battery of behavioral tests. Due to the postnatal lethality of the complete loss of miR-137, we focused on 2- to 3-month-old wildtype and heterozygotic miR-137 cKO/gKO mice.</p>
<p id="P13">Previous reports indicate that overexpression of miR-137 in the dentate gyrus impairs hippocampus-dependent learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We therefore asked whether the loss of miR-137 would also alter learning and memory in our miR-137 knockout mice. First, we performed the Morris water maze test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a–d</xref>). During the training phase of four trials per day for four successive days, although both <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice showed improved latency to the platform, <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice exhibited a significant delay in finding the platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). There was no significant difference in swimming speeds between the two groups of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In the subsequent probe test phase, <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice exhibited significantly higher latency to targets and fewer target crossings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). Consistently we observed similar changes in miR-137 gKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a–d</xref>). To further assess the impaired spatial learning and memory deficit in miR-137 cKO and gKO mice, we performed Barnes maze test. Mice received training in the Barnes maze for four consecutive days, consisting of four trials per day to find the hiding box. We found that both <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/–</italic></sup> mice failed to diminish the latency of the first entry to the hiding box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>).

<p id="P14">With these observed hippocampus-dependent learning deficits, we further investigated the effect of miR-137 deficiency in neuronal plasticity.

The electrophysiological results indicate that miR-137 plays vital roles in maintaining the normal synaptic plasticity. Together, these data suggest that the loss of miR-137 results in the deficits of learning and memory. Prior studies found that the overexpression of miR-137 could result in impaired learning and memory as well, indicating that miR-137-mediated regulation could be dosage-dependent.</p>

The GO analyses showed that the upregulated proteins (<italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> / <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>) were significantly involved in DNA replication, nervous system development, and chromatin remodeling while the downregulated proteins were enriched in the genes that play important roles in peptidase activity regulation, acute-phase response, and regulation of neurotransmitter secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The interactome analysis using the selected DE genes revealed a complex gene regulatory network, suggesting that these DE genes might be associated with each other and result in dysfunction upon loss of miR-137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>).

We found that those upregulated DE genes significantly associated with miR-137 predicted targets (Pearson’s chi-square test, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.0001).

<p id="P22">We then explored whether miR-137 targets the known candidate genes of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Notably, we found that the upregulated ASD candidate genes were significantly associated with miR-137 predicted targets, suggesting that miR-137 may play essential roles in ASD by directly regulating the genes involved in ASD. Given the potential impact of miR-137 in ASD, we generated a predicted ASD-gene network to explore brain-specific interactions between ASD candidate genes, including the 15 upregulated and 16 downregulated DE proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). In the predicted network, we found the upregulated miR-137-predicted targets potentially influence the adjacent ASD candidate gene expression in protein levels.

<p id="P25">To further confirm that miR-137 regulates the expression of Pde10a through the predicted binding site in the 3’UTR of Pde10a, we mutated Pde10a-3’UTR by deleting the miR-137 target site (Pde10a-3’UTR<sup><italic>ΔmiR−137</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>).

<p id="P30">To strengthen the link between miR-137 and Pde10a, we generated the lentiviruses encoding shRNA targeting Pde10a (sh-Pde10a) and injected lenti-sh-Pde10a in adult <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice and assessed the impact of Pde10a knockdown on the impaired phenotypes associated with the partial loss of miR-137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a–8b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P31">In the Morris water maze test, the mean escape latency for the trained mice decreased over the course of the 5 learning days in all groups, and sh-Pde10a resulted in the improved time in <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice took to find the platform. In the probe trials, although sh-Pde10a did not change the swimming speed, it significantly improved the impaired latency to the platform and increased the number of target crossings in <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). In the 3-chamber test, we found Pde10a knockdown significantly improved the impaired sociability and social novelty in <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice, without influencing their choice of the left or right chamber during the habituation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>).

<p id="P32">Our earlier data indeed showed that papaverine resulted in the impaired dendritic growth of both <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> neurons, which may occur due to the toxicity of papaverine solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13e–g</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P33">Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci that are likely involved in neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, ASD, bipolar disorder, and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Among them, MIR137 was found significantly associated with schizophrenia and ASD. Also, in 5 independent studies, 12 individuals carrying a microdeletion in chromosome 1p21.3 reported with a 92% incidence of ASD and 100% incidence of intellectual disability (ID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The minimal overlapping region of their deletions on chromosome 1p21.3 only includes the <italic>MIR137</italic> gene, indicating that miR-137 mediates the core clinical features of ASD in patients carrying 1p21.3 deletion. Furthermore, gene expression analyses found that the overexpression of <italic>MIR137</italic> could be associated with schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, while the loss of <italic>MIR137</italic> is likely associated with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Here we present the first characterization of miR-137 knockout mice at molecular, cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral levels. Our results suggest that miR-137 plays important roles in postnatal neurodevelopment and provides the direct evidence to support that the loss of miR-137 potentially causes ASD.</p>
<p id="P34">We observed that the loss of miR-137 significantly influenced the expression of many known ASD genes. Particularly the upregulated ASD genes were significantly enriched with miR-137 predicted targets, such as Foxp1, Nfia, Satb2, and Tsn. For these genes, we only observed the changes at the protein level, but not at RNA level. Given the critical roles of these genes in neurodevelopment, our results suggest important roles of miR-137 in posttranscriptional gene regulation in ASD. In a previously published study focusing on <italic>MIR137</italic> gain-of-function, Siegert et al. found the mRNAs and proteins of Cplx1, Nsf, Syn3, and Syt1 were consistently downregulated upon overexpression of miR-137 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In our RNA-seq and proteomics analyses, however, we did not observe significant changes of these genes, suggesting that it is possible that the overexpression of miR-137 could target additional mRNAs compared to endogenous miRNA. Moreover, both our and their results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> suggest that either the miR-137 loss-of-function or gain-of-function could result in impaired learning and memory, indicating that the miR-137-mediated regulation during neurodevelopment could be dosage-dependent.</p>
<p id="P35">PDE10A is one of the miR-137 mRNA targets that is previously linked to neuropsychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The inhibition of PDE10A can ameliorate both dopaminergic and glutamatergic dysfunction, suggesting its attractive therapeutic potential in treating neuropsychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Papaverine is a widely used selective inhibitor of PDE10A. Administration of papaverine produced an increase in striatal tissue levels of cGMP and an increase in extracellular cAMP. These effects of papaverine on biochemical and behavioral assays were absent in PDE10A knockout mice, indicating specific inhibitory effects of papaverine on PDE10A activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Given that the PDE10A protein level is significantly elevated in the heterozygous miR-137 KO mice, we conducted several social deficit rescue experiments, and our results demonstrate that papaverine could indeed restore the impaired repetitive behaviors and sociability/social novelty in <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice. Also, we found that papaverine can partially ameliorate learning and memory deficits as well as repair neuronal morphological alterations associated with the partial loss of miR-137. These significant rescue effects suggest that PDE10A inhibition efficiently improves those behavioral abnormalities found in <italic>miR-137</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice. An earlier clinical trial using a selective PDE10A inhibitor for the treatment of schizophrenia failed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Rather, our results presented here suggest that PDE10A inhibitors should be targeted to a subgroup of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with the partial loss of <italic>MIR137</italic>. Notably, given that miR-137 has highly pleiotropic functions, it may be difficult to treat patients using only single-drug therapies aimed at specific pathways.</p>
<p id="P36">In summary, we show here that the partial loss of miR-137 leads to the molecular, cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral abnormalities associated with ASD. Given the known genetic association between MIR137 and neuropsychiatric disorders, our data provide the first direct evidence that the dysregulation of miR-137 directly contributes to the molecular pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

Mice received training in the Morris water maze for 4 successive days, and each session consisted of 4 trials. For each trial, the mouse was released from the wall of the tank and allowed to search, find, and stand on the platform for 20 seconds within the 60-second trial period. For each training session, the starting quadrant and sequence of the 4 quadrants from where the mouse was released into the water tank were randomly chosen, such that it was different among the separate sessions for each animal and was different for individual animals. A probe test was conducted 24 hours after completion of the training. During the probe test, the platform was removed from the pool, and the task performances were recorded for 60 seconds.

These slices were kept continuously oxygenated for at least 1 h before use. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature 22–25 °C. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. A bipolar concentric stimulating electrode (FHC Inc., Bowdoin, ME) was placed in the Schaffer collaterals to deliver test and conditioning stimuli. A glass recording electrode (3–4MΩ) filled with ACSF were positioned in stratum radiatum of CA1. fEPSPs in CA1 were induced by test stimuli at 0.033 Hz with an intensity that elicited a fEPSP amplitude of 40–50% of maximum. Test responses were recorded for 30–40 min before beginning the experiment, to ensure the stability of the response. After at least 15 min of stable baseline recording, LTP was induced by 100 Hz tetanic stimulation (1 train of 100 Hz for 1s) at baseline stimulation intensity.

Then, 100 μM picrotoxin was added to verify the inhibitory response. The E/I ratio was calculated as (PSC-IPSC)/IPSC.</p>

RNA was then reverse-transcribed using a SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). qPCR quantified cDNA via TaqMan assay (Invitrogen). Each reaction was run in triplicate and analyzed following the ∆∆Ct method using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) as a normalization control. Mature miR-137 was quantified as described in our previous work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.

<p id="P59">Four μg of total RNA (from P12 mice cortical tissues) was used for RNA-seq library construction following instructions of the Illumina mRNA sample prep kit (Cat# RS-100–0801). In brief, the poly-A–containing mRNA was purified using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. The mRNA was then fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments were copied into the first-strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. Second-strand cDNA synthesis followed using DNA Polymerase I and RNaseH. These cDNA fragments underwent an end-repair process, the addition of a single “A” base, and then ligation of the adapters. These products were gel purified and enriched with PCR to create the final cDNA libraries. The library constructs were run through the bioanalyzer to verify size and concentration before sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq2000 machines. In total, four biological replicates were carried out for each condition. Short read alignment, transcript expression estimation, and differential analysis were carried out using the Tophat2 (v2.1.1) and Cufflinks (v2.2.1) pipelines. The short reads were aligned against a reference gene database (Ensembl: Mus musculus, NCBIM37.62) without attempting to assemble novel transcripts. Both bias detection (–frag-bias-correct) and multi-read correction (–multi-read-correct) options were used to obtain a more accurate estimate of transcript abundance. A gene was considered differentially expressed with a q-value &lt; 0.05.</p>

Specific parameters included full trypticity, two maximal miscleavages, 10 ppm mass tolerance for both precursor ion and product ions, static mass addition (+229.16293) on lysine and N-terminus for TMT-tag, and the assignment of <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, and <italic>y</italic> ions. Crude peptide-spectrum matches were first analyzed to determine the mass accuracy and shift; then filtered using 4 standard deviations (~2 ppm) according to the results of doubly charged peptides with Jscore of ≥ 30.0. The cleaned matches were grouped by precursor ion charge state and further filtered by Jscore and dJn values. The cutoff values for these values were adjusted until a protein false discovery rate (FDR) lower than 1% was achieved. If one peptide was matched to multiple proteins, the peptide was represented by the protein with the highest peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) according to the rule of parsimony. The peptide and protein quantification steps included: (i) extract TMT reporter ion intensities from each PSM; (ii) correct the distorted raw intensities due to isotopic distribution of each TMT tag (e.g., TMT126 also generates 7.9% and 0.3% signals onto TMT127 and TMT128 in addition to 91.8% on its own.); (iii) exclude very low intensity PSMs (e.g. minimum intensity of 1,000 and median intensity of 5,000); (iv) normalize the sample loading bias with the trimmed median intensity of all PSMs; (v) calculate the mean-centered intensities across samples (e.g. relative intensities between each sample and the mean), using all PSMs with removal of outliers detected by Dixon’s Q-test or generalized extreme Studentized deviate test; (vi) average all corresponding PSMs of a protein; (vii) finally calculate protein absolute intensities by multiplying the intensity average by the grand-mean of three most highly abundant PSMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Identification of differentially expressed (DE) protein.</title>
<p id="P64">In total, 11,729 unique proteins at 1% FDR (0.1% unique peptide FDR and 0.05% PSM FDR). We showed the confidence intervals of the identified peptides in three aspects: i) Matching scores: the score distribution of accepted PSMs is vastly different from that of decoy PSMs; ii) Mass accuracy: almost all PSMs have precursor mass error within ± 4 ppm; and iii) De novo amino acid tags: almost all (99.9%) of accepted PSMs are supported by tags, with the median tag length of 6 AAs. These results strongly support the reliability of the 11,729 identified proteins. Besides the above stringent criteria, we further required a minimum of 9 PSMs for each protein, resulting in only 7,810 proteins for subsequent TMT-based quantification. No decoy protein passed the threshold of 9 PSMs, resulting in 0 FDR for this set of 7,810 proteins. However, we recognized that the FDR estimation might not be accurate and further calculated the standard deviation of the FDR using Target-decoy method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. The actual FDR falls between 0 and 0.07% within a 99% confidence interval. For each pairwise comparison (e.g., KO vs. WT), we required a consistent trend of significant changes in both experiments and defined differentially expressed (DE) proteins with the following criteria: (i) absolute z-score ≥1.96 (that corresponds to a P-value &lt; 0.05) in both experiments; (ii) the same trend in both experiments: the signs of z-scores should be consistent. This procedure resulted in 417, 94, and 76 DE proteins, when comparing KO vs. WT, Het vs. WT, and KO vs. Het, respectively.</p>
