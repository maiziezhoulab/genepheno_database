<p id="Par1">Exposure to social stress and dysregulated serotonergic neurotransmission have both been implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. However, the serotonergic circuit involved in stress vulnerability is still unknown. Here, we explored whether a serotonergic input from the dorsal raphe (DR) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) influences vulnerability to social stress. We identified a distinct, anatomically and functionally defined serotonergic subpopulation in the DR that projects to the VTA (5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons). Moreover, we found that susceptibility to social stress decreased the firing activity of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons. Importantly, the bidirectional manipulation of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons could modulate susceptibility to social stress. Our findings reveal that the activity of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons may be an essential factor in determining individual levels of susceptibility to social stress and suggest that targeting specific serotonergic circuits may aid the development of therapies for the treatment of stress-related disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Stress is thought to play an important role in promoting adaptation to physical or psychological threats to achieve homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, prolonged stress can have deleterious and long-lasting adverse effects on brain function and may contribute to the onset of psychiatric disorders, such as pathological anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Interestingly, there are prominent individual variations in responses to stress: when resilient individuals are exposed to extraordinary levels of stress, they develop adaptive responses and avoid serious mental illness, while susceptible individuals adapt poorly to stress, trauma, or more chronic forms of adversity, and express inappropriate physiological and psychological responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. To account for this variation, the diathesis–stress hypothesis of psychiatric disorders proposes that some individuals’ biological predispositions make them more susceptible to the effects of stressful life events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, on which neural circuits the stress risk factors converge to yield subthreshold changes rendering individuals vulnerable to stress remains largely unknown.</p>
<p id="Par4">The brain’s serotonergic network is a large and complex modulatory neurotransmitter system that has been demonstrated to regulate a number of behaviors, involving food intake, impulsivity, attention, and decision making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The dysregulation of serotonergic neurotransmission has long been implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Indeed, there have also been reports of serotonin deficiency in subpopulations of depression patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and individuals carrying mutations in the serotonin transporter gene are more likely to develop depression, following exposure to stressful events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, the most frequently prescribed drugs on the market today for depression and anxiety disorders target the serotonergic system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The majority of serotonergic neurons are located in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), comprising up to two-thirds of total neurons in this nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The activity of DR serotonergic neurons has been shown to play an important role in reward-associated and emotional behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and low levels of serotonin increase susceptibility to depression-like phenotypes induced by psychosocial stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, the optogenetic silencing of DR GABA neuronal activity disinhibits serotonergic neurons and prevents the acquisition of social avoidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, insight into the direct role of DR serotonergic neurons in stress vulnerability is still scarce.</p>
<p id="Par5">DR serotonergic neurons receive dense inputs from a broad range of limbic structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and transmit information to downstream targets, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The VTA is an important region in motivation and reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> that undergoes aberrant dopamine neuronal adaptations following chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), leading to depression-like behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, a clear understanding of how upstream brain regions shape VTA neurons’ responsiveness to stress is still substantially lacking.</p>
<p id="Par6">Recent studies have shown that a large number of serotonergic inputs from the DR to VTA dopamine neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and that the global pharmacological inhibition or lesioning of serotonergic neurons is capable of increasing the firing rate of VTA dopamine neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Projections from the DR to VTA neurons strongly mediate reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, but their implication in the stress response has yet to be addressed. Understanding whether the DR-VTA circuit mediates the effects of social stress and how this neuronal population undergoes electrophysiological adaptations in response to stress may have important implications for treatment strategies.</p>
<p id="Par7">Here, we demonstrated that serotonergic input from the DR to the VTA plays a prominent role in regulating CSDS-induced behavior. Specifically, we reported that susceptibility to CSDS decreased the neuronal firing and the intrinsic excitability of VTA-projecting DR serotonergic neurons (5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons). Furthermore, we found that the optogenetic inhibition of this circuit following subthreshold social defeat stress promoted stress vulnerability in stress-naive animals, and the chronic silencing of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons induced stress vulnerability in mice resilient to CSDS. Interestingly, we found enhanced excitatory synaptic inputs onto 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in resilient mice, and the activation of this pathway was sufficient to confer stress resilience. Taken together, we demonstrate that VTA-projecting DR serotonergic neurons may be a key factor in the regulation of stress responses.</p>

<title>5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons represent an independent subpopulation</title>
<p id="Par8">To identify projection targets of DR serotonergic neurons, we labeled DR serotonergic axons by injecting a double-floxed (DIO) Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing enhanced archaerhodopsin (eArch) fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP; AAV-DIO-eArch-GFP) into the DR of Sert-Cre mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a, b</xref>), in which Cre recombinase was selectively expressed in adult serotonergic neurons under the control of a serotonin transporter promoter (Sert; Sert is also known as Slc6a4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. DR serotonergic neurons are long-range projection neurons, as demonstrated by dense innervation in several brain areas, including the VTA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). The VTA is primarily thought to mediate stress-induced behavioral abnormalities. A key question is whether VTA-projecting DR serotonergic neurons represent an independent subpopulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Several studies have shown that serotonergic projections from the DR to the NAc is essential for the processing of social reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and that serotonin release in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a role in driving emotional behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To determine the identity of VTA-projecting serotonergic neurons (5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup>), we injected an axon-terminal-transducing AAV<sub>retro</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> expressing Cre-dependent membrane-tethered eYFP (AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-eYFP) or mCherry (AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-mCherry) into the mPFC, NAc, or VTA of Sert-Cre mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d, e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>An independent subpopulation of DR 5-HT neurons project to the VTA.</title><p><bold>a</bold> AAV5-DIO-eArch-GFP was injected into DR of Sert-Cre mice. <bold>b</bold> Dense terminal expression in the VTA.

<p id="Par9">Our data demonstrated that 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons formed a particularly strong cluster distinct from 5-HT<sup>DR→mPFC</sup> and 5-HT<sup>DR→NAc</sup> clusters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f–i</xref>; ~22.57–31.62% 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons; ~4.16% 5-HT<sup>DR→mPFC</sup> neurons, ~3.42% 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA/mPFC</sup> neurons; ~12.03% 5-HT<sup>DR→NAc</sup> neurons, ~2.33% 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA/NAc</sup> neurons; ~54.02–69.85% AAV-negative serotonergic neurons). Furthermore, we found that 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons tended to distribute more ventrally than the other two subpopulations, with little overlap, accounting for 13.1% of the DR-mPFC volume and 6.9% of the DR-NAc volume (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1j, k</xref>). However, this methodology may not detect all axonal collateralization simultaneously because potential target regions can only be sampled one or two at a time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. To overcome this limitation, we used an intersectional strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> to examine the collateralization patterns of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons, permitting a more comprehensive analysis of the axonal collateralization of this specific subpopulation. In Sert-Cre mice, we injected an AAV<sub>retro</sub>-expressing Cre-dependent Flp recombinase (AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-Flp) into the VTA concurrently with an AAV-expressing eYFP in a Flp-dependent manner (AAV-fDIO-eYFP) into the DR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1l</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1e, f</xref>). In this manner, only serotonergic neurons that project to the injection site of AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-Flp (VTA) were labeled. A detailed examination of the axonal fibers originating from 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons revealed that these neurons projected primarily to the VTA, with very few axonal arbors being observed in the mPFC, NAc, or others (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1m</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1g–i</xref>).</p>

<title>Stimulation of SERT fibers evokes glutamate and 5-HT effects</title>
<p id="Par10">Approximately two-thirds of the serotonergic neurons in the DR co-express vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, a vesicular transporter that is believed to concentrate glutamate into synaptic vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and co-release glutamate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. To determine the neurotransmitter identity of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons, we injected AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry into the DR of Sert-Cre animals, and examined the effect of stimulating axonal terminals from DR serotonergic neurons on postsynaptic neurons in the VTA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Single-pulse light stimulation elicited short-latency fast excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that were completely abolished by the application of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), a selective AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>). Prolonged photostimulation (20 Hz for 30 s) typically produced slow outward currents that were substantially inhibited by ketanserin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d, e</xref>), a drug that blocks serotonin 2 A and 2 C receptors. Interestingly, we observed that the majority of recorded VTA neurons received both AMPAR-mediated excitatory inputs and serotonin-receptor-mediated inhibitory inputs from the DR (34/95 neurons 35.8%), compared to those that exclusively received inhibitory inputs (27.4%) or exclusively received excitatory inputs (8.4%; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). Furthermore, tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 μM) eliminated VTA EPSCs evoked by the light stimulation of DR inputs, which were restored by the subsequent application of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in the presence of TTX (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a–c</xref>). We also found that light-evoked EPSCs exhibited short-latency and low-response jitter (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2d–f</xref>). From these electrophysiological findings, we inferred that VTA neurons receive direct monosynaptic inputs from DR serotonergic neurons.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Activating serotonergic terminals elicits glutamate and 5-HT release.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram showing whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the VTA following the Cre-dependent expression of ChR2 in the DR of Sert-Cre mice. <bold>b</bold> Representative recording trace from a VTA neuron showing a fast EPSC evoked by the light stimulation (5 ms, 20 Hz) of DR axonal terminals (upper panel).

<p id="Par11">Given the multiple converging lines of evidence linking dysregulated serotonergic neurotransmission with the etiology of stress-induced affective disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, we first investigated the endogenous recruitment of the 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons using CSDS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a, b</xref>). Animals exposed to ten consecutive days of social defeat were separated into susceptible and resilient groups on the basis of their social interaction ratio score. Susceptible defeated mice showed marked social avoidance, spending significantly less time in the interaction zone, whereas resilient defeated mice displayed an interaction ratio score similar to that of undefeated control mice, spending a significant amount of time with the social target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>). To label 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons for electrophysiological recordings, Sert-Cre animals were injected with AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-mCherry in the VTA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3b–d</xref>). Next, we tested whether 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons exhibit aberrant electrophysiological adaptations after CSDS. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in acute brain slices containing the DR from undefeated control, susceptible, and resilient mice. Consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in control mice exhibited a firing rate of 2.68 ± 0.34 Hz (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e, f</xref>). However, we found a decrease in the spontaneous firing rates of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in susceptible mice compared to those of control and resilient mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e, f</xref>). Consistent with this finding, the interspike intervals were significantly increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3g</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed a significant decrease in the depolarization-evoked firing activity of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in susceptible mice compared with that in neurons of control and resilient mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h, i</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3e–g</xref>). We then measured the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and sIPSCs, respectively) in these three groups. We only found an increase in the frequency of sEPSCs in 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in resilient mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a, b, e</xref>). No change was observed in either the frequency of sIPSCs or in the amplitude of sEPSCs and sIPSCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4c, d, f</xref>). To determine if the stress-induced alterations in synaptic inputs caused the observed excitability changes, we blocked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents by the application of CNQX, APV, (NMDA receptor antagonist) and bicuculline methiodide (BMI). We again found decreased excitability in susceptible mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3h–k</xref>), suggesting that alterations in excitability were not due to a secondary effect of synaptic changes. Furthermore, we observed that the action potential threshold and the rheobase current were significantly increased in 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons of susceptible mice relative to those of control mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3i, j</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons from susceptible mice show reduced firing activity.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Behavioral paradigm (<bold>a</bold>) and experimental timeline (<bold>b</bold>). <bold>c</bold> Left, time in the interaction zone in control mice (<italic>n</italic> = 12; one-way ANOVA<italic>, F</italic><sub>1,22</sub> = 8.319, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009) and resilient mice (<italic>n</italic> = 11; one-way ANOVA<italic>, F</italic><sub>1,20</sub> = 13.985, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) was significantly increased when a target was present, whereas it was significantly decreased in susceptible mice (<italic>n</italic> = 11; one-way ANOVA<italic>, F</italic><sub>1,20</sub> = 5.125, <italic>P</italic> = 0.035).

<title>Inhibition of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons promotes susceptibility</title>
<p id="Par12">The observation that the spontaneous firing rate and the intrinsic excitability of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons were decreased in susceptible mice prompted us to hypothesize that reducing DR serotonergic neural activity may promote stress susceptibility. To test this hypothesis, we injected AAV-DIO-eArch-eYFP into the DR of Sert-Cre mice and implanted optic fibers above the DR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a, e</xref>). The optogenetic silencing of DR serotonergic neuronal activity had no effect on locomotor activity, anxiety, or social interactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c–f, h</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>). Interestingly, we found that mice exposed to subthreshold defeat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> followed by the inhibition of DR serotonergic neuronal activity showed robust social avoidance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g, i</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5c</xref>).

<p id="Par13">To determine whether DR serotonergic neuronal activity promotes stress susceptibility through projections to VTA, we injected AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-eNpHR-mCherry into the VTA of Sert-Cre mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a, c</xref>). Immunohistofluorescence and electrophysiological results confirmed the viability of using AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-eNpHR-mCherry or control vectors to express functional eNpHR in DR cells projecting to the VTA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3b–d</xref>). Similar to somatic manipulations, the silencing of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons did not alter baseline measures of locomotion, anxiety, and social interactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d, f</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a–c</xref>). Moreover, inhibition of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in stress-naive mice did not induce an effect in the tail suspension test (TST) or sucrose preference test (SPT; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a, b</xref>). However, the optogenetic inhibition of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons following subthreshold exposure to aggressive CD1 mice was sufficient to induce a social avoidance phenotype similar to that seen in susceptible animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e, g</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6d</xref>).

<title>5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> pathway bidirectionally regulates susceptibility</title>
<p id="Par14">Given that decreased activity in 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons is characteristic of susceptible animals and that silencing of these neurons after subthreshold social defeat attenuates the acquisition of social interaction phenotypes, we next investigated whether the silencing of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons is necessary to convert resilient animals to susceptible animals. To this end, AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-eNpHR-mCherry or AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-mCherry were injected into the VTA of Sert-Cre animals, and an optic ferrule was implanted above the DR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10b</xref>). Following a standard 10-day CSDS paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, we identified the subgroup of mice that remained resilient based on normal social interaction ratio scores (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8a</xref>). We found that the eNpHR-mediated inhibition of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons for 5 min during a second social interaction test did not induce a significant effect on social interaction behavior (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8b</xref>). Interestingly, chronic inhibition (20 min/day for a week) led to decreased social interactions, thereby reversing the resilient phenotype to a susceptible phenotype of defeated mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8c</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons bidirectionally modulate stress susceptibility.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>e</bold> Experimental timeline and optogenetic stimulation protocol. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>f</bold> Quantitative data showing no difference in social interaction time or social interaction ratio between the resilient-eNpHR group and the mCherry group (<bold>b</bold>, eNpHR, <italic>n</italic> = 9 mice; mCherry, <italic>n</italic> = 8 mice; one-way ANOVA, interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,15</sub> = 0.594, <italic>P</italic> = 0.453, SI ratio: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,15</sub> = 0.407, <italic>P</italic> = 0.533) or between the susceptible-channelrhodopsin-2 (sus-ChR2) group and the susceptible-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (sus-eYFP) group (<bold>f</bold>, eYFP, <italic>n</italic> = 9 mice; ChR2, <italic>n</italic> = 8 mice; one-way ANOVA, interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,15</sub> = 0.241, <italic>P</italic> = 0.63, SI ratio: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,15</sub> = 2.62, <italic>P</italic> = 0.126). <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold> One week of the inhibition of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in resilient mice counteracted this phenotype to induce a susceptible-like phenotype (<bold>d</bold>, eNpHR, <italic>n</italic> = 8 mice; mCherry, <italic>n</italic> = 7 mice; one-way ANOVA, interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,13</sub> = 10.613, <italic>P</italic> = 0.006, SI ratio: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,13</sub> = 5.546, <italic>P</italic> = 0.035), whereas acute stimulation during the social interaction test had no effect; (<bold>c</bold>, eNpHR, <italic>n</italic> = 8 mice; mCherry, <italic>n</italic> = 8 mice; one-way ANOVA, interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,14</sub> = 0.95, <italic>P</italic> = 0.346, SI ratio: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,14</sub> = 2.231, <italic>P</italic> = 0.157). <bold>g</bold>, <bold>h</bold> The time spent in the interaction zone with the target of ChR2-stimulated susceptible mice was significantly increased during the acute (<bold>g</bold>, eYFP, <italic>n</italic> = 8 mice; ChR2, <italic>n</italic> = 8 mice; one-way ANOVA, interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,14</sub> = 9.497, <italic>P</italic> = 0.008, SI ratio: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,14</sub> = 7.375, <italic>P</italic> = 0.017) or chronic stimulation of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons (<bold>h</bold>, eYFP, <italic>n</italic> = 6 mice; ChR2, <italic>n</italic> = 8 mice; one-way ANOVA, interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,12</sub> = 4.773, <italic>P</italic> = 0.049, SI ratio: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,12</sub> = 5.989, <italic>P</italic> = 0.031).

<p id="Par15">To investigate whether the activation of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons is sufficient to counteract vulnerability to social defeat, we injected AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-ChR2-eYFP (yellow fluorescent protein) or AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-eYFP into the VTA of Sert-Cre mice implanted with an optical ferrule above the DR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10a</xref>). We validated the specificity of viral expression in the soma and in the VTA terminals of DR serotonergic neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9a–c</xref>), and functional validation confirmed that optogenetic stimulation (20 Hz, 10 min) enables the activation of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9d–g</xref>). We first identified susceptible phenotypes in a new cohort of socially defeated mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8d</xref>). The optogenetic stimulation (5 ms, 20 Hz) of the 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> pathway changed the behavioral phenotype of these animals from susceptible to resilient, as evidenced by a robust increase in social interactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6g</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8e</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par16">The dysregulation of serotonergic tone has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, the direct contribution of the serotonergic circuit to social stress vulnerability is still unknown. Here, our results demonstrate that 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons mediate susceptibility to social stress and exhibit electrophysiological adaptations, a finding that supports both the serotonergic neurotransmission and the diathesis (vulnerability factors)–stress hypotheses of psychiatric disease.</p>
<p id="Par17">Accumulating evidence suggests that the activity of serotonergic neurons is critical for the regulation of emotional states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Findings from these studies have shown that the activation of DR serotonergic neurons elicits antidepressant-like effects and induces anxiogenic-like behaviors. However, other studies have reported that the activation of DR serotonergic neurons has no effect on anxiety-like behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. While different experimental conditions and behavioral assays may contribute to these conflicting results, they may also stem from treating the DR serotonergic neurons as a single population. Here, we used viral-genetic methods to study the specific functional and anatomical properties of DR serotonergic neurons projecting to the VTA. It is well known that VTA dopamine neurons are implicated in regulating susceptibility to social stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Inputs to the VTA likely play a role in shaping stress-induced maladaptive behaviors. Indeed, a recent study has reported that parvalbumin neurons in the ventral pallidum projecting to the VTA adapt their activity in response to social stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Other studies have shown that noradrenergic inputs from the locus coeruleus to the VTA promote resilience to social stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The pathway from the laterodorsal tegmentum to the VTA has recently been shown to drive stress-induced maladaptive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Inputs from DR serotonergic neurons to the VTA are involved in reward signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The activation of this pathway has been reported to produce conditioned place preference. Our study addressed the role of VTA-projecting DR serotonergic neurons in the regulation of stress responses. Importantly, the optogenetic activation of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons counteracted vulnerability to social stress. These results indicate that the DR serotonergic neuronal inputs to the VTA not only convey rewarding information, but also confer resilience to social stress. Therefore, 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons are a more versatile subpopulation in the DR than originally thought and should be considered a key regulator of the VTA, shaping responses to reward and stress.</p>
<p id="Par18">Our data showed that the firing activity and intrinsic excitability of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons decreased in susceptible animals, whereas the electrophysiological properties of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in resilient animals more closely resembled those of undefeated controls. This finding is consistent with a previous report indicating a significant reduction in the excitability of DR serotonergic neurons in susceptible mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that an increase in serotonin levels due to the systemic administration of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine inhibits the firing rate of putative dopamine neurons in the VTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In contrast, the depletion of serotonin by chemicals or electrolytic lesions of DR has been reported to increase the firing rate of VTA dopamine neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, the decreased firing activity of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons observed in susceptible animals may result in increasing VTA dopamine neuronal activity—a biological mark previously described in susceptible animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In line with this reasoning, the optogenetic inhibition of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neuronal activity following subthreshold social defeat stress promoted stress vulnerability. Moreover, recent reports have shown that DR serotonergic neurons synapse on VTA dopamine neurons that heavily innervate NAc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, whereas the VTA-GABA neurons receiving input from the DR mainly target the PFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Thus, these findings are consistent with Chaudhury et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, which found that optogenetic stimulation of the VTA-NAc, but not the VTA-PFC pathway induced stress susceptibility. In contrast, Tye et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> reported that opposite effects of VTA DA neurons stimulation, reversing the susceptible phenotype to a resilient phenotype. These studies suggest that VTA DA neurons have complex and perhaps contradictory roles in the behavioral consequences of different types of stressors. It will be of interest to test whether the role of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in stress vulnerability can be extended to other experimental models. Interestingly, Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> recently reported that DR dual SERT-VGluT3 terminals have an excitatory effect on some VTA dopamine neurons. Understanding the roles of specific neurons (SERT only and SERT-VGluT3 neurons) within the DR pathway to VTA might provide further insights into circuit mechanisms of stress vulnerability. We also observed that glutamate can be co-released with serotonin following the optical stimulation of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons. Thus, both serotonin and glutamate may be important for controlling VTA neuronal activity. Interestingly, while decreased firing activity of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in susceptible animals was not due to alterations in synaptic inputs, we found an increase in excitatory synaptic inputs to 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in resilient mice compared to levels in controls. These excitatory input adaptations in 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons may arise from alterations in brain areas, such as the PFC, which is often associated with processing emotional information. Previous studies have shown that cortical inputs preferentially synapse onto serotonergic neurons that are localized in the ventral DR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, where 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons also localize (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). Thus, it is possible that projections from the PFC targeting 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons may display selective synaptic changes in resilient animals. Consistent with this notion, the optogenetic stimulation of PFC terminals in the DR or the direct activation of the DR has been shown to exert a significant antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Collin et al. reported an increase in the frequency of IPSCs in DR serotonergic neurons as a whole in susceptible mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, while we found no change in IPSCs in 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons. These findings suggest that the heterogeneous physiological responses seen in DR serotonergic neurons could result from recording at least two distinct subpopulations. Future research will be required to identify the area-specific synaptic inputs onto 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons to understand which precise upstream pathways drive CSDS-induced alterations in resilient conditions.</p>
<p id="Par19">The biological factors that determine whether an individual develops mental illness, such as posttraumatic stress disorder or depression, remain largely unknown. Our data demonstrate that the activation of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons counteracted the reduction in social interaction time in susceptible mice, which indicates that 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neuron excitation is sufficient to confer stress resilience. Conversely, the silencing of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons resulted in reduced social interaction time, which suggests that 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neuron inhibition is sufficient to induce stress susceptibility. These results highlight that inputs from DR serotonergic neurons to the VTA play a prominent role in regulating vulnerability to social stress. Consistent with this conclusion, several studies have shown that individuals carrying mutations within the serotonin transporter gene have an increased risk of major depression following exposure to stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, a previous study reported that serotonin deficiency increases susceptibility to psychosocial stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In another recent study, social isolation was shown to decrease the excitability of DR serotonergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Interestingly, Zhou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> recently reported that activation of the 5-HT<sup>DR</sup>→SOM<sup>CeA</sup> circuit reduces depressive-like behavior in mice exposed to chronic pain, but not in mice exposed to chronic stress. The finding, together with our data, suggests that different etiologies of psychiatric disorders, for example, chronic pain and stress, may be encoded by distinct serotonergic pathways. Notably, we surprisingly found that the chronic inhibition of 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neural activity in resilient mice counteracted this phenotype to induce a susceptible-like phenotype, whereas this effect was not observed after acute inhibition during the social interaction test. One possible explanation for this result is that the synaptic connection between 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons and VTA neurons is weak in healthy mice, but may be selectively stronger in resilient mice. It is possible that chronic inhibition, which results in long-term plasticity adaptations, may convert resilient mice into susceptible mice. In line with this reasoning, we demonstrated that 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons in resilient mice received increased excitatory synaptic input compared to those in susceptible and control mice.</p>
<p id="Par20">Future interrogation into the downstream circuits and VTA cell types engaged by DR serotonergic neurons, and their neural adaptations in response to CSDS will be required.</p>
<p id="Par21">Taken together, we characterize a neural circuit that mediates vulnerability to chronic social stress, a finding that could have important implications for our understanding of the etiology of psychosocial stress, and suggests that future strategies aimed at activating the 5-HT<sup>DR→VTA</sup> neurons may be protective against stress-related psychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Viral injections and stereotaxic surgeries</title>
<p id="Par24">For all injections, mice were anesthetized using pentobarbital (intraperitoneal, 75 mg/kg) and placed in a small animal stereotaxic instrument equipped with a heating pad. Hair was removed from the dorsal surface of the head with hair clippers, and ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes. Craniotomies were performed above the target region, and all measurements were made relative to bregma for virus/implant surgeries. Injections were performed using a microsyringe pump (Nanoliter 2010 Injector, WPI) at a rate of 100 nl/min. The glass pipette was retracted after 5–10 min and then slowly withdrawn.</p>
<p id="Par25">To label DR 5-HT axons, we injected 500 nL of AAV5-ef1α-DIO-GFP into the DR of Sert-Cre mice at the following coordinates: anteroposterior (AP): 5.2 mm, mediolateral (ML): 0 mm, and dorsoventral (DV): 2.6 mm (a 15° angle from caudal to rostral); for retrograde tracing, we bilaterally injected 300–500 nL of the following viruses: AAV<sub>retro</sub> -Ef1α-DIO-mCherry and AAV<sub>retro</sub>-Ef1α-DIO-eYFP into the VTA (AP: −3.1 mm, ML: ±0.5 mm, and DV: −4.6 mm), NAc (AP: +1.6 mm, ML: ±0.7 mm, and DV: −4.2 mm), and/or mPFC (AP: +1.8 mm, ML: ±0.3 mm, and DV: −2.3 mm) of Sert-Cre mice.</p>
<p id="Par26">To express opsins in the DR serotonergic neurons inhibition experiments, 500 nL of AAV5-Ef1α-DIO-eArch-GFP or AAV5-Ef1α-DIO-GFP was infused into the DR of Sert-Cre mice. To specifically target DR neurons projecting to the VTA, Sert-Cre mice aged ~8 weeks were injected with 500 nL of AAV<sub>retro</sub>-Ef1α-DIO-eNpHR3.0-mCherry, AAV<sub>retro</sub>-Ef1α-DIO-mCherry, AAV<sub>retro</sub> -Ef1α-DIO-ChR2-eYFP, or AAV<sub>retro</sub>-Ef1α-DIO -eYFP into the VTA. Ferrules attached to optical fibers (200 mm core diameter, 0.37 numerical aperture (NA)) were implanted 0.2 mm above the DR for somatic stimulation. Four weeks were given for the full expression of viruses in somas before behavioral testing commenced. Upon the completion of the behavioral experiments, coronal sections of DR were used to confirm viral expression and fiber placement.</p>
<p id="Par27">Approximately, 8-week-old Sert-Cre mice were injected with AAV5-Ef1α-DIO-ChR2-mCherry into the DR using the same volumes and coordinates as previously stated. A total of 6–8 weeks were to ensure for viral expression in terminals before animals were sacrificed for electrophysiology. For the retrograde labeling of VTA neurons projecting to DR, AAV<sub>retro</sub>-Ef1α-DIO-mCherry was infused into the VTA of Sert-Cre mice. Electrophysiological recordings were performed 5–6 weeks after stereotaxic surgery, allowing the full expression of viruses.</p>

<title>Histology and imaging</title>
<p id="Par28">Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (intraperitonial (i.p.) injection) and then intracardially perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were carefully removed and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight before being transferred into 30% sucrose in PBS solution until they sank to the bottom of the container. Forty-micron-thick coronal sections containing the brain region of interest were sliced on a freezing microtome (Leica CM1950).</p>
<p id="Par29">Sections were washed with PBS three times (5 min each) and were then blocked in 5% normal goat serum solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. Then, slices were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Tph2 (1:400, Millipore) or anti-GFP antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) in 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight, and washed three times (5 min each) in PBS before incubation for 2 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen, goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 Cat# A-21245; goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 Cat# A-11034; and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 594 Cat# A-11037).</p>
<p id="Par30">We first verified that the AAV injections were localized to the target brain regions (DR, VTA, NAc, and mPFC). Brain regions were determined by anatomical landmarks, and were based on the Mouse Brain Atlas in Stereotaxic Coordinates, Paxinos and Franklin, second edition. For the quantification of starter cells, the number of Tph2<sup>+</sup> and AAV-positive cells in the DR were counted in 1–2 sections out of every six, from bregma −4.24 to −4.96 mm. The cellular resolution images of coronal sections of interest were acquired through the 10× and 20× objective, using the Nikon A1 confocal microscope and were processed with NIH ImageJ software. Sixteen/22 mice were excluded from the double-site retrograde tracing experiments because of failed injection or because they did not show any dual-color AAV expression.</p>
<p id="Par31">Images were acquired using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 20× objective (NA 0.8). All images were taken in roughly the same imaging area. Images were processed using NIH ImageJ software and were quantified as a percentage of the area of thresholded pixels normalized to the AAV<sub>retro</sub>-DIO-Flp injection site. Qualitatively determined threshold values were maintained consistent throughout animals. Sample size was based on reports in related literature and was not predetermined by calculation.</p>

<title>In vitro electrophysiological recording</title>
<p id="Par32">The methods of slice preparation and physiological recordings were similar to those in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Briefly, 10- to 12-week-old mice were deeply anesthetized with an i.p. injection of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg). Mice were then rapidly decapitated, and brains were removed from the cranial cavity and dissected into ice-cold oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), containing (in mM) 250 sucrose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 KCl, 1.3 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Coronal brain sections (300 μm thickness) containing DR or VTA were cut using a vibratome (VT-1200S, Leica, Germany). Brain slices were incubated at 34 °C for 30 min and then at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C) to recover in a holding chamber containing oxygenated ACSF (in mM; 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>) before being transferred to the recording chamber for electrophysiological recordings. Neurons were visualized under an upright microscope (ECLIPSE FN1, Nikon) equipped with a 40× water-immersion lens, infrared differential interference contrast and digital camera (C11440-42U, Hamamatsu).</p>
<p id="Par33">Electrophysiological recordings were made using a MultiClamp700B amplifier and PClamp software (Molecular Devices, USA). The data were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz with Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices, USA). During recording, slices were submerged in normal, oxygenated ACSF and superfused (2 ml/min) at temperature (32–34 °C). The pipette (4–6 MΩ) was pulled by a micropipette puller (P-97, Sutter instrument) and filled with the internal solution (in mM: 105 K-gluconate, 30 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na, and 0.3 EGTA, pH 7.35, 285 mOsm). Cell-attached voltage clamp was used to record spontaneous firing of serotonergic neurons in DR slices. Unlike whole-cell patch clamping, which disturbs the intracellular contents and can thereby change the membrane potential of serotonergic neurons during recordings, cell-attached patch clamping was chosen to produce reliable, long-lasting, and stable recording of firing of serotonergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Following a 3-min stabilization period, cell-attached voltage clamp was performed.</p>
<p id="Par34">To measure the intrinsic membrane properties of DR serotonergic neurons, whole-cell recordings were carried out in current-clamp mode, and spikes were induced by incremental increases in the current injection (from −40 to 340 pA at a step of 20 pA). All action potential properties and excitability recordings in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3h–k</xref> were performed in the presence of 20 μM CNQX, 100 μM dl-AP5, and 20 μM BMI. The action potential threshold was measured as the point of depolarization at which the neuron fires. Rheobase was determined by injecting a ramp of current and examining the current needed to elicit the first spike. Membrane resistance was calculated from the change in voltage elicited after a series of hyperpolarizing pulses.</p>
<p id="Par35">For target recordings in the VTA, AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry was injected into the DR of Sert-Cre animals and cells in the VTA near mCherry + fibers were patched. For the photostimulation of ChR2-expressing axon terminals, a 5 ms blue light pulse was emitted from a Lambda DG-4 (Sutter, USA) under the control of Digidata 1440. A Lambda DG-4 Wavelength Switcher was used to deliver different wavelengths of light through the 40× objective. Recordings were conducted in voltage-clamp mode using a cesium-methansulfonate (Cs-Meth)-based internal solution (in mM: 135 Cs-Meth, 10 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 EGTA, 2 QX-314, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na, and 20 phosphocreatine, pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm) so we could detect EPSCs (−70 mV) and IPSCs (0 mV) in the same neuron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. sEPSCs and sIPSCs were also recorded at −70 mV and 0 mV, respectively. For drug application, AMPA-mediated EPSCs were blocked by the bath application of CNQX (10 µM, Sigma), and 5-HT-receptor-mediated IPSCs were blocked with ketanserin (10 µM, Sigma). sEPSCs were validated by the addition of kynurenic acid (3 mM, Sigma), and sIPSCs were validated with bicuculine (20 µM, Sigma). For eNpHR experiments, different durations of yellow light were generated by the above mentioned stimulator and delivered to DR serotonergic neurons expressing eNpHR.</p>
<p id="Par36">To verify the monosynaptic connection between DR 5-HT axons and VTA neurons, TTX (1 µM) and 4-AP (200 mM) were bath applied in succession. The latency of optical-evoked EPSCs was calculated by the time interval between the onset of the light pulse and the time point at which 10% of the peak amplitude was achieved. The response jitter was calculated by measuring the s.d. of the latency of five successive recordings for each VTA neuron.</p>
<p id="Par37">In all experiments, the series resistance was controlled &lt;30 MΩ. All recordings were excluded if the holding current exceeded −200 pA or if series resistance fluctuated &gt;20% from the initial values. The data were acquired by pClAMP 10.7, and analyzed using Clampfit 10.7 software and Mini Analysis software.</p>

<title>Behavioral assays</title>
<p id="Par38">For ChR2-mediated stimulation experiments, optical fibers (200-μm diameter, NA 0.37, Inper, Hangzhou, China) were connected to patch cords (Thorlabs), which were, in turn, connected to blue or yellow light lasers (Thinker Tech Nanjing Biotech Co., Ltd., China) using FC/PC adapters located above the operant chambers. Laser output was controlled with a stimulator (Thinker Tech Nanjing Biotech Co., Ltd., China). For DR stimulation, 5 ms pulses of 20 Hz light were delivered as outlined in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> that optogenetically manipulated DR serotonergic neurons. Laser power was measured (Thorlabs) before each experiment and was measured to be ~15 mW. For NpHR-mediated inhibition, fibers were connected to a 593 nm yellow laser diode. Laser power was again measured (Thorlabs) before each experiment and adjusted to ~8 mW.</p>

<title>Chronic social defeat stress</title>
<p id="Par39">CSDS protocal was conducted according to the model described by Golden et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Before the start of the social defeat experiments, retired male breeder CD1 mice were screened on three consecutive days and were selected according to the following criteria: (i) a latency of attack under 60 s, (ii) consistent bouts over 3 min long, and (iii) attack in at least the two past screening days. Experimental mice were subjected to physical contact with a novel CD1 aggressive mouse for ten consecutive days. Following daily physical defeat, the mice remained in the aggressor’s home cage on the other side of a translucent divider that was perforated with holes to allow for visual, auditory, and olfactory interaction with the aggressor for 24 h until the next physical defeat. The control mice were housed two animals per cage in the same conditions as their experimental counterparts, but were never exposed to the CD1 aggressors. Each day, the experimental and the control mice were relocated to a cage with a new cage mate immediately before social defeat. After 10 days of CSDS, all mice were housed singly and tested 24 h later for the social interaction test.</p>

<title>Subthreshold social defeat stress</title>
<p id="Par40">The subthreshold social defeat experiment is a well-established protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Briefly, an experimental mouse was introduced into a CD1 aggressor’s home cage for two consecutive bouts of 3 min of physical defeat on a single day. After 3 min of physical defeat, the mouse was kept with the CD1 aggressor separated by a perforated partition for 10 min. A 5 min rest in the home cage was given between the sensory defeat session and the subsequent bout of physical defeat in the home cage of a new CD1 aggressor. Social defeat was repeated once, and experimental mice were assessed using the social interaction test the following day.</p>

<title>Social interaction test</title>
<p id="Par41">Social interaction was measured in a two-stage social interaction test. In the first stage (target absent), the experimental mice were placed in an open field arena (42 cm × 42 cm × 42 cm) with an empty wire mesh enclosure (10 cm wide × 6.5 cm deep × 42 cm high) in the middle of one of the arena walls. In the second stage, the experimental mouse was reintroduced into the arena, and a novel, aggressive CD1 mouse was placed into the wire mesh enclosure. Between the two stages, animals were returned to home cage for 30 s. In all behavioral experiments, animals were monitored with video tracking software (Ethovision XT 10, Noldus). Time spent in the social interaction zone, which was defined to as a 24 cm × 14 cm area around the wire mesh enclosure, and time spent in the corner along the wall opposite to the social interaction zone were measured. From these two stages, an interaction ratio was calculated (SI = time spent interaction zone, target present/time spent interaction zone, and target absent). Animals were defined as susceptible if SI &lt; 1, and resilient if SI &gt; 1. In a subset of studies, for acute stimulation, experimental mice underwent optogenetic stimulation to activate or inhibit DR serotonergic neurons, during both the target absent and target present sessions of the social interaction test. For chronic stimulation, mice received blue light stimulation two times a day (08:00 and 20:00, 10 min per session) in their home cage for 1 week.</p>
