<p id="Par1">Aplastic Anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure (BMF) disorder, resulting in bone marrow hypocellularity and peripheral pancytopenia. Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a subset of AA defined by a more severe phenotype. Although the immunological nature of SAA pathogenesis is widely accepted, there is an increasing recognition of the role of dysfunctional hematopoietic stem cells in the disease phenotype. While pediatric SAA can be attributable to genetic causes, evidence is evolving on previously unrecognized genetic etiologies in a proportion of adults with SAA. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the pathophysiology of SAA, which will help to inform the course of disease progression and treatment options. We have derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) from three unaffected controls and three SAA patients and have shown that this in vitro model mimics two key features of the disease: (1) the failure to maintain telomere length during the reprogramming process and hematopoietic differentiation resulting in SAA-iPSC and iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors with shorter telomeres than controls; (2) the impaired ability of SAA-iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors to give rise to erythroid and myeloid cells. While apoptosis and DNA damage response to replicative stress is similar between the control and SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors, the latter show impaired proliferation which was not restored by eltrombopag, a drug which has been shown to restore hematopoiesis in SAA patients. Together, our data highlight the utility of patient specific iPSC in providing a disease model for SAA and predicting patient responses to various treatment modalities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Aplastic Anemia (AA) is a rare and serious bone marrow disorder associated with hypocellular bone marrow and peripheral pancytopenia. Severe AA (SAA) is a subtype of the disease characterized by very low bone marrow cellularity of less than 25%, with significant morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. AA occurs with peak incidences at the two extremes of life, in patients between the age of 10 and 25, and patients aged &gt;60 years. Children with AA are more often treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) while adults are treated with either immunosuppressive therapy using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and Cyclosporine or HSCT, if a matched donor is available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Currently, 70–80% of cases are classified as idiopathic because their etiology is unknown. The remainder (15–20%) consists of constitutional bone marrow failure syndromes with the most common being Fanconi anemia (FA) followed by the telomeropathies such as dyskeratosis congenital (DC).</p>
<p id="Par3">There are currently two proposed models of pathogenesis in idiopathic AA that could explain the characteristic marrow hypocellularity observed in this disorder. In model 1, an underlying abnormality of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) may result in a predisposition to stem cell damage, as well as qualitative or quantitative defects of HSC production. In model 2, a deregulated immune response targets a normal HSC compartment. Strong evidence for an immune component to the pathogenesis of AA comes from the success of the immunosuppressive therapies in treating AA and associated clinical features, including aberrations in immune cell number, phenotype and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Evidence for an underlying stem cell/progenitor defect is derived from the observations of reduced hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers both at presentation and following successful therapy with ATG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, enhanced apoptosis of HSCs, upregulation of genes involved in cell death in hematopoietic progenitors obtained from AA patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and mutations in genes such as <italic>PRF1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, <italic>MPL</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, <italic>NSB1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, <italic>SBSD</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, <italic>TERT</italic>, <italic>TERC</italic>, and <italic>TIF2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> as well as polymorphisms in the <italic>IFN gamma</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> found in a small number of patients.</p>
<p id="Par4">Acquisition of cells from the bone marrow of AA patients is complicated by the paucity of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in these patients and the lack of mouse models which recapitulate the entire spectrum of AA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Here we describe the generation of an iPSC-derived disease model for SAA consisting of iPSC lines derived from 1 pediatric and 2 young adult cases and 3 unaffected controls. These iPSC lines were differentiated to hematopoietic lineages and although no significant differences were observed in the ability to give rise to hematopoietic progenitors between control and SAA-iPSC, the later, showed a reduced potential to generate erythroid and myeloid cells, impaired proliferation and shorter telomeres when compared to unaffected controls.</p>

<title>Generation of human iPSC from control and SAA patient fibroblasts</title>
<p id="Par5">To generate an in vitro disease model for SAA, dermal fibroblasts cells from 1 pediatric and 2 young adult cases of idiopathic SAA, showing severe and very severe clinical manifestation and no clinical stigmata of constitutional AA as well as three unaffected controls (indicated as WT throughout the manuscript) were transduced with the non-integrating RNA-derived Sendai virus (SeV) vector including the four Yamanaka reprogramming factors (<italic>OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC</italic>) as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). SAA fibroblasts showed slightly reduced reprogramming efficiencies compared to unaffected controls (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). No residual presence of the SeV transgenes was detected in any of the lines generated indicating that SAA-iPSC and control lines successfully maintained stable regulation of the endogenous pluripotent gene expression activated during reprogramming after the loss of SeV transgene expression (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>). Cytogenetic analysis carried out by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) array showed that the reprogramming process/prolonged culture of the iPSC lines did not induce any detectable genomic abnormalities with the exception of SAA1-iPSC in which two loss of heterozygosity events were identified (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). SAA-iPSC colonies displayed characteristic human ESC-like morphology and expression of pluripotent markers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2a and b</xref>). Similarly, in vivo assessment of pluripotency revealed that SAA-iPSC lines induced formation of teratomae containing cells belonging to all three germ layers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2c</xref>). These data indicate that SAA-iPSC and control-iPSC lines displayed characteristic features of fully-reprogrammed cells.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Table providing detailed information regarding SAA patients used in this study and reprogramming efficiencies obtained for each control and patient</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Patient ID</th><th>Age (years)</th><th>Gender</th><th>Phenotype</th><th>Reprogramming efficiency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>WT1</td><td>Newborn</td><td>Male</td><td>Heathy</td><td>0.21%</td></tr><tr><td>WT2</td><td>51</td><td>Male</td><td>Healthy</td><td>0.29%</td></tr><tr><td>WT3</td><td>37</td><td>Female</td><td>Healthy</td><td>0.14%</td></tr><tr><td>SAA1</td><td>16</td><td>Male</td><td>Severe AA Responded to immunosuppressors</td><td>0.11%</td></tr><tr><td>SAA2</td><td>24</td><td>Male</td><td>Very Severe AA Responded to immunosuppressors Developed PNH and relapsed Failed with second course of horse ATG Successful matched unrelated HSCT</td><td>0.10%</td></tr><tr><td>SAA3</td><td>10</td><td>Female</td><td>Very Severe AA and autism Successful matched unrelated HSCT</td><td>0.11%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>AA</italic> aplstic anemia, <italic>PNH</italic> paroxysmal nocturnal hemaoglobinuria, <italic>ATG</italic> anti-thymocyte globulin, <italic>HSCT</italic> hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>SAA-iPSC lines display in vitro hallmarks of pluripotency</title><p><bold>a</bold> Brightfield images of control and SAA-iPSC colonies displaying typical ESC-like morphology and staining of control and SAA-iPSC colonies with pluripotency markers.

<title>Reduced colony-forming potential of SAA iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors</title>
<p id="Par6">To investigate the hematopoietic differentiation potential of the SAA-iPSC lines, all patient specific and control iPSC were differentiated using a method previously described by Olivier et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Early stages of mesoderm induction from iPSC cultures were monitored on day 3 of differentiation by expression of KDR (FLK1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Generation of the first hematopoietic progenitors was detected at day 6 using the CD43 pan-hematopoietic marker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The emergence of hematopoietic progenitors (CD43+) and the subtypes of hematopoietic progenitors including megakaryocyte progenitors (CD41a+CD235a−), erythroid progenitors (CD41a-CD235a+), megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (CD41a+CD235a+) and myeloid progenitors (CD41a-CD235a−) was assessed by flow cytometric analysis throughout the differentiation time course<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). To identify the sources of variation that could affect the ability to generate hematopoietic progenitors, different variables such as differentiation experiment, passage number, clonal and donor cell origin (genetic background) were compared using the control-iPSC lines by flow cytometric analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">3a</xref>). None of these parameters showed a statistically significant difference in the percentage of CD43 positive cells at day 12 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">3b–d</xref>). Hence, one clone from each patient and control was used throughout this study. To enable comparison of data from each patient against all three controls, the latter were pooled together, averaged and shown as WT throughout the manuscript.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>SAA-iPSC differentiation into mesodermal and hematopoietic progenitors</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic representation of the experimental design used to analyze the WT and SAA-iPSC hematopoietic differentiation capacity; <bold>b</bold> Representative images of flow cytometric analysis and scatter dot plot representation of KDR expression in WT and SAA cell lines on day 3. <bold>c</bold> Representative images of flow cytometric analysis and scatter dot plot representation of CD43 expression in differentiating WT and SAA cell lines on day 6. <bold>b</bold> One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used for statistical comparison between WT and SAA cell lines. <bold>c</bold> Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparison test was used for statistical comparison between WT and SAA cell lines. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> Data is presented as mean of at least 3 independent experiments ± S.E.M.

<p id="Par7">Analysis of mesodermal induction in SAA-iPSC lines at day 3 revealed that patient cell lines showed similar frequencies of KDR+ compared to control-iPSC lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). No significant reduction in the potential to generate CD43+ hematopoietic progenitors was observed in any of the SAA-iPSC cell lines compared to unaffected controls at days 6 and 12 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>c and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>); however one of the SAA patient iPSC (SAA1) showed a statistically significant reduction in the potential to generate erythroid progenitors (CD43+CD41a−CD235a+) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title><bold>SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors show a reduced colony-forming potential</bold></title><p><bold>a</bold> Representative images of flow cytometric analysis of CD34 and CD43 expression and CD41 and CD235 expression on CD43+ population in WT and SAA cell lines on day 12 of differentiation; <bold>b</bold> Analysis of percentages of hematopoietic progenitors (CD43+), erythroid progenitors (CD43+CD41a−CD235a+) and myeloid progenitors (CD43+CD41a−CD235a-) in WT and SAA cell lines on day 12.

<p id="Par8">To assess the colony-forming potential of the SAA-iPSC cell lines, we performed colony forming unit (CFU) assay at day 12 by culturing iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors in methylcellulose-derived media enriched with recombinant cytokines which promote the differentiation into committed erythroid progenitors (CFU-E and BFU-E), and myeloid lineage progenitors (CFU-G, CFU-M, CFU-GM, and CFU-GEMM) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). All three SAA-iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors showed a significant reduction in the total number of CFUs indicating an impaired hematopoietic colony-forming capacity, including both erythroid and myeloid colony potential (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). Despite reduced hematopoietic colony number in SAA, no differences in types and ratios of colonies formed were observed (data not shown). Similar data were obtained at day 16 of differentiation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">4</xref>), suggesting that the impaired hematopoietic colony forming ability was not due to a delay in differentiation process.</p>

<title>Telomerase-independent impaired telomere elongation in SAA-iPSC cell lines and enhanced telomere attrition during hematopoietic differentiation</title>
<p id="Par9">Excessive telomere attrition in highly proliferative cells such as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells can lead to bone marrow failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Although the SAA patients used in this study did not display typical dyskeratosis congenita phenotype or mutations in <italic>DKC1</italic>, <italic>TINF2</italic>, <italic>TERT</italic> or <italic>TERC</italic> genes by exome sequencing analysis (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">3</xref>), we decided to investigate the telomere dynamics in our SAA-iPSC model since it has been reported that one third of acquired AA patients present short telomeres in leukocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Control-iPSC showed longer telomeres than parental fibroblasts due to telomere elongation during reprogramming, corroborating published reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. No increases in telomere length were observed during the reprogramming of SAA fibroblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>).

<title>Reduced proliferation capacity of SAA-iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors</title>
<p id="Par11">Progressive telomere shortening leads eventually to cell cycle arrest or cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In view of this as well as the reduced capacity of SAA-iPSC to give rise to erythroid and myeloid cells, we investigated the proliferative capacity and apoptosis of the SAA iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors. We synchronized the iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors in G1/S phase by treatment with ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) for 24 h. This was followed by culture in HU-free media and pulsing with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 1 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content and incorporation of BrdU in control-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors indicated a high percentage of cells arrested in G1/S phase at 1 and 3 h post-release from HU due to depletion of deoxyribonucleotide pools (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">5a</xref>). These arrested cells reentered the cell cycle, progressed through S-phase and showed a similar cell cycle profile to that of untreated cells at 24 h post treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">5a, b</xref>), indicating that iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors require at least 24 h to restore a normal cell-cycle profile. We analyzed the proliferation rate of the synchronized control and SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors (marked by CD43 expression) by comparing the percentage of BrdU-incorporating cells (S-phase) at 24 h post-release from HU. Interestingly, SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors showed a significant reduction in the number of BrdU-incorporating cells (proliferative cells) compared with control counterparts, indicating a reduced proliferative capacity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). To investigate whether apoptosis was increased in SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors, we measured the presence of cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP) by flow cytometric analysis.

<p id="Par12">Induction of replicative stress by depletion of deoxyribonucleotide pools with long exposure to hydroxyurea leads to stalled replication forks and accumulation of DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. To address whether reduced hematopoietic potential of SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors might be attributed to an impaired ability to repair DNA damage associated with replicative stress, we analyzed the percentage of DNA damage induced by HU treatment by flow cytometric analysis in proliferating and non-proliferating cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c–f</xref>). To assess the reversibility of the DNA damage induced by HU exposure, we measured the formation of the phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (γH2AX) at 1, 3, 8, and 24 h after HU release in control-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors. This analysis indicated accumulation of γH2AX+ in BrdU+ cells at 1 and 3 h after HU release indicating accumulation of DNA damage in replication forks after HU replication block (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">5e</xref>). The γH2AX foci progressively disappeared showing similar levels of γH2AX levels to those of untreated cells at 24 h (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">5e</xref>). Thus, analysis of accumulation of DNA damage in proliferating (γH2AX+BrdU+) and non-proliferating (γH2AX+BrdU−) iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors showed that control cell lines were able to repair the induced DNA damage after 24 h release from HU (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">5f, g</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par13">To investigate the ability of SAA cell lines to repair DNA damage associated to replicative stress, we then analyzed the accumulation of γH2AX in proliferating (BrdU+) and non-proliferating (BrdU−) in SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors at 1 and 24 h after HU release (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c–f</xref>). No significant increase in the accumulation of γH2AX+BrdU+ was observed at 1 h post HU release in SAA-iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>), unlike the control counterparts which showed a significant accumulation of DNA damage at 1 h post HU release. Low levels of DNA damage observed in BrdU+ after replicative stress points to a reduced proliferation capacity likely due to a reduced formation of replication forks, in agreement with our results showing significantly reduced number of BrdU-incorporating cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Thus, higher levels of γH2AX+BrdU+ cells were observed in control-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors compared to those in SAA cell lines, likely due to a higher number of replication forks, although the differences were not statistically significant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). Interestingly, analysis of DNA damage in in non-proliferating (BrdU−) progenitors revealed a significant increase in the level of γH2AX at 24 h post HU release in one of patient-derived-hematopoietic progenitors (SAA2) compared to equivalent cells generated from the controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>), suggesting an individual patient specific impaired ability to restore normal levels of DNA damage after HU treatment in non-proliferating iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors. Notwithstanding this, the percentage of γH2AX+BrdU-cells in the hematopoietic progenitors derived from this patient iPSC line was not significantly higher when compared to equivalent cells generated from the unaffected controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>). Together these data indicate that proliferating SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors tend to accumulate less DNA damage soon after HU treatment most likely as result of their reduced proliferation. Furthermore, a subset of SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors may be slower or have an impaired ability to restore DNA damage in the non-proliferative compartment. However, the overall level of DNA damage induced in response to replicative stress is not significantly different compared to control-derived-hematopoietic progenitors, excluding DNA damage accumulation as a key factor underlying the impaired hematopoietic differentiation of SAA-iPSC lines.</p>

<title>Eltrombopag does not improve hematopoietic differentiation potential or enhance proliferation of SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par17">Studies of hematopoietic progenitor cell dysfunction in SAA have been difficult due to paucity of these cells in patient’s bone marrow samples. We have overcome this difficulty by using an iPSC disease model of three patients with SAA which has enabled us to study the phenotype of hematopoietic progenitors independent of the influence of the immune system.</p>
<p id="Par18">SAA-iPSC lines were largely not impaired in their ability to generate hematopoietic progenitors; however the latter exhibited a much reduced erythroid and myeloid CFU ability accurately recapitulating the phenotype that defines SAA. The presence of reduced number and clonogenic capacity of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors in AA patients has been reported by different studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and traditionally considered secondary to immune-mediated stem cell destruction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Using our in vitro SAA iPSC model, we provide evidence for an impaired differentiation capacity in SAA hematopoietic progenitors in the absence of an immune system, which may be suggestive of a constitutional progenitor cell dysfunction. Genetic background has been reported as one of the major drivers of phenotypic variability in iPSC modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. We minimized this effect in the SAA-iPSC model by including multiple control cell lines in order to distinguish between phenotypic effects caused by disease-causing alterations and genetic background. Further experiments using a larger number of iPSC lines from relatives sharing similar genetic background are needed to fully understand the disease pathogenesis.</p>
<p id="Par19">Functional reconstruction of telomeres and upregulation of telomerase activity during reprogramming represent a hallmark of induced pluripotency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. iPSC-derived modeling of telomeropathies associated with BMFs caused by mutations in telomerase-associated genes such as <italic>TERC, TERT</italic>, and <italic>DKC</italic> have shown defective telomere elongation in iPSC due to reduced telomerase function which impacts on the maintenance of pluripotent phenotype and hematopoietic differentiation capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In SAA, only 10% of patients with short telomeres display known mutations in telomere pathway components suggesting that mutations in uncharacterized genes might have a role in the disease phenotype observed in these patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Our results revealed that SAA fibroblasts failed to elongate telomeres during the reprogramming process despite up-regulation of telomerase activity, pointing to an impaired telomere elongation during the reprogramming process that is not attributable to a defective telomerase activity. Similarly, iPSC-based hematopoietic progenitors in SAA cell lines showed excessive telomere shortening during hematopoietic differentiation. It is possible that the presence of short telomeres may be responsible for the impaired hematopoietic differentiation capacity we observed in our iPSC derived modeling of SAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Alternatively, the short telomeres can be a consequence of reiterative rounds of divisions carried out by a smaller number of proliferating hematopoietic progenitor cells in SAA patients as a compensatory mechanism to maintain homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To be able to distinguish between these possibilities and investigate whether genetic predispositions play a role, whole genome analysis of a large number of SAA patients and their families need to be carried out. Our study included three patients only which precludes such large scale analysis, however exome sequencing analysis of patient’s dermal fibroblasts revealed the presence of deleterious mutations in telomere-associated genes such as <italic>RPA2, NCL, POLD3, TEP1, YLMP1, PIF1</italic>,<italic> and ERCC4</italic> (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">3</xref>). Interestingly, replication Protein A (RPA) has been reported to be necessary for telomere maintenance due to its role in unfolding of telomeric G-quadruplexes and preventing replication-fork stalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> whereas <italic>NCL</italic> codifies for the RNA chaperone nucleolin that regulates the nuclear localization of telomerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Likewise, overexpression of <italic>Ylpm1</italic> in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to down-regulation of telomerase activity and telomere shortening resulting in reduced proliferation and hematopoietic differentiation ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Whilst these data point to existence of potentially deleterious mutations in telomere-associated genes in SAA patients, access to DNA samples from their related family members and larger cohorts of SAA patients is needed to confirm their involvement in SAA etiology.</p>
<p id="Par20">EP is a non-peptide molecule mimetic to TPO that stimulates tri-lineage hematopoiesis in 40% of the SAA patients at 3–4 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism by which EP is promoting the generation of blood cells and impacting hematopoietic stem and progenitors in AA patients is not fully understood. We studied the ability of EP to rescue the impaired hematopoietic differentiation capacity in our SAA-iPSC model. SAA-iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors did not show a significant increase in the number of erythroid or myeloid-lineage CFUs, proliferative capacity or DNA damage repair capacity under conditions of replicative stress, upon adding EP during the differentiation process. Interestingly, it has been reported that EP failed to improve severe thrombocytopenia in patients with constitutional bone marrow failures syndromes including DC and Diamond-Blackfan-anemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Thus, this lack of response to EP by DC patients supports our hypothesis that constitutional defects in the telomere-associated genes may be at the root of the impaired hematopoietic differentiation observed in the SAA-iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors. As such it would be of interest to investigate if this group of patients will respond to other available therapies, for example danazol, although to date is unclear whether danazol related improvements are due to upregulation of telomerase activity through an increase in <italic>TERT</italic> expression or to elongation of telomeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Likewise, different authors have hypothesized that EP might be involved in immune cell function by modulating regulatory T cell function in SAA patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> as observed in chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura patients treated with EP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. The lack of response to EP observed in our SAA-iPSC model suggests that EP may indeed have an underlying immune-regulatory function, which is separate to the impaired differentiation and telomere maintenance defect reported herein. In summary, our data provide strong evidence for usefulness of iPSC based disease modeling to replicate key phenotypes associated with SAA, facilitating the diagnosis of previously unidentified cases of constitutional SAA, and predicting patient specific response to various treatment modalities.</p>

<title>Exome sequencing analysis</title>
<p id="Par34">DNA was extracted from 5 HLHS patient fibroblasts using QIAamp DNA Micro kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, 56304). Exome sequencing was performed by BGI. Exome capture was performed using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kit (V4). Libraries were constructed following the Illumina Paired-End Sequencing Library Preparation Protocol version 1.0.1 and then sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx platform with version 4 chemistry and version 4 flowcells. The sequencing reads were analyzed using the following workflow to identify variants in patient. The quality of sequencing reads was firstly checked with FastQC (Version 0.11.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> Low quality bases (Q &lt; 20) on 3′ ends of reads were trimmed off using seqtk (Version 1.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Duplicated reads were then removed with FastUniq (Version 1.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> before mapping to the human reference genome GRCh37 with BWA (Version 0.7.6.a)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. The alignments were refined with tools of the GATK suite (Version 3.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Variants were called according to GATK Best Practice recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, including recalibration. Freebayes (Version 1.0.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> was also used to call variants from the same set of samples. The variants called by Freebayes with total coverage ≥ 5, minor allele coverage ≥ 5 and variants call quality ≥ 20 were added to those identified by GATK. Non-synonymous exonic variants were subsequently filtered by quality and minor-allele frequency (MAF) reported in the 1000 Genomes project (2012 Feb release)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup> and ESP6500<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>.

ANNOVAR (Version 2014-07-22)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup> was used for annotations and prediction of functional consequences. Deleterious in our study was defined by at least one of the predictors [SIFT or PolyPHEN2] and those that had alternative allele frequency less than 0.01 in both 1000 Genomes project and ESP6500 (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>).</p>
