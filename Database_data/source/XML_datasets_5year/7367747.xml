<title>Purpose</title>
<p>MORC4 has recently been characterized as a breast cancer-associated anti-apoptotic oncoprotein. In the current study, we explored its downstream regulation in luminal A/B breast tumors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2002">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Bioinformatic prediction was performed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-breast cancer (BRCA). Cellular and molecular studies were conducted using luminal A/B representative MCF-7 and BT-474 cell lines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>ENST00000355610.8 (encoding MORC4a isoform) was the dominant transcript in breast cancer. ChIP-qPCR and dual-luciferase assay confirmed two STAT3-binding sites in the <italic>MID2</italic> promoter in both MCF-7 and BT-474 cells. Co-IP confirmed an interaction between MORC4 and STAT3. ChIP-qPCR data indicated that <italic>MORC4</italic> inhibition led to remarkably decreased enrichment of the STAT3-binding <italic>MID2</italic> promoter segments. <italic>MORC4</italic> overexpression significantly elevated BCL-2 expression in MCF-7 cells and increased their resistance to adriamycin (ADM), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cisplatin (DDP). <italic>MID2</italic> inhibition largely abrogated MORC4-induced drug-resistance. However, the drug-resistant phenotype was rescued by overexpressing MID2-MT that was resistant to <italic>MID2</italic> siRNA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of MORC4 on <italic>MID2</italic> expression via STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation. This regulatory axis might confer increased chemoresistance to breast cancer cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Currently, chemotherapy is still the standard therapeutic strategy applied for breast cancer patients with triple-negative, HER2-positive, or advanced luminal tumors when resistance to endocrine therapy occurs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref> The basic mechanism of anti-cancer drugs is to induce apoptosis-related cell death networks to eliminate tumor cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref> However, activation of anti-apoptotic signalings and subsequent chemoresistance often occur in the ongoing treatment, leading to therapeutic failure and eventually death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref> Therefore, a thorough understanding of the endogenous factors leading to intrinsic or acquired chemoresistance is critical for improving therapeutic outcomes.</p>
<p>MORC family CW-type zinc finger proteins are a highly conserved nuclear protein superfamily constituting of four members (MORC1/2/3/4). These proteins have nuclear matrix binding domains and thus have been considered as putative transcriptional regulation factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref> Some recent studies observed that they might act as critical regulators during cancer development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref> Among the family members, MORC4 upregulation might serve as a biomarker of some diffuse large B‐cell lymphomas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref> The oncogenic effects of MORC4 were also reported in breast cancer. Its overexpression confers malignant phenotypes to breast cancer cells, including increased cell viability, migration, and invasion, as well as decreased apoptosis of multiple breast cancer cell lines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref> By upregulating BCL-2 and downregulating BAD expression, MORC4 reduces the apoptosis of breast cancer cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref> Therefore, its dysregulation might be an important contributor to chemoresistance. However, the downstream regulation network of MORC4 in breast cancer is still mysterious.</p>
<p>Midline2 (MID2) is an ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme that is involved in tumor development and has a physical interaction with breast cancer 1, early-onset (BRCA1).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref> One previous study found that <italic>MID2</italic> is overexpressed in breast cancer and might be a prognostic biomarker.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref> MID2 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation rates of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and in vivo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref> In this work, we explored the regulatory network of MORC4 in breast cancer by bioinformatic prediction and following molecular/cellular studies. Our findings suggested that MORC4 could recruit STAT3 to the promoter region of <italic>MID2</italic> and drive its expression. Activation of this pathway enhanced the chemoresistance to breast cancer cells.</p>

<title>Bioinformatic Prediction of the Potential Regulatory Network of MORC4 in Breast Cancer</title>
<p>Alternative transcripts of <italic>MORC4</italic> encoding different protein isoforms have been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref> Using RNA-seq data from GTEx-normal breast and TCGA-BRCA, we examined the transcription profile of <italic>MORC4</italic>. Results showed that ENST00000355610.8 (encoding MORC4a isoform) was the dominant transcript in both normal and tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1A</xref>). Its expression was significantly upregulated in basal-like, HER2+, luminal A and luminal B tumors compared to normal breast tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1B</xref>). To explore the potential functional partners of MORC4, we predicted its co-expressed genes and interacting proteins using GeneMANIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1C</xref>). The nine predicted co-expressed genes were subjected to validation using RNA-seq in TCGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1D</xref>). By setting |Pearson’s r|≥0.4 as the cutoff, we found that only <italic>MID2</italic> was correlated with ENST00000355610.8 expression. Subgroup analysis showed that <italic>MID2</italic> was only upregulated in luminal A/B tumors compared to normal breast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1E</xref>). Correlation analysis confirmed a moderate positive correlation (Person’s r &gt;0.4) in these two subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1F</xref>). STAT3 is a predicted MORC4 interacting protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, correlation analysis also confirmed a moderate positive correlation between <italic>STAT3</italic> and <italic>MID2</italic> expression in luminal A/B tumors (Pearson’s r=0.44, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1G</xref>). K-M survival analysis confirmed that luminal A/B patients with the top quartile of ENST00000355610.8 or MID2 expression had significantly worse OS compared to the respective bottom quartile group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">I</xref>). Previous studies reported that MID2 could promote the proliferation of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref> These findings triggered our interest to explore the potential regulation network among MORC4, MID2, and STAT3 in luminal A/B tumor cells.<fig fig-type="figure" id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Bioinformatic prediction of the potential regulatory network of MORC4 in breast cancer.

<p>By prediction using JASPAR, we found two high potential STAT3-binding sites in the <italic>MID2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3A</xref>). By performing ChIP-qPCR assay, we found that the two predicted regions were enriched upon anti-STAT3 immunoprecipitation in both MCF-7 and BT-474 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3B</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">D</xref>), suggesting that STAT3 might exert regulatory effects on <italic>MID2</italic> expression. To validate our hypothesis, different lengths of the 5ʹ flanking region of <italic>MID2</italic>, including –1461/+179, −1100/+179, and −400/+179 were cloned into the pGL3-basic plasmid and transiently transfected into MCF-7, and BT-474 cells. The luciferase constructs carrying STAT3-binding sites exhibited higher luciferase comparing to the pGL3-basic plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3E</xref>). pGL3-(1461/+179) with two STAT3-binding sites showed the highest luciferase activity, whereas pGL3-(−1100/+179) had a reduced luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3E</xref>). These findings suggest STAT3 could activate the <italic>MID2</italic> promoter via the two binding sites. To further validate the influence of STAT3 on the <italic>MID2</italic> promoter activity, MCF-7 and BT-474 cells were co-transfected with <italic>STAT3</italic> siRNA or si-NC and recombinant pGL3 constructs with different <italic>MID2</italic> promoter fragments. Results showed that <italic>STAT3</italic> inhibition significantly reduced the luciferase activity of pGL3-(1461/+179) and pGL3-(−1100/+179) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">G</xref>), but did not change the activity of pGL3-(−400/+179) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3H</xref>).<fig fig-type="figure" id="F0003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>MORC4 is required for STAT3-induced <italic>MID2</italic> promoter activation and <italic>MID2</italic> mRNA expression.

<title>MORC4 is Required for STAT3 Binding to <italic>MID2</italic> Promoter</title>
<p>To validate the predicted interaction between STAT3 and MORC4, MCF-7 and BT-474 cells were infected for overexpression of STAT3-HA or MORC4-FLAG alone or in combination. Co-IP confirmed an interaction between MORC4 and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">J</xref>). Then, we investigated whether MORC4 was required for the interaction between STAT3 and <italic>MID2</italic> promoter. ChIP-qPCR assays were performed using anti-STAT3 in MCF-7 and BT-474 cells with or without <italic>MORC4</italic> inhibition.

<title>MID2 is a Major Downstream Modulator of MORC4 in Chemoresistance of Breast Cancer</title>
<p>Since both MORC4 and MID2 have well-established roles in regulating cell proliferation, we then tested whether the MORC4-MID2 regulatory axis could regulate the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were subjected to <italic>MORC4</italic> overexpression alone or in combination with <italic>MID2</italic> inhibition. <italic>MORC4</italic> overexpression significantly increased MID2 expression, and also elevated BCL-2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4A</xref>). <italic>MID2</italic> inhibition largely abrogated MORC4-induced BCL-2 upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4A</xref>), which could be rescued by the overexpression of MID2-MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4A</xref>). To further validate the regulatory effect of the MORC4-MID2 axis on chemoresistance, MCF-7 cells were infected as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4A</xref> and were treated with ADM, 5-FU, and DDP at different concentrations for 48 h. CCK-8 assay showed that MORC4 overexpression dramatically increased the IC50 of ADM, 5-FU, and DDP in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4B</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">D</xref>) and also significantly inhibited drug-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4E</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">G</xref>). <italic>MID2</italic> inhibition significantly suppressed the MORC4-induced IC50 increase and apoptosis inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4B</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although MORC4 has been demonstrated as an oncogenic protein in breast cancer, the downstream regulatory effect is still poorly understood. Via performing bioinformatic prediction, we found that both MORC4 and STAT3 were positively co-expressed with MID2 in luminal A/B breast tumors. Using MCF-7 and BT-474 cells as luminal A/B representative models, we observed that inhibiting MORC4 or STAT3 could significantly decrease the expression MID2 at both mRNA and protein levels, suggesting a potential modulative effect of MORC4 and STAT3 on <italic>MID2</italic> expression.</p>
<p>STAT3 is transiently activated under normal physiological conditions but is frequently overexpressed and activated in breast cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref> There is growing evidence showed that STAT3 is one of the critical regulators of tumor-associated signaling pathways in breast cancer. It modulates the transcriptional intensity of a series of genes involved in breast cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and drug resistance, such as Bcl-X, Survivin, p21<sup>CIP1</sup>, Cyclin D1, c-Myc, VEGF, Vimentin, TWIST, MMP- and MMP-9.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref> Therefore, targeting STAT3 has been considered as a potential therapeutic strategy in breast cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref> In some cases, STAT3 does not exert regulatory effects alone but acts as a transcription co-activator. For example, STAT3 acts as a PR coactivator and is required for PR binding in Bcl-X, p21CIP1, and c-Myc promoters.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref> It also co-opts ErbB-2 nuclear function to induce miR-21 expression, a metastasis-promoting miRNA in breast cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref></p>
<p>Using ChIP-qPCR and dual-luciferase assay, we confirmed that STAT3 directly bound to and activated the promoter of <italic>MID2</italic>, suggesting that <italic>MID2</italic> is a novel target gene of STAT3 in luminal A/B breast tumors. The direct physical interaction between MORC4 and STAT3 was also confirmed. Notably, MORC4 was required for STAT3 binding to the <italic>MID2</italic> promoter. These findings collectively suggest a MORC4-STAT3-MID2 regulatory pathway in luminal A/B tumors. These three proteins all exert anti-apoptotic properties in breast cancer cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref> Thus, this pathway was supposed to have an essential role in regulating the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells. IC50 and Annexin V/PI apoptotic assay confirmed that MORC4 could increase the chemoresistance of MCF-7 cells, the effects of which were weakened by MID2 inhibition but were restored by MID2-MT overexpression. Although adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemotherapy treatment have been used for patients with a high risk of relapse, both early and late relapses still occur.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref> Primary or acquired chemoresistance is a common cause of mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref> Therefore, it would be meaningful to explore the potential of these proteins as therapeutic targets of luminal A/B breast cancer in the future.</p>
<p>Altogether, this study revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of MORC4 on <italic>MID2</italic> expression via STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation. This regulatory axis might confer increased chemoresistance to breast cancer cells.</p>
