<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Chronic itch is a highly debilitating condition affecting about 10% of the general population. The relay of itch signals is under tight control by inhibitory circuits of the spinal dorsal horn, which may offer a hitherto unexploited therapeutic opportunity. Here, we found that specific pharmacological targeting of inhibitory α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors reduces acute histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch in mice. Systemic treatment with an α2/α3GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor selective modulator alleviates also chronic itch in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis and in dogs sensitized to house dust mites, without inducing sedation, motor dysfunction, or loss of antipruritic activity after prolonged treatment. Transsynaptic circuit tracing, immunofluorescence, and electrophysiological experiments identify spinal α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors as likely molecular targets underlying the antipruritic effect. Our results indicate that drugs targeting α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are well-suited to alleviate itch, including non-histaminergic chronic itch for which currently no approved treatment exists.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Chronic itch affects between 4–17% of the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Most drugs currently used to treat itch are histamine H1 and H4 receptor blockers that work well against acute itch. By contrast, chronic itch is mostly histamine-independent and largely irresponsive to these medications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Frequent causes of histamine-independent itch include, besides atopic dermatitis, cholestatic liver disease, end stage kidney failure, and opioid-therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Drugs used to treat itch in these conditions include immune suppressants and drugs acting at the CNS such as gabapentinoids, antidepressants, and opioid receptor antagonists. In the majority of cases, these treatments do not provide adequate relief or cause severe side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Pruritic (itch) stimuli are detected by sensory neurons (primary pruritoceptors) that innervate the skin and transform these stimuli into electrical signals, i.e., action potentials. These action potentials are then relayed via the peripheral and central axons of primary pruritoceptors to central neurons in the spinal or medullary dorsal horn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Only recently have researchers begun to understand the signaling molecules, receptors, transmitters and neuronal pathways of itch. Several “new” G protein-coupled receptors expressed by primary sensory neurons have been identified that are activated by pruritogens. One such receptor is the mas-related G protein coupled receptor A3 (MrgprA3 in mouse, or MRGPRX1 in human), which is activated by the antimalarial drug chloroquine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Sensory neurons expressing this receptor become excited by a wide variety of pruritogens involved in acute histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch, as well as in chronic itch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Other work addressed neuronal pathways involved in the spinal relay of itch. These studies identified excitatory interneurons expressing gastrin releasing peptide (GRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or the GRP receptor (GRPR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> as key elements of this process. These itch-relay pathways appear to be under tight control by dorsal horn inhibitory neurons. Lack of a certain subset of these neurons that depend on the transcription factor Bhlhb5 leads to severe chronic itch in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Local ablation of inhibitory neurons of the deep dorsal horn induces abnormal grooming and biting behavior, and localized hair loss reminiscent of chronic itch syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Conversely, local activation of these neurons through DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>) suppressed histamine-dependent and histamine-independent itch, demonstrating that inhibitory dorsal horn neurons exert a profound control over spinal itch relay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Inhibitory neurons of the spinal dorsal horn release two fast amino acid transmitters, GABA and glycine, to reduce the excitability of their postsynaptic target neurons. In the present study, we focused on the GABAergic system and investigated whether itch, in particular chronic itch, can be suppressed through pharmacological modulation of specific subtypes of spinal GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs). GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are pentameric anion channels built from a repertoire of 19 subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Most GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the brain and spinal cord are composed of α, β, and γ subunits in a 2:2:1 stoichiometry. The mammalian genome harbors 12 genes encoding for these subunits (α1-6, β1-3, and γ1–3). Spinal GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs mainly contain α1, α2, α3, or α5 subunits together with β2/3 subunits and a γ subunit. α4 and α6 subunits are only sparsely expressed or completely lacking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Differences in the physiological functions and pharmacological properties of these GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are mainly determined by the α subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In the present study, we first used genetically modified mice to identify α2/α3 containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs as key elements of spinal itch control. Building on this result we assessed potential antipruritic actions of an α2/α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R selective compound (TPA023B; ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>) and showed that it not only reduced acute histamine-dependent and histamine-independent itch in mice but also chronic itch in mice and dogs without apparent side effects.</p>

<title>Inhibitory input to peripheral and spinal pruritoceptors</title>
<p id="Par6">We first verified that itch relaying GRP neurons receive input from local inhibitory interneurons. Retrograde mono/transsynaptic rabies virus-based tracing experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> initiated from GRP::cre neurons identified numerous inhibitory and excitatory neurons presynaptic to GRP neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). About half of the inhibitory neurons were located in lamina II of the dorsal horn, where most inhibitory neurons are purely GABAergic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The other half resided in deeper layers, where most inhibitory neurons co-express glycine and GABA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Inhibitory input onto spinal GRP positive itch relaying interneurons. <bold>a</bold> Neurons providing synaptic input onto GRP positive neurons were identified using transsynaptic rabies virus based tracing.

<p id="Par7">We next investigated the presence of α1, α2, α3, and α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits on spinal axon terminals of primary MrgprA3 positive pruritoceptors and on spinal GRP neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Both MrgprA3 fibers and GRP neurons are concentrated in lamina II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, which also harbors α2 and/or α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits at high density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To visualize MrgprA3 axons and terminals and GRP neurons, we used GRP::eGFP and MrgprA3::cre-eGFP;ROSA26<sup>lsl-tdTom</sup> transgenic mice. Immunostaining of spinal cord sections of these mice confirmed that the region of α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit expression overlapped with that of MrgrpA3 terminals and GRP neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a,c</xref>). A similar GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit expression pattern was found in the cervical spinal cord and the medullary dorsal horn (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). By contrast, α1 and α5GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits were largely missing from lamina II. Confocal analysis at higher magnification further demonstrated that α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits were located on MrgprA3 fibers and GRP neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b,d</xref>). To allow a quantification of α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit expressing neurons, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization in sections of lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and lumbar spinal cords (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). In these experiments, we also included spinal cord sections from GRPR::eGFP transgenic mice. Only about 20% of MrgprA3 positive DRG neurons expressed α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit transcripts. This low expression is consistent with previously published single cell RNAseq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (Supplementary <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">Table 1</xref>). By contrast, virtually all GRP and GRPR neurons expressed α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit transcripts, and more than 60% of these neurons also expressed α2GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits. Co-expression of α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit transcripts with GRP and GRPR transcripts was also observed in human spinal cord tissue (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are expressed on key elements of a spinal itch relay circuit.

<title>GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes with antipruritic efficacy</title>
<p id="Par8">We then asked whether pharmacological targeting of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs containing α2 or α3 subunits (α2/α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) reduces itch. To this end, we administered diazepam, a classical benzodiazepine that non-selectively potentiates the activation of benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. To restrict diazepam’s action to a single GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtype (α1, α2, α3, or α5), we used triple GABA<sub>A</sub>R point mutated mice, which carry a histidine to arginine (H → R) point mutation in three of the four benzodiazepine sensitive GABA<sub>A</sub>R α subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> (designated as HRRR, RHRR, RRHR, and RRRH mice, for mice in which only α1, α2, α3, or α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs remained diazepam sensitive). Because mice of this particular genetic background (129SvJ) have not yet been systematically analyzed in itch experiments, we first assessed their sensitivity to different pruritogens. We found that injection of α-methyl serotonin (α-methyl 5-HT), a metabolically more stable derivative of the pivotal itch messenger serotonin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, induced robust dose-dependent scratching behavior (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). We then tested the effect of systemic diazepam (10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, p.o.) on scratching responses evoked by α-methyl 5-HT (20 µg). Selective targeting of α2 or α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (in RHRR or RRHR mice) strongly reduced scratching bouts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a–d</xref>). No significant reduction was observed after activation of α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (in RRRH mice).

<title>Antipruritic efficacy of an α2/α3 selective GABA<sub>A</sub>R modulator</title>
<p id="Par10">We then tested whether the data obtained in genetically modified mice would translate into therapeutic efficacy of GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtype-selective compounds. To this end, we tested the antipruritic efficacy of the α1-sparing GABA<sub>A</sub>R modulator TPA023B (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>). As a prerequisite, we verified the in vitro pharmacological profile of TPA023B in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. As reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, TPA023B had partial agonistic activity at the benzodiazepine binding site of α2β3γ2 and α3β3γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, but did not potentiate α1β2γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and had very weak potentiating effects on α5β2γ2 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). It did not activate GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the absence of GABA. We then asked whether this partial agonistic activity would translate to a facilitation of GABAergic inhibition in MrgprA3 or GRP neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b, c</xref>). In dissociated MrgprA3::cre-eGFP positive DRG neurons, TPA023B (1 µM) led to a slight statistically insignificant increase in GABA<sub>A</sub>R current amplitudes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.068, two-sided paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>n</italic> = 10) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>).

Chloroquine-induced scratching was reduced by TPA023B in wild-type mice at doses ≥ 0.03 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>. Similar effects were obtained with α-methyl 5-HT and histamine. To verify that the antipruritic effect of TPA023B was due to its interaction with the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, we used GABA<sub>A</sub>R triple point mutated mice (HRRR mice), in which all GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs susceptible to modulation by TPA023B (α2, α3, and α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) had been rendered benzodiazepine-insensitive.

Because selective targeting of α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs had an even stronger antipruritic effect than targeting α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h</xref>), we focused our efforts on the α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtype and investigated α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit knock-out mice, in which deletion of the α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit gene was achieved through the insertion of a duplicated exon (5*) flanked by loxP sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

<title>Antipruritic efficacy of TPA023B in pruritic dogs</title>
<p id="Par16">Encouraged by its efficacy in mice and the absence of apparent side effects, we tested the antipruritic efficacy of TPA023B in a second, hierarchically higher, species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10</xref>). We chose dogs because models of atopic dermatitis that closely mimic natural disease are well-established in this species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and because the tolerability of TPA023B in dogs had already been established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. We performed a pseudo-randomized observer-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial and in twelve beagle dogs sensitized to house dust mites by repeated exposure of their lower abdomen to lyophilized extracts of <italic>Dermatophagoides farinae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. After a sensitization period of 8 weeks during which the dogs were exposed to the extracts once a week, three challenges on three consecutive days were made in week 12. Nine of the 12 dogs developed clinical signs of pruritus and were included in subsequent experiments. These nine dogs were again challenged in weeks 15 and 18 on three consecutive days. The challenge on day 2 was used to obtain baseline values. The challenge on day 3 was followed by TPA023B (20 mg in one tablet, equivalent to about 2 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, p.o.) or placebo administration. The same procedure was repeated in week 18 with a cross-over design. Both the time spent scratching and the numbers of scratching bouts were counted over 6 h after drug administration and normalized to the values on the day before drug exposure. Compared to placebo, a significant reduction was observed for both read-outs. Five of the 9 dogs (56%) responded with a reduction by more than 50% (for responses of the individual dogs see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). These results indicate that specific targeting of α2/α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs alleviates itch not only in mice but also in dogs supporting the potential for translation to more complex species, including possibly, also human patients.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Antipruritic actions of TPA023B in a dog model of allergic itch. <bold>a</bold> Time line of the study.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par17">Local application of TPA023B to the spinal cord and specific genetic ablation of spinal α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs have shown that most if not all of its antipruritic action originates from the spinal (or medullary) dorsal horn. This is consistent with our finding that virtually all GRP and GRPR neurons in the mouse spinal cord express α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R transcripts and more than 60% of these neurons also express α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Using post mortem tissue samples, we confirmed a similar coexpression of α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits on GRP and GRPR neurons for the human spinal cord, in line with the highly conserved expression pattern of spinal GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits in rodents and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par18">MrgprA3 is primarily activated by chloroquine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, the fibers carrying this receptor respond to many pruritogens and convey signals related to both histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A critical role of GRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and GRPR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> neurons in spinal itch circuits is meanwhile also well established. After local spinal ablation of GRP neurons, mice respond less to pruritic stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This is also supported by a study that employed BNP-conjugated saporin to ablate spinal GRP neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Besides GRP and GRPR positive interneurons, neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor expressing neurons of the dorsal horn are also relevant to spinal itch relay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Previous work from our group has shown that these neurons also express α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par19">α2/α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs do not only control itch but also pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> (for a review see ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>). The latter function is supported by the expression of α2/α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs receptors on sensory fibers and dorsal horn nociceptive neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and also by the efficacy of spinal GABAergic neuron transplants against pain and itch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Unlike opioids that reduce pain but cause itch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, drugs targeting α2/α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs should alleviate both itch and pain. Activation of α3GABA<sub>A</sub>R had a stronger impact on scratching responses than α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. This ratio is reverse in case of analgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> in line with the view that sensory fibers and dorsal horn neurons processing itch or pain are not identical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. There were also differences in the contribution of α2 and α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs between models of acute and chronic itch. These may hint at potential neuroplastic changes occurring during the transition from acute to chronic itch.</p>
<p id="Par20">In the present study, we have assessed unwanted effects that typically occur with classical non-selective benzodiazepine site ligands. TPA023B was devoid of sedative effects, did not impair motor coordination and did not lose antipruritic activity during prolonged treatment. The absence of a sedative effect is consistent with the pivotal role of α1GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in benzodiazepine-induced sedation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The increase in locomotor activity observed in the present study is possibly related to the anxiolytic action of α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (see also ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>). Previous studies in triple GABA<sub>A</sub>R point mutated mice have attributed the impairment of motor coordination and tolerance development to α1 or α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The lack of these side effects in TPA023B treated mice may either come from the absence of activity at α1GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs or from the only partial agonistic activity (relative to the full agonist diazepam) at α3GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p>
<p id="Par21">In human patients, the most challenging type of pruritus is chronic non-histaminergic pruritus which is often due to liver or kidney failure or treatment with opioids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. While antihistaminergics provide good itch relief in cases associated with urticaria, other forms respond less well to these drugs or not at all. At present, these conditions are mostly treated off-label with systemically applied anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, antidepressants, opioid antagonists, or more recently with NK1 receptor blockers (aprepitant), or immunosuppressants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. None of these compounds have been approved for systemic treatment of chronic itch conditions. In our study, TPA023B was similarly effective against non-histaminergic and histamine-induced itch, and, in general, more effective in chronic than in acute itch. If the antipruritic efficacy combined with good tolerability observed in the present study translates to human patients, TPA023B or related compounds should be well-suited for the treatment of chronic itch in humans.</p>
<p id="Par22">In a broader context, our study adds to a growing body of evidence indicating that subtype selective GABA<sub>A</sub>R modulators promise not only better tolerability but may also open new avenues to the treatment of disorders that have hitherto not been considered indications for benzodiazepines. Such potential new opportunities include, in addition to itch and pain, cognitive enhancement by inverse agonists at α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, depression and autism spectrum disorders (for a review see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>). Given the wide-spread, almost ubiquitous, expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the CNS, such new opportunities should not come as a surprise.</p>

<title>Skin histology and immunofluorescence</title>
<p id="Par34">Inflamed and healthy back skin was collected. Tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, USA) and frozen on dry ice. Cryostat sections (7 μm) were placed on glass slides, air dried, fixed with acetone for 2 min at −20 °C and subsequently rehydrated with 80% methanol for 5 min at 4 °C. Specimens were incubated with 5% donkey serum, 0.1% Triton-X and 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with rat anti-mouse CD68 (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at 4 °C. The samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-coupled secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342 (all from Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. CD68-stained sections were examined on an Axioskop 2 mot plus microscope (Carl Zeiss, Feldbach, Switzerland), equipped with an AxioCam MRC camera (Zeiss) and a Plan-Apochromat 0.45 NA ×10 objective (Zeiss). Images of at least four individual fields of view were acquired per section using Axio-Vision software 4.8. Using ImageJ v1.49, the fluorescent area was determined between the stratum corneum and an outline thereof shifted 300 µm into the tissue. Results are expressed as CD68-positive area (µm<sup>2</sup>) per µm basement membrane.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recordings in HEK293 cells recordings</title>
<p id="Par35">The effects of TPA023B on currents through recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs were studied in HEK293 cells (ATCC) transiently expressing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. HEK293 cells were transfected using lipofectamine LTX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. To ensure expression of the γ2 subunit (required for modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs by BDZs) in all recorded cells, we transfected cells with a plasmid expressing the γ2 subunit plus eGFP from an IRES, and only selected eGFP-positive cells for recordings. The transfection mixture contained (in µg): 1 α1, 1 β2, 3 γ2/eGFP (used as a marker of successful transfection) or 1 αx, 1 β3, 3 γ2/eGFP in case of α2, α3, or α5GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Recordings were made 18–36 h after transfection. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of GABA-evoked currents were made at room temperature (20–24 °C) and at a holding potential of −60 mV. Recording electrodes were filled with solution containing (in mM): 120 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.40), 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 GTP and 2 ATP. The external solution contained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 10 KCl, 2.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), and 10 glucose. GABA was applied to the recorded cell using a manually controlled pulse (4–6 s) of a low sub-saturating GABA concentration (EC<sub>5</sub>). EC<sub>5</sub> values of GABA were determined for all subunit combinations analyzed. EC<sub>50</sub> values and Hill coefficients (n<sub>H</sub>) were obtained from fits of normalized concentration-response curves to the equation I<sub>GABA</sub> = I<sub>max</sub> [GABA]<sup>nH</sup>/([GABA]<sup>nH</sup> + [EC<sub>50</sub>]<sup>nH</sup>). I<sub>max</sub> was determined as the average maximal current elicited by a concentration of 1 mM GABA. TPA023B was dissolved in DMSO and subsequently diluted with recording solution was co-applied together with GABA without preincubation.</p>

IPSCs were evoked by electrical stimulation (300 µs, 0.2–50 V) at 0.05 Hz using glass electrode filled with aCSF and placed 50–100 µm from the soma of the recorded cell. Experiments were performed in the presence of NBQX (20 µM), AP5 (50 µM), and strychnine (0.5 µM), in order to isolate the GABAergic component of IPSCs. At the end of the recordings bicuculline (10 µM) was added to confirm the GABAergic nature of the recorded IPCSs. The weighted decay time constant (τ<sub>w</sub>) was calculated from dual-exponential fits using the following equation: τ<sub>w</sub> = (τ<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub> + τ<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>)/(A<sub>1</sub> + A<sub>2</sub>) where τ<sub>1</sub> and τ<sub>2</sub> are the fast and the slow decay time constants and A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are the equivalent amplitude weighting factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Access resistance of each neuron was continuously monitored with short hyperpolarizing voltage step applied before the electrical stimulation.

<title>Behavioral experiments in mice</title>
<p id="Par39">All behavioral experiments were performed in 7–12-week-old female and male mice. Care was taken to ensure equal numbers of female and male mice. All behavioral experiments were made by an experimenter, blinded either to the genotype of the mice or to their treatment with drug or vehicle. In experiments involving comparisons between diazepam or TPA023B and vehicle, mice were randomly assigned to the different groups. No formal sample size calculation was made. Group sizes were chosen based on previous experience with the respective behavioral test. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed with electronic von Frey filaments (no. 7; IITC, Woodland Hills, CA) and quantified as the change in the paw withdrawal thresholds measured in g. Heat hyperalgesia was evaluated in the Hargreaves test as the change in the latency of paw withdrawal to a defined heat stimulus. Responses to light mechanical stimulation of the hairy skin was tested as the change in the paw withdrawal responses upon gentle stimulation with a paint brush using the following score: 0 (no evoked movement), 1 (walking away or brief paw lifting of 1 s or less), 2 (sustained lifting of more than 2 s), 3 (strong lateral lifting above a 90° angle) or 4 (flinching/ licking of the affected paw).

<title>Acute itch</title>
<p id="Par40">was assessed in mice that received intradermal microinjections of pruritogens or 0.9% saline into the right cheek, which had been shaved at least 1 day before the experiment. In two sets of experiments that addressed the contribution of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs on primary and secondary pruritoceptors, pruritogens were injected into the skin of the left thigh (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a–c</xref>). Before injection, mice were acclimatized to a 15 cm diameter cylindrical enclosure for more than 30 min with cage bedding on the floor. Background white noise generated by a radio at ambient volume was applied to prevent auditory distraction. A 30 gauge needle was inserted bevel-up and pushed 5 mm horizontally into the skin beyond the point of insertion, before injection of the pruritogen (in a total volume of 10 µl). No anesthesia was used. Correct injection was confirmed by the appearance of a slightly domed bulla. After injection, mice were placed back into the cylindrical enclosure and videotaped for 30 min. Videos were analyzed off-line. Scratching with the hind paw directed to the ipsilateral cheek was counted in bouts, with one bout defined as an instance when the mouse lifted its paw to scratch until it returned the paw to the cage floor. In case of experiments in which the pruritogen was injected into the skin of the thigh, the time spent biting the injected skin area was counted in s min<sup>−1</sup> as a measure of itch.</p>

After a resting period of 7 days, mice were treated with 1% oxazolone in acetone/olive oil (4:1 v v<sup>−1</sup>) on the nape of the neck (100 µl) every other day for 10 days. On the day of the experiment, mice were injected with drug or vehicle i.p. under short light isoflurane anesthesia. Scratching of the hind paw directed to the ipsilateral cheek was quantified as the number of scratching bouts. In the dry skin model, mice were treated with a mixture of acetone and diethylether (1:1) on the shaved nape of the neck for 15 s, followed by distilled water for 30 s, twice daily for 10 days.

<title>Pruritus study in dogs</title>
<p id="Par44">Twelve 6 months-old beagle dogs (6 females, 6 males) weighing between 9.0 and 13.0 kg (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) were included in the study. They were sensitized using lyophilized extracts of the house dust mite <italic>Dermatophagoides farinae</italic> in mineral oil. In order to expose the living epidermis, the skin of the abdomen was tape-stripped. <italic>D. farinae</italic> extract was gently applied on the tape-stripped skin once a week for eight weeks. At this time point, dogs were considered <italic>D. farinae</italic>-sensitized even though most of them (8 out of 12) did not exhibit pruritus or clinical signs of atopic dermatitis. Four weeks later, the dogs were challenged using <italic>D. farinae</italic> extracts after tape stripping of the abdominal skin. This challenge was made on three consecutive days (days 1 to 3). Pruritus and clinical signs were assessed on day 2, 3, and 4. All dogs exhibited pruritus and clinical signs compatible with atopic dermatitis on the site of challenge but also in remote areas. After the third challenge all dogs exhibited histological signs of atopic dermatitis and nine dogs showed positive reactions in intradermal allergen exposure test. These nine dogs were enrolled to assess the antipruritic effect of TPA023B in a randomized placebo-controlled observer-blind cross-over study. TPA023B was administered at a dose of 20 mg per dog as a tablet, 30 min after the challenge. For the following 6 h, dogs were kept in groups of three in closed arenas of 2 × 4 m and continuously video recorded. Both the number of scratching bouts and the total time spent scratching per hour were determined. Recordings were made on the day of the second challenge (baseline) and on the following day after drug or placebo administration. The same procedure was done three weeks later with switched treatment (TPA023B and placebo). Number of scratching bout and total time spent scratching were normalized to the control values obtained the day before (second challenge). We did not correct our outcome parameters for baseline scratching present in the absence of the pruritogenic challenge. Blood samples were taken from all dogs at the end of the video recording and whole blood concentrations of TPA023B were measured by high performance liquid chromatography/high resolution electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry to verify drug exposure.</p>
