<abstract>
<p>AIM: To determine the prevalence of bipolar disorder (BD) and sub-threshold symptoms in
children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) through 14 years’
follow-up, when participants were between 21-24 years old.</p>
<p>METHODS: First, we examined rates of BD type I and II diagnoses in youth
participating in the NIMH-funded Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD (MTA). We used the
diagnostic interview schedule for children (DISC), administered to both parents (DISC-P) and
youth (DISCY). We compared the MTA study subjects with ADHD (<italic>n</italic> = 579) to a
local normative comparison group (LNCG, <italic>n</italic> = 289) at 4 different assessment
points: 6, 8, 12, and 14 years of follow-ups. To evaluate the bipolar variants, we compared
total symptom counts (TSC) of DSM manic and hypomanic symptoms that were generated by DISC in
ADHD and LNCG subjects. Then we sub-divided the TSC into pathognomonic manic (PM) and
non-specific manic (NSM) symptoms. We compared the PM and NSM in ADHD and LNCG at each
assessment point and over time. We also evaluated the irritability as category A2 manic symptom
in both groups and over time. Finally, we studied the irritability symptom in correlation with
PM and NSM in ADHD and LNCG subjects.</p>
<p>RESULTS: DISC-generated BD diagnosis did not differ significantly in rates between ADHD
(1.89%) and LNCG 1.38%). Interestingly, no participant met BD diagnosis more than once in the 4
assessment points in 14 years. However, on the symptom level, ADHD subjects reported
significantly higher mean TSC scores: ADHD 3.0; LNCG 1.7; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. ADHD
status was associated with higher mean NSM: ADHD 2.0 <italic>vs</italic> LNCG 1.1;
<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001. Also, ADHD subjects had higher PM symptoms than LNCG, with PM
means over all time points of 1.3 ADHD; 0.9 LNCG; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001. Examining both
NSM and PM, ADHD status associated with greater NSM than PM. However, Over 14 years, the NSM
symptoms declined and changed to PM over time (df 3, 2523; F = 20.1; <italic>P</italic> &lt;
0.0001). Finally, Irritability (BD DSM criterion-A2) rates were significantly higher in ADHD
than LNCG (χ<sup>2</sup> = 122.2, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), but irritability was
associated more strongly with NSM than PM (df 3, 2538; F = 43.2; <italic>P</italic> &lt;
0.0001).</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: Individuals with ADHD do not appear to be at significantly greater risk for
developing BD, but do show higher rates of BD symptoms, especially NSM. The greater linkage of
irritability to NSM than to PM suggests caution when making BD diagnoses based on irritability
alone as one of 2 (A-level) symptoms for BD diagnosis, particularly in view of its frequent
presentation with other psychopathologies.</p>
