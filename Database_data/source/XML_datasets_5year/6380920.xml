<p id="P3">Macrophages enforce anti-tumor immunity by engulfing and killing tumor cells. Although these functions are determined by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals, the role of macrophage metabolism is unknown. Here, we study the capacity of macrophages to circumvent inhibitory activity mediated by CD47 on cancer cells. We show that stimulation with CpG, a TLR9 agonist, evokes changes in the central carbon metabolism of macrophages that enable anti-tumor activity, including engulfment of CD47<sup>+</sup> cancer cells. CpG activation engenders a metabolic state, that requires fatty acid oxidation and shunting of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates for <italic>de novo</italic> lipid biosynthesis. This integration of metabolic inputs is underpinned by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A and ATP citrate lyase, which together, impart macrophages with anti-tumor potential capable of overcoming inhibitory CD47 on cancer cells. Our findings identify central carbon metabolism to be a novel determinant and potential therapeutic target for stimulating anti-tumor activity by macrophages.</p>

<p id="P4">Macrophages govern the immune landscape of many cancers and are key proponents of tumor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, macrophages can also enact anti-tumor functions. These opposing roles are explained by the phenotypic polarity of macrophages, which are often classified as either pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages that enforce anti-tumor immunity or immunosuppressive M2 macrophages that promote tumor progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. While macrophages most commonly adopt a phenotype that is supportive of tumor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, their biology is pliable. As a result, under the appropriate conditions, macrophages can be redirected with anti-tumor activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The mechanisms that determine pro- versus anti-tumor functions of macrophages, though, are still being elucidated.</p>
<p id="P5">One mechanism governing pro- and anti-tumor roles of macrophages is the balance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals. For example, a key negative regulator of macrophage activity is CD47, a membrane-bound protein overexpressed by many cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. CD47 is a “don’t eat me” signal that suppresses the phagocytic activity of macrophages upon binding SIRPα (signal regulatory protein α)-receptor present on phagocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Blocking CD47-SIRPα binding promotes macrophage engulfment of tumor cells and induces anti-tumor responses in multiple xenograft models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, in models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), CD47-blockade as a monotherapy has shown modest anti-tumor efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, which may be explained by the limited pro-phagocytic effect of CD47-blockade seen in non-hematopoietic tumor models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that additional stimuli are required to potentiate anti-tumor activity by macrophages.</p>
<p id="P6">Macrophage stimulation is directed by cytokines and agonists of pathogen recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which together determine macrophage phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Unique combinations of stimuli have been used <italic>in vitro</italic> to define classical phenotypic states of macrophages, such as M1 and M2. However, in pathological settings, such as cancer, macrophages more commonly acquire phenotypes that span a spectrum of differentiation states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">When examined using systems-based approaches, macrophage phenotypes can be distinguished by their core metabolic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. For example, M1 macrophages rely on glycolytic metabolism and reduced oxidative phosphorylation, whereas M2 macrophages perform <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis and glutaminolysis to support fatty acid oxidation (FAO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Additional studies support an association between M2-macrophage polarity and FAO, but indicate that these can also occur independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In particular, FAO and lipid metabolism underpin the anti-tumor functions of multiple myeloid subsets (e.g. dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Similarly, lipid availability can modulate macrophage engulfment of red blood cells and macromolecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Together, these findings underscore the potential role of metabolism in defining myeloid cell biology and suggest that lipid metabolism may likewise coordinate macrophage function in cancer.</p>
<p id="P8">To understand the metabolic determinants that govern macrophage anti-tumor function, we utilized metabolomic approaches and a syngeneic model of PDAC to study macrophage engulfment of PDAC cells upon TLR stimulation. Further, we leveraged targeted knockout of CD47 in PDAC cells to understand how macrophage activation acts in concert with inhibition of anti-phagocytic signals present in cancer. Our studies reveal a novel role for metabolic pathways in regulating macrophage anti-tumor functions and underscore the potential of targeting macrophage metabolism for overriding inhibitory signals used by cancer cells to evade elimination by innate immunity.</p>

<title>Macrophage activation, but not loss of inhibitory CD47, is sufficient for anti-tumor activity in PDAC</title>
<p id="P9">Macrophages can be induced with therapeutic and anti-tumor functions by activating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways such as CD40 and TLRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, macrophage biology is ultimately determined by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals that are sensed within the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 1a</xref>). One major inhibitory signal that is involved in suppressing macrophage anti-tumor activity is CD47, which is overexpressed on cancer cells across a wide range of solid malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Elevated CD47 can be detected in both mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 1b–c</xref>) and human PDAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, we initially studied the role of CD47 as a macrophage-inhibitory signal in a murine model of PDAC. To do this, we administered a CD47-blocking antibody via intratumoral delivery to mice implanted with Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup> Trp53<sup>R172H/+</sup> mutant PDAC tumors. In this fully syngeneic and immunocompetent model, antibody blockade of CD47 did not alter tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). To address possible limitations in bioavailability or insufficient blockade, expression of <italic>Cd47</italic> was ablated in PDAC cells using transient expression of CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 1d–e</xref>). Unlike models of leukemia where CD47 overexpression is a key determinant of immune escape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, deletion of <italic>Cd47</italic> in PDAC cells did not impact tumor engraftment or growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>). This observation suggested that mechanisms other than CD47 can regulate macrophage-dependent anti-tumor responses in PDAC, consistent with xenograft models of this disease and other non-hematopoietic malignacies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In support of this finding, we also found that antibody blockade of CD47 on PDAC cells did not enhance <italic>in vitro</italic> phagocytosis by murine bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">We next hypothesized that PDAC cells might not provide sufficient activating signals to stimulate macrophages with anti-tumor functions, and that delivery of discrete stimuli may be necessary to induce macrophages with anti-tumor activity. We tested a panel of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway agonists for their capacity to stimulate macrophages with anti-tumor functions, such as phagocytosis. In the absence of TLR stimulation, mock-treated BMDMs lacked the capacity to phagocytose tumor cells upon co-culture with PDAC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Further, the phagocytic capacity of BMDMs increased only modestly with 24-hour pretreatment with Pam3CSK4, Poly(I:C), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagellin, and imiquimod – which stimulate TLR1 &amp; TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR7, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>). In contrast, ODN1826, a Class B CpG oligonucleotide that preferentially stimulates TLR9 expressed by macrophages and B cells, was found to be a potent activator of macrophage phagocytosis of PDAC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d–e</xref>). Upon increasing the duration of CpG pretreatment, CpG-activated macrophages (CpG-BMDM) exhibited enhanced phagocytic capacity relative to mock-stimulated macrophages (mock-BMDM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1f</xref>). To ascertain the potential of CpG-activation to produce anti-tumor activity, we also performed an extended co-culture of pretreated macrophages with PDAC cells for 48 hours. We found that CpG-activation rendered macrophages with potent anti-tumor activity leading to a decrease in tumor cell survival in comparison to co-culture with mock-BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g</xref>). Together, these data show loss of inhibitory CD47 alone to be insufficient for unleashing anti-tumor activity by macrophages in PDAC, and that an activated phenotype is also necessary for macrophages to engage in anti-tumor functions.</p>

<title>Tumor-associated macrophages are essential for CpG-activated anti-tumor responses</title>
<p id="P11">We next evaluated the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumor activity of CpG on established murine PDAC tumor growth. Treatment was initiated with intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (PBS) or CpG on day 10 with repeated administration every other day for a total of five doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>). CpG treatment potently suppressed tumor growth in two independent PDAC tumor models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b–c</xref>). Although tumors ultimately relapsed, CpG significantly prolonged overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>) without inducing gross toxicity or lethality. This effect was also independent of any direct cytotoxic activity of CpG on tumor cells, as treatment of PDAC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> with supratherapeutic concentrations of CpG did not affect tumor cell survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Repeated dosing of CpG to non-tumor bearing mice has been found to stimulate a macrophage activation syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, we examined the impact of treatment on the systemic release of inflammatory cytokines. We found that <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery of CpG to tumor-bearing mice increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum, including TNF, IFN-γ, and CCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>). Consistent with this increase in inflammatory and chemotactic factors, we observed an increase in tumor-associated macrophages following CpG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a–b</xref>). In addition, we detected an increase in F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells in CpG-treated tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 3</xref>). To ascertain the role of tumor-associated macrophages in the response to CpG treatment, we depleted distinct macrophage populations using GW2580, an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1-receptor (CSF1Ri), and clodronate encapsulated liposomes (CEL), which target phagocytes residing outside of the tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Depletion with either CEL or CSF1Ri alone did not affect tumor outgrowth in the vehicle-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). In contrast, CSF1Ri abrogated the anti-tumor effect of CpG, whereas CEL did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). Similarly, we found that administration of an anti-CSF1R antibody attenuated the CpG-induced anti-tumor response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>). These findings implicated a CSF1R<sup>+</sup> population of macrophages, which are not targeted by liposomes, in mediating the anti-tumor response by CpG. Consistent with this observation, we found that CEL did not alter macrophage presence within tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>), whereas both CSF1Ri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a–b</xref>) and anti-CSF1R antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>) treatment decreased the abundance of tumor-associated macrophages.</p>
<p id="P13">To ascertain the possible contribution of other immune effectors, we considered a role for lymphocytes in CpG-induced anti-tumor activity. We found that CpG did not significantly alter the infiltration of T cell subsets (CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) into tumors (data not shown). In addition, we detected no significant change in the expression of immune regulatory markers, including PD-1 and Tim3, by T cells after CpG treatment (data not shown). CpG-induced anti-tumor activity was also preserved in Rag2-deficient mice bearing PDAC.1 tumors, thereby excluding a role for lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 4a</xref>). Anti-tumor activity induced with CpG was also preserved in mice depleted of natural killer (NK) cells using the anti-NK1.1 antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 4b</xref>). In addition, we found that depletion of dendritic cells (DC) using the CD11c-DTR-eGFP mouse model did not alter the anti-tumor response stimulated by CpG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 4c</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that T and B lymphocytes as well as DC and NK cells are not required for the anti-tumor response induced by CpG.</p>
<p id="P14">We have previously shown a role for peripheral blood myeloid cells in mediating anti-tumor activity against PDAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, we investigated the expression of CSF1R on myeloid cell populations in the peripheral blood. We found that CSF1R was expressed by a subset of CD11b<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells bearing high levels of the monocyte marker Ly6C (data not shown), which marks a population of myeloid cells that have been previously shown to be recruited to PDAC tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Further, administration of an anti-CSF1R antibody significantly reduced the Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> myeloid population in the peripheral blood (data not shown). We also found, similar to CSF1Ri and anti-CSF1R treatment, that anti-Ly6C antibodies, which deplete the Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocyte population <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, blocked both the accumulation of F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3f</xref>) and the CpG-induced anti-tumor response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3g</xref>). Together, these data implicate myeloid cells marked by expression of Ly6C and CSF1R in the anti-tumor activity induced by CpG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>CpG activation of macrophages bypasses inhibitory CD47 on PDAC cells</title>
<p id="P15">We next sought to understand the mechanism by which CpG stimulates macrophages with enhanced phagocytic and anti-tumor activity. We hypothesized that CpG might alter the capacity of macrophages to respond to CD47 as a negative regulatory signal. To test this, we assessed the impact of CpG on SIRPα expression. However, we observed no changes in SIRPα surface expression with increasing duration of CpG-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>). We also examined the effect of CpG-activation on macrophage-inhibitory signals present <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found that CpG-BMDMs phagocytosed PDAC cells that either expressed or lacked CD47, indicating that CpG stimulates macrophages with anti-tumor activity that is independent, at least in part, of CD47 as a macrophage-inhibitory signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>). This finding was generalizable as CpG-activation enabled macrophage engulfment of CD47-expressing syngeneic tumor cells derived from breast cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, lung cancer and lymphoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>). CD47-blockade alone also showed limited capacity to enhance macrophage phagocytosis in these tumors, except for EL4 lymphoma cells. However, despite limited activity by itself, we found that genetic ablation of CD47 in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>) as well as CD47 blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>) significantly enhanced the capacity of CpG-stimulated macrophages to phagocytose tumor cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, implying that appropriate macrophage-activation signals are critical for overcoming CD47 in non-hematopoietic tumors.</p>
<p id="P16">Prior studies have suggested that TLR agonists might promote phagocytic and anti-tumor activity by stimulating macrophages to produce calreticulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. To test this possibility, we quantified calreticulin expression – including both membrane-bound and intracellular levels – but detected no differences between mock-BMDMs and CpG-BMDMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 5</xref>). Further, upon extended co-culture, CpG-BMDMs effectively eliminated PDAC cells, with loss of CD47 expression in tumor cells providing an additive benefit in anti-tumor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). However, the ability of CpG to promote anti-tumor activity by macrophages despite CD47 expression on tumor cells is in contrast with other TLR agonists, for which blockade of CD47 is critical for macrophage activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P17">We then asked whether disruption of CD47 enhances the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumor activity of macrophages. Delivery of CpG to mice bearing control or CD47 knockout (<italic>Cd47</italic><sup>–/–</sup>) tumors produced similar increases in the relative abundance of tumor-associated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4e–f</xref>). The impact of CpG on tumor growth was also similar in tumors that expressed or lacked CD47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4g</xref>). These findings underscore the dominant response elicited by CpG activation of macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic> that can overcome CD47 expressed by PDAC cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>CpG induces a shift in macrophage metabolism</title>
<p id="P18">Microenvironmental cues can induce distinct phenotypes in macrophages. For example, the combination of LPS and IFN-γ promote an M1 phenotype in macrophages, which is associated with pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In contrast, the combination of IL-4 and IL-13 endows macrophages with M2-polarity, which suppresses inflammation and promotes tumor growth. To study the direct effect of CpG on macrophage polarity, we evaluated CpG-BMDMs for markers associated with M1 and M2 macrophages, including arginase 1 (Arg1), CD206, MHC-II, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-6 and IL-12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We found that CpG-activation increased the expression of both iNOS and Arg1 which are associated with M1(LPS) and M2(IL-4) macrophages, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>). However, CpG did not significantly alter expression of MHC-II or CD206, markers increased by M1(LPS) and M2(IL-4) polarization, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b</xref>). CpG also induced production of both pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-6, IL-12, CCL2, and TNF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-10) relative to mock-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5c</xref>). Further examination of additional markers revealed that CpG did not modulate IL-4R alpha, CD80 or CD86, but upregulated expression of FcγRIII and PD-L1 (data not shown).</p>
<p id="P19">Pro-inflammatory stimuli can also alter macrophage metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, we sought to understand the impact of CpG-activation on the metabolic state of macrophages by assessing their ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) and OCR (oxygen consumption rate). We found that CpG and several other TLR agonists increased ECAR relative to mock-BMDMs, indicating an increase in glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 6</xref>). However, distinct from other TLR agonists, CpG elevated the basal OCR of macrophages, signifying higher rates of oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5e–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 6</xref>). This metabolic change seen in CpG-stimulated macrophages is consistent with metabolic activation seen in dendritic cells in response to CpG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Further, we observed that the basal OCR of macrophages increased with prolonged CpG stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5g</xref>) and corresponded with reduced spare respiratory capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5h</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CpG-activation confers a unique metabolic shift in macrophages and that CpG-activated macrophages do not fully conform to the classical M1(LPS) or M2(IL-4) classification.</p>

<title>Lipid metabolism is critical for anti-tumor functions induced by CpG</title>
<p id="P20">We next investigated the significance of elevated oxygen consumption in response to CpG activation by first assessing mitochondrial abundance in macrophages. CpG-BMDMs exhibited an increase in total mitochondria, in comparison to mock-BMDMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Figure 7a</xref>). To further evaluate changes in mitochondrial function, we tested the contribution of FAO toward elevated oxygen consumption under normal culture conditions, in the presence of serum and without other exogenous lipids. FAO was restricted using etomoxir, an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) that is involved in fatty acid breakdown. We found that FAO-inhibition blocked the CpG-induced increase in macrophage OCR without affecting the maximal respiratory capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6a–b</xref>). Furthermore, FAO inhibition with etomoxir attenuated the capacity of CpG-BMDMs to phagocytose PDAC cells, whether they expressed inhibitory CD47 or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6c–d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P21">To test the role of FAO for the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumor activity induced by CpG, etomoxir was administered daily to mice beginning on day 9 prior to initiating CpG treatment on day 10. We found that etomoxir treatment blocked the anti-tumor effect of CpG, whereas treatment with etomoxir alone had no significant impact on tumor outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6e</xref>). Importantly, etomoxir treatment also did not alter the abundance of F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, indicating that the inhibitory effect observed was not a result of depletion or exclusion of macrophages from the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6f</xref>). Rather, the inhibitory effect of etomoxir was associated with decreased engulfment of tumor cells by F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 3</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate a key role for FAO in macrophage-dependent anti-tumor activity induced with CpG.</p>

<title><italic>De novo</italic> lipogenesis, but not exogenous fatty acids, are critical for CpG-activated anti-tumor activity</title>
<p id="P22">To define the metabolic changes induced by CpG, we assessed the abundance of short chain coenzyme A (CoA) species in mock- and CpG-treated macrophages. We hypothesized that an increase in FAO in CpG-BMDMs would require breakdown and incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into acetyl-CoA and TCA substrates. Surprisingly, we found that the incorporation of labeling from <sup>13</sup>C-palmitate into acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA was decreased in CpG-BMDMs, indicating that substrates other than exogenous palmitate likely serve as precursors for generating acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA in response to CpG stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7a–b</xref>). We next investigated the impact of CpG on increased fatty acid uptake which is a key feature of M2 macrophages. We found that CpG-BMDMs did not upregulate fatty acid transporters such as CD36 which instead, was significantly downregulated in response to CpG stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 7b</xref>). In addition, CpG-BMDMs showed a limited increase in the uptake of BODIPY-labeled palmitate, indicating that utilization of exogenous fatty acids was not significantly altered in macrophages by CpG stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 7c</xref>). Together, these findings illustrate that while CpG-macrophages share several metabolic features with M2 macrophages, such as their oxidative phenotype, they differ significantly in their utilization of exogenous fatty acids.</p>
<p id="P23">We proceeded to examine alternative pathways that may support metabolic activation in CpG-BMDMs. Upon substitution of glucose or glutamine with <sup>13</sup>C-glucose or <sup>13</sup>C-glutamine in the media, the relative total pool sizes for acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA and HMG (hydroxymethylglutaryl)-CoA increased in CpG-BMDMs compared to mock-BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7c</xref>). The percent of acetyl-CoA derived from glucose (M+2 isotopologue) increased in CpG-BMDMs relative to mock-BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7d</xref>). This shift was accompanied by a decreased percent of acetyl-CoA derived from glutamine (M+2 isotopologue) in CpG-BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7d</xref>). Conversely, incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C-glucose into succinyl-CoA (M+4 isotopologue) decreased upon CpG-stimulation, and was accompanied by an increase in labeled, glutamine-derived succinyl-CoA (M+4 isotopologue) in CpG-BMDMs compared to mock-BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7e</xref>). Together, these data show that CpG activation of macrophages promotes a shift away from complete utilization of carbon from glucose and toward glutamine anaplerosis for generating TCA cycle intermediates such as succinyl-CoA.</p>
<p id="P24">The incorporation of glucose into acetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA (a precursor for the cholesterol synthesis pathway) seen in CpG-stimulated BMDMs was consistent with a shunting by ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of cholesterol and/or lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Lipid metabolism can impact multiple biological processes in macrophages, including cellular organelle production, cytokine secretion, and lipid membrane properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, we examined a role for secretory capacity in CpG-induced macrophage phagocytosis. We found that blocking endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretion using brefeldin A inhibited CpG-induced phagocytosis of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 7d</xref>). This finding was consistent with previous work showing a role for the ER as a source of membrane for phagocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next hypothesized that disruption of ACLY would alter membrane properties and directly impede the anti-tumor activity of CpG-activated macrophages. We found that inhibition of ACLY during CpG-induced macrophage activation attenuated the oxidative phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7f</xref>) and reversed membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 7e</xref>), an established regulator of macrophage phagocytosis. Consistent with this, we also found that inhibition of ACYL abrogated the anti-tumor phagocytic activity of CpG-stimulated macrophages even with combined CD47 ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7g</xref>). Together, our findings demonstrate that CpG imparts macrophages with a unique metabolic state, defined by enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and a shunting of TCA cycle intermediates, which determines their anti-tumor potential and capacity to circumvent inhibitory signals received by CD47 expressed on malignant cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P25">Macrophages dominate the microenvironment of many cancers, wherein they are directed toward a pro-tumor role and restricted in their anti-tumor potential. The capacity of macrophages to engulf and kill tumor cells is countervailed by their phenotype as well as inhibitory signals present within their surrounding microenvironment, including the anti-phagocytic molecule CD47, which is overexpressed by malignant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Our study identifies the central carbon metabolism of macrophages as a regulator of their anti-tumor functions, including the capacity to phagocytose tumor cells. We found that redirection of macrophages toward an oxidative phenotype is essential for anti-tumor activity induced by CpG stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. CpG-stimulated alterations in macrophage metabolism were necessary for circumventing inhibitory signals mediated by CD47. Together, our findings highlight rewiring macrophage metabolism – by promoting FAO and redirecting the use of TCA intermediates – as a mechanism to circumvent negative regulatory signals present on malignant cells and to endow macrophages with anti-tumor potential.</p>
<p id="P26">Inhibitory signals expressed by tumor cells may not always be dominant in regulating anti-tumor activity by macrophages. Unlike findings in other cancers, we found that disruption of CD47 activity via antibody-blockade was not sufficient for inciting anti-tumor responses in an immunocompetent tumor model of PDAC. Deletion of tumor-expressed CD47 was also not sufficient for inducing <italic>in vitro</italic> phagocytosis of tumor cells or <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumor responses. The absence of macrophage activity in this setting was not due to a lack of pro-phagocytic signals as treatment with CD47-blocking antibodies, which contain Fc-domains for driving Fc receptor dependent pro-phagocytic signals in macrophages, also failed to elicit macrophage anti-tumor activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, in the absence of macrophage activation via CpG stimulation, we found that CD47-blocking antibodies were insufficient for stimulating macrophage phagocytosis of multiple solid tumor types including colorectal, glioblastoma, melanoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer. Our data support a conceptual model in which inhibitory signals, such as CD47, can be overcome by the activation state of macrophages, which is defined by core metabolic pathways that govern their anti-tumor potential. Consistent with this, we observed a significant role for CD47 in regulating macrophage anti-tumor activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, but only when macrophages were activated with CpG, which provides rationale for combining CD47 antagonists with myeloid agonists. However, this finding was not appreciated <italic>in vivo</italic> where CpG-induced anti-tumor activity was indistinguishable between tumors that expressed or lacked CD47. This may reflect the emergence of additional anti-phagocytic signals that are redundant with CD47 expressed by tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> or even the capacity of CpG to more effectively activate macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic> to circumvent inhibitory signals mediated by CD47.</p>
<p id="P27">The functional consequences of metabolic changes in macrophages has remained poorly defined in cancer, despite findings to suggest that lipid metabolism has a pivotal role in governing the anti-tumor functions of several other immune cell types (e.g. myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, and T-cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. We showed that, similar to M1 macrophages, CpG-activated macrophages redirected exogenous fatty acids and glucose toward acetyl-CoA generation and <italic>de novo</italic> lipid biosynthesis. We also found, as seen in M2 macrophages, that FAO and glutaminolysis were essential for the oxidative phenotype of CpG-activated macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Notably, M2 macrophages are recognized to possess superior abilities than M1 macrophages in phagocytosing antibody-opsonized tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, suggesting an association between FAO and phagocytic capacity. Functionally, FAO in anti-tumor macrophages may enable the breakdown of large lipid loads after engulfment of target cells or fulfill the metabolic demands for phagocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Together, our findings substantiate the importance of lipid metabolism as a dominant regulator of anti-tumor activity by macrophages.</p>
<p id="P28">Changes in lipid metabolism can alter plasma membrane properties in macrophages and in doing so, confer them with an ability to phagocytose more effectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Our data show enhancement of membrane fluidity induced by CpG, that is dependent on acetyl-CoA shunting for <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis. In turn, membrane fluidity can modulate CD47-SIRPα signaling and receptor clustering at phagocytic synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Macrophage activation by TLRs has been shown to promote lipid-modifying programs that alter ceramide and sphingolipid species which may influence the membrane properties of macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Analogously, CpG-activation enhances lipogenesis in macrophages, which consequently modulates secretory function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, we identified secretory pathways between the ER and Golgi to be critical for CpG-induced phagocytosis. In non-cancerous settings, lipogenesis supports macrophage engulfment of microparticles, due to its role in phospholipid synthesis and expansion of cellular organelles (e.g. ER and Golgi)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. However, the relevance of <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis for macrophage activity in cancer and for circumventing inhibitory signals of phagocytosis (i.e. CD47) has not been previously reported. We find that CpG increases mitochondrial abundance and enhances FAO, along with shunting of acetyl-CoA toward cholesterol biosynthesis. This mechanism is necessary for CpG to endow macrophages with the capacity to phagocytose tumor cells, without need for engaging Fc-receptors or blocking CD47 activity.</p>
<p id="P29">Most clinical studies evaluating CpG oligonucleotides have investigated subcutaneous delivery and weekly administration with the goal of stimulating dendritic cells and mobilizing T cell immunity. However, thus far, CpG has demonstrated limited efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. In contrast to these studies, we administered CpG systemically and repeatedly to incite robust and sustained macrophage activation. Our data suggest that activation of adaptive immunity may not always be required for CpG-induced anti-tumor activity and support evaluating the potential of CpG to stimulate macrophage anti-tumor activity in the clinical setting.</p>
<p id="P30">The mechanisms involved in shifting the role of macrophages from pro- to anti-tumor have remained poorly defined. We found that CSF1R<sup>+</sup> macrophages were necessary for mounting an anti-tumor response upon CpG-activation, despite this subset of macrophages being associated with immunosuppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Our findings show a role for core metabolic processes, which act in concert as a key regulator of macrophage anti-tumor activity. Our findings also highlight the importance of the metabolic state of macrophages for circumventing immune checkpoint signals with implications for broadening the impact of immunotherapy and identify macrophage metabolism as a novel therapeutic target that must be appropriately wired to enable macrophages to carry out anti-tumor functions.</p>

<p id="P46">BMDMs and tumor cells were seeded at 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well into a 96-well plate and treated with inhibitors diluted in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamax, and 10 ng/ml gentamicin. After 4 hours, the media was removed, and samples were stained with 0.05% w/v crystal violet (Sigma) in 20% ethanol/80% H<sub>2</sub>O. Samples were then washed and optical density measured at 570 nm using a Spectramax M3 spectrophotometer. Cell viability was determined by normalizing optical density of treated conditions to mock-treated controls.</p>

<title><sup>13</sup>C metabolite tracing.</title>
<p id="P47">After pretreatment with CpG or vehicle for 96 hours, macrophages were counted and seeded at 4×10<sup>6</sup> cells per sample. For glucose and glutamine labeling, U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose and U-<sup>13</sup>C-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) were substituted into DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed FCS (Life Technologies), 4 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), and 25 mM glucose (Sigma). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in labeled media for 2 hours prior to harvest. For palmitate labeling, cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 100 μM U-<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories),10% v/v charcoal-stripped FCS (Life Technologies), 4 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), and 25mM glucose (Sigma) for 4 hours. Both tracer experiments included unlabeled control samples not exposed to <sup>13</sup>C-labeled substrates. After incubation, cells harvested and placed on ice. Samples were then pelleted, washed in cold PBS, and harvested in 750 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO cat. #T6399) and internal standard containing <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>1</sub>-labeled acyl-CoAs generated in <italic>pan6</italic>-deficient yeast culture were added to each sample in equal amounts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Acyl-CoA thioester were analyzed by LC-MS/HRMS using an Ultimate 3000 autosampler coupled to a Thermo Q Exactive Plus instrument in positive ESI mode using the settings described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Isotopologue enrichment in cells exposed to <sup>13</sup>C labeled substrates was calculated using unlabeled control samples not exposed to <sup>13</sup>C substrate as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. For relative total pool quantitation, the total AUC for each acyl-CoA species (sum of all relevant isotopologues) was normalized to the AUC for the <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>1</sub>-labeled internal standard specific for that species. As previously described (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), samples were centrifuged at 1,200×g for 10 min at 4 °C and pulse-sonicated with a probe sonicator (Fisher Scientific). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000×g for 15 min, and the supernatants were further purified by solid-phase extraction using (OASIS HLB) columns. Supernatants were then applied, and columns were washed with 1 ml H<sub>2</sub>O. Analytes were eluted in 25 mM ammonium acetate in methanol and evaporated to dryness overnight by N<sub>2</sub> gas. Samples were resuspended in 50 μl of 5% 5-sulfosalicylic acid and 10 μl injections were applied in LC/ESI/MS/MS analysis. Isotopologues were designated as unlabeled (M+0), containing one <sup>13</sup>C isotope (M+1), two <sup>13</sup>C isotopes (M+2), etc following tracer labeling.</p>

<title>Statistics and software analysis.</title>
<p id="P49"><italic>P</italic>-values were calculated using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test and Hochberg correction for multiple comparison testing, unless stated otherwise. Linear mixed effects models (LMEM) were built to include random effects for each cell and image fields; statistical differences between treatment conditions were determined by ANOVA comparison of LMEM models. For survival analysis, significance was determined using the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test. <italic>P</italic>-values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. Error bars indicate standard deviation unless stated otherwise. Data analysis and graphical design was performed using R software (v3.4.3), R-studio, and additional R-packages: ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, EBimages, lme4, kmsurv, and heatmap.2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis was completed using FlowJo (v10.3), and figure design utilized Adobe Illustrator CS6.</p>
