<p id="P1">The equivalence of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) remains controversial. Here we use genetically matched hESC and hiPSC lines to assess the contribution of cellular origin (hESC vs hiPSC), the Sendai virus (SeV) reprogramming method and, genetic background to transcriptional patterns while controlling for cell-line clonality and sex. We find that transcriptional variation originating from genetic background dominates over variation due to cellular origin or SeV infection. Moreover, the 49 differentially expressed genes we detected between isogenic hESCs and hiPSCs neither predicted functional outcome nor distinguished an independently derived, larger set of unmatched hESC and hiPSC lines. We conclude that hESCs and hiPSCs are molecularly and functionally equivalent and cannot be distinguished by a consistent gene expression signature. Our data further imply that genetic background variation is a major confounding factor for transcriptional comparisons of pluripotent cell lines, explaining some of the previously observed expression differences between unmatched hESCs and hiPSCs.</p>
<p id="P2">The question of whether hiPSCs, derived from somatic cells by overexpression of the transcription factors Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc (OKSM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, are equivalent to hESCs, the gold standard of pluripotent cell lines, is becoming increasingly urgent as patient-specific hiPSCs are advanced toward clinical application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Initial studies showed that hESC and hiPSC lines are fundamentally different at the transcriptional level, whereas subsequent work concluded that they are virtually indistinguishable when comparing larger sample sets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. More recent reports using refined gene expression analyses found small sets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, the origins of these DEGs, their consistency across independent studies and their impact on the differentiation potential of hiPSC lines remain unclear. Transcriptional patterns are influenced by numerous biological and technical parameters that may confound results. The reprogramming method, including the choice of integrating versus non-integrating factor delivery systems, can alter gene expression in iPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Likewise, genetic background may influence transcriptional signatures in pluripotent cell lines since iPSCs derived from different individuals are reportedly more divergent than iPSCs derived from the same individual. The difference between the clonal origin of hiPSC lines, derived from single somatic cells, and the polyclonal origin of most hESC lines may also introduce transcriptional variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. An additional consideration is the sex of cell lines and defects in X chromosome reactivation in female hiPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Some of these variables have been addressed in previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, but, to our knowledge, no comparative study of hESCs and hiPSCs has accounted for all of them.</p>
<p id="P3">We previously showed that comparing genetically matched mouse ESC and integration-free iPSC lines eliminates most of the transcriptional variation observed between unmatched cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Although we could not identify consistent transcriptional differences between mouse ESC and iPSC lines, we discovered a small group of transcripts that was aberrantly silenced in a subset of iPSC lines, which adversely affected their developmental potential. Here we extend our analyses to the human system and ask whether molecular differences can be identified in hiPSC lines relative to hESC lines that cannot be attributed to the SeV reprogramming method, genetic background, clonal origin or sex, and whether any such differences impact functional outcomes.</p>

<title>Approach to generate isogenic hESCs and hiPSCs</title>
<p id="P4">To compare hESCs with genetically matched hiPSC lines devoid of viral integrations, we generated hiPSCs from <italic>in vitro</italic>-differentiated hESCs using a non-integrating Sendai virus (SeV)-based reprogramming system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>; SeV is an RNA virus that is diluted from infected cells in a replication-dependent manner, leaving no genetic footprint behind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). We chose two well-characterized hESC lines, HUES2 and HUES3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, for these experiments. We selected male hESC lines because female iPSCs can exhibit defects in X chromosome reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, which might confound subsequent interpretations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">First, we subcloned each line in order to ensure genetic and epigenetic homogeneity of cells and to properly control for the clonal origin of hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We differentiated one hESC subclone from each background by switching cells to serum-containing medium without basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which is critical for the maintenance of hESCs, and sorting fibroblast-like cells based on CD90<sup>+</sup>/TRA-1-81<sup>−</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A,C</xref>). These fibroblast-like cells, which resemble primary human fibroblasts by morphological criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), did not form Alkaline Phosphatase (AP)-positive colonies in hESC media, indicating successful differentiation and the absence of residual pluripotent cells in the culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Analysis of global gene expression by RNA-sequencing revealed that the fibroblast-like cells were highly similar to dermal fibroblasts but distinct from pluripotent stem cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). Pluripotency-associated promoters, such as <italic>POU5F1, LEFTY1, TDGF1,</italic> and <italic>SCNN1A,</italic> were re-methylated and decreased in expression levels whereas fibroblast-specific promoters such as <italic>TMEM173</italic>, <italic>EMILIN1, LMNA,</italic> and <italic>RIN2</italic> were demethylated and regained expression in fibroblast-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In a final step, the fibroblast-like cultures were reprogrammed into hiPSCs by infecting the cells with SeV vectors expressing <italic>OKSM</italic>, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Emerging colonies were isolated after ~3 weeks, expanded and confirmed to be positive for AP activity and endogenous OCT4 expression, indicating successful reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Moreover, we ensured loss of SeV expression in all lines, demonstrating reprogramming factor independent self-renewal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1C,D</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3" sec-type="background">
<title>Genetic background drives transcriptional variation</title>
<p id="P6">First we studied whether the SeV reprogramming method affects global transcription. The parental hESC subclones were infected with GFP-expressing SeV (SeV-GFP) and passaged until GFP fluorescence was no longer detectable before analyzing cell lines by RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We found a common set of 63 genes that was differentially expressed between three uninfected hESC subclones (hESC SCs) and three SeV-GFP infected hESC subclones (hESC GFPs) from each genetic background, which demonstrates that viral infection itself leads to subtle but statistically significant transcriptional changes that persist after viral loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This 63-DEG set consistently separated hESC SC lines from hESC GFP lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Gene Ontology terms significantly enriched among these 63 DEGs are related to transcription, DNA binding, and development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1E</xref>). Based on these observations, we decided to use expression data from hESC GFP lines as controls for all subsequent comparisons with SeV-generated hiPSC lines.</p>
<p id="P7">A comparison of the transcriptional profiles of hESC subclones (hESC SCs and hESC GFPs), <italic>in vitro</italic>-differentiated fibroblasts and derivative hiPSCs by unsupervised clustering showed the largest differences between pluripotent cell lines and differentiated cell types, consistent with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). Likewise, global methylation analysis of representative samples by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) separated pluripotent cells from <italic>in vitro</italic>-differentiated fibroblasts, indicating distinct epigenetic states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1F</xref>). Notably, we observed a clear segregation of all pluripotent samples into two transcriptionally related groups, irrespective of whether cell lines were infected with SeV or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, expanded from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). This segregation could not be explained by the cellular origin of cell lines from embryos (hESCs) or somatic cells (hiPSCs) but instead correlated with the genetic background of each line. That is, HUES2-derived hESC subclones clustered with HUES2-derived hiPSC lines whereas HUES3-derived hESC subclones clustered with HUES3-derived hiPSC lines. Consistent with this finding, overall transcriptional variation between groups of genetically matched hESC and hiPSC lines was significantly lower than that between unmatched cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>). Moreover, transcriptional variation within groups of genetically matched hiPSC or hESC lines was similar, indicating that hiPSCs and hESCs are equally variable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>). Of note, the number of promoters differentially methylated between unmatched pluripotent cell lines was approximately twice as high (2,610) as that between matched pluripotent cell lines (1,205), suggesting that genetic background also influences epigenetic patterns in hESCs and hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2D</xref>). We conclude that genetic background is a major driver of transcriptional and epigenetic differences between pluripotent cell lines, whereas the SeV reprogramming method introduces more subtle yet stable transcriptional changes in hiPSCs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Expression differences between matched hESCs and hiPSCs</title>
<p id="P8">Although genetic background accounted for most transcriptional differences among the analyzed pluripotent cell lines, we noticed that hESCs clustered with each other and separately from hiPSCs within a given background, suggesting subtle but consistent transcriptional differences that reflect distinct cellular origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). To identify any DEGs that distinguish hESC from hiPSC lines independent of SeV infection and genetic background, we compared transcriptional profiles of hiPSC lines with those of genetically matched hESC GFP lines. This analysis revealed that 52 and 91 genes were up- and down- regulated, respectively, in hiPSC lines derived from the HUES2 background, whereas 77 and 426 genes were up- and down-regulated in hiPSC lines derived from the HUES3 background, respectively. Forty-nine genes were commonly dysregulated in both genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Considering the good depth of our RNA-seq data (~40 million mapped reads per sample on average) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2E</xref>), it is highly unlikely that this small number of DEGs was due to low sensitivity. As expected, the 49-DEG signature reliably separated our hiPSC lines from our hESC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We did not detect any Gene Ontology term that was significantly enriched among the 49 DEGs. A comparison of our DEG set with 8 different protein interaction databases, including BIND, DIP, MINT and REACTOME INTERACTION using DAVID, also showed no significant enrichment (data not shown). Notably, 48 of 49 DEGs were downregulated in hiPSCs relative to hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This raised the possibility that the DEGs were silenced in fibroblast-like cells and were not properly reactivated in derivative hiPSCs. However, the expression levels of the DEGs in fibroblast-like cells did not show a consistent pattern, excluding incomplete reprogramming or the retention of ‘epigenetic memory’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">We next asked whether the DEGs have functional consequences. We focused on two DEGs, <italic>LDHA</italic> and <italic>SLC2A1</italic> (also known as <italic>GLUT1</italic>), because of their strong basal expression in hESCs and reduced expression in all hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C,D</xref>). Both gene products are involved in energy metabolism; <italic>LDHA</italic> plays an important role in glycolysis by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to lactate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, whereas <italic>SLC2A1</italic> facilitates glucose uptake in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Accordingly, <italic>LDHA</italic> and <italic>SLC2A1</italic> are abundantly expressed in pluripotent cells, which produce energy through glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Based on the down-regulation of these two genes in all examined hiPSC lines compared to hESC lines by RNA-seq and qPCR analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>), we hypothesized that hiPSC lines might be less glycolytic than hESC GFP lines. However, neither lactate production nor glucose uptake levels differed between isogenic hiPSC and hESC GFP lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Further, there was no difference in LDHA protein levels despite the observed transcriptional differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Thus, at least two of the 49 DEGs seem not to translate into functional differences, possibly owing to posttranscriptional compensatory mechanisms.</p>
<p id="P11">The low level of transcriptional differences between undifferentiated hESCs and hiPSCs does not exclude the existence of iPSC-specific aberrations that become detectable only after differentiation. We performed RNA-sequencing of fibroblast-like cells derived from 8 hESC subclones (2 hESC SC and 6 hESC GFP lines) and 6 hiPSC subclones using the same <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation protocol as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Only two genes were consistently upregulated in hiPSC-derived fibroblast-like cells compared to hESC-derived fibroblast-like cells from both genetic backgrounds, and they did not overlap with the 49 DEGs between undifferentiated hESC and hiPSC lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3A,B</xref>). However, HUES2-derived fibroblast-like cells tended to cluster together and apart from HUES3-derived fibroblast-like cells using PCA analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>), which is consistent with the segregation of undifferentiated cells by genetic background. We infer that genetic background also drives transcriptional variation in differentiated cell populations, and that any transcriptional differences observed between undifferentiated hESC and hiPSC lines do not persist in differentiated fibroblast-like cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5" sec-type="background">
<title>Dysregulation of genes in a subset of hiPSC lines</title>
<p id="P12">As most of the DEGs between undifferentiated hESC GFP and hiPSC lines produced low-abundance transcripts that were not obviously connected through a common biological process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), we examined genes that were dysregulated in only a subset of hiPSC lines, which we refer to as inconsistently differentially expressed genes (iDEGs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3C</xref>). We have previously shown that iDEGs between isogenic mouse ESCs and iPSCs could predict full developmental potential of subsets of iPSC lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Applying the same principle to our human data set, we found that 34 genes were upregulated, whereas 27 genes were downregulated in some of the HUES2-derived hiPSC lines when compared to genetically matched hESC GFP lines. Similarly, 9 genes were upregulated and 32 genes were downregulated in some of the HUES3-derived hiPSC lines relative to matched hESC GFP controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3C</xref>). Only eight iDEGs were dysregulated in both genetic backgrounds, and these were thus selected for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">The iDEGs <italic>IRX2</italic> and <italic>DPP10</italic> have been linked to neural development or psychiatric disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and IRX2 suppression reportedly impairs hESC differentiation into neural progenitors. Silencing of <italic>IRX2</italic> and <italic>DPP10</italic> in some of the hiPSC lines and none of the hESC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) was confirmed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). However, the iDEGs did not affect the cells’ potential to differentiate into neuroectodermal cells using a published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), as determined by RNA expression analysis for <italic>NESTIN, SOX1, PAX6</italic>, and <italic>FOXG1</italic>, well- established markers of neuroectoderm differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Consistent with this, PAX6 and SOX1 were equally expressed at the protein level during neural differentiation from hiPSC and hESC GFP lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">To determine whether hiPSCs exhibit biases in differentiation into other lineages, we evaluated their ability to generate ectodermal, endodermal and mesodermal derivatives by the Score card assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Briefly, hiPSC and hESC GFP lines from both genetic backgrounds were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs) before scoring for the expression of 77 developmental marker genes by qPCR. Hierarchical clustering of these data showed that all markers were expressed at similar levels in genetically matched cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). Thus, isogenic hESCs and hiPSCs appear to have equivalent potential to differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers.</p>

<title>Genetic background explains previous expression differences</title>
<p id="P15">We asked whether the 49 genes differentially expressed between our isogenic hESCs and hiPSCs are also dysregulated in hiPSC lines derived from primary somatic cells as well as in other published datasets. First, we reanalyzed a published set of unmatched hESC (n=18) and hiPSC (n=12) lines generated from primary fibroblasts using retroviral vectors, whose gene expression patterns were previously analyzed by microarrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Since many of the 49 DEGs were not covered in the available microarray data, we performed RNA-sequencing of these hESC and hiPSC lines, which offers increased sensitivity, especially for low-abundance transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. However, unsupervised clustering was unable to separate these hESCs from hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Although 3 DEGs (<italic>RP11-1, MEG3, AL1327</italic>) were identified between unmatched hESCs and hiPSCs, these were likely false positives based on permutation analysis. Indeed, supervised clustering of all samples with these 3 DEGs (data not shown) or an extended set of 16 DEGs using loosened criteria could not distinguish hESCs from hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4A,D</xref>). Notably, our stringently defined 49-DEG signature was also unable to segregate the transcriptomes of this extended set of hESC and hiPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">Next, we determined the potential overlap between DEGs identified within our isogenic and unmatched hESC/hiPSC lines, and two previously reported sets of DEGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. There was little to no overlap between DEGs discovered by independent laboratories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>) and these DEGs could not distinguish hiPSC and hESC lines from the respective other data sets using supervised clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4C-I</xref>). Only two of our 49 DEGs (<italic>MT1E, S100A14</italic>) and two of our 8 iDEGs (<italic>IRX2</italic> and <italic>DPP10</italic>) overlapped with DEGs reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">ref. 10</xref>. Collectively, these data support the view that other parameters, such as reprogramming method, genetic background or sex, account for the majority of previously reported transcriptional differences between hESCs and hiPSCs.</p>
<p id="P17">In agreement with this conclusion, DEGs reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">ref. 10</xref> distinguished our hESC and hiPSC cell lines by genetic background rather than cellular origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, left panel). In that study, multiple hiPSC lines generated from one man were compared to male and female hESC lines of different genetic backgrounds. Conversely, genes that distinguish our HUES2-derived and HUES3-derived pluripotent cell lines were able to separate the hESCs and hiPSCs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">ref. 10</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4J,K</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">In further support of the notion that genetic background profoundly influences transcriptional patterns in pluripotent cell lines, we found that DEGs that distinguish our HUES2-derived and HUES3-derived cell lines account for more transcriptional variation among our 30 unmatched hESCs and hiPSCs than do all genes or DEGs that distinguish our isogenic hESCs and hiPSCs or SeV-infected and uninfected hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Taken together, these meta-analyses suggest that the main transcriptional differences between genetically unrelated hESC and hiPSC lines are primarily driven by genetic background rather than cellular origin or reprogramming method.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion">
<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P19">Here we show that isogenic male hESC and hiPSC lines are transcriptionally highly similar to one another, suggesting that genetic background variability and possibly sex differences account for most of the previously reported gene expression differences between hESCs and hiPSCs. This conclusion is particularly relevant to studies where only a limited number of hESC lines or a single iPSC donor individual was used, as imbalances in genetic background and sex may further inflate transcriptional differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Our finding that a previously reported set of DEGs between 4 hiPSC lines derived from a single individual and 4 hESC lines separated our hESC and hiPSC lines by genetic background rather than cellular origin supports this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">Our study reveals that a commonly used non- integrating reprogramming method can subtly but stably alter transcriptional patterns in iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B,C</xref>). However, the transcriptional signature introduced by SeV infection (63 DEGs) did not separate hESCs from hiPSCs previously generated with retroviral or episomal vectors, suggesting that each reprogramming system may introduce unique transcriptional alterations into iPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4F,I</xref>). Whereas the molecular mechanisms of this observation remain to be elucidated, our findings highlight the importance of controlling for the method of iPSC induction when studying transcriptional patterns in iPSCs. Indeed, a recent comparison of hiPSCs generated with different OKSM delivery systems showed that hiPSCs derived with integrating vectors (e.g., retroviral transgenes) more often exhibit expression, methylation and differentiation defects compared to hiPSCs produced with non-integrating approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P21">We identified only 49 DEGs that could distinguish hESCs and hiPSCs and 8 iDEGs that were dysregulated in a subset of hiPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This small number of genes contrasts with previous studies, which identified much larger numbers of DEGs when comparing unmatched hESCs and hiPSCs using a similar cutoff<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Of note, we found no evidence that two of the tested DEGs (<italic>LDHA</italic> and <italic>SLC2A1</italic>) and two of the tested iDEGs (<italic>IRX2</italic> and <italic>DPP10</italic>) predict functional outcome, i.e., energy production or differentiation potential into neural cells or EBs. These results therefore suggest that hESC and hiPSC lines are equivalent after accounting for genetic background differences. We surmise that the remaining DEGs we detected between isogenic hESCs and hiPSCs might represent transcriptional noise from weakly expressed genes. In support of this notion, the vast majority of the 49 DEGs was expressed at relatively low levels in our hESCs and hiPSCs and showed no overlap with previously reported gene expression signatures. However, we cannot exclude that the lack of an obvious phenotype with the abovementioned assays could be due to insufficient expression of the analyzed genes in undifferentiated hiPSCs or compensation by posttranscriptional mechanisms, as appears to be the case with LDHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Alternatively, our metabolic and <italic>in vitro</italic>-differentiation assays may not have been sensitive enough to detect functional differences. Another possibility is that hiPSCs are distinguished from hESCs by epigenetic or genetic differences that do not manifest in the pluripotent state. However, our finding that fibroblast-like cells derived from all examined hESC and hiPSC lines show no discernable transcriptional differences argues against this explanation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3A,B</xref>). The fact that isogenic hESC and hiPSC lines exhibit equivalent differentiation potentials using either a directed or spontaneous differentiation paradigm further supports this interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-G</xref>). Critically, hiPSCs were derived from <italic>in vitro</italic>- differentiated fibroblasts in this study and, we can therefore not rule out that hiPSCs produced from primary cells accrue additional aberrations that cannot be recapitulated with our <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation approach.</p>
<p id="P22">Our results may have implications for the use of iPSC technology in disease modeling approaches, where hiPSC lines from healthy individuals are usually compared to hiPSC lines from affected individuals. Because of the apparent influence of genetic background on gene expression patterns in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells, it will be critical to study a sufficient number of hiPSC lines to detect robust phenotypes; this is particularly relevant in complex diseases where the causal mutation(s) are not known. When studying monogenic diseases, it may be necessary to introduce mutations into wild- type hESCs or rescue mutations in patient-derived hiPSCs, as different backgrounds may mask subtle transcriptional differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p id="P23">hESC lines and hiPSC lines were cultured with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, Globalstem) pre-plated at 12-15,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Medium containing DMEM/F12, 20% knockout serum replacement, 1mM L-glutamine, 100 uM MEM non-essential amino acids, and 0.1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol was used. 10 ng/ml of FGF-2 was added after sterile filtration and cells were fed daily and passaged weekly using 6 U/mL dispase or mechanically.</p>

<sec id="S10">
<title>hiPSC generation</title>
<p id="P24">hESC lines were cultured in fibroblast medium without FGF-2 containing DMEM, 10% FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine, 100 uM MEM non-essential amino acids, and 0.1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, for a week. Cells were passaged three times using 0.25% trypsin and then sorted for hThy1<sup>+</sup>/hTRA-1-81<sup>−</sup> populations. Sorted fibroblast-like cells were plated, passaged one more time, and then reprogrammed by using CytoTune®-iPS Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S11">
<title>RNA-sequencing</title>
<p id="P25">Undifferentiated hESC/hiPSC cells were sorted for hTRA-1-81<sup>+</sup> to control for the homogeneity of cells before RNA extraction. The quality and quantity of total input mRNA was determined on an Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit. One microgram of total RNA from each sample was then used as input for library preparation using Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit, following manufacturer’s instructions. Each paired-end library was prepared with an adaptor with unique index sequence. The size profile and quantity of resulting libraries were than determined on the BioAnalyzer 2100 with Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit. These libraries were then pooled together at equal molar concentration and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. All hESC and hiPSC samples for RNA-Seq analysis were prepared on the same day by the same person, and then sequenced simultaneously on the same run (except for hiPSC lines 1, 2 and 3; this did not affect the clustering). All fibroblasts samples were prepared and sequenced in the same manner as the pluripotent samples but on different days.</p>
<p id="P26">RNA-seq reads were mapped using Bowtie 0.12.7 allowing up to 2 mismatches, to the library of human transcriptome sequences obtained from ENSEMBL (GRCh37.67) reference chromosomes, then entries with identical gene symbols were merged. The transcriptome includes both protein-coding genes and non-coding genes such as lincRNAs. EMSAR was used to quantify the expression levels in TPM (transcripts per million) and to infer read counts for individual genes. Differentially expressed genes were identified using edgeR 3.4.2 and confirmed using DESeq 1.8.3.</p>

<title>Methylation analysis</title>
<p id="P27">Methylation of individual CpGs was derived by observing bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosines in RRBS reads when compared to the reference genome. Methylation maps of individual CpGs show the average methylation value obtained by dividing the number of reads on which the CpG was methylated by the total times the CpG was covered by a read. Promoters were defined as 1 Kb up- and downstream of Refseq gene transcription start sites. Methylation values of individual CpGs in promoters were pooled in a weighted manner (i.e. proportional to the number of reads covering that CpG).</p>
<p id="P28">To count differentially-methylated promoters that supported variance due to cellular origin or genetic background, within-sample methylation difference was compared to the between-sample methylation difference for each promoter in sets based on cellular origin (hESC/hiPSC) and cell background (HUES2/HUES3). The promoter was assigned to the set with the lesser methylation difference, such that promoters in the hESC/hiPSC set showed greater methylation difference between hESCs and hiPSCs and lesser metylation difference between HUES2 and HUES3.</p>
<p id="P29">Global methylation clustering was performed by first pooling individual CpG methylation levels into 1 Kb non-overlapping tiles using weighted averages as with promoters, and then using Pearson’s correlation to compute distance between samples. Ward’s method was used for hierarchical clustering analysis. Analyses were performed using R and Perl.</p>
