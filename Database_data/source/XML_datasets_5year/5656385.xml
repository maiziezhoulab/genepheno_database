<abstract>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Background</title>
<p id="P1">Chromosome 16p11.2 microdeletion is associated with early-onset obesity. Information is limited about the effect of bariatric surgery in patients with genetic obesity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Objective</title>
<p id="P2">To examine effects of bariatric surgery in obese patients with chromosome 16p11.2 microdeletion.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="P4">The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study is a prospective study with 2010 participants receiving bariatric surgery. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was available in 1843 participants. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to identify 16p11.2 microdeletion carriers. Follow up time was 10 years. In carriers and non-carriers, follow-up rate was 86% and 82% at 10 years, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Results</title>
<p id="P5">Nine carriers of the chromosome 16p11.2 microdeletion (9/1843, 0.49%) were found. At baseline, most risk factors were similar, however carriers had higher body mass index (BMI), insulin levels and systolic blood pressure compared to non-carriers. At the 1-year examination, the percent excess BMI lost (%EBMIL) in carriers and non-carriers was 71.9 and 62.2, respectively; p=0.031 (37.9 and 30.6 kg). This was followed by partial weight regain in both groups, and after 10 years %EBMIL was 25.5 and 41.5 (15.7 and 21.3 kg), respectively (p=0.377). Changes in risk factors were similar in the carriers and non-carriers. Two carriers who had type 2 diabetes at baseline were both in remission at the 2-year follow-up, but had relapsed at the 10-year follow-up. Perceived health status was similar in carriers and non-carriers during follow-up (overall p=0.198).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P6">Despite small sample size, our results indicate that bariatric surgery is a treatment option in obese patients with chromosome 16p11.2 microdeletion.</p>
