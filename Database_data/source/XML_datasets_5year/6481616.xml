<abstract id="ABS1">
<p id="P1">Demonstratives (e.g. here, that, these) and personal pronouns are early
developing components of language, which are often impaired in young children
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Additionally, demonstrative and personal
pronoun use are linked to joint attention and language ability early in life for
individuals with ASD. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder with a
significant amount of overlap in its behavioural phenotype with ASD. The present
study examined demonstrative and personal pronoun production during a
conversation sample in adolescent boys with ASD and adolescent boys with FXS
with a co-diagnosis of ASD (FXS+ASD). Findings indicated that grammatical
complexity was related to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of
demonstrative and personal pronoun production in boys with ASD, while
grammatical complexity was related to the total number of demonstratives and
personal pronouns produced in the boys with FXS+ASD. ASD severity was not
related to demonstrative or personal pronoun production in ASD, although it was
negatively correlated with the total number of personal pronouns produced by the
boys with FXS. Additionally, groups did not differ significantly in production
of personal pronouns, but they did differ significantly in multiple aspects of
demonstrative use. Findings suggest that these groups produce similar rates of
personal pronouns in the school-age years, while production of demonstratives
differentiates these groups. This study contributes to the knowledge of the
language phenotypes of idiopathic ASD and FXS+ASD, and provides implications for
intervention targets for school-age children with these disorders.</p>
