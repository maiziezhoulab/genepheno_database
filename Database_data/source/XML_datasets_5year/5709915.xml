<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">While Munc18–1 interacts with Syntaxin1 and controls the formation of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) complex to regulate presynaptic vesicle fusion in developed neurons, this molecule is likely to be involved in brain development since its gene abnormalities cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst (Ohtahara syndrome), neonatal epileptic encephalopathy and other neurodevelopmental disorders. We thus analyzed physiological significance of Munc18–1 during cortical development. Munc18–1-knockdown impaired cortical neuron positioning during mouse corticogenesis. Time-lapse imaging revealed that the mispositioning was attributable to defects in radial migration in the intermediate zone and cortical plate. Notably, Syntaxin1A was critical for radial migration downstream of Munc18–1. As for the underlying mechanism, Munc18–1-knockdown in cortical neurons hampered post-Golgi vesicle trafficking and subsequent vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Notably, Syntaxin1A-silencing did not affect the post-Golgi vesicle trafficking. Taken together, Munc18–1 was suggested to regulate radial migration by modulating not only vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane to distribute various proteins on the cell surface for interaction with radial fibers, but also preceding vesicle transport from Golgi to the plasma membrane. Although knockdown experiments suggested that Syntaxin1A does not participate in the vesicle trafficking, it was supposed to regulate subsequent vesicle fusion under the control of Munc18–1. These observations may shed light on the mechanism governing radial migration of cortical neurons. Disruption of Munc18–1 function may result in the abnormal corticogenesis, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders with <italic>MUNC18–1</italic> gene abnormalities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Munc18 (mammalian homologs of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> uncoordinated-18) proteins are essential regulators of exocytosis, and mammals express 3 highly homologous isoforms, Munc18–1~3. While Munc18–1 is primarily expressed in neurons and neuroendocrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], Munc-18-2 and Munc-18-3 are expressed widely including brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As for the function, Munc18–1 regulates neuronal exocytosis by serving as a molecular chaperone for Syntaxin1, and controls SNARE (soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex formation through modulating Syntaxin1 level at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. On the other hand, Munc18–3, which has been intensively analyzed for the regulation of insulin-mediated GLUT4 (glucose transporter) localization in adipocytes, seems to be involved in corticogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par3">Based on the reports of gene abnormalities including haploinsufficiency and heterozygous mutations, an essential role of MUNC-18-1 has been predicted in the etiology of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst (EIEE; Ohtahara syndrome) and other neurodevelopmental disorders such as neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (NEE), intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although molecular mechanism underlying the etiology of disorders with <italic>MUNC-18-1</italic> (also known as <italic>STXBP1</italic>) gene abnormalities remains to be elucidated, the abovementioned reports may indicate that MUNC18–1 regulates excitatory neuron positioning and synapse network formation during brain development to establish the cortical architecture. In this context, abnormal positioning of cortical neurons (a focal cortical dysplasia type 1a) has been observed in an autopsy sample from an epilepsy patient with a <italic>MUNC18–1</italic> mutation (c.1631G &gt; T; p.Gly544Val) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par4">While intensive studies have been performed for the role of Munc18–1 in the neurotransmitter release of differentiated neurons, little is known about its physiological role during corticogenesis. Pathophysiological significance of <italic>MUNC18–1</italic> mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders also remains to be enigmatic, although EIEE-causative mutations may render MUNC-18-1 thermolabile with a strong propensity to aggregate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These mutants are assumed to form aggregates with wild type MUNC-18-1, leading to proteasomal degradation, and thus lower the level of functional MUNC-18-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par5">Newborn cortical neurons generated in the VZ are primarily multipolar, and exhibit slow and irregular movement in the lower IZ for ~24 h. Then, they transform into a bipolar shape with a leading process and an axon in the IZ, and perform radial migration toward the pial surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Strict spatiotemporal regulation of neuron migration is crucial for brain development and intellectual functioning. In this study, we found that Munc-18-1 as well as Syntaxin1A is indispensable for radial migration of cortical neuron during brain development. Munc18–1 was shown to regulate post-Golgi transport of vesicles to the plasma membrane as well as subsequent vesicle fusion at cell surface for proper distribution of proteins crucial for neuron migration, while Syntaxin1A appeared to be involved in the vesicle fusion as a downstream effector of Munc18–1. Thus, differential roles of Munc18–1 and Syntaxin1A may be critical for cortical neuron migration. Protein kinase C(PKC)-mediated phosphorylation seemed to be required for the migration regulation. Then, epilepsy-related <italic>MUNC18–1</italic> gene abnormalities were suggested to induce a loss-of-function which may cause defective neuronal migration, leading to abnormal cytoarchitecture of cerebral cortex associated with the clinical manifestations of patients with the gene abnormalities.</p>

<title>Plasmid construction</title>
<p id="Par7">Mouse (m) Munc18–1 clone (<italic>mStxbp1</italic>) was kindly provided from Dr. T. Izumi (Gunma Univ., Japan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. pCAG-HA-N-Cadherin was from Dr. T. Kawauchi (Inst. Biomed. Res. Innov., Kobe, japan). mMunc18–2, mMunc18–3, mSyntaxin1A and mSyntaxin1B were amplified by RT-PCR with adult mouse brain RNA pool. These cDNAs were constructed into pCAG-Myc vector (Addgene Inc., Cambridge, MA). The following target sequences were inserted into pSuper-puro RNAi vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA); mMunc18–1#1, GGACATTGGCACAAGAATA (1558–1574), mMunc18–1#2, GAGGATGAACACTGGCGAG (942–960) and mStx1A#1, GGACATTGGCACAAGAATA (mSyntaxin1A, 1558–1574). Numbers indicate the positions from translational start sites. It should be noted that we could prepare only one RNAi vector specific for mSyntaxin1A, since Syntaxin1A and 1B are small proteins (288 aa) with high homology (84%). For RNAi-resistant versions of mMunc18–1 and mSyntaxin1A, mMunc18–1R and mSyntaxin1A, respectively, silent mutations were introduced in the target sequences as underlined (ATGG<underline>G</underline>CA<underline>C</underline>TGGCA<underline>T</underline>AA<underline>A</underline>AA<underline>C</underline>A in mMunc18–1#1; ATGG<underline>G</underline>CA<underline>C</underline>TGGCA<underline>T</underline>AA<underline>A</underline>AA<underline>C</underline>A in mStx1A#1). For the control RNAi experiments, we used pSuper-H1.shLuc designed against luciferase (CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. By the use of pCAG-GFP-mMunc18–1R as a template, site-directed mutagenesis was performed with KOD-Plus Mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) to generate Munc18–1 mutants at PKC- and Cyclin-dependent kinase 5(Cdk5)-phosphorylation sites (Ser306/Ser313 and Thr574, respectively), causative mutants for EIEE (c.539G &gt; A, p.C180Y; c.1217G &gt; A<bold>,</bold> p.R406H; c.1328 T &gt; G, p.M443R) and NEE (c.1631G &gt; T; p.G544 V). Chimeric cDNA, mSyntaxin1AB, containing N- and C-terminal regions of mSyntaxin1A (aa1–149) and B (aa145–255), respectively, was constructed by PCR. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.</p>

<title>Distribution of Munc18–1 in embryonic mouse brain</title>
<p id="Par14">Involvement of MUNC18–1 in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders implicates its physiological role in brain development. When Munc18–1 expression during mouse corticogenesis was examined by western blotting, it was detected from E13.5 and gradually increased throughout the developmental process analyzed until postnatal day (P)30 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). The expression profile was correlated with that of the northern blotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In immunohistochemical analyses, Munc18–1 was detected mainly in the intermediate zone (IZ) where axons are enriched and glia cells including oligodendrocytes are not yet present at E17 and P0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1). On the other hand, Munc18–1 was detected moderately in the cortical plate (CP) during corticogenesis while it was barely detected in the progenitor and stem cells in the ventricular zone (VZ)/subventricular zone (SVZ) throughout the development (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). Notably, Munc18–1 was distributed uniformly in the cerebral cortex in the adult brain (P30) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). These results were consistent with those of in situ hybridization, where Munc18–1 was expressed in CP neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Further analyses revealed that Munc18–1 was distributed in the cytosol of bipolar cells committed to layer II-III pyramidal neurons (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>), which were still migrating in the lower part of CP at E17 as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This result suggests that Munc18–1 participates in radial migration during corticogenesis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Expression of Munc18–1 in developing mouse brain. <bold>a</bold> Developmental changes of Munc18–1 protein amounts.

<title>Roles of Munc18–1 in excitatory neuron migration during corticogenesis</title>
<p id="Par15">Since Munc18–1 is likely to be involved in the lamination of cerebral cortex during brain development (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), we examined the role of Munc18–1 in migration of newly generated cortical neurons. We constructed 2 RNAi vectors, pSuper-mMunc18–1(sh-Munc)#1 and #2, which efficiently knocked down Munc18–1 overexpressed in COS7 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). These vectors also silenced endogenous Munc18–1 in primary cultured cortical neurons (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). Then, pCAG-RFP was electroporated in utero with pSuper-H1.shLuc (Control), sh-Munc#1 or #2 into progenitor and stem cells in the VZ of E14.5 mice brains. When localization of transfected cells and their progeny was visualized at P2, RFP-positive neurons were positioned normally at the superficial layer (bin 1; layers II ~ III) of CP in the control slice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c–d</xref>). In sharp contrast, a considerable portion of cells transfected with the RNAi vectors remained in the lower zone of CP and IZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>,ii,iii and d). Meanwhile, many Munc18–1-deficient neurons still reached the superficial layer of CP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>, ii, iii and d), perhaps due to incomplete depletion of Munc18–1 in neurons incorporating low amount of the RNAi vector; knockdown effects in each cell may vary according to the cell surface area physically exposed to the ventricular lumen from which RNAi vectors pass into cells. Since cell shape is closely associated with cell migration, we examined the morphology of Munc18–1-deficient neurons and found it indistinguishable from normal cells. The deficient neurons apparently formed a normal leading process and attached to radial glial fibers (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). We could not examine long-term effects of Munc18–1-knockdown (sh-Munc#1 and #2) since the deficient neurons disappeared at P7 (data not shown), presumably due to cell death as in the case of hippocampal neurons from Munc18–1-null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

<p id="Par16">Since Munc18–3 is also involved in corticogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], we asked if the observed migration defects are indeed ascribed to Munc18–1-silencing. Consequently, neither sh-Munc#1 nor #2 silenced mMunc18–3 as well as mMunc18–2 in COS7 cells, strongly suggesting that the observed migration defects were caused by Munc18–1 knockdown (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par17">At the end of radial migration, the migratory mode changes to the terminal translocation, a crucial step for the completion of neuronal migration, just beneath the marginal zone (MZ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

The deficient neurons could enter the outermost region of the CP termed primitive cortical zone, and the tip of the leading process was attached to the MZ.

<p id="Par18">Rescue experiments were performed to rule out off-target effects.

<p id="Par20">In the control experiment, GFP-positive neurons normally transformed from multipolar to bipolar in the upper IZ and moved into the CP. Then, typical radial migration was visualized toward the pial surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>
<italic>upper</italic> panels, C <italic>left</italic> panel and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Video 1). On the contrary, Munc18–1-deficient cells frequently remained stranded in the upper IZ - lower CP during the imaging time period (~24 h) and the migration was significantly prevented during the analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>, <italic>lower</italic> panels, c <italic>right</italic> panel and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Video 2). Although the multipolar-bipolar shape transition was normal, the deficient cells could not pass the IZ-CP boundary efficiently.</p>
<p id="Par21">On the other hand, considerable population of Munc18–1-deficient cells crossed the IZ-CP border. They, however, frequently showed an abnormal migration phenotype in the CP. Although the deficient cells were morphologically indistinguishable from control cells and maintained normal bipolar polarity from the beginning of the imaging (E17.5) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d and e</xref>), they displayed a migration delay with a reduced speed after entering the CP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>, <italic>lower</italic> panels, f and Additional files <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Videos 3 and 4).</p>
<p id="Par22">As for the aberrant migration phenotype, it was notably less characteristic than knockdown phenotypes of other genes. For example, SIL1 (a chaperone-related protein)-deficient neurons exhibited abnormal bipolar-multipolar shape turnover during radial migration, while Rbfox1(an RNA-splicing factor)-deficient neurons showed a stepwise migration profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Meanwhile, Nr1d1 (a circadian clock protein)-knockdown neurons displayed characteristic phenotypes such as jump in a tangential direction and reverse-directed migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par23">Collectively, Munc18–1 was supposed to be involved in two steps of excitatory neuron migration during corticogenesis; crossing of the IZ-CP boundary and radial migration in the CP. While migration defects may occur at the IZ-CP boundary when the RNAi effect is strong, delayed locomotion in the CP may occur when the RNAi effect is relatively weak.</p>

<title>Munc18–1 does not regulate neuronal progenitor proliferation</title>
<p id="Par24">Since prolonged cell cycle results in a migration delay of newly generated neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], we looked into the effect of Munc18–1-silencing on the cell cycle of progenitor and stem cells in the VZ/SVZ. When S-phase cells were labeled with EdU to detect DNA synthesis, Munc18–1-deficient cells entered S-phase to a similar extent as the control cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Figure S3). These results indicate that the cell cycle G1-progression rate was not statistically different between the control and the deficient cells, and that Munc18–1-silencing did not affect cell proliferation in the VZ/SVZ. Also, positioning of EdU/GFP-double positive cells in the VZ/SVZ was not affected by the knockdown (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Figure S3a). Taken together with the data that Munc18–1 was barely detected in the VZ/SVZ (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>), we conclude that the neuronal positioning defects by Munc18–1-knockdown were most likely to be caused by aberrant migration.</p>

<title>Effects of PKC- and Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Munc18–1 on cortical neuron migration</title>
<p id="Par25">Cdk5 is known to play a central role in neuronal migration during corticogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and phosphorylate Munc18–1 at Thr574 to regulate neuronal secretion through the modulation of interaction with Syntaxin 1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Meanwhile, PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Munc18–1 at Ser306 and Ser313 has been reported to be crucial for its localization in nerve terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], interaction with Syntaxin1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Analyses with chemical inhibitors suggest possible involvement of PKC in radial migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We thus analyzed the role(s) of PKC as well as Cdk5 in Munc18–1-mediated cortical neuron migration by examining whether Munc18–1 mutants at the phosphorylation sites by these kinases rescue the knockdown phenotype. As for Cdk5, both Munc18–1-T574D and -T574A mimicking phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states, respectively, rescued the migration defects (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">8</xref>: Figure S4a). In contrast, no mutations at the PKC sites mimicking phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states could rescue the abnormal migration phenotype (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">8</xref>: Figure S4b). Expression of each mutant was confirmed immunohistochemically (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">8</xref>: Figure S4c).</p>

<title>Important role of Munc18–1-Syntaxin1A interaction in cortical neuron migration</title>
<p id="Par26">Since Munc18–1 is a regulator for Syntaxin1 in the neurotransmitter release pathway, Syntaxin1 is also possible to regulate neuronal migration downstream of Munc18–1. Interestingly, we found that Syntaxin1A but not 1B rescued the migration defects by Munc18–1-knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a and b</xref>), although the rescue effect was less than that by Munc18–1R (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b and c</xref>). Coordinated function of Munc18–1 with Syntaxin1A was thus suggested to be essential for neuronal migration during corticogenesis. Notably, interaction of Munc18–1 with N-terminal region of Syntaxin1A (aa1–149) might be critical since Syntaxin1AB chimera rescued the migration defects (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a–b</xref>).

<title>Regulation of cortical neuron migration by Syntaxin1A</title>
<p id="Par27">Since Munc18–1-Syntaxin1A interaction was found to be crucial for radial migration during corticogenesis, we examined the role of Syntaxin1A per se in the migration. Syntaxin1A was expressed in the CP, IZ and VZ/SVZ as in the case of Munc18–1 during corticogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). It was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of migrating neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). For the functional analyses, we prepared pSuper-mStx1A(sh-Stx1A), which knocked down exogenous Syntaxin1A but not 1B in COS7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). Endogenous Syntaxin1A was also knocked, albeit partially, in primary cultured mouse cortical neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>). We also made mSyntaxin1A-R resistant to sh-Stx1A-mediated silencing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). Then, pCAG-RFP was electroporated in utero with the control RNAi vector or sh-Stx1A into the VZ cells of E14.5 mice brains.

<title>Munc18–1 regulates intracellular trafficking of N-Cadherin</title>
<p id="Par29">Neuronal cadherin (N-Cadherin) is one of the important adhesion molecules for the attachment of migrating neurons to radial glial fibers.

<p id="Par30">Since N-Cadherin exerts its function at cell surface, we next analyzed the involvement of Munc18–1 in vesicle fusion at cell surface. To this end, we used primary cultured cortical neurons to detect cell surface N-Cadherin as neurons were too closely packed in cortical slices to dissect. E14 mouse brain was electroporated in utero with pCAG-GFP together with the control RNAi vector or shMunc#1. After isolation at E16, neurons were cultured for 48 h and then stained for cell-surface N-Cadherin without permeabilization, followed by permeabilization for staining total N-Cadherin. Endogenous N-Cadherin was distributed on the surface of control cell bodies, whereas such distribution was suppressed when Munc18–1 was silenced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d and e</xref>). Cell surface distribution of N-Cadherin was also decreased in neurites of the deficient neurons as in the case of cell body (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8f</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par31">Although transport of Syntaxin1A from Golgi to the plasma membrane region was dependent on Munc18–1, Syntaxin1A per se was not required for the post-Golgi vesicle transport when N-Cadherin was used as an indicator (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>: Figure S5a, b). On the other hand, Syntaxin1A-knockdown suppressed N-Cadherin distribution on the cell surface as in the case of Munc18–1-silencing (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>: Figure S5c). Syntaxin1A was thus supposed to regulate the vesicle fusion process to ensure proper interaction of migrating neurons with glial fibers during corticogeneis.</p>
<p id="Par32">Collectively, while Munc18–1 is known to be essential for the vesicle priming/fusion process in the neurotransmitter release, we here clarified that 1) Munc18–1 likely regulates post-Golgi transport of vesicles containing N-Cadherin, a crucial process for radial migration of excitatory neurons during corticogenesis, and 2) subsequent vesicle fusion and distribution of N-Cadherin to migrating cell surface.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par33">It is well accepted that Munc18–1 is a presynaptic chaperone for Syntaxin1 and regulates neurotransmitter release through the modulation of SNARE complex formation in developed neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Although Munc18–1-knockout mice showed complete loss of neurotransmitter secretion from synaptic vesicles, corticogenesis was morphologically normal; cortical layer structure, fiber pathways and synapse formation were completed normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. These observations suggest that cortical development including synaptic connectivity does not depend on the Munc18–1 function.</p>
<p id="Par34">On the other hand, expression of Munc18–1 in developing cerebral cortex suggests its role in cortical development. Critical function of Munc18–1 during brain development also should be approved by <italic>MUNC18–1</italic> gene abnormalities that cause neurodevelopmental disorders such as EIEE, NEE, ID and ASD. Little is, however, known about the significance of MUNC18–1 during brain development and in the above neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p id="Par35">In the present study, we show that Munc18–1 is involved in excitatory neuron migration during corticogenesis, based on acute knockdown experiments with in utero electroporation. The results obtained may indicate a novel role of Munc18–1 in the embryonic stage where functional synapses were not detected by electron microscopic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The discrepancy between the knockout mice and acute knockdown experiments may be explained by functional redundancy by Munc18 isoforms. Considering that Munc18–2 and Munc18–3 are expressed widely, they may compensate for the loss of Munc18–1 function in the knockout mouse. Notably, Munc18–3 appeared to be essential for brain development since poorly formed axon fibers and mispositioned neurons were observed in the IZ of the null mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We assume that acute conditional knockdown of Munc18–1 may circumvent the compensatory effects of general gene-knockout approaches.</p>
<p id="Par36">We here focused on the pyramidal neurons generated at ~E14.5 which form layer II/III of cerebral cortex. When Munc18–1 was silenced in utero at E14.5 and neuronal migration was monitored by time-lapse imaging from E16.5 for ~24 h, characteristic radial migration delay was observed. Given the absence of functional synapses in E17 mouse neocortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], it is plausible that Munc18–1 plays a yet unidentified role in radial migration. The basic molecular mechanism of Munc18–1 function in neuronal migration, however, might be at least partially common to that of the vesicle fusion process in neurotransmitter release of adult neurons, because intracellular vesicle trafficking is required to add new membrane and a variety of molecules to specific regions of migrating cortical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Our results suggest that, when Syntaxin1A or N-Cadherin was used as a tracer, Munc18–1 regulates post-Golgi vesicle trafficking to the plasma membrane and subsequent vesicle fusion at cell surface in migrating neurons during corticogenesis.</p>
<p id="Par37">Recent study reported that an epilepsy-causative C180Y mutation in <italic>MUNC18–1</italic> destabilizes protein structure and induces protein degradation through the proteasome in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Since Munc18–1 mutants analyzed here were severely degradated in cells, these mutations appeared to have loss-of-function effects. On the other hand, since it has been reported that Munc18–1 controls aggregative propensity of α-synuclein and that C180Y mutation induces abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein, the migration defects observed in this study might be attributable to the level of toxic α-synuclein aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this context, disrupted function of Munc18–1 has been shown to trigger neuronal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Given that clinical symptoms are different in respective patients with <italic>MUNC18–1</italic> gene abnormalities, additional environmental or genetic factors affecting neurodegeneration are suggested in each patient.</p>
<p id="Par38">Previous works using knockout mice and dominant-negative mutants revealed that Cdk5 plays an essential role in cortical neuron migration through regulation of cell morphology and polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. On the other hand, experiments using chemical inhibitors suggest a role of PKC in the migration, although underlying molecular mechanism has been obscure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The results obtained here suggest that phsophorylation by PKC is required for Munc18–1 function in cortical neuron migration. Since the Munc18–1 mutations at the PKC-phosphorylation sites that mimic phosphorylated or unphosphorylated state both demonstrated similar effects on cortical neuron migration, balance between the phosphorylation and unphosphorylation states and/or dynamic changes of the phosphorylation status might be essential for the regulation of Munc18–1 function during the migration. Given that PKC-mediated phosphorylation is crucial for Munc18–1 localization in nerve terminals in developed neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], PKC may be involved in the localization of Munc18–1 at specific intracellular sites, where Munc18–1 exerts its functions for proper radial migration.</p>
<p id="Par39">Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that Syntaxin1A and B play important roles in brain development. As for Syntaxin1B, mutations such as truncation, in-frame insertion and deletion have been reported to cause fever-associated epilepsy syndromes with a wide phenotypic spectrum, ranging from simple febrile seizures to severe epileptic encephalopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Since these syndromes usually emerge from age of ~6-months, functional defects in the neurotransmitter release are possible to be the major cause of the syndromes. Meanwhile, Syntaxin1A is also related to neuronal development since its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are significantly associated with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Based on these observations, both Syntaxin1A and B seemingly take part in cortical development. Considering different implication of Syntaxin1A and B in neurodevelopmental disorders, they might have temporally different roles during brain development and impaired Syntaxin1A function might be related to the clinical features common to those of <italic>MUNC18–1</italic> gene abnormalities. In this study, only Syntaxin1A showed rescue effects on Munc18–1-silencing, implying specific functional relationship of Syntaxin1A with Munc18–1 during radial migration. However, it should be noted that other mechanism(s) could contribute to the neurodevelopmental defects observed in this study, since the rescue effect on Munc18–1-silencing by Syntaxin1A expression were inefficient compared to that of Munc18–1R expression.</p>
<p id="Par40">In the present study, we clarified that Munc18–1 plays an essential role in neuronal migration during corticogenesis. During radial migration, Munc18–1 is considered to regulate post-Golgi vesicle trafficking in a Syntaxin1A-independent manner. Munc18–1 is then likely to control the vesicle fusion step in harmony with Syntaxin1A to ensure distribution of numerous proteins including N-Cadherin, which are essential for radial migration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>). Although PKC-mediated phosphorylation is seemingly crucial for cortical neuron migration, its molecular mechanism is still enigmatic. Further investigation is required to clarify the MUNC18–1 function in corticogenesis and pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders with <italic>MUNC18–1</italic> gene abnormalities.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Current working hypothesis of Munc18–1 function during corticogenesis</p></caption><graphic id="MO9" xlink:href="40478_2017_498_Fig9_HTML"></graphic></fig>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>During corticogenesis, Munc18-1 (Stxbp1) regulates radial migration by modulating vesicle transport from Golgi to the plasma membrane and subsequent fusion, in order to distribute various proteins on the cell surface. Syntaxin1A may participate in the fusion step under the control of Munc18-1. Gene abnormalities in <italic>MUNC18-1</italic> may result in abnormal corticogenesis, leading to neonatal epileptic encephalopathy and other neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
