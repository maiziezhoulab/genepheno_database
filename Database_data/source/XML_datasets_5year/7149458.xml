<title>Significance</title>
<p>Although sequencing of the human genome was completed years ago, we still do not know about the physiological significance of thousands of predicted proteins, particularly of predicted membrane proteins. On the other hand, for approximately 100 human enzymes, no coding gene is known even though their enzymatic reaction has been well characterized. In this work, we assign one of those predicted membrane proteins (transmembrane protein 189; TMEM189) to one of the enzymatic reactions with an uncharacterized gene (plasmanylethanolamine desaturase). This enzyme catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of plasmalogens, an abundant class of glycerophospholipids that is depleted in such diseases as Alzheimer’s. Our findings enable interpretation of the previously characterized impaired growth phenotype of <italic>Tmem189</italic>-deficient mice.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>A significant fraction of the glycerophospholipids in the human body is composed of plasmalogens, particularly in the brain, cardiac, and immune cell membranes. A decline in these lipids has been observed in such diseases as Alzheimer’s and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Plasmalogens contain a characteristic 1-<italic>O</italic>-alk-1′-enyl ether (vinyl ether) double bond that confers special biophysical, biochemical, and chemical properties to these lipids. However, the genetics of their biosynthesis is not fully understood, since no gene has been identified that encodes plasmanylethanolamine desaturase (E.C. 1.14.99.19), the enzyme introducing the crucial alk-1′-enyl ether double bond. The present work identifies this gene as transmembrane protein 189 (<italic>TMEM189</italic>). Inactivation of the <italic>TMEM189</italic> gene in human HAP1 cells led to a total loss of plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity, strongly decreased plasmalogen levels, and accumulation of plasmanylethanolamine substrates and resulted in an inability of these cells to form labeled plasmalogens from labeled alkylglycerols. Transient expression of TMEM189 protein, but not of other selected desaturases, recovered this deficit. TMEM189 proteins contain a conserved protein motif (pfam10520) with eight conserved histidines that is shared by an alternative type of plant desaturase but not by other mammalian proteins. Each of these histidines is essential for plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity. Mice homozygous for an inactivated <italic>Tmem189</italic> gene lacked plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity and had dramatically lowered plasmalogen levels in their tissues. These results assign the <italic>TMEM189</italic> gene to plasmanylethanolamine desaturase and suggest that the previously characterized phenotype of <italic>Tmem189</italic>-deficient mice may be caused by a lack of plasmalogens.</p>

<p content-type="flushleft">Plasmalogens are a special type of glycerol-based phospholipids that are abundant in human and animal bodies. Yeast, aerobic bacteria, plants, and most nonanimal organisms do not contain this special glycerophospholipid class. Interestingly, some anaerobic bacteria also form plasmalogens using enzymatic reactions different from those in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). In humans, plasmalogens constitute roughly one-fifth of all phospholipids, with particularly high concentrations in brain and in immune cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). A decline in plasmalogens has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>) and autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Plasmalogens are important constituents of surfactants in the lung and have been shown to effectively reduce the surface tension of surfactant-like phospholipid mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). It has been suggested that decreased plasmalogen levels in smokers could be involved in the development of smoking-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>Rare inherited disorders have been characterized that impair the initial peroxisomal steps of plasmalogen biosynthesis, resulting in rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata types 1 to 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>) with severe clinical outcomes, including impaired neural development, bone deformation, and premature death. The initial peroxisomal steps of human plasmalogen biosynthesis have been well characterized to require the genes <italic>GNPAT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), <italic>AGPS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>), and <italic>DHRS7B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Further downstream steps occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum are less well understood, however. Enzymes modifying the <italic>sn</italic>2 and <italic>sn</italic>3 positions during the biosynthesis of ether lipids in the endoplasmic reticulum might be shared to an unknown extent between ether and ester-linked glycerophospholipids. Recently, <italic>SELENOI</italic>, which encodes ethanolamine phosphotransferase 1, has been found to play a crucial role in plasmalogen biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>); however, the gene coding for the enzyme generating the first plasmalogen in the pathway, plasmanylethanolamine desaturase (PEDS, E.C. 1.14.99.19), has not yet been identified. This enzymatic reaction is specific for plasmalogen biosynthesis. It introduces the alk-1′-enyl ether double bond (vinyl ether bond) into plasmanylethanolamines, yielding plasmenylethanolamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), the first plasmalogens formed in the biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). In contrast, plasmenylcholines (plasmalogens of the phosphocholine head group class) are not substrates of the enzyme and thus must be synthesized from plasmenylethanolamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>).</p>

<p>Importantly, the alk-1′-enyl ether double bond confers crucial biophysical, biochemical, and chemical properties to plasmalogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). Plasmenylethanolamine has been shown to have a dramatic impact on the structure of phospholipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>) and to facilitate rapid membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Both properties are not shared by the corresponding ester-linked phosphatidylethanolamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref> shows chemical structures). Due to the alk-1′-enyl ether double bond, plasmalogens become sensitive to chemical cleavage by low concentrations of ozone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>) or by hydrochloric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>), resulting in formation of an aldehyde. The liberation of an aldehyde on acid treatment resulted in the detection of these compounds, giving rise to their designation as plasmalogens (aldehyde-releasing compounds found in cell plasma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we present evidence that the transmembrane protein 189 gene (<italic>TMEM189</italic>; <italic>Tmem189</italic> for the murine gene) encodes PEDS activity, that the conserved eight histidines found in a conserved motif occurring in TMEM189 proteins are essential for PEDS enzymatic activity, and that mice homozygous for an inactivated <italic>Tmem189</italic> gene have dramatically lower plasmalogen levels.</p>

<title>Selection of Candidate Gene.</title>
<p>PEDS has never been purified but is thought to be a labile integral membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). Therefore, we looked for a candidate gene to express or inactivate it in cultured cells and monitor the enzymatic activity using a fluorescence-based enzyme activity assay that we developed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). In previous work, we found that the enzyme has properties similar to non–heme-containing di-iron desaturases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>), which are characterized by a motif of eight conserved histidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). The enzymatic activity was found in the microsomal fraction of tissues or cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>), thus being membrane-bound and likely originating from the endoplasmic reticulum. In our previous characterization of the gene for another ether lipid-metabolizing enzyme, alkylglycerol monooxygenase, we found good correlation of mRNA abundance with enzymatic activity in cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). Thus, for the selection of candidate genes, we followed the hypotheses that (<italic>i</italic>) the messenger RNA amount of the candidate would correlate with the enzymatic activity of the respective cell or tissue, (<italic>ii</italic>) the candidate should have features predicting it as a membrane protein, (<italic>iii</italic>) the candidate protein might have a kind of histidine motif characteristic for lipid desaturases, and (<italic>iv</italic>) the candidate gene should occur only in species synthetizing plasmalogens—that is, in animals but not in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, plants, yeast, or fungi.</p>
<p>In murine RAW264.7 cells, which have distinctive PEDS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>) we found 9,619 of 24,421 genes clearly expressed by mRNA sequencing. We compiled these data with mRNA sequencing data obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for 11 human cell lines and seven mouse tissues. This resulted in 7,382 genes commonly expressed RAW 264.7 in 11 human cell lines and in seven mouse tissues. We then correlated for each of these genes, separately for human cell lines and for mouse tissues, the normalized mRNA sequencing counts with PEDS enzymatic activity that we had observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). We ranked these 7,382 genes according to their mean correlation of cell and tissue mRNA sequencing counts with PEDS activity. <italic>TMEM189</italic> was the very top hit of all 7,382 genes examined, and both the gene symbol and the protein name defined it as a transmembrane protein. TMEM189 proteins contain a conserved motif (pfam10520) with eight conserved histidines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). This motif had also been found in an alternative class of plant desaturases designated fatty acid desaturase type 4 (FAD4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). These desaturases introduce a <italic>trans</italic> double bond at position ∆3 into a hexadecanoyl residue at <italic>sn</italic>2 of phosphatidylglycerol in photosynthetic membranes of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). The eight-histidine motif of pfam10520 resembles the classical eight-histidine stearoyl CoA desaturase motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>) but is different in the amino acid distances and the grouping of the histidines. In addition, one TMEM189 protein homolog per species was found throughout the animal kingdom, but not in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, or <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Thus, the <italic>TMEM189</italic> gene best met all four of our criteria, and we tested this gene for its impact on PEDS activity.</p>

<title><italic>TMEM189</italic> Encodes for PEDS.</title>
<p>For the following experiments, we used different cell types chosen according to their suitability for the respective assays—for example, HEK293T for transfection of expression plasmids, A431 for siRNA experiments, and human haploid HAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>) for generating a <italic>TMEM189</italic> knockout cell line. In HEK-293T cells, transfection of an expression plasmid for TMEM189 protein, but not for selected desaturases included as controls, resulted in significantly increased PEDS activity (<italic>F</italic><sub>(10,</sub>

<p>We next obtained HAP1 cells with an inactivated <italic>TMEM189</italic> gene generated by specific gene editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p content-type="flushleft">In this work, we show that the <italic>TMEM189</italic> gene is essential for the introduction of the alk-1′-enyl ether bond to form plasmalogens. TMEM189 proteins contain a conserved motif comprising eight conserved histidines that had previously been found in an alternative type of plant fatty acid desaturase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). This motif differs in structure somewhat from the eight-histidine motif found in classical membrane bound desaturases, such as stearoyl CoA desaturase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). The conserved histidines of stearoyl CoA desaturase have been shown to coordinate a di-metal center in crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>) that is thought to be involved in catalysis of the enzymatic reaction. We found that each of the eight histidines conserved in both the TMEM189 proteins and the plant FAD4 alternative desaturase proteins is essential for PEDS activity. These data strongly suggest that the TMEM189 protein is the PEDS enzyme itself rather than an accessory protein required for the enzymatic reaction.</p>
<p>TMEM189 protein is currently annotated as an ubiquitin ligase in databases, and the pfam10520 protein motif is annotated as the localization B domain of TMEM189. This is based on findings that in human cells, a read-through transcript of <italic>TMEM189</italic> with the adjacent gene, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1 (<italic>UBE2V1</italic>), was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). The authors characterized TMEM189 as a conserved class of proteins with a histidine-rich motif. When fused to the downstream gene <italic>UBE2V1</italic>, overexpression of the TMEM189 fusion protein altered localization of the UBE2V1 protein from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>) to the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>), where unfused TMEM189 protein was also found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). This gave rise to the designation of the pfam10520 domain as a localization domain. The read-through transcript was rare, however, and the two genes adjacent in humans were found to be separate in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as well as in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>), indicating that formation of the read-through transcript with UBE2V1 might not be the major role of TMEM189 proteins. Since we find here that the <italic>TMEM189</italic> encodes PEDS, we suggest naming the gene <italic>PEDS</italic> and the protein plasmanylethanolamine desaturase. Since the pfam10520 domain is also found in the FAD4 alternative type of plant fatty acid desaturase proteins, and the conserved histidines of this domain are essential for PEDS enzymatic activity, we further suggest annotating pfam10520 as a lipid desaturase domain.</p>
<p>We found that a mouse strain with inactivated <italic>Tmem189</italic> gene had no detectable PEDS activity in the kidneys, the organ with the otherwise highest PEDS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). Plasmalogen levels were strongly reduced in all organs of the mouse that we tested, indicating that no isoenzyme encoded by a gene different from <italic>Tmem189</italic> is present in these tissues to carry out the PEDS reaction. Mice with inactivated <italic>Tmem189</italic> gene had significantly lower weight, indicating the importance of the vinyl ether bond for normal growth. The phenotype of <italic>Tmem189</italic>-deficient mice has already been characterized in a systematic phenotyping program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>), and results have been presented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). Our finding of a lack of plasmalogens in these mice provides a novel biochemical basis for the interpretation of the phenotype. For example, plasmalogen deficiency accompanies diminished weight also in mouse strains with plasmalogen deficiency caused by inactivation of <italic>Pex7</italic>, <italic>Gnpat</italic>, or <italic>Agps</italic> genes, all of which are required for the peroxisomal steps of ether lipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). Growth retardation is also a hallmark of human peroxisomal ether lipid biosynthesis deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). In humans, a UK Biobank study found associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the <italic>TMEM189</italic> gene with altered monocyte percentage of white cells and with altered granulocyte percentage of myeloid white cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). However, alterations of monocyte or granulocyte cell counts were not evident in <italic>Tmem189</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Pex7-</italic>, <italic>Gnpat-</italic>, and <italic>Agps-</italic>deficient mice all show male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>), whereas male <italic>Tmem189</italic>-deficient mice are fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that male infertility in mice with deficient peroxisomal ether lipid biosynthesis is caused by the lack of seminolipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>), which has no vinyl ether bond and thus does not require PEDS to be synthesized. Interestingly, <italic>Tmem189</italic>-deficient mice have decreased bone mineral content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). Humans with plasmalogen deficiency show a characteristic bone phenotype, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). For unknown reasons, this is observed mostly in proximal, but not in distal bone elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>Mice with one WT allele contained &gt;90% of plasmalogens of animals with both WT alleles, although the PEDS activity was even &lt;50% of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). This indicates that PEDS might not be the rate-limiting step in plasmalogen tissue homeostasis, which is consistent with the suggestion that fatty acyl CoA reductase 1 controls the plasmalogen biosynthesis rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). In <italic>TMEM189</italic>-deficient human HAP-1 cells, we found accumulation of plasmanylethanolamines, the substrates of PEDS. The pattern of these plasmanylethanolamine species with regard to total carbon chain length and number of double bonds was strikingly similar to the pattern of plasmenylethanolamines, the products of the PEDS reaction, observed in WT cells. This shows that PEDS apparently does not discriminate between individual plasmanylethanolamine species for desaturation.</p>
<p>Our study provides a paradigm for the usefulness of shared public resources. High-throughput mRNA sequencing data from the NCBI GEO datasets for 11 human cell lines and seven mouse tissues allowed us to correlate gene expression with PEDS enzyme activity data that we had measured in our laboratory and directly led us to the gene for which we had searched. A mouse deficient in our gene of interest was available from the European Mutant Mouse Archive, and a systematic study of its phenotype had already been performed by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, allowing us to interpret it on the basis of our biochemical findings regarding the role of the <italic>Tmem189</italic> gene in encoding PEDS. Our work will enable future investigations of specific roles of plasmalogens for mouse physiology by studying the <italic>Tmem189</italic>-deficient mouse in more detail with regard to known and assumed roles of this lipid class.</p>

<title>Feeding of Cells with 1-<italic>O</italic>-pyrenedecyl-sn-Glycerol, Cell Harvest, and Lipid Extraction.</title>
<p>These steps were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). 1-<italic>O</italic>-pyrenedecyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol was obtained from Otava. Lipids were extracted from cell pellets twice with 500 µL of chloroform/methanol (2/1 vol/vol), and the combined organic phases were dried. The dried lipid extract was taken up in 100 µL of acetonitrile/ethanol (1/1 vol/vol) and stored at −20 °C until analysis.</p>

<sec id="s15">
<title>Measurement of PEDS Enzymatic Activity.</title>
<p>PEDS activity assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). The fluorescent 1-<italic>O</italic>-pyrenedecyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine substrate was purified from lipid extracts of 1-<italic>O</italic>-pyrenedecyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol–treated RAW.12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>) with a protocol comprising cleavage of residual plasmenyl species by HCl, a first reversed-phase HPLC purification step, cleavage of the 2-acyl side chains by NaOH, and then a second HPLC purification step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). After incubation with NADPH and catalase, the reaction was stopped with acetonitrile/HCl to liberate pyrenedecanal from the plasmalogen formed, which was quantified by reversed-phase HPLC and fluorescence detection. Controls with acetic acid/acetonitrile to quantify non–plasmalogen-derived pyrenedecanal were always negative.</p>

<sec id="s16">
<title>Measurement of Labeled Alkyl and Alk-1′-Enyl Lipids.</title>
<p>Pyrene-labeled alkyl and alk-1′-enyl lipids were quantified by reversed-phase HPLC with fluorescence detection as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>), with the modification that methanol rather than acetonitrile was used together with HCl (or acetic acid as a control) to liberate pyrenedecanal from plasmalogens, and that the aldehyde was quantified as the resulting pyrenedecanal dimethylacetal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s17">
<title>Measurement of Total Unlabeled Plasmalogen.</title>
<p>This step was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). Lipid extracts were derivatized with dansylhydrazine (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile in the presence of either HCl (to quantify plasmalogens plus free aldehydes) or acetic acid (to quantify free aldehydes only, which were typically &lt;1% of plasmalogens). The resulting dansylhydrazones were determined by reversed-phase HPLC with fluorescence detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s18">
<title>LC-MS/MS of Glycerophosphocholines and Glycerophosphoethanolamines.</title>
<p>This step was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>), modified and extended to also allow quantification and fragmentation of glycerophosphocholines and glycerophosphoethanolamines. Internal standards were added to cell homogenates, and lipids were extracted via the Folch procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). Dried lipid extracts were dissolved in HPLC starting condition, separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quantified with a Velos Pro Dual-Pressure Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Baseline corrected data were integrated in MZmine 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>), quantified, and visualized as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>) using custom-made scripts in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/" xlink:show="new">https://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>). Molecular PE, PC, plasmanyl-PE and plasmenyl-PE species were identified by their retention time, monoisotopic mass-to-charge ratio, isotope pattern, and fragmentation behavior (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1917461117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5 and <italic>Materials and Methods</italic></ext-link>), which was cross-validated with single lipid standards commercially available from Avanti Polar Lipids: C16-18:1 PC, C18(Plasm)-22:6 PC, C16-18:1 PE, C18(Plasm)-18:1 PC, C18(Plasm)-18:1 PE, and C18(Plasm)-20:4 PC.</p>

<title>Western Blot Analysis.</title>
<p>This analysis was performed using standard techniques and antibodies against the myc tag (ab 9106, Abcam) and β-actin (MAB1501; Merck Millipore), Cy3- and Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare), and a Typhoon 9410 multi-wavelength laser scanner (GE Healthcare).</p>

<title>Harvest of Mouse Tissues for Analysis of PEDS Activity and Plasmalogen Content.</title>
<p>Animal breeding practices were approved by the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture (BMBWF-66.011/0100-V/3b/2019). Tmem189tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi mice (Welcome Sanger Institute) were maintained on C57bl/6N genetic background. The tg was a knockout-first allele leading to an inactive truncated TMEM189 protein by artificially splicing a galactosidase reporter downstream of exon 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). The mice were housed in individual ventilated cages with nesting material, on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle with standard chow and water ad libitum. Mice were weighed weekly from 3 to 8 wk of age. For tissue harvest, 8-wk-old female and male homozygous <italic>Tmem189</italic>-deficient mice and their heterozygous and WT littermates were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further analysis.</p>
