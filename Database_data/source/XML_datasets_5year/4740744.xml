<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia.

<body>
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure and cardiovascular death. In the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genomic regions associated with AF, for example, on chromosomes 4q25 (<italic>PITX2</italic>), 16q22 (<italic>ZFHX3</italic>) and 1q21 (<italic>KCNN3</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, these loci do not fully explain the genetic risk for AF, suggesting that additional genetic factors or variants remain to be discovered. In the human genome, copy number variation (CNV) is a variation in the DNA sequence and can affect the expression and function of nearby and distal genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, causing phenotypic differences. It has been demonstrated that signals from SNPs and CNVs have little overlap<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Therefore, examining the genome for both SNP and CNV variants might be an effective means of determining the genetic causes of complex phenotypes and diseases in humans.</p>
<p>CNV regions have been estimated to cover 5% of the human genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Inherited CNVs underlie Mendelian diseases, and some copy number (CN) variable genes are associated with rare human diseases, such as schizophrenia and autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Although some studies have shown that CNVs may also contribute to the susceptibility to common diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, their influence on phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility still remained poorly understood.</p>
<p>Whether CNVs may also contribute to the risk of AF has never been investigated before. Herein, we sought to explore this issue using a genome-wide approach and a three-stage study design with the attempt to minimize false positive findings yet maximize power and efficiency by examining samples with gradually increased phenotypic severity but with increasing sample size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. A similar approach had been used to efficiently identify the genetic susceptibility loci associated with electrocardiographic QT interval by GWAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition, so far there have been many genetic studies adopting different genome-wide technologies to identify causal variants or susceptibility genes for common diseases, for example, GWAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> or whole exome sequencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However, few of the identified variants or loci have been linked to disease mechanisms with translational functional studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Hence, in the present study, we identify a common diallelic insertion/deletion CNV in the Kv channel interacting protein 1 gene (<italic>KCNIP1</italic>) as a strong predictor of AF susceptibility and, using the zebrafish and cellular models, we also provide the possible functional mechanism to explain the genetic association. <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-encoded protein potassium channel interacting protein 1 (KCHIP1) may modulate atrial electrophysiology at high atrial rates.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>General CNV pattern and association with the risk of AF</title>
<p>Genome-wide detection of CNV was performed in the stage I discovery subjects, using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip (1,014,075 SNPs) to obtain signal and allelic intensities and to generate CNV calls. After quality control filtering (removal of markers or subjects with call rate&lt;99%), there was a total of 7,210 CNV calls. The CNV calls spanned between 1 and 2,288 SNP markers, with an average of 43 SNPs per CNV region and an average CNV region size of 119 kb.</p>
<p>Although the small stage I sample size, we still identified several CNV regions that were associated with AF (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), probably because of the significant phenotype contrast between cases (extreme phenotypes) and controls. All of the significant CNVs were small CNVs (&lt;500 kb) and, thus, there was no enrichment of large CNVs among the cases relative to controls as observed in Mendelian diseases. Because of the smaller case number in the stage I GWAS sample (because of very low prevalence of extreme AF cases), false positive results were expected by chance, and further follow-up was critical.</p>
<p>We then replicated the significant CNVs from the stage I discovery sample in the stage II replication sample with another 105 patients with symptomatic AF and 422 normal sinus rhythm (NSR) healthy controls. Interestingly, we found that the CNV region in an ionic channel/subunit gene, the Kv channel interacting protein 1 gene (<italic>KCNIP1</italic>), remained significant in the stage II sample. We found a short (∼4,470 bp) common insertion/deletion diallelic CN polymorphism in the first intron of human <italic>KCNIP1</italic> gene that was associated with the susceptibility to AF. The insertion allele of the diallelic CNV was associated with an increased risk of AF, and the deletion allele was protective from AF (harbouring insertion allele was associated with AF, <italic>P</italic>=1.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). This diallelic CNV has also been published recently to be associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Furthermore, it has also been published in the Database of Genomic Variants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://projects.tcag.ca/variation" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://projects.tcag.ca/variation</ext-link>) and the 1,000 Genomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1000genomes.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.1000genomes.org</ext-link>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>CNVs may be linked to their neighbouring SNPs. We showed the regional plot around this <italic>KCNIP1</italic> CNV region (Chr5:169,800,000–170,300,000) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In this region, only rs11742875, which is ∼100 kb far from the CNV, was associated with AF based on the preset stage I threshold of 0.001 (<italic>P</italic>=1.05 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). However, the density of SNP in the chip is sparse, and there may be other better SNP markers around the CNV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Based on the 1000 Genomes data, this CNV (MERGED_DEL_2_33224) is in very strong linkage disequilibrium (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.95) with three SNPs (rs1541665, rs2032863 and rs1363713). SNP rs1541665 was among the SNP list of our Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), but not rs2032863 and rs1363713. However, the <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> between rs1541665 and the CNV was not high (0.48) in our Taiwanese population, and therefore rs1541665 was not significantly associated with AF trait (<italic>P</italic>=0.093) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We also genotyped rs2032863 and rs1363713. SNP rs2032863 was in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs1363713 and therefore provided no additional information. The <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> between rs1363713 and the CNV was modestly high (0.78) in our Taiwanese population, but not as strong as found in other populations (&gt;0.95). Therefore, the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between genetic marks may be variable in different ethnic populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Nevertheless, the association of rs1363713 with AF trait was highly significant (<italic>P</italic>=3.34 × 10<sup>−5</sup>), but not as significant as the CNV. In conclusions, this CNV might be only partially tagged by surrounding SNPs, and therefore, genotyping of this common CNV was still necessary for the large-scale stage III association study.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we further validated the association of this common CNV with AF in the large stage III population. The distribution of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> insertion/deletion genotypes was also in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the stage III sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, the insertion allele was associated with an increased risk of AF (insertion allele frequency 0.36 versus 0.23, <italic>P</italic>=5.38 × 10<sup>−23</sup>). The association became even more significant because of the large case number. Harbouring at least one insertion allele was associated with a significantly higher risk of AF (odds ratio 2.12, 95% confidence interval 1.54–2.94, <italic>P</italic>=4.19 × 10<sup>−22</sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Validation in different geographic areas</title>
<p>In stage III, we also genotyped this common insertion/deletion polymorphism in 821 subjects (275 AF cases and 546 NSR controls) in different geographic areas (Middle and Southern Taiwan). Power estimation revealed that we had &gt;95% power to replicate the association for an odds ratio of 2.0 at an alpha level of 0.05. The distribution of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> insertion/deletion genotypes was also in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Again, we observed a significantly association between insertion allele and AF (autosomal dominant odds ratio 2.38, 95% confidence interval 1.75–3.23, <italic>P</italic>=1.08 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). Given this strong genetic association between <italic>KCNIP1</italic> gene and AF, we tried to investigate the possible underlying functional mechanism.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Expression of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> in the mammalian atrium</title>
<p><italic>KCNIP</italic> genes encode the potassium channel interacting proteins (KCHIPs). KCHIPs are small cytosolic, calcium-binding proteins that were initially identified as subunits for the voltage-gated A-type potassium current in neuronal tissue and the transient outward potassium current in cardiac tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The pore-forming protein complex governing these potassium currents is the Kv4 protein. KCHIPs modulate the kinetics and current amplitudes of these Kv4 currents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Four <italic>KCNIP</italic> genes have been identified in humans and mice, encoding KCHIP1-4 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). KCHIP1 is mainly expressed in neuronal tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, whereas KCHIP2 is mainly expressed in cardiac tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, whether KCHIP1 is expressed in the human atrium has never been investigated before.</p>
<p>We then tried to investigate the expression patterns of the four <italic>KCNIP</italic> mRNAs in the mammalian heart. We found that <italic>KCNIP1-3</italic> are expressed in all the four chambers of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the CNV pattern in the first intron of the <italic>KCNIP1</italic> gene significantly affected the expression level of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Homozygous insertion was associated with a significantly higher <italic>KCNIP1</italic> mRNA level. This result indicates that a higher <italic>KCNIP1</italic> expression or higher KCHIP1 level/function may be associated with the mechanism of AF and increased susceptibility to AF. In the next step, we tried to address this possibility in animal studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Effect of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> knockdown and overexpression in hearts</title>
<p>Because <italic>KCNIP1</italic> is expressed in the atrium, in the next step, we sought to investigate the role of KCHIP1 in the atrium. Recently, zebrafish has become a powerful vertebrate genetic model system used to study the mechanism of cardiac arrhythmia because its fundamental electrophysiological properties, such as heart rates, action potential morphology and electrocardiogram morphology, are remarkably similar to those of human<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Therefore, in the present study, instead of mice which have extremely short action potential durations (APDs), we used zebrafish to investigate the functional role of KCHIP1 in the mechanism of AF.</p>
<p>APD shortening at high rates is critical to maintain AF and is the major electrophysiological mechanism of AF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Calcium plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of AF, because calcium overload is common at high rates in AF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. KCHIP1 is a calcium-binding protein and may mediate the interplay between intracellular calcium and modulation of potassium currents, which are the major repolarization currents and are essential to determine APD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Therefore, it is logical to speculate that KCHIP1 may play an important role in the mechanism of APD shortening during AF. We then sought to evaluate the response of APD shortening at high rates when the <italic>KCNIP1</italic> was knocked down or overexpressed, using zebrafish as the genetic model system.</p>
<p>There are two homologues of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> (<italic>KCNIP1a</italic> and <italic>KCNIP1b</italic>) in zebrafish. The sequence of <italic>KCNIP1a</italic> is largely unknown, and <italic>KCNIP1b</italic> shares much sequence homology with mammalian <italic>KCNIP1</italic>. In the present study, our zebrafish experiment targeted on <italic>KCNIP1b</italic> (zebrafish chromosome 10). We have screened the CN of the zebrafish <italic>KCNIP1b</italic>, and only one gene copy was noted. Whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization shows that the expression of <italic>KCNIP1b</italic> is first detected on the third day post fertilization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Grossly, <italic>KCNIP1b</italic> MO or mRNA overexpression did not cause significant developmental delay in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding cardiac and electrophysiological phenotypes, the heart rates were comparable between control, <italic>KCNIP1</italic> knockdown and overexpression hearts (178±15 versus 171±20 versus 175±19 beats per min for control, knockdown and overexpression hearts, respectively). The baseline atrial action potentials for the three groups are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>. There was no significant change of the atrial APD (204±14 versus 213±9 versus 192±10 ms for control, knockdown and overexpression hearts, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
<p>However, hearts with <italic>KCNIP1</italic> knockdown showed less atrial APD shortening at increasing rates and could not sustain high atrial pacing rates as compared with control hearts. On the contrary, hearts with <italic>KCNIP1</italic> overexpression showed more atrial APD shortening at increasing rates and could sustain higher atrial pacing rates as compared with control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Interestingly, one transient atrial tachycardia or AF could be induced in the <italic>KCNIP1</italic> overexpression hearts during high-rate pacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). AF could not be induced in control and <italic>KCNIP1</italic> knockdown hearts.</p>

<p>Previously KCHIP2 had been identified as the cardiac KCHIP assembled in macromolecular structures with the Kv4.2 channel to generate and regulate the cardiac transient outward current<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Recently it has also been shown that KCHIP2 is also associated with the Cav1.2 channel and modulate the cardiac L-type calcium current<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Whether <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-encoded protein KCHIP1 also interacts with cardiac ionic channels, such as Kv4.2, Kv4.3 or Cav1.2 in the atrium has never been investigated before.</p>
<p>Using co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that KCHIP1 was also physically associated with the Kv4.2/4.3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). However, not like KCHIP2, KCHIP1was not physically associated with the Cav1.2 protein in the atrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These results raise the possibility that KCHIP1 can also modulate atrial transient outward current and thus modulate atrial repolarization properties, as shown in the zebrafish experiments. In the next step, we tried to address this issue using cultured atrial myocytes.</p>

<title>Effect of KCHIP1 in atrial myocytes</title>
<p>Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are the major pore-forming subunits of the cardiac transient outward current<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. We sought to investigate the effect of KCHIP1 knockdown or overexpression on the cardiac transient outward current. To address this issue, we used a murine atrial cell line HL-1, which is the only available atrial myocyte cell line that continuously divides, maintains a differentiated atrial phenotype with spontaneous depolarization and has a high transfection efficiency for genetic manipulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. We found that knockdown of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> significantly impaired the cardiac transient outward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). We failed to overexpress <italic>KCNIP1</italic> because of the low efficiency of the expression plasmid (no significant change of KCHIP1 protein level after overexpression). Nevertheless, this result indicates that the <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-encoded protein KCHIP1 also modulates atrial potassium currents and, thus, may play a role in modulating atrial repolarization.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first study to investigate the role of genomic CNV in determining the susceptibility to AF and is also the first genome-wide CNV study of AF. We identified a common CNV in human <italic>KCNIP1</italic> gene that was a strong genetic predictor of AF. We demonstrated that intronic CNV in the human <italic>KCNIP1</italic> gene determined the mRNA level of <italic>KCNIP1</italic>, and <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-encoded protein KCHIP1 was linked to the mechanism of maintaining higher atrial rates, and is the possible future target for AF treatment.</p>
<p><italic>KCNIP1</italic>-encoded protein KCHIP1 is a KCHIP and also a calcium-binding protein. It was traditionally thought an auxiliary subunit of the protein complex Kv4.3 potassium channel in neurons, and modulates the neural voltage-gated A-type Kv4.3 current<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In the present study, we first demonstrated the expression of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> in the mammalian atrium. Previously, it has been demonstrated that KCHIP2 is the main cardiac KCHIP (mainly in ventricles), and KCHIP2 is a subunit protein of Kv4.2 and Cav1.2, modulating the ventricular transient outward potassium current and L-type calcium current, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In the present study, we first demonstrated that in the mammalian atrium, KCHIP1 formed a protein complex with Kv4.2/4.3 and modulated the atrial transient outward current, thus modulating atrial repolarization properties.</p>
<p>KCHIP1 is a calcium-binding protein. The intracellular calcium level plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of AF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. At high atrial rates, the intracellular calcium level is accumulated and elevated due to the short time available for beat-to-beat diastolic calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby triggering atrial electrical remodelling (for example, APD shortening) and facilitating the maintenance of AF. Our results first provide the possibility that KCHIP1 mediates the regulation of potassium channel by calcium in the mammalian atrium at high rates. It may be speculated that in response to elevated intracellular calcium at high atrial rates, KCHIP1 augments transient outward potassium current and shortens APD. Accordingly, in the zebrafish model, we have shown that genetic overexpression of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> resulted in facilitation of APD to shorten at high rates and promotes AF. The results of our human genetic study are also compatible with this finding because most of the AF patients harboured a <italic>KCNIP1</italic> intron insertion, which is associated with higher <italic>KCNIP1</italic> expression.</p>
<p>The results of the present study also suggest that targeting on KCHIP 1 may be a future therapeutic approach to treat human AF. As mentioned before, we have demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> may predispose to AF, implicating that inhibiting <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-encoded protein KCHIP1 may prevent AF. Because currently there has been no specific inhibitor of KCHIP1, developing anti-<italic>KCNIP1</italic> RNA interference may be an option, and testing of this gene therapy in human clinical trials are warranted in the future to demonstrate the efficacy of inhibiting <italic>KCNIP1</italic> expression to treat AF.</p>
<p>Four <italic>KCNIP</italic> genes have been identified in humans and mice, encoding KCHIP1-4 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). There are also four <italic>KCNIP</italic> genes identified in zebrafish (sources from ZFIN). A well-known phenomenon in the cardiac electrophysiology is the compensatory mechanism to prevent perturbation of the normal electrophysiological function, even when a function of an ionic channel or its regulatory protein is markedly altered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Therefore, since the four KCHIP paralogous proteins may function similarly to modulate the transient outward potassium current in the heart, it is logical to speculate that overexpression of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> may trigger compensatory downregulation of the functions of other paralogous proteins, resulting in minimal change of the transient outward potassium current. Unfortunately, it is difficult to isolate single atrial cardiomyocytes from the small zebrafish embryo atrium with <italic>KCNIP1</italic> overexpression and measure the transient outward potassium current. Furthermore, we did not have the data of the expression of other paralogues. We could only evaluate gross action potential morphology or measure APD of the intact whole heart, and did find no significant change of resting action potential morphology or APD in the heart with <italic>KCNIP1</italic> overexpression. However, we found that the change of APD could manifest at extreme conditions which the compensatory mechanism could not keep pace with, such as at very high rate. Therefore, we could only find phenotypic change of APD by high-rate pacing.</p>
<p>There are several studies using a zebrafish model for the genetic studies of AF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Müller <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> knocked down a candidate gene, <italic>GREM2</italic>, in zebrafish, and the morphants showed abnormal atrial development/differentiation. Overexpression of mutant <italic>GREM2</italic> resulted in abnormal atrial rhythm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Liang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> knocked down candidate genes <italic>kcnk3a</italic> and <italic>kcnk3b</italic>, which resulted in lower heart rate and marked increase in atrial diameter. Sinner <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> knocked down genome widely identified <italic>NEURL</italic> and <italic>CAND2</italic> genes, and the morphants showed prolonged atrial APD. All these phenotypes are surrogate phenotypes of AF or substrates that may predispose to the development of AF, but not real AF phenotype. The only studies that showed real electrophysiological AF were Rottbauer's study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and our study. Rottbauer <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> first reported a zebrafish model with loss of L-type calcium channel function (isl mutant), and spontaneous AF was recorded in ECG. In our study, we induced AF in one <italic>KCNIP1</italic> (a GWAS-identified gene) overexpressed zebrafish.</p>
<p>There are several limitations in our study. First, although most of the neighbouring SNPs were not better than the CNV in predicting AF risk and CNV genotypes predicted <italic>KCNIP1</italic> expression level (probably functional or disease causing), we still could not rule out the possibility that there is another true disease causing variant. We did not find the exact breaking points of the CNV. An intense effort to map the exact CNV breakpoints and dense fine mapping of SNPs around the breakpoints might well identify better SNP markers or even the disease causing variant. Second, we did not address all the molecular mechanisms experimentally. To address the full molecular mechanisms, how the CNV affects the expression of <italic>KCNIP1</italic>, the physiological function of <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-encoded protein KCHIP1 in the atrium and how loss of function or gain of function predisposes to AF in an animal model should be addressed. Although we showed that the CNV affects the expression level of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> mRNA, we did not show the mechanism by which this CNV regulates <italic>KCNIP1</italic> expression. The lengths and sequences of intron 1 of the <italic>KCNIP1</italic> gene are markedly different between fish and humans, and this 4-kb CNV segment found in humans does not exist in zebrafish. To study the specific function of this 4-kb CNV segment, state-of-the art technique CRISPR or TALEN may be adopted in large mammals that may also have this specific intron segment. We have experimentally shown that <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-encoded protein KCHIP1 is physically associated to atrial Kv proteins and modulates atrial transient outward current, which plays an important role in atrial electrophysiology. We have also experimentally proved that KCHIP1 mediates facilitation of APD shortening at high rates which may predispose to AF. Therefore, we only addressed part of the molecular mechanism experimentally. Finally, we could not rule out the possibility that <italic>KCNIP1</italic> (also expressed in neurons) is linked to AF through a neurogenic mechanism.</p>
<p>In conclusions, the present study is a translational research in which we directly translated the results of genetic and molecular studies into a new idea of AF disease mechanism, which further implicates a therapeutic potential of targeting on KCHIP1 to treat human AF in the future.</p>

<title>Study population</title>
<p>The study participants were from the National Taiwan University AF Registry (Northern Taiwan). We used a three-stage study design with the attempt to minimize false positive findings yet maximize power and efficiency by examining samples with gradually increased phenotypic severity but with increasing sample size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In stage I, we selected 50 younger AF patients with extremely severe phenotype, who were diagnosed as having symptomatic persistent AF with very frequent AF attacks (≥ one attack per day), and no identifiable underlying cardiovascular diseases responsible for the cause of AF (lone AF). Genotyping these patients with disease phenotypes at the extremes is more likely to identify underlying genetic causes although the case number may be small due to the lower prevalence of these patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The healthy controls had NSR and had no identifiable cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>In stage II, we selected another 105 symptomatic persistent lone AF patients with less attack frequency than the stage I patients (≥ one AF attack per week), and 422 NSR healthy controls to replicate the significant CNVs in stage I. In stage III, we replicated the significant CNVs in both stages I and II in a combined larger population. The significant CNV was also validated in 275 AF cases and 546 NSR controls from different geographic areas (Middle and Southern Taiwan) in stage III.</p>
<p>The criteria for selection of case and control patients have been reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Cases were patients with AF, whereas controls were those with NSR. Patients with AF due to hyperthyroidism were excluded. We also included those with highly suspicious but non-documented AF and those with other atrial arrhythmia for the large stage III population. Informed consent was obtained from participating subjects and the study was approved by the institutional review board of the National Taiwan University Hospital.

<title>Genome-wide detection of CNV</title>
<p>Using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip (1,140,419 markers) SNP-based probes and additional CNV intensity probes, genome-wide genotyping was performed to obtain signal and allelic intensities and CNV regions were first identified through comparing with HapMap controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. To increase the sensitivity of CNV identification, we incorporated multiple factors using PARTEK Genomic Suite 6.6 (PARTEK. Inc., St Louis, USA), a program that is based on the segmentation algorithm. The criteria for the detected CNV segments were as previously reported criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>: (1) neighbouring regions with significantly different average intensities, and the significant level of <italic>P</italic> value &lt;0.001; (2) breakpoints (region boundaries) that yielded the optimal statistical significance (smallest <italic>P</italic> value); and (3) signal-to-noise ratio ≥0.3. SNPs with a smoothing value below and above 2±0.4 were considered loss and gain, respectively. The approximate CNV breakpoints were predicted <italic>in silico</italic>, and because the density of the SNPs in the Chip is sparse, the breakpoint is defined at the midpoint between two distinct genomic segments. These two genomic segments are also <italic>in silico</italic> predicted. When the average allelic intensity of two regions are significant different, they are defined as two distinct regions or two distinct segments and a CNV region is called. Then the breakpoint is defined at the midpoint between the two adjacent boundaries of the two distinct segments. The size of the CNV is defined as the genomic length between the 5′ and 3′ breakpoints. We identified a total of 7,210 CNVs. NCBI RefSeq (hg18; build 36) was used to annotate the location and coding region of each CNV region in the genome.</p>

<title>Verification of CNV regions</title>
<p>Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and semiquantitative conventional PCR with densitometry were performed to verify the CNV and determine the CN of the targeted gene (for example, <italic>KCNIP1</italic>) in the study samples. qPCR was performed with the TaqMan Copy Number Reference Assay RNase P following the TaqMan qPCR protocol. Each 15-μl reaction mixture comprised 50-ng genomic DNA and 1 TaqMan probe/primer mix in 1 TaqMan Master Mix, amplified on an Applied Biosystems QuanStudio 3D. qPCR data were collected and analysed by the ABI software (Life Technologies Co., CA, USA). Semiquantitative conventional PCR with densitometry were performed for large samples with designed primers targeting the sequences within the postulated deletion segment. There was no PCR product from those samples with zero copy and presence of PCR band from those with more or equal to one copy.</p>

<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top panel: The detection of insertion/deletion in intron 1 of human <italic>KCNIP1</italic> was performed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA with primers targeting the sequences within the CNV segment in intron 1 of human <italic>KCNIP1</italic>. No PCR band indicates homozygous deletion (copy number (CN)=0) (patients 1–4, 9 and 10); the presence of one PCR band (479 bp) indicates homozygous insertion (CN=2)(patients 5–8). Middle and lower panels: <italic>KCNIP1</italic> and <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA expressions were semiquantified by PCR with reverse transcription and visualized by electrophoresis. White blood cell mRNA samples from those with <italic>KCNIP1</italic> intron homozygous insertion (patients 5–8) show higher PCR band density, indicating a higher <italic>KCNIP1</italic> mRNA level. Arrows indicate the locations of PCR bands. (<bold>b</bold>) Quantification of <italic>KCNIP1</italic> expression (normalized to GAPDH) in patients with CN=0 and those with CN=2.

<title><italic>KCNIP1</italic>-knockdown and overexpression modulates APD shortening at high atrial rates.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative atrial action potential tracings at increasing pacing rates for <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-knockdown (KCNIP1 MO), overexpression (KCNIP1 OE) and control (CTL) hearts are shown. At pacing cycle length (PCL) 200 ms, the CTL and <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-overexpression hearts could sustain 1 to 1 pacing rate, but the <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-knockdown heart could not, and 2 to 1 capture is noted, indicating that the <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-knockdown heart could not maintain as higher rates as the CTL heart. At even shorter PCL (170 ms), only the <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-overexpression heart could sustain 1 to 1 high pacing rate, but the <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-knockdown and CTL hearts could not (2 to 1 capture), indicating that the <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-overexpression heart could maintain higher rates than the CTL heart. Interestingly, at this high-rate pacing, atrial tachyarrhythmia or AF could be induced in the <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-overexpression heart. (<bold>b</bold>) Summary data for three independent experiments demonstrating the relationship of PCL and APD from CTL, <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-knockdown and overexpression hearts are shown. With increasing rate (decreased PCL), APD shortens accordingly to facilitate maintenance of high rate in all the three groups. However, less APD shortening is observed in the <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-knockdown hearts. The maximal pacing rate is lower in the <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-knockdown hearts and higher in the <italic>KCNIP1</italic>-overexpression hearts, compared to that of the CTL hearts. <italic>N</italic>=3 experiments for each group.
