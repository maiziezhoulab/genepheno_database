<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Synapses are the regions of the neuron that enable the transmission and propagation of action potentials on the cost of high energy consumption and elevated demand for mitochondrial ATP production. The rapid changes in local energetic requirements at dendritic spines imply the role of mitochondria in the maintenance of their homeostasis. Using global proteomic analysis supported with complementary experimental approaches, we show that an essential pool of mitochondrial proteins is locally produced at the synapse indicating that mitochondrial protein biogenesis takes place locally to maintain functional mitochondria in axons and dendrites. Furthermore, we show that stimulation of synaptoneurosomes induces the local synthesis of mitochondrial proteins that are transported to the mitochondria and incorporated into the protein supercomplexes of the respiratory chain. Importantly, in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, a common disease associated with dysregulation of synaptic protein synthesis, we observed altered morphology and respiration rates of synaptic mitochondria. That indicates that the local production of mitochondrial proteins plays an essential role in synaptic functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synapses are spatialized zones of communication between neurons that enable the transmission and propagation of the signals. Recently, it was shown that synapses are the regions of the neuron with the highest energy consumption. Thus, they have the highest demand for mitochondrial ATP production <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0003">3</xref>. More specifically, it is the synaptic excitability that provokes temporal ion influx that will require millions of ATP molecules to be hydrolyzed to pump the ions back across the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0003">3</xref>. Maintaining resting potentials and firing action potentials is energetically expensive, as is neurotransmission on both the pre‐ and postsynaptic sides <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0004">4</xref>. The rapid changes in local energetic demands at dendritic spines imply the role of mitochondria in the maintenance of their homeostasis.</p>
<p>Synapses underlay the phenomenon of the plastic change referred to as synaptic plasticity. Some forms of synaptic plasticity require mRNA translation in the postsynaptic region <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0006">6</xref>. This process proved to be extremely important for the physiology of neurons, and its dysfunction leads to abnormalities observed in the disease syndromes such as fragile X syndrome (FXS, a mutation in fragile X mental retardation 1 gene, <italic>FMR1</italic>) and autism <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0007">7</xref>. The discovery of actively translating polyribosomes in dendritic spines raised the question of which mRNAs are locally translated and what their function is <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0008">8</xref>. Since then, many experimental approaches have been applied to identify mRNAs transported to the dendrites and translated upon synaptic stimulation. Transcriptomic studies suggested that a large portion of proteins present in dendrites and at dendritic spines can be synthesized locally on the base of mRNA specifically transported to this compartment <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0009">9</xref>. These results reveal a previously unappreciated enormous potential for the local protein synthesis machinery to supply, maintain, and modify the dendritic and synaptic proteome. However, one of the critical questions in this field that remain uncovered is the global impact of local translation on synaptic functions. Recently, the role of mitochondria in the plasticity of dendritic spines was revealed on the postsynapse <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0010">10</xref> and in axons where the late endosomes were shown to serve as a platform for local translation <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0011">11</xref>.</p>
<p>Herein, we employed quantitative mass spectrometry and <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of isolated mouse synapses (synaptoneurosomes) to create a comprehensive view of local protein synthesis in neurons. Strikingly, the third most numerous group of proteins synthesized in the synapses represented ones imported into the mitochondria. The proteomic data were further supported by the sequencing of mRNAs bound with actively translating polyribosomes. Our results show that an essential pool of mitochondrial proteins is locally produced at the synapse, indicating that mitochondrial biogenesis takes place locally to maintain the functional mitochondria in axons and dendrites. We further show that stimulation of synaptoneurosomes induces the local synthesis of mitochondrial proteins that are transported to the mitochondria and incorporated into the respiratory chain complexes. That contributes to mitochondrial biogenesis in neurons, and a logical consequence of this fact would be a dysregulation of mitochondrial function in the conditions that deal with dysregulated synaptic translation, such as FXS. Consequently, we have shown mitochondrial dysfunction in the <italic>Fmr1</italic>KO mice synapses.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="embr201948882-sec-0003">
<title>Mitochondrial proteins represent a significant fraction of locally synthesized proteins in synaptoneurosomes</title>
<p>To explore the dynamics of synaptic proteome upon neuronal stimulation, we employed a simple model system, isolated synaptoneurosomes (SN). Synaptoneurosomes are a fraction of brain homogenate obtained by the series of filtrations and centrifugations. The resulting fraction is enriched in synapses containing both pre‐ and postsynaptic compartments (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001">1</xref>A). The Western blot on fractions obtained during SN preparation shows enrichment of pre‐ and postsynaptic markers (Psd95, GluA1, GluA2, Nlgn3, and synaptophysin) as well as depletion of cytosolic markers (Gapdh and Hsp90) in synaptoneurosomes as compared to the homogenate. Nuclear markers (Kdm1 and c‐Jun) are barely detectable in synaptoneurosomal fraction. Glia marker (Gfap) is present in synaptoneurosomes; however, it is not enriched (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001">1</xref>B). Directly after the isolation, synaptoneurosomes can be <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulated to induce local protein translation. We have chosen the stimulation protocol that promotes the induction of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDA‐Rs) on the synaptoneurosomes, which initiate calcium signaling in neurons and physiological conditions in the brain, and leads to long‐lasting responses such as long‐term potentiation (LTP) <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0012">12</xref>. For this, we treated synaptoneurosomes for 30 s with NMDA and glutamate and added a selective NMDA‐R antagonist (APV) to avoid the induction of excitotoxicity. This treatment produces the transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal‐regulated protein kinases (ERKs) in synaptoneurosomes, which reflects activity‐induced calcium influx mediated by NMDA receptors (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001ev">EV1</xref>) <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0014">14</xref>. Next, in order to study activity‐induced protein translation, we incubated synaptoneurosomes with radioactive methionine/cysteine prior to NMDA‐R stimulation. We observed the incorporation of radioactive amino acids into the newly synthesized proteins at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, as revealed by the autoradiography of the SDS–PAGE gel (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001">1</xref>C). In the control experiments, when synaptoneurosomes were pretreated with cytoplasmic protein synthesis inhibitors, such as puromycin (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001">1</xref>C), cycloheximide, or anisomycin (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001ev">EV1</xref>C), significant inhibition of the translation visualized by <sup>35</sup>S‐Met/Cys incorporation was observed. This effect was not observed with chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial translation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001">1</xref>C). The residual staining is caused by non‐specific interactions of radiolabeled amino acids with proteins as verified by incubation of <sup>35</sup>S‐Met/Cys with inactivated synaptoneurosomes (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001ev">EV1</xref>B).</p>

<p>Protein translation in isolated synaptoneurosomes depleted of nuclei and cell bodies relies on the pool of mRNAs transported into the synapses in the brain. Therefore, we reasoned that all proteins whose abundance will increase after the <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation would be locally synthesized on the base of these mRNAs. Thus, in order to identify the proteins newly synthesized in stimulated synaptoneurosomes, we performed mass spectrometry (label‐free quantification—LFQ) and compared the abundance of proteins in unstimulated and NMDA‐R‐stimulated SN (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001">1</xref>D). The total number of identified proteins was 2200 (FDR 1%). To gain some insight into the biological functions of identified proteins, we have performed standard gene annotation using DAVID. Strikingly, the third most numerous group was annotated as proteins imported to the mitochondria after the nucleotide binding and synaptic proteins (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001">1</xref>E). 24% of all upregulated proteins were mitochondrial (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0001">1</xref>F).</p>
<p>Because of the small number of proteins that reached statistical significance in the LFQ analysis, we turned into the quantitative mass spectrometry based on isobaric labeling techniques and we performed labeling of the samples with iTRAQ or TMT tag (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002">2</xref>A and B). Quantitative mass spectrometry heavily depends on the physicochemical properties of peptides and dynamic range of samples, which limits the depth of analysis. Some of the tryptic peptides would be better detectable unmodified, other when modified for example, with stable isobaric labeling techniques such as iTRAQ or TMT tag. Therefore, in order to gain a more in‐depth insight into the nature of synaptic proteome and overcome physicochemical limitations, we measured the same samples using two quantitative methods: iTRAQ8 and TMT10 on the same biological material. We identified 1,942 proteins using iTRAQ8‐plex and 2,508 in TMT10‐plex. Altogether in three independent proteomic approaches, we identified 3,201 proteins out of which we were able to quantify 2,080. 516 of those proteins were significantly upregulated in the stimulated synaptoneurosomal samples (Mann–Whitney <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The list of identified proteins is attached as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="embr201948882-sup-0004">Dataset EV1</xref>. Next, we performed gene annotation enrichment analysis with DAVID on proteins identified as significantly upregulated after NMDA‐R stimulation (assembled from all three proteomic analyses). Here, we observed mitochondrial proteins to be the second most abundant category of identified proteins (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002">2</xref>C).</p>

<p>To look more specifically on mitochondrial proteins, we equated our results to a mitochondrial database of MitoCarta 2.0. Mitochondrial proteins constituted 19% (393) of all quantified proteins and 13.4% (69) of upregulated ones (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002">2</xref>C). This finding is remarkable since mitochondrial proteins (1,160 gene names, MitoCarta 2.0) represent only 5% of all protein sequences in the database downloaded from UniProt (52539 entries) and used for the results annotation.</p>
<p>Proteomic mass spectrometry data from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="embr201948882-sup-0004">Dataset EV1</xref> and the software program Cytoscape (version 3.5.1) were used to generate a graphic representation of known protein–protein interactions for proteins significantly upregulated by NMDA‐R stimulation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002">2</xref>D).</p>
<p>The number of quantified proteins (3201) could be considered as relatively low for shotgun MS experiment; however, one should take into account the specificity of the synaptoneurosomal preparations depleted of nuclear and probably many cytoplasmic proteins. Importantly, 516 proteins upregulated in synaptoneurosomes by the stimulation correspond to as much as 20% of all identified proteins. The average fold change was relatively low, which was, however, expected because of the translational capacity of synaptic ribosomes.</p>
<p>To strengthen the proteomic data, we additionally analyzed synaptoneurosomal transcriptome engaged in translation. For this, we took advantage of the fact that local synthesis of synaptic proteins is performed on‐site with the pool of available ribosomes <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0015">15</xref> that can be isolated from synaptoneurosomes and fractionated on the sucrose gradient according to their molecular weight <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0016">16</xref>. Thus, we fractionated polyribosomes from stimulated synaptoneurosomes to identify the mRNAs associated with polyribosomal fractions in response to the stimulation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002">2</xref>E). Then, we performed RNA‐seq experiments in which we detected 17,160 different transcripts, 3,078 (18%) of which were detected at the protein level. Then, we calculated the abundance of given mRNA in the polyribosomal fraction in response to NMDA‐R stimulation comparing to total mRNA from the unstimulated sample which is visualized as an MA plot (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002">2</xref>F). Importantly, both transcripts encoding all upregulated proteins (green dots) and mitochondrial proteins (orange dots) detected by the mass spectrometry represented highly abundant mRNAs with good ribosome association values. They were generally enriched in the polyribosomal fractions as visualized on the density curves (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002">2</xref>F). Quantitatively, 64% of all upregulated proteins were also enriched on the mRNA level supporting their activity‐induced polyribosomal binding and translation. In the case of the remaining 36% of proteins, we did not detect their enrichment in the polyribosomal fraction. Nevertheless, they were mostly already present in the polysomal fraction. Thus, although they have the potential to be translated locally, the mechanism of regulation remains to be established. Importantly, 56 of 69 upregulated mitochondrial proteins were also overrepresented at the mRNA level in the polyribosomal fraction (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002">2</xref>F).</p>
<p>Next, we verified RNA‐seq data using qRT–PCR on the polysomal fractions isolated from synaptoneurosomes (selected mRNAs are listed in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002ev">EV2</xref>). Indeed, we could see the transcripts encoding for mitochondrial proteins shift toward the polyribosomal fractions upon the NMDA‐R stimulation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002ev">EV2</xref>).</p>

<title>Locally synthesized proteins build mitochondria in the synapse</title>
<p>The large fraction of locally synthesized mitochondrial proteins identified in our mass spectrometry analysis were the constituents of the respiratory chain complexes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="embr201948882-sup-0004">Dataset EV1</xref>). Mitochondria in presynaptic terminals of synapses were for a long time used as a hallmark of synapses, and their real role in neurotransmission is recently being determined <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0017">17</xref>. The studies of axonal local translation in squid giant axon and presynaptic nerve terminals of the photoreceptor neurons revealed the presence of mRNA population containing nuclear‐encoded mitochondrial proteins <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0019">19</xref>. Synapses in the brain contain mitochondria; therefore, to confirm that the mitochondria located in SN are functional, we measured O<sub>2</sub> consumption following supplementation in respiratory substrates, uncouplers, and inhibitors. Quantitative respirometry was performed in parallel to compare the respiration rates between permeabilized HEK293T cells and SN. We detected similar responses to the addition of respiratory substrates for complex I (malate and pyruvate) and complex II (succinate) in the case of HEK293T cells and SN pointing at their similar respiration status (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0003">3</xref>A). We also compared the native mitochondrial protein complexes from SN and HEK293T cells obtained by digitonin extraction and blue‐native gel electrophoresis (BN‐PAGE), the golden standard for visualization of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes present in mitochondria (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0003">3</xref>B). The characteristic pattern of bands representing the native mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes appeared to be similar in SN and HEK293T cells although more high molecular weight bands in the region of supercomplexes were revealed in SN. Next, the BN‐PAGE gels were electrotransferred onto the PVDF membrane for Western blot analysis. We used the panel of antibodies specifically recognizing the protein components of complex I (Ndufb8), complex II (Sdha), complex III (Uqcrc2), complex IV (Cox6a), and complex V (Atp5a) that revealed the presence of these complexes in the BN‐PAGE gels (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0003">3</xref>C). The pattern and identity of proteins were in agreement with a well‐established profile of the native respiratory chain complexes from mouse heart <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0020">20</xref>. Interestingly, we observed more bands corresponding to supercomplexes in SN than in HEK293T, which confirmed the Coomassie staining (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0003">3</xref>B and C).</p>

<p>For the undeniable characterization of the protein complexes visible on the BN‐PAGE gels, we dissected eight bands from the polyacrylamide gel and analyzed them by mass spectroscopy (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0003">3</xref>D).

<p>To establish that locally translated mitochondrial proteins are effectively transported into the mitochondria, we loaded synaptoneurosomes with radioactive methionine/cysteine, stimulated NMDA‐Rs allowing local protein synthesis, and assayed for incorporation of radioactive proteins into the native mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes on BN‐PAGE (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0004">4</xref>A).

<title>Altered mitochondrial functions and morphology in synapses of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, a model of a fragile X syndrome</title>
<p>Having established that mitochondrial proteins are indeed synthesized locally and incorporated into respiratory chain complexes in synaptic mitochondria, we asked a question about the physiological consequences of this phenomenon. One of the conditions in which the local synaptic translation is genetically dysregulated is a human neurodevelopmental disorder known as fragile X syndrome. We took advantage of the fact that in the mouse model of this disease, an <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse, synaptic protein synthesis is also dysregulated. Namely, in the basal state synaptic translation is upregulated and poorly responds to stimulation <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0007">7</xref>.</p>
<p>We aimed at the analysis of mitochondrial metabolism, respiration, and morphology in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO synapses (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0005">5</xref>A).To compare mitochondrial metabolism in SN isolated from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and WT mice, we assayed the rates of electron flow through the mitochondrial electron transport chain following reduction of tetrazolium redox dye which receives electrons from cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. We used a set of 30 different metabolic substrates such as L‐malate, succinate, D,L‐α‐glycerol‐PO<sub>4</sub>, and D,L‐β‐hydroxy‐butyric acid. (MitoPlates, Biolog). We observed significantly higher utilization of succinic acid by mitochondria from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0005">5</xref>B). A similar trend was observed in case of several other substrates such as D,L‐α‐glycerol‐PO<sub>4</sub> and D,L‐β‐hydroxy‐butyric acid although in these cases the increase in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mitochondria failed to reach significance.

<p>Next, to study the respiration of synaptic mitochondria more precisely, we used a high‐resolution respirometry technique that allows measuring O<sub>2</sub> consumption in SN isolated from WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0005">5</xref>C). Similarly to the tetrazolium dye method, we found that in the presence of succinic acid, which provide electrons to complex II, the SN from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice respired at significantly higher rate than the control. Moreover, respiration of SN from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice was increased in the presence of ascorbate and TMPD that provide electrons directly to complex IV. In line with this observation, in the Drosophila model of FXS, <italic>dfmr1</italic>, mitochondria have significantly increased maximum electron transport system (ETS) capacity similar to what we observed in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO synapses <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0022">22</xref>.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles, and local protein synthesis may affect not only their biochemical properties but also morphology, movements, and fusions. Thus, we studied the morphology of the mitochondria in the brains of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice using electron microscopy, which revealed prominent morphological alterations of the mitochondria at the synapses of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons. In the synapses of WT mice, we observed morphologically normal mitochondria with a regular distribution of cristae and matrix of typical electron density (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0005">5</xref>D). In contrast, striking morphological abnormalities were observed in mitochondria of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO synapses, both in dendritic spines (postsynaptic side) and in the presynaptic terminals (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0005">5</xref>D). Mitochondrial pathology at the synapses consisted of substantial changes in the shape and size, alteration in the arrangement of the cristae, and in some cases accumulation of osmiophilic material (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0003ev">EV3</xref>D). Generally, we observed small, round mitochondria with irregular cristae and a very high electron density of the matrix.</p>
<p>Moreover, we found mitochondria with partially impaired structure, discontinuous, incomplete outer membrane, and altered arrangement of the cristae. Occasionally, some of the abnormal mitochondria were swollen with pale matrix (reduced matrix density) without or with very few cristae. Also, the presence of small, completely degenerated mitochondria with remnants of the cristae was noticed.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that local synthesis of mitochondrial proteins is relevant for their morphology since the mitochondria localized in the dendrites and dendritic spines of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice appear degenerated. The unusual shape and increased electron density of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mitochondria can be an effect of enhanced translation of proteins regulated by FMRP. Interestingly, similar abnormal mitochondrial phenotypes involving a change of shape and size, fragmentation of cristae, and accumulation of osmiophilic material have been described in a study of electron micrographs of autopsy brains of Alzheimer's disease patients <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0023">23</xref>. Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction was shown to be connected to autism spectrum disorder <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0001">1</xref>. Major neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, including abnormal mitochondrial phenotype <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0025">25</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we have made a serendipitous discovery of mitochondrial protein biogenesis at the neuronal synapse. Interestingly, mitochondrial proteins not only represent one of the most abundant classes of locally synthesized proteins in response to neuronal stimulation but they are also capable of entering mitochondria followed by the active formation of functional complexes (synopsis). Besides, our study defines mitochondrial biogenesis as a new group of potential therapeutic targets in diseases such as fragile X syndrome, where the synaptic translation is dysregulated.</p>

Before tissue dissection, Krebs buffer (2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.18 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 118.5 mM NaCl, 24.9 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.18 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 3.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 212.7 mM glucose) was aerated with an aquarium pump for 30 min at 4°C. Next, the pH was lowered to 7.4 using dry ice. The buffer was supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail cOmplete EDTA‐free (Roche) and 60 U/ml RNase Inhibitor (RiboLock, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation; hippocampi and a part of cortex adjacent to the hippocampus were dissected. Tissue from one hemisphere (~50 mg) was homogenized in 1.5 ml Krebs buffer using Dounce homogenizer with 10–12 strokes. All steps were kept ice‐cold to prevent the stimulation of synaptoneurosomes. Homogenates were loaded into 20‐ml syringe and passed through a series of presoaked (with Krebs buffer) nylon mesh filters consecutively 100, 60, 30, and 10 μm (Merck Millipore) in cold room to 50‐ml polypropylene tube, centrifuged at 1,000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C, and washed, and pellet was resuspended in Krebs buffer with protease and RNase inhibitors. The protocol for <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of NMDA receptors on synaptoneurosomes was described before <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0027">27</xref>.

<title>Protein labeling with <sup>35</sup>S‐methionine/cysteine and autoradiography</title>
<p>Freshly isolated synaptoneurosomes were incubated with 100 μCi [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine/cysteine mix (Perkin Elmer) for 10 min at 4°C. Next, synaptoneurosomes were prewarmed for 5 min at 37°C and stimulated (50 μM NMDA and 10 μM glutamate for 30 s, followed by addition of 120 μM APV). Synaptoneurosomes were further incubated at 37°C for indicated time points. A control sample was stimulated and kept on ice. Synaptoneurosomes were subsequently centrifuged (1,000 ×<italic>g</italic>, 10 min at 4°C), washed with ice‐cold Krebs buffer with protease and RNase inhibitors, centrifuged again, and further subjected to SDS–PAGE or BN‐PAGE followed by autoradiography or Western blot with specific antibodies.</p>
<p>Where indicated, isolated synaptoneurosomes were stimulated in the presence of 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol (CAP), 3 mM puromycin (PURO), 500 μg/ml cycloheximide, 250 μM anisomycin, and 10 μM carbonyl cyanide m‐chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) or VOA mixture (containing 1 μM valinomycin, 20 μM oligomycin, and 8 μM antimycin).

<p>For SDS–PAGE, proteins were precipitated with pyrogallol red‐molybdate (0.05 mM pyrogallol red, 0.16 mM sodium molybdate, 1 mM sodium oxalate, and 50 mM succinic acid) for 20 min at room temperature, centrifuged (20,000 ×<italic>g</italic> for 15 min), resuspended in urea sample buffer (6 M urea, 6% SDS, 125 mM Tris–HCl [pH 6.8], 0.01% bromophenol blue, and 50 mM DTT), and separated on 15% polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were fixed using the Coomassie staining solution. Gels were further destained, dried in a vacuum dryer, and incubated with a storage phosphor screen (GE Healthcare). Radioactively labeled proteins were visualized by digital autoradiography (Storm imaging system; GE Healthcare) followed by image processing with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare).</p>
<p>For analysis of native protein complexes (blue native electrophoresis, BN‐PAGE), synaptoneurosomes and isolated mitochondria were resuspended in solubilization buffer (5% [wt/vol] digitonin, 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 10% [wt/vol] glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 2 mM PMSF) and incubated for 20 min on ice. Mitochondria from HEK293T cells were isolated as described in Ref. <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0028">28</xref>.</p>
<p>Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 ×<italic>g</italic> at 4°C, and the soluble fraction was mixed with loading dye (5% [w/v] Coomassie Brilliant Blue G‐250, 100 mM Bis‐Tris, and 500 mM ε‐amino‐n‐caproic acid [pH 7.0]). HMW Native Marker Kit (GE Healthcare) was used for protein complexes’ weight reference. Samples were separated on a 4–13% gradient gel at 4°C. For LC‐MS analysis, separated protein complexes were subjected to Coomassie staining. After destaining, the bands representing protein complexes were excised from a gel and subjected to LC‐MS. Radioactively labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography as described for SDS–PAGE gels. For Western blotting, protein complexes were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF, Millipore) by a semi‐dry transfer (250 mA for 2 h) in the blotting buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.15 M glycine, and 10% methanol). Membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies and detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system using X‐ray films (Foton‐Bis). Custom rabbit polyclonal antibodies (from Peter Rehling Lab), anti‐COX6A (1:2,000; PRAB3283) and anti‐NDUFB8 (1:1,000; PRAB3765), and commercial mouse monoclonal antibody, ATP5A (15H4C4, Abcam, 1:500), SDHA (D‐4, Santa Cruz, 1:2,000), and UQCRC2 (13G12AF12BB11, Abcam, 1:500), were used.</p>

<title>Proteomics</title>
<p>Synaptoneurosomes (unstimulated and 20 min stimulated) were frozen at −80°C; 500 μl of buffer (25 mM HEPES, 2% SDS, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors) was added. Samples were heated at 96°C for 3 min, cooled down, and sonicated in Bioruptor<sup>®</sup> Plus (Diagenode) for 20 cycles 30/30 s at “high”; then, samples were again heated for 3 min at 96°C.</p>
<p>Protein concentration has been determined using Direct Detect Spectrometer (Merck Millipore). Appropriate volumes containing accordingly 75 μg proteins and 10 μg, respectively, for isobaric labeling and label‐free experiments, per sample, were moved to 1.5‐ml tubes and precipitated using chloroform/methanol protocol. Samples then were labeled using standard iTRAQ8‐plex (SCIEX) and TMT10‐plex (Thermo Fisher) protocol according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Label‐free samples were dissolved in 100 μl of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, reduced in 100 mM DTT for 30 min at 57°C, alkylated in 55 mM iodoacetamide for 40 min at RT in the dark, and digested overnight with 10 ng/ml trypsin (V5280, Promega) at 37°C. Finally, to stop digestion trifluoroacetic acid was added at a final concentration of 0.1%. The mixture was centrifuged at 4°C, 14,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min, to remove solid remaining.</p>
<p>Samples labeled with TMT and iTRAQ were fractionated prior to LC‐MS using strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX).

<p>Proteins in bands excised from a gel were reduced with 100 mM DTT (for 30 min at 57°C), alkylated with 0.5 M iodoacetamide (45 min in a dark at room temperature), and digested overnight at 37°C with 10 ng/μl of trypsin in 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin Promega V5111) by adding the enzyme directly to the reaction mixture. Peptides were eluted with 2% acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% TFA. The resulting peptide mixtures were applied to RP‐18 precolumn (Waters, Milford, MA) using water containing 0.1% TFA as a mobile phase and then transferred to a nano‐HPLC RP‐18 column (internal diameter 75 μM, Waters, Milford MA) using ACN gradient (0–35% ACN in 180 min) in the presence of 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The column outlet was coupled directly to the ion source of Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA) working in the regime of data‐dependent MS to MS/MS switch, and data were acquired in the <italic>m/z</italic> range of 300–2,000.</p>
<p>MS analysis was performed by LC‐MS in the Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry (IBB PAS, Warsaw) using a NanoAcquity UPLC System (Waters) coupled to an Q Exactive Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The density of synaptoneurosomes was approximated by OD at 600 nm, and the volume corresponding to 150 μg per respirator chamber was loaded. Synaptoneurosomes were permeabilized in the chamber by digitonin (0.005%, wt/vol) for 20 min. HEK293T cells were harvested by trypsinization, counted, and resuspended in the MIR05 medium. 2 mln of cells were loaded per respirator chamber and permeabilized by saponin (15 μg/ml) for 20 min. Respiration was measured at 37°C. Malate (0.5 mM) and pyruvate (10 mM) were added to the respirator chambers to support electron entry through complex I followed by titration of CCCP to a final concentration of 2 μM. After inhibition of complex I by rotenone (0.5 μM), succinate (10 mM) was added to support electron entry through complex II. Measurement was concluded with sodium azide (50 mM) to inhibit complex IV. Data recording was performed using Oxygraph‐2k and analyzed with DatLab 7 software (Oroboros Instruments).

Basing on this profile, fractions were combined into five pools (depicted in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002">2</xref>): (I) monosome, (II) and (III) representing light polysomes, and (IV) and (V) corresponding to heavy polysomes that are engaged in active translation. Obtained fractions were used for RNA isolation and qRT–PCR analysis. For RNA‐seq experiment, light and heavy polyribosomal fractions without RNA granules (II, III, IV, and first 1 ml of fraction V) were used (depicted in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="embr201948882-fig-0002">2</xref>).</p>

<title>RNA isolation, library preparation, and RNA sequencing</title>
<p>Synaptoneurosomes isolated from cortices and hippocampi of 6 mice were divided into 4 aliquots containing an equal amount of material. One aliquot was saved as a “total” synaptoneurosomal fraction from which total RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform mixture, and another was NMDA‐R‐stimulated for 20 min. Triplicates of ribo‐depleted total RNA isolated from synaptoneurosomes (“total”) as well as RNA from the NMDA‐R‐stimulated synaptoneurosome polysome fractions were used to prepare strand‐specific libraries (dUTP RNA) <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0031">31</xref>.</p>
<p>Polysomal fractions were isolated as described above, pooled, and precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol. Precipitates were digested with proteinase K, and total RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform mixture. Phase separation was performed using Phase Lock Gel Heavy 2‐ml Tubes (5Prime). DNA contamination from 2 μg of nucleic acids was removed by 2 U of TURBO DNase (AM2238, Ambion) in 20 μl of the supplied buffer at 37°C for 30 min. RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in RNase‐free water. Concentration was measured with NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Prior to library preparation, to provide an internal performance control for further steps, 1.75 μg of RNA was mixed with 3.51 μl of 1:99 diluted ERCC RNA Spike‐In Control Mix 1 (Ambion). Subsequently, rRNA was depleted using the Ribo‐Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat, Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fragmentation and first‐strand cDNA synthesis were performed as in TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 protocol (Illumina, RS‐122‐2001, instruction number 15026495 Rev. D), using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For second‐strand synthesis, reaction mixtures were supplemented with 1 μl of 5× first‐strand synthesis buffer, 15 μl 5× second‐strand synthesis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.45 μl 50 mM MgCl, 1 μl 100 mM DTT, 2 μl of 10 mM dUNTP Mix (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dUTP, 10 mM each, Thermo Fisher Scientific), water to 57 μl, 5 U <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA ligase (NEB), 20 U <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA polymerase I (NEB), and 1 U RNase H (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and incubated at 16°C for 2 h. Further steps, purification, end repair, A‐tailing, and adapter ligation, were performed as described in TruSeq kit protocol with one modification: The first purification eluate was not decanted from the magnetic beads, and subsequent steps were performed with the beads in solution. Instead of a new portion of magnetic beads, an equal volume of 20% PEG 8000 in 2.5 M NaCl was added and the DNA bound to the beads already present in the mixture. After the second cleanup procedure after adapter ligation, the supernatant was separated from the beads and treated with USER Enzyme (NEB) in 1× UDG Reaction Buffer (NEB) at 37°C for 30 min. The digestion step ensures that the second strand synthesized with dUTP instead of dTTP is removed from cDNA, resulting in strand‐specific libraries. The product was amplified using 1 U of Phusion High‐Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1× HF Buffer supplemented with 0.2 mM dNTP Mix, and the following primers:</p>
<p>PP1 (5′‐AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGA‐3′), and PP2 (5′‐CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT‐3′). TruSeq kit protocol temperature scheme with 12 amplification cycles and subsequent purification procedure was applied. Enriched library quality was verified using 2100 Bioanalyzer and High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent). The libraries’ concentration was estimated by qPCR means with KAPA Universal Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems), according to the supplied protocol. These libraries were subsequently sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform to the average number of 20 million reads per sample in 100‐nt pair‐end mode.</p>
<p>Reads were mapped to the mm10 mouse reference genome (GRCm38 primary assembly) using STAR short read aligner with default settings (version STAR_2.5.2) <xref ref-type="ref" rid="embr201948882-bib-0032">32</xref> yielding an average of 62% (polysomal fraction) and 85% (Total RNA sample) of uniquely mapped reads.

<title>RNA isolation from polysomal fractions and qRT–PCR</title>
<p>Before the RNA extraction, external spike‐in control mRNA (an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed fragment of A. thaliana LSm gene, 10 ng) was added to each of the fractions to control the extraction step. RNA in each fraction was supplemented with linear polyacrylamide (20 μg/ml) and precipitated with 1:10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 1 volume of isopropanol. After proteinase K digestion, RNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform extraction method. Phase separation was performed using Phase Lock Gel Heavy 2‐ml Tubes (5Prime). RNA pellets were dissolved in 30 μl of RNase‐free water. Equal volume from each RNA sample (6 μl) was reverse‐transcribed using random primers (GeneON; #S300; 200 ng/RT reaction) and SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Next, the abundance of studied mRNAs in different polysomal fractions was analyzed by qRT–PCR using LightCycler 480 Probes Master Mix (Roche) in a LightCycler 480 (Roche). The cDNA was diluted 5× with H<sub>2</sub>O, and 4 μl of each cDNA sample was amplified using a set of custom sequence‐specific primers and TaqMan MGB probes in a final reaction volume of 15 μl.</p>
<p>Following TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used: Dnm1 l (dynamin 1‐like); Suclg1 (succinate‐CoA ligase, alpha subunit); Sod2 (superoxide dismutase 2); Ndufa10 (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex 10); Sept4 (septin 4); Agk (acylglycerol kinase); Pdhb (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1, beta subunit); Rab35 (RAB35, member RAS oncogene family); Slc25a18 (solute carrier family 25 member 18); and AT3G14080 (U6 snRNA‐associated Sm‐like protein LSm1).</p>
<p>Relative mRNA levels in different fractions were determined using the ∆Ct (where Ct is the threshold cycle) relative quantification method and presented as the % of mRNA in each fraction. Values were normalized to LSm spike‐in control.</p>

<title>MitoPlates</title>
<p>Mitochondrial function assays using MitoPlates S‐1 were performed as suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, assay mix was dispensed into all wells of a MitoPlate and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 1 h to allow substrates to fully dissolve. Freshly isolated synaptoneurosomes were pelleted and resuspended in 1× Biolog Mitochondrial Assay Solution (MAS) containing saponin and dispensed into each well of a MitoPlate (final concentration of saponin 30 μg/ml). Color formation at 590 nm was read kinetically for 2 h on a Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer (Thermo Scientific). The background was corrected for the blank sample, and the average rate between 10 min and 100 min was calculated. The protein content of synaptoneurosomal samples was measured using Bradford method. Synaptoneurosomes isolated from 3 mice per genotype were analyzed. Results are presented as average rate per minute per μg of protein.</p>

Brains were isolated and further fixed in the same solution overnight at 4°C. Next, brains were cut on vibratome (Leica VT1000 S) into 100‐μm slices and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) was manually isolated, washed with PBS (5×3 min, room temperature), and stained on ice with freshly prepared 3% potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) in PBS with 4% aqueous osmium tetroxide in proportion 1:1 for 1 h. Next, samples were rinsed with Milli‐Q water (5 × 3 min, room temperature) and incubated in freshly prepared and filtered (0.22‐μm syringe filters, Millipore) 1% thiocarbohydrazide aqueous solution for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed again with Milli‐Q water (5 × 3 min), and placed in 2% osmium tetroxide solution in Milli‐Q water for 30 min in room temperature. After washing with Milli‐Q water (5 × 3 min, room temperature), samples were incubated overnight at 4°C in 1% uranyl acetate solution in Milli‐Q water. Next day, Walton's lead aspartate was prepared; briefly, 0.66% lead nitrate was added to the 0.4% aspartic acid in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and incubated at 60°C for 30 min, and pH was adjusted to 5.5 with 0.1 M NaOH. Tissue samples were washed with Milli‐Q water (5 × 3 min), incubated in lead aspartate at 60° C for 30 min, washed with Milli‐Q water (5 × 3 min at room temperature), and dehydrated using freshly prepared, ice‐cold solutions of 25, 50, 75, and 96% anhydrous ethanol, 5 min each and placed in 100% anhydrous ethanol for 10 min. Next, samples were submerged in a mixture of Durcupan ACM resin:anhydrous ethanol 1:3, 1:1, 3:1 (2 h each) and with 100% resin overnight. Next, tissue pieces were flat‐embedded and placed in a 60°C oven for 48 h. Samples were trimmed, mounted into pins, and imaged by SBF‐SEM Sigma VP 3View electron microscopy (voltage—14 kV; magnification—10,000×; pixel size—5.9 nm; thickness—60 nm). Samples from 3 mice per genotype were analyzed; from each sample, 4 scans were made—each scan consisted of 120 images.</p>
