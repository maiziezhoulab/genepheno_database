<abstract>
<p>To study complex biological processes holistically, it is imperative to take an integrative approach that combines multi-omics data to highlight the interrelationships of the involved biomolecules and their functions. With the advent of high-throughput techniques and availability of multi-omics data generated from a large set of samples, several promising tools and methods have been developed for data integration and interpretation. In this review, we collected the tools and methods that adopt integrative approach to analyze multiple omics data and summarized their ability to address applications such as disease subtyping, biomarker prediction, and deriving insights into the data. We provide the methodology, use-cases, and limitations of these tools; brief account of multi-omics data repositories and visualization portals; and challenges associated with multi-omics data integration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Comprehensive understanding of human health and diseases requires interpretation of molecular intricacy and variations at multiple levels such as genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. With the advent of sequencing technology, biology has become increasingly dependent on data generated at these levels, which together is called as “multi-omics” data. Availability of multi-omics data has revolutionized the field of medicine and biology by creating avenues for integrated system-level approaches.</p>
<p>Analysis of multi-omics data along with clinical information has taken the front seat in deriving useful insights into the cellular functions. Integration of multi-omics data providing information on biomolecules from different layers seems to be promising to understand the complex biology systematically and holistically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1177932219899051">1</xref></sup> Integrated approaches combine individual omics data, in a sequential or simultaneous manner, to understand the interplay of molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1177932219899051">2</xref></sup> They help in assessing the flow of information from one omics level to the other and thus help in bridging the gap from genotype to phenotype. Integrative approaches, by virtue of their ability to study the biological phenomenon holistically, have the ability to improve prognostics and predictive accuracy of disease phenotypes and hence can eventually aid in better treatment and prevention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1177932219899051">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1177932219899051">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent times, various studies have shown that combining omics data sets yield better understanding and clearer picture of the system under study. For instance, integrative analysis of ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines showed that cancer-specific histone marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, are associated with transcriptional changes in HNSCC driver genes, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), FGFR1, and FOXA1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1177932219899051">4</xref></sup> Zhang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1177932219899051">5</xref></sup> showed the importance of integrating proteomics data along with genomic and transcriptomic data to prioritize driver genes in colon and rectal cancers. Their results showed that chromosome 20q amplicon was associated with the largest global changes at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Integration of proteomics data helped in the identification of potential 20q candidates, including HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha), TOMM34 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34), and SRC (SRC proto-oncogene, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1177932219899051">5</xref></sup> In another study, integrating metabolomics and transcriptomics yielded molecular perturbations underlying prostate cancer. The metabolite sphingosine demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity for distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia, as reported in this study. Downstream of sphingosine, the impaired sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 signaling represents a loss of tumor suppressor gene and a potential key oncogenic pathway for therapeutic targeting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1177932219899051">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>These studies widely proved the importance of integrating multi-omics data over single omics analysis. Employment of multi-omics approach has resulted in the development of various tools, methods, and platforms provisioning multi-omics data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. There are various review articles that cover the importance of multi-omics approaches from different perspectives. Multiple reviews are available that provide a summary of the multi-omics data integration methodologies categorized based on their underlying mathematical aspects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1177932219899051">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1177932219899051">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1177932219899051"></xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1177932219899051">9</xref></sup> Yan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1177932219899051">1</xref></sup> summarize the network-based approaches used for multi-omics data analysis, whereas Tini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1177932219899051">10</xref></sup> provide benchmarking of unsupervised clustering methods in data integration.</p>
<p>In this review, we focus on the tools and methods that perform integration of multiple omics data and discuss in detail about their applications in understanding the complex human biology. The tools are chosen based on the below-mentioned criteria:</p>
<list id="list1-1177932219899051" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The approach must perform an integrative step wherein multiple data sets are analyzed in a simultaneous manner (parallel integration of data sets and not sequential). Platforms such as Galaxy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1177932219899051">11</xref></sup>and O-Miner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1177932219899051">12</xref></sup> that help in analyzing multi-omics data, albeit individually, are not part of this review.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The approach must integrate at least 2 omics data sets derived from samples that have at least partial overlap.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The method or approach should be readily available in the form of tool/package to be able to execute the method on any data set.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In the following sections, the tools/methods are classified based on their ability to address diverse biological case studies showcased in their publications using multi-omics data. We also provide a detailed account of various portals that allow visualization of multi-omics data sets along with analysis that aids in understanding the correlation between the omics data sets.</p>

<title>Omics Data Types and Repositories</title>
<p>Multi-omics data broadly cover the data generated from genome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolome, and epigenome. The spectrum of omics can be further extended to other biological data such as lipidome, phosphoproteome, and glycol-proteome. Multi-omics data generated for the same set of samples can provide useful insights into the flow of biological information at multiple levels and thus can help in unraveling the mechanisms underlying the biological condition of interest. There are a few publicly available databases, listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1177932219899051">Table 1</xref>, that provide multi-omics data sets of patients.</p>

<title>Leveraging Multi-omics Data to Derive Actionable Insights</title>
<p>Genes, transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and other macro/micro molecules systematically collaborate to perform complex cellular processes. It has been widely shown that integration of multi-omics data sets can help in unraveling the underlying mechanisms at multiple omics levels. Using TCGA data, previous reports identified distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer by combining data from different layers such as CNV, mutation, DNA methylation, transcriptomics (mRNA expression and microRNA [miRNA] expression), and proteomics. The integrative analysis produced a comprehensive catalog of genetic and epigenetic drivers of breast cancer subtypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1177932219899051">24</xref></sup> Furthermore, Zheng et al showed that addition of proteomic data sets to genomic and transcriptomic data helped in deriving useful insights into high-grade serous ovarian cancer. This analysis showed that the integration of proteomics data complements genomics in the identification of multiple pathways and processes that drive ovarian cancer and potential drivers that can stratify patients for informed therapeutic management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1177932219899051">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Herein, we discuss in detail the tools and their methods that allow integration of multi-omics data sets to address the various challenges related to disease and their mechanisms. The tools are organized based on their ability to address biological question of interest. The biological questions are broadly categorized into 3 different case studies:</p>

Few tools like PARADIGM, similarity network fusion (SNF), and so on use a combination of these approach categories as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1177932219899051">Figure 1</xref>. The tools and methods under each case study are presented as per their approach categories. Tools falling under combination categories are explained only under the first appearing approach section. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1177932219899051">Table 2</xref> summarizes the tools/methods, their approach, multi-omics data processed, and availability along with details of the input data used to showcase the applications of the tools. In this article, the data type numerical refers to continuous (for instance, segmentation mean data of comparative genomic hybridization [CGH] arrays) and discrete data (for instance, read counts in RNA-Seq) and categorical refers to all categorical data (for instance, ternary copy number data) including binary data. The presence of missing values in multi-omics data is inevitable and needs to be addressed by the data integration tools. Few of the tools mentioned in this article can handle missing data (refer <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1177932219899051">Table 2</xref>) using imputation methods, whereas other tools require handling/removal of missing values in preprocessing steps.</p>

<title>Disease subtyping and classification of samples based on their omics profiles</title>
<p>Many diseases, especially cancer, are heterogeneous because of the remarkable degree of differences between cancer progression in affected individuals. In addition to this, multiple other factors such as environment and life style may play a role in disease heterogeneity. Hence, it is imperative to identify the underlying subtypes of a disease or classifying samples into known subgroups to understand the etiology of the disease and identify suitable interventions for patients belonging to different subtypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1177932219899051">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1177932219899051"></xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1177932219899051">35</xref></sup> There exist several tools that leverage multi-omics data from samples to identify subtypes of a disease or classify various samples into subgroups based on their omics profiles.

<title>Pathway Recognition Algorithm using Data Integration on Genomic Models (PARADIGM)</title>
<p>Pathway Recognition Algorithm using Data Integration on Genomic Models infers the activities of patient-specific biological pathways from multi-omics data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1177932219899051">36</xref></sup> Multiple omics-scale measurements on a single patient sample are combined to infer the activities of genes, their products, and abstract biological processes derived from curated pathway interactions from NCI Protein Interaction Database. PARADIGM uses Bayesian factor graphs and hence will also fall in the “Network” category.</p>
<p>A gene is modeled by a factor graph as a set of interconnected variables encoding the expression and known activity of a gene and its products, allowing the incorporation of many types of omics data as evidence. PARADIGM produces a matrix of Integrated Pathway Activities (IPAs) <italic>A</italic>, where <italic>A<sub>ij</sub></italic> represents the inferred activity of entity <italic>i</italic> in patient sample <italic>j</italic>.</p>
<p>The PARADIGM integrative approach using gene expression and copy number data from TCGA Glioblastoma (GBM) revealed 4 subtypes of the disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1177932219899051">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1177932219899051">36</xref></sup> The fourth subtype showed an interesting distinct pattern with downregulation of HIF-1-alpha transcription factor network and overexpression of the E2F transcription factor network. The inactivity of the HIF-1-alpha might be a marker that the tumors were more oxygenated, suggesting that they might be smaller or newer tumors. Upregulation of E2F, which acts with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, was consistent with an active suppression of cell cycle progression in the tumor samples of this subtype. In addition, this subtype was significantly different from the other clusters for their survival. In contrast, 2 of the first 3 subtypes had elevated EGFR signatures and an inactive mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade involving the GATA interleukin transcriptional cascade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1177932219899051">36</xref></sup> Thus, PARADIGM IPAs provide a meaningful set of profiles for delineating subtypes with markedly different survival outcomes.</p>

<p>iCluster method aims to generate a single cluster assignment for samples based on simultaneous inference from multiple data types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1177932219899051">37</xref></sup> This unsupervised method uses a joint latent variable model for integrative clustering and incorporates flexible modeling of the associations between different data types and the variance-covariance structure within data types in a single framework while simultaneously reducing the dimensionality of the data sets.

<p>By integrating the copy number and gene expression data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1177932219899051">Table 2</xref>), iCluster helped in identifying novel subgroups and their characteristic molecular patterns in breast cancer. In breast cancer analysis, 4 cell lines (BT474, T47D, MCF7, and SKBR3) were grouped in cluster 1, differentiating them from the tumor samples. HER2/ERBB2 subtypes were observed in cluster 2, whereas a novel subtype showing amplifications in the end of the q-arm of chromosome 17 was grouped in cluster 3. Cluster 4 did not show a significant distinct pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1177932219899051">37</xref></sup> Similarly, using copy number, gene expression, and methylation data sets of GBM, clustering analysis resulted in 3 distinct subtypes. The subtype represented by cluster 1 showed an unevenly distributed profile of copy number alterations, hypermethylation of genes involved in brain development and neuronal differentiation, and a proneural expression profile. The subtype shown as cluster 2 was characterized by association with EGFR alteration, gains of chromosome 19 and 20, methylation of homeobox genes, and enriched expression. The subtype shown as cluster 3 was characterized by NF1 and PTEN alterations and exhibits mesenchymal-like expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1177932219899051">38</xref></sup></p>

<title>iClusterPlus</title>
<p>iClusterPlus is an enhancement of iCluster and uses generalized linear regression for the formulation of a joint model of categorical and numerical (continuous and count) variables from integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling. This method uses a set of latent variables to represent “k” driving factors which predict the key genomic variables and thus capture the biological variation. Furthermore, using Lasso regression approach, iClusterPlus pinpoints the subset of features that contribute to the biological variation between the subtypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1177932219899051">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using mutation, copy number, and gene expression profiles of 729 cancer cell lines representing 23 tumor types from CCLE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1177932219899051">Table 2</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1177932219899051">19</xref></sup> iClusterPlus identified 12 distinct clusters. Although many cell lines were majorly grouped by their cell-of-origin for few cancer types (eg, small-cell lung carcinoma [SCLC], hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, and breast cancer), several other subgroups were also revealed that were not lineage-dependent and possibly were driven by a shared genetic alteration (eg, cluster 9 which belonged to both non–small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC] and pancreatic cancer cell lines showed prevalent KRAS mutations).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1177932219899051">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>In another case study using TCGA colorectal carcinoma (CRC) data set of mutation, DNA copy number, promoter methylation, and gene expression from 189 samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1177932219899051">Table 2</xref>), iClusterPlus helped in the discovery of 2 new subtypes in addition to the 2 classic subtypes (chromosomally stable or unstable) based on chromosomal instability (CIN). The new subtypes CIN-negative showed the lowest degree of alteration (3% genome altered) and CIN-low showed moderate degree of alteration (14% genome altered).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1177932219899051">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, a limitation of this method is that statistical inference (statistical selection of the final model) is not straightforward owing to its computationally intensive approach and the use of penalized regression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1177932219899051">39</xref></sup></p>

<title>LRAcluster</title>

<p>LRAcluster was used to classify TCGA data sets containing 11 different types of cancer using 4 different omics data, namely, mutation, CNV, DNA methylation, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1177932219899051">Table 2</xref>). LRAcluster analysis yielded 10 clusters in a 10-dimensional space with samples from the same type of cancer grouped together in individual clusters. The 2 different types of brain cancer (low-grade glioma [LGG] and GBM) were grouped together in a cluster (Cluster 3). The HNSCC samples were observed in 2 different clusters (clusters 1 and 10). Cluster 10 also contains samples from lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), indicating that the squamous carcinoma of different tissue origins can have common underlying molecular mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1177932219899051">40</xref></sup> Thus, LRAcluster is able to perform an unsupervised clustering of samples using multi-omics data in a faster and efficient manner.</p>

<title>Patient-specific data fusion (PSDF)</title>
<p>This method uses a Bayesian nonparametric model (Dirichlet process mixture models) to integrate CNVs and gene expression data to stratify samples into sub-groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1177932219899051">41</xref></sup> Each sample is assigned a binary state based on their concordance between the 2 data sets. Only samples that show concordance are fused together, whereas the other samples remain unfused, thus accounting for patient-specific fusion models. Patient-specific data fusion (PSDF) uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method to predict the probability for each sample that it is fused. The feature selection of PSDF helps in reducing the noise from data sets by selecting only those features that help in clustering. Feature selection is again a binary indicator and is identified for each data set separately. Patient-specific data fusion, thus, accounts for patient-specific consistent fusion and derives the number of clusters inherently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1177932219899051">41</xref></sup> Although PSDF is explained under “Bayesian” section, it also uses “Fusion”-based approach.</p>
<p>Copy number and gene expression data of 106 breast cancer samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1177932219899051">28</xref></sup> were clustered using the PSDF method (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1177932219899051">Table 2</xref>). One hundred six samples were grouped into 4 clusters, and 3 fused clusters were identified. Cluster 2 shows a distinct substructure where the expressions are distinctly different and the copy number is largely neutral. Few samples from clusters 1, 2, and 4 and all samples from cluster 3 have unfused samples. These samples have similar CNV pattern with a range of gene expression values. The survival analysis revealed a low survival group (cluster 1), a good outcome group (cluster 4), and intermediate groups (clusters 2 and 3). The features elected by PSDF show various well-reported genes in breast cancer. For instance, copy number features identified that 8q contains MYC, 17q contains BRCA1, and 17p encodes TP53.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1177932219899051">41</xref></sup> Similarly, the PSDF model identified 7 subtypes in prostate cancer data by integrating copy number and gene expression data from 150 tumor samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1177932219899051">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1177932219899051">41</xref></sup></p>

<title>Bayesian consensus clustering (BCC)</title>
<p>Consensus clustering is widely used to combine multiple clustering algorithms or to integrate multisource data sets. Bayesian consensus clustering (BCC) proposes a data-driven consensus clustering (CC) method that models source-specific features as well as an overall clustering using finite Dirichlet mixture model extended to account for multiple data sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1177932219899051">42</xref></sup> It forms separate clustering of individual data, but they are loosely connected to the overall clustering of all data sources. Bayesian consensus clustering performs both specific clustering and CC simultaneously, and CC is derived based on the distribution that gives higher probability to clusters that are present in specific regions. The authors also propose a heuristic approach to select the optimal number of clusters for a given data set. Bayesian consensus clustering implementation is based on the assumption that the data are normally distributed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1177932219899051">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>The BCC method was applied to identify the subtypes of breast cancer using TCGA breast cancer data of 348 samples with gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and protein data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1177932219899051">Table 2</xref>). The method yielded 3 clusters that define the known subtypes of breast cancer.

The fusion step is based on message-passing theory that makes the network more like the others with each iteration. The advantage of this method is that the weak connections (noise) disappear with iterations, whereas the strong connections are propagated till convergence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1177932219899051">46</xref></sup> Although this method is explained under “Network” approaches, SNF also uses “Fusion”- and “Similarity”-based techniques in its approach.</p>

Then, it aligns those local sample patterns to a common feature space and synthesizes the global sample pattern across most data types. During this process, the contributions by each data type (or individual sample) on the global sample spectrum would be quantitatively measured and the effects of bias or systematic noises would be iteratively decreased to better fit the data. The repeated correction will end when it reaches convergence. After the adaptive optimal alignment, the combinatorial sample pattern could represent comprehensive characterization, which would be closer to inherent relations in data. Thus, PFA helps in identifying distinct subgroups of cells or samples across multi-omics data set.</p>

<p>Perturbation clustering for data integration and disease subtyping (PINSPlus) is an unsupervised clustering method that helps in identifying subtypes from multi-omics data. To identify subtypes, the algorithm identifies how often the patients are grouped together in a single cluster (1) when the data are perturbed, (2) when using different types of omics data, and (3) when a different clustering technique is used.

<title>Feature selection multiple kernel learning (FSMKL)</title>
<p>This supervised classification method uses multiple kernels to capture the similarity between data sets to identify features for disease progression. Each data set is encoded into a base kernel, a linear combination of which is used to create composite kernels. A large number of kernels are used with variable number of features per kernel per data type. Feature selection is achieved using statistical methods, and the algorithm finds the most relevant kernel and the features associated for a given classification problem.

<title>Challenges in Multi-omics Data Integration and Future Perspectives</title>
<p>Integration of multi-omics data set to derive holistic understanding of biological processes and diseases comes with its share of challenges. The underlying heterogeneity in individual omics data, large size of data sets leading to compute intensive analysis, and lack of studies that help in prioritizing the diverse set of tools make multi-omics data integration and analysis a challenging task. Multi-omics data are generated using wide range of platforms, and hence the data storage and formats vary considerably. Most of the multi-omics integrative analysis tools require data to be in specific formats (mostly in Feature X Sample matrix), and therefore the individual omics data need preprocessing. The preprocessing step includes data filtering, systematic normalization, removal of batch effects, and quality checks. It becomes imperative to carefully use these preprocessing steps as they have a huge influence on the integrative analysis. For instance, data filtering step plays an important role in filtering the noise and reducing the number of features that go into integrative models as most of the integrative methods are compute-intensive and hence it is a prerequisite to reduce the size of the input data sets. However, deciding appropriate criteria for filtering is challenging because of the lack of universal standards. Perez-Riverol et al have developed a workflow that could guide in feature selection from high -dimensional omics data sets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1177932219899051">99</xref></sup> In this regard, development of new integrative methods/tools must consider efficient handling of large data sets.</p>
<p>The primary key to any integrative analysis is the right choice of method that can address the biological question of interest. There are studies that perform benchmarking of integrative tools,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1177932219899051">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1177932219899051">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1177932219899051">45</xref></sup> but are not comprehensive enough in terms of choice of tools in the context of biological question of interest. More of such comprehensive studies are needed to guide the community in better understanding of the wide array of tools.</p>
<p>Another dimension that could add value to multi-omics data interpretation is the clinical information. Currently, there is no robust method to integrate omics data with the non-omics data such as clinical metadata.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1177932219899051">100</xref></sup> The recent advances in this field are progressing largely with efforts to reduce the challenges. Further developments in integrative analysis of multi-omics data must aim to ease interoperability of multiple data sets and to develop a framework that can help in seamless analysis of multi-omics data.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Integrative approach using multi-omics data is a powerful strategy to decipher the mechanistic details of the information flow in a cell. Currently, there are a wide array of tools and methods available in the public domain to integrate multi-omics data sets to derive meaningful insights. We have discussed in detail the approach and applications of various integrative methods in this review. We also provide a brief account of multi-omics data repositories, visualization portals, and challenges in integration of data sets. As the tools and methods are largely isolated, there is a need to have a uniform framework that can effectively process and analyze multi-omics data in an end-to-end manner along with easy and biologist-friendly visualization and interpretation.</p>
