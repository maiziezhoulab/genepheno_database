<abstract>
<p>Hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common sensory impairments and etiologically and genetically heterogeneous disorders in humans. Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle accompanied by non-muscular symptoms. Aberrant glycosylation of α-dystroglycan causes at least eighteen subtypes of MD, now categorized as MD-dystroglycanopathy (MD-DG), with a wide spectrum of non-muscular symptoms. Despite a growing number of MD-DG subtypes and increasing evidence regarding their molecular pathogeneses, no comprehensive study has investigated sensorineural HL (SNHL) in MD-DG. Here, we found that two mouse models of MD-DG, <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> and <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice, exhibited congenital, non-progressive, and mild-to-moderate SNHL in auditory brainstem response (ABR) accompanied by extended latency of wave I. Profoundly abnormal myelination was found at the peripheral segment of the cochlear nerve, which is rich in the glycosylated α-dystroglycan–laminin complex and demarcated by “the glial dome.” In addition, patients with Fukuyama congenital MD, a type of MD-DG, also had latent SNHL with extended latency of wave I in ABR. Collectively, these findings indicate that hearing impairment associated with impaired Schwann cell-mediated myelination at the peripheral segment of the cochlear nerve is a notable symptom of MD-DG.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common sensory impairments and heterogeneous disorders in humans. Up to 60% of HL cases are caused by genetic factors, and approximately 30% of genetic HL cases are syndromic. Although 400–700 genetic syndromes are associated with sensorineural HL (SNHL), caused due to problems in the nerve pathways from the cochlea to the brain, only about 45 genes are known to be associated with syndromic HL. Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle accompanied by non-muscular symptoms. MD-dystroglycanopathy (MD-DG), caused by aberrant glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, is an MD subtype with a wide spectrum of non-muscular symptoms. Despite a growing number of MD-DG subtypes (at least 18), no comprehensive study has investigated SNHL in MD-DG. Here, we found that hearing impairment was associated with abnormal myelination of the peripheral segment of the cochlear nerve caused by impaired dystrophin–dystroglycan complex in two mouse models (type 3 and 6) of MD-DG and in patients (type 4) with MD-DG. This is the first comprehensive study investigating SNHL in MD-DG. Our findings may provide new insights into understanding the pathogenic characteristics and mechanisms underlying inherited syndromic hearing impairment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common sensory impairments and one of the most etiologically and genetically heterogeneous disorders in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref001">1</xref>]. Congenital HL affects around 1 in 1000 live births, and an additional 1 in 1000 children will suffer from HL before adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref002">2</xref>]. Up to 60% of HL cases are caused by genetic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref001">1</xref>], and approximately 70% and 30% of genetic HL cases are non-syndromic and syndromic, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref004">4</xref>]. Based on the site of the lesion electrophysiological tests, HL is categorized into conductive, sensorineural, mixed, and central HL, as well as auditory neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref005">5</xref>]. In the past two decades, extensive studies on the genetics of hereditary HL have been conducted, implicating 121 causative genes in non-syndromic sensorineural HL (SNHL) at around 150 SNHL loci (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/">http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref004">4</xref>]. Although 400–700 genetic syndromes are accompanied by SNHL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref004">4</xref>], only about 45 genes are known to be associated with syndromic HL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref003">3</xref>]. Syndromic HL often exhibits inconsistencies in the severity of HL and the age of onset; these inconstancies exists both between and within families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are a heterogeneous group of genetic and neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles accompanied by various non-muscular symptoms. They are caused by mutations in a large variety of genes, which encode proteins of the contractile apparatus, structural proteins, and post-translational modification enzymes; currently, more than fifty causative genes have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref008">8</xref>]. MDs are categorized based on factors such as causative genes, inheritance patterns, and clinical presentations. Duchenne MD is the most common form of MD, resulting from loss of functional dystrophin, a cytoplasmic actin-binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Several forms of MDs result at least partially from defects in the dystrophin–dystroglycan complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref009">9</xref>], which serves to link the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (basal lamina). Dystroglycan is a single gene (<italic>dystrophin-associated glycoprotein 1</italic>: <italic>DAG1</italic>) product that is processed into two subunits: β-dystroglycan (β-DG), a transmembrane protein that interacts with dystrophin in the cytoplasm, and α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a highly glycosylated protein that interacts with both β-DG and multiple components of the basal lamina, such as laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Notably, proper glycosylation of α-DG is essential for its binding to the basal lamina.</p>

<p>A growing number of causative genes for congenital MD (CMD) with abnormal α-DG glycosylation, including <italic>FUKUTIN</italic>, <italic>POMGNT1</italic>, <italic>POMGNT2</italic>, <italic>FUKUTIN RELATED PROTEIN</italic> (<italic>FKRP</italic>), and <italic>LARGE</italic>, have been recognized, and to date, at least eighteen have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref008">8</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Genetic abnormalities in <italic>FUKUTIN</italic> cause Fukuyama CMD, which is the second most common form of MD in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref010">10</xref>]. As aberrant α-DG glycosylation is a common biochemical feature, the diseases are called α-dystroglycanopathy or MD-dystroglycanopathy (MD-DG). However, MD-DG is clinically heterogeneous and exhibit a wide spectrum of symptoms, from combined brain and eye anomalies to only muscular phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref011">11</xref>]. Most of the MD-DG causative genes encode enzymes that synthesize unique sugar chains of α-DG, namely CoreM1 and CoreM3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref008">8</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). LARGE is a bifunctional glycosyltransferase that synthesizes a repeating unit consisting of a glucuronic acid and a xylose, namely matriglycan, which provides the laminin-binding moiety on the terminal portion of CoreM3. FUKUTIN is an enzyme involving the synthesis of the tandem ribitol-phosphate structure, which serves as a fundamental unit required for LARGE-dependent matriglycan formation. POMGNT1 functions not only in the synthesis of CoreM1 but also plays important roles in regulating FUKUTIN function. Thus, a lack of either FUKUTIN or POMGNT1 consequently affects LARGE-dependent laminin-binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>SNHL has been reported in specific types of MD, such as facioscapulohumeral MD (FSHD) and myotonic dystrophy (DM: classified into DM1 and DM2). FSHDs (FSHD1 and FSHD2) are caused by aberrant expressions of DUX4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref013">13</xref>], and about 20% of FSHD1 patients show SNHL at high frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref014">14</xref>]. A transgenic mouse model of FSHD has been generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref015">15</xref>], and the auditory brainstem response (ABR) tests show SNHL at frequencies greater than 8 kHz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref016">16</xref>]; however, the underlying mechanism of SNHL has not been evaluated even in the FSHD transgenic mice. DM1 is caused by an expanded CTG repeat in the 3’ untranslated region of the gene encoding myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, and a high prevalence of SNHL (68%) has been reported in DM1 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref017">17</xref>]. Furthermore, dysfunction of outer hair cells (OHCs) is implicated in SNHL in DM1 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref019">19</xref>], although how OHC function is impaired has not been clarified. Additionally, it remains unclear whether SNHL is present in <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> mice, a model of Duchenne MD (19, 20). Finally, although <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd</italic></sup> mice were proposed as a model of FSHD in the 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref020">20</xref>], <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd</italic></sup> mice were later proven to be a model of MD-DG type 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, molecular mechanisms underlying SNHL in FSHD and DM are ambiguous, and hearing function in MD-DG remains unclear despite the growing categories of MD-DG.</p>
<p>In the present study, we examined hearing function in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd</italic></sup> and <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice, models of MD-DG, and patients with Fukuyama CMD, a type of MD-DG. We found hearing impairment in both MD-DG mouse models and in Fukuyama CMD patients. In the mouse models, profoundly abnormal myelination was observed at the peripheral segment of the cochlear nerve located at Rosenthal’s canal (RC) and the osseous spiral lamina (OSL), where the cochlear nerve is myelinated by Schwann cells. Our findings indicate that MD-DG is associated with congenital, non-progressive retrocochlear hearing impairment.</p>

<title>HL in <italic>Large</italic>-deficient and <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice</title>
<p>To evaluate hearing function in MD-DG, we firstly measured ABRs to click and tone-burst stimuli (8, 16, and 24 kHz) in 2-, 3-, 5-, 8-, and 10-week-old <italic>Large</italic>-deficient (<italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup>) mice. ABR threshold was significantly higher in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice regardless of the age and sound frequency, except for 24 kHz in those aged 5 weeks, than in control (WT) and heterozygous <italic>Large</italic>-deficient (<italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/wt</italic></sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The hearing impairment in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice was non-progressive. In <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice, the wave I latency, but not latencies between wave I and wave V (I-V) or III-V, was significantly delayed at the ages of 3 and 8 weeks, and the amplitude of wave I was significantly reduced at the age of 8 weeks compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), which is used to estimate OHC function in the cochlea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref022">22</xref>], was impaired in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice aged 2–9 weeks compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008826.s001">S1A Fig</xref>).

<title>Decreased levels of α-DG glycosylation, laminin, and myelin basic protein (MBP) at the RC and OSL in <italic>Large<sup>myd/myd</sup></italic> and <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice</title>
<p>In the rodent inner ear, strong immunoreactivity of α-DG has been observed in the perineural basal lamina of the peripheral, but not central, segment of the cochlear nerve, which is clearly demarcated by “the glial dome” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref026">26</xref>]. The glial dome is located at the level of the basal turn of the cochlea and is the transitional zone of Schwann cells (peripheral) and oligodendrocytes (central) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref028">28</xref>]. Notably, α-DG is strongly positive at the RC and OSL, where cell bodies of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are located and peripheral axons of SGNs (bipolar neurons) pass to reach hair cells (HCs). Moreover, greater degrees of glycosylated α-DG in the cochlea than in the cerebellum and brain have been demonstrated in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>To detect the affected lesion in the cochlea in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> and <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice, we performed immunostaining using antibodies detecting the glycosylated form of α-DG, core α-DG protein, β-DG, pan-laminin, or laminin α2. Although immunoreactivities of core α-DG and β-DG did not differ between control and <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice, those of glycosylated α-DG, pan-laminin, and laminin α2 significantly decreased at the peripheral portion of the cochlear nerve (distal from the glial dome), especially at the RC and OSL, in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>).

Furthermore, the immunoreactivity of laminin α2 was mildly but significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). We were unable to show the decreased levels of glycosylated α-DG or laminin α2 by immunoblotting because of the limitation of the antibodies.

Although POMGnT1 and Fukutin expression has been reported in astrocytes, Large, POMGnT1, or Fukutin expression in Schwann cells has not been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref036">36</xref>]. In peripheral nerves, α-DG is expressed in the outer (abaxonal) membranes of Schwann cells to bind to basal lamina proteins, such as laminin α2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref032">32</xref>]. The mechanism of myelin formation, in which the anchorage of the abaxonal membranes to the basal lamina provided by the α-DG–laminin complex enables the inner lips of spiraling Schwann cells to progress over the axonal membranes, is well studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref038">38</xref>]. Impairment of peripheral nerve myelination causing various axonal abnormalities, including naked axons and axons with abnormal myelin, was reported in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref039">39</xref>], <italic>Fukutin</italic>-deficient chimeric mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref040">40</xref>], a patient with <italic>LAMA2</italic> deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref041">41</xref>], and a Fukuyama CMD patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref042">42</xref>]. Moreover, the dystroglycan–laminin complex is reportedly more important for myelination/differentiation of Schwann cells than for their survival/proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref043">43</xref>]. The findings in these studies support our results that α-DG and laminin α2 are critical for myelin formation in the peripheral segment of the cochlear nerve.</p>
<p>The mechanisms underlying abnormal DPOAE in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice, but not in <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice, are currently unknown because we were unable to detect morphological abnormality of OHCs or connective spaces between OHCs and supporting cells or between OHCs and underlying basal lamina, where α-DG is reportedly expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref026">26</xref>], in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008826.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Since MD-DG is a complex disease, which causes lesions in many organs and tissues, including the peripheral nerves, brainstem, and brain, one simple explanation is that the efferent fibers in the cochlear nerve, relaying the feedback from cortico-olivocochlear pathways, which is proposed to modulate otoacoustic emission (OAE) generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref044">44</xref>], could be more severely affected in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> than in <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice. Although abnormal cortico-olivocochlear efferent function is associated with various auditory disorders, such as hyperacusis, tinnitus, and poor speech-in-noise recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref046">46</xref>], its effects on OAE are controversial; its activation decreases and enhances OAE levels depending on stimuli and conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref047">47</xref>]. Another possibility is that cochleae in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice may have functional issues, but not morphological ones. Since α-DG is reported to be widely expressed in rodent and human cochlea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref048">48</xref>], including in the stria vascularis where endocochlear potential is generated, MD-DG dysfunction may affect cochlear function due to reduced endocochlear potential. Indeed, mild morphological atrophy was reported in the stria vascularis in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease type 1B (CMT1B), which is caused by congenital anomalies in myelination by Schwann cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref050">50</xref>]. Additionally, because SNHL in DM1 shows abnormal OAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref019">19</xref>], the same mechanism may underlie the dysfunction of <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> cochlea.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice showed milder phenotypes than did <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice. There are three possible explanations: 1) <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice show the detectable amount of properly glycosylated α-DG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref051">51</xref>], whereas properly glycosylated α-DG is completely absent in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref052">52</xref>]. This difference might be due to different enzyme functions: Large is an enzyme responsible for synthesizing laminin-binding matriglycan, whereas POMGnT1 acts as a regulatory enzyme for matriglycan formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref008">8</xref>]; 2) more than 60% of <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice usually die within 3 weeks after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref053">53</xref>]; notably, the present study used mice aged ≥ 4 weeks, which probably had milder phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref054">54</xref>]. In fact, there is broad phenotypic variability in patients with abnormal <italic>POMGNT1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref057">57</xref>]; and 3) the genetic backgrounds of <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> and <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice are different (C57B/6 and 129SvEv, respectively). Regarding the recovery of wave I latency observed in 10-week-old <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice, they showed fewer secondary axonal changes than <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008826.s004">S4B and S4D Fig</xref>), suggesting that, judged on the basis of morphological phenotypes, surviving <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice may have a greater potential for functional recovery than <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice. Alternatively, in addition to lesions at the peripheral segment of the cochlear nerve, <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO mice may have other lesions, which affect the early hearing phenotype but improve by 10 weeks of age.</p>
<p>Whether MD-DG pathology can lead to SNHL in humans remains an open question. Recently, mild to moderate HL was found in two patients (siblings) with homozygous truncating mutation in <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl kinase (POMK, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), which is required for α-DG glycosylation, and this disease was classified as MD-DG 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref058">58</xref>]. Among 9 reported patients in 6 families with mutations in <italic>POMK</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref062">62</xref>], SNHL was demonstrated in the above mentioned two patients. Among 23 reported patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref063">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref065">65</xref>] with mutations in <italic>B3GALNT2</italic> (MD-DG 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), one patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref066">66</xref>] had SNHL. Six patients in four families with <italic>LARGE</italic> mutations were reported, but hearing function based on intensive evaluation was not described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref069">69</xref>]. In patients with <italic>POMGNT1</italic> mutations, symptoms associated with SNHL have not been investigated to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref057">57</xref>], and no Fukuyama CMD patient with SNHL has been reported either. The Fukuyama CMD patients showed prolonged ABR wave I latency, but their hearing thresholds are less than 40 dB, which is the minimum sound intensity used in this study. Nevertheless, prolonged wave I latency may cause minor hearing symptoms such as tinnitus, since several studies suggested that prolonged latency and reduced amplitude of wave I are characteristic findings for tinnitus patients with normal hearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref070">70</xref>]. Recently, “hidden HL” has been referred to as hearing dysfunction that cannot detected by standard tests of auditory thresholds, but can be diagnosed by a reduced wave I amplitude in the absence of ABR threshold or latency changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref071">71</xref>]. In addition to cochlear synaptopathy, which is induced by impaired synaptic connection between HCs and the cochlear nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref072">72</xref>], peripheral neuropathy including demyelination of the cochlear nerve has been reported as a cause of “hidden HL” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref071">71</xref>]. Demyelination-related hidden HL reportedly had an additional phenotype of permanently increased wave I latency in Guillain-Barre syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref073">73</xref>]. Additionally, demyelination-related hidden HL with abnormal speech recognition ability in noisy backgrounds, but normal ABR amplitude and latency, was reported in CMT type 1A (CMT1A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref074">74</xref>].</p>
<p>CMT1A and CMT1B are neuropathies caused by genetic abnormalities in peripheral myelin protein 22 and myelin protein zero, respectively, which are the main myelination-associated proteins in Schwann cells, and commonly show progressive SNHL starting in adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref075">75</xref>]. Although Kovach et al. and Starr et al. reported abnormal ABR accompanied by decreased or absent OAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref076">76</xref>], the principal pathology of CMT1B is myelin damage of the cochlear nerve initiating distally (accompanied by secondary damage of the cochlear nerve axons) without IHC loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref050">50</xref>]. While children with CMT1A showed no prolonged latency of wave I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref075">75</xref>], adult patients showed prolonged latency of wave I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref077">77</xref>]. Thus, both CMT1 and MD-DG cause primary lesions at the distal portion of the cochlear nerve; however, CMT1 shows a progressive phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref075">75</xref>]. This difference is most likely to arise due to from the different etiologies of CMT1 and MD-DG (autosomal dominant vs. autosomal recessive inheritance, respectively), and the degree of cochlear synaptopathy involvement may also be different in the two diseases. Possible dysmyelination at the peripheral cochlear nerve in Fukuyama CMD patients may accompany cochlear synaptopathy, and may cause similar symptoms of “hidden HL”, including tinnitus and hyperacusis. These pathologies that are otherwise missed in routine clinical examination could be detected by more intensive hearing assays, such as speech recognition test in noisy backgrounds and estimation of auditory temporal resolution/processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref074">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref075">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref078">78</xref>], suggesting that other types of MD-DGs also cause previously unrecognized common and specific retrocochlear pathologies with widely varying degrees of hearing impairment.</p>
<p>Fukuyama CMD is characterized by the combination of MD and dysgenesis of the central nerve system (CNS). However, a good mouse model of Fukuyama CMD is not available. Mice with knock-in of the SVA-transposal insertion, the most frequent mutation in Japanese Fukuyama CMD patients, show no phenotype because of the only 50% binding reduction in laminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref051">51</xref>], and conventional <italic>Fukutin</italic>-KO mice are embryonic lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref079">79</xref>]. Brain MRI of Fukuyama CMD patients demonstrates that cerebral cortical dysplasia is the most frequently detected anomalies (97/207 patients), and white matter abnormalities are the second detected anomalies (35/207 patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref010">10</xref>]. To date, it is unclear whether white matter lesions are involved in delayed myelination or dysmyelination. Delayed myelination is supported by the observation that white matter lesions lessen with age (usually until 5-year-old) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref080">80</xref>]. In addition, other studies support dysmyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref081">81</xref>] or/and hypomyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref082">82</xref>] based on the following observations: 1) inconsistent distribution of white matter lesions with the time-course of myelination process, 2) no disappearing of white matter lesions in some patients (elder than 5-year-old) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref080">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref083">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref084">84</xref>], and 3) data using MR spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref085">85</xref>]. Taken together, white matter lesions are not simply delayed myelination, but dysmyelination or/and hypomyelination is more or less involved. Indeed, we detected mildly decreased levels of MBP in the brain and the proximal cochlear nerve of <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice. In addition to the white matter lesions, Fukuyama CMD patients have dysplasia in the brain, which may also affect hearing function. However, we detected the prolonged latency of wave I with normal interpeak latency between waves I and V in ABR in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd/myd</italic></sup> mice, as well as in Fukuyama CMD patients, indicating that the main lesions for SNHL in MD-DG are at the peripheral segment of the cochlear nerve myelinated by Schwann cells, rather than in the brain.</p>
<p>No HL in Duchenne/Becker MD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref086">86</xref>], as well as <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx/mdx</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref087">87</xref>], may be due to compensations by other types of dystrophins and/or utrophin, a homolog of dystrophin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref088">88</xref>]. Indeed, specific dystrophin (Dp116) and utrophin are the major subtypes of dystrophins in Schwann cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref088">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref090">90</xref>]; furthermore, Duchenne MD patients with Dp116 deficiency have no apparent peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref086">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref091">91</xref>]. In addition, agrin, as well as laminin 2, has been shown as the binding partners of α-DG in Schwann cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref092">92</xref>]. These diversities of dystrophin–dystroglycan complex in Schwann cells may account for the milder hearing phenotypes in Fukuyama CMD patients than in two mouse models.</p>
<p>The present study indicates that both animal models and patients of MD-DG have impaired myelination at the peripheral segment of the cochlear nerve (at the RC and OSL), which potentially causes retrocochlear/retrolabyrinthine hearing impairment. Other types of MDs, including Duchenne/Becker MD, may also have the cryptic lesions at the peripheral segment of the cochlear nerve, leading to various types of hearing impairments/symptoms such as HL, “hidden HL”, hyperacusis, and tinnitus. However, we did not find correlations between genotypes (homozygous vs. heterozygous mutation, which generally predict severity of MD phenotypes) and hearing phenotype (prolonged latency of wave I in ABR) in Fukuyama CMD patients. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to further investigate HL in diseases with impairments of the dystrophin–dystroglycan complex.</p>

Sections were visualized after staining with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.02% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6). Slides were washed and were mounted in Entellan New (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), coverslipped, and photographed under a light microscope (Axioplan II; Carl Zeiss) equipped with a DP26 camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>For the quantitative assessment of DAB intensity, we compared sample pairs (control vs. mutant) prepared (fixed, embedded into paraffin, cut into slices, and immunostained) on the same day and as per the same schedule and conditions, such as the duration of developing times. We used ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and the color deconvolution plugin for proper separation of the DAB color spectra, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref097">97</xref>]. Briefly, the region of interest (ROI, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) was manually determined with the polygon or freehand tool, and the deconvoluted image was then analyzed pixel-by-pixel. The color threshold for the positive area was defined in the range of 61–125/255, and the ratio of the positive area to the total image area was calculated and presented as a percentage of the control sample ratio.</p>

<title>ABR and DPOAE measurements</title>
<p>To assess hearing, ABR and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) were measured in mice under anesthetization with a mixture of medetomidine, midazolam, and butorphanol (intraperitoneal, 0.3 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg, and 5.0 mg/kg, respectively) and on a heating pad. In mice, ABR and DPOAE are reportedly mature and saturated at 2 weeks and 2–4 weeks after birth, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref023">23</xref>]. Blinded data analysis was performed by two otologists.</p>
<p>ABR was measured in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd</italic></sup>, <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO, and <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> mice with their littermate control mice at the indicated ages, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref096">96</xref>]. ABR waveforms using sound stimuli of clicks or tone bursts at 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 24 kHz, or 32 kHz were recorded for 12.8 ms at a sampling rate of 40,000 Hz using 50–5000 Hz band-pass filter settings, and ABR waveforms from 500 stimuli were averaged. ABR thresholds (dB SPL) were defined by decreasing the sound intensity by 5 dB intervals until the lowest sound intensity level, resulting in a recognizable ABR wave pattern (mainly judged by recognition of wave III), was achieved.</p>
<p>DPOAE was measured in <italic>Large</italic><sup><italic>myd</italic></sup>, <italic>POMGnT1</italic>-KO, <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> mice with their littermate controls at the indicated ages, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref096">96</xref>]. DPOAE at frequency of 2f1–f2 were elicited using two primary tone stimuli, f1 and f2, with sound pressure levels of 65 and 55 dB SPL respectively, with f2/f1 = 1.20. DPOAE amplitudes (dB SPL) were measured at f2 frequencies of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, and 20 kHz and plotted after substitution with noise floor amplitude.</p>

<title>ABR studies in humans</title>
<p>The auditory function in Fukuyama CMD patients was evaluated using ABR. In order to avoid risks related to the sedation procedures in Fukuyama CMD patients, which is usually required for conventional ABR testing, we used the Integrity 500 System (Rion Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) that can measure ABR in awake patients using a combination of in situ amplifier-electrodes and Kalman-weighted averaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref099">99</xref>]. Each participant was examined by otoscopy prior to the ABR testing, and participants with abnormal otoscopic findings were excluded from the study. The normal hearing in controls was verified by responses to pure tone audiometry or condition-oriented response audiometry at sound intensity of 40 dB in 1 kHz and 4 kHz. The ABR waveforms using click stimuli presented through insert-earphones (Intelligent Hearing Systems, Miami, FL) were recorded for 25.0 ms at a sampling rate of 27.5 Hz using 30–1500 Hz band-pass filter settings. Equivalent sweeps determined by Kalman weighted algorithm were spontaneously averaged and visualized as ABR waveforms, and the recording was continued until both wave I and V became recognizable and plateaued or the number of the equivalent sweeps became larger than 2000.</p>
<p>Obtained ABR waveforms with sound intensity of 40 dB SPL and 60 dB SPL were evaluated by two otologists. A non-recognizable wave pattern larger than 2000 equivalent sweeps was defined as no response. ABR thresholds were determined as minimal sound intensities at which recognizable wave V was obtained. After the thresholds were determined, the latency and amplitude of each wave were analyzed at 60 dB, since the waveform was more clearly determined at 60 dB than at 40 dB.　The amplitudes and the latencies of wave I and V and the interpeak latency between wave I and V in Fukuyama CMD patients were analyzed and compared with those in age- and sex-matched normal controls. An amplitude of a wave was defined as the voltage difference between the peak of the wave and the adjacent negative peak after the wave.</p>

<title>TEM</title>
<p>Sample preparation and observation were conducted as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008826.ref024">24</xref>]. Briefly, freshly dissected inner ear tissues were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PB. OC epithelia were dissected in the same buffer and postfixed with 1% OsO4 in H<sub>2</sub>O for 1 h. For TEM analyses, samples were embedded in Spurr Low-Viscosity Embedding Media after post-fixation (Polysciences, Germany) and polymerized at 70°C for 8 h. Ultra-thin sections (thickness ~70 nm) were cut using an ultramicrotome (EM-UC7; Leica Microsystems, Germany), placed on copper grids, and examined on Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope at 80 kV.</p>
<p>For the quantitative assessment of myelination, we classified abnormal axons into three categories in the transverse section at the OSL (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008826.g006">Fig 6A</xref>): “naked axons”, “axons with disrupted myelin”, and “axons with secondary changes (vacuoles and/or aggregates)”. “Axons with abnormal myelination” was defined as the sum of “naked axons” and “axons with disrupted myelin.” An “axon with myelination” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008826.s005">S5B Fig</xref>) was defined as a myelinated axon regardless of myelin morphology. We also measured the longest diameter of each myelinated axon (including axons with abnormal myelin, but excluding naked axons) in the transverse section at the OSL; their distribution is shown as a bar graph (x-axis: diameter, y-axis: number of axon) and boxplot.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: This is a solid descriptive study of hearing loss in two mouse models of muscular dystrophy. Muscular dystrophy is caused by degeneration of skeletal muscles, often due to changes in the dystrophin-dystroglycan complex, which mediates attachments between cells and the extracellular matrix. Because this complex is present in other tissues, some forms of MD may include additional phenotypes, such as sensorineural hearing loss. The origin and nature of MD associated hearing loss is not well defined. This study provides new evidence that hearing may be affected in some forms of MD, possibly due to changes in myelination. Specifically, the data show that 1) ABR and DPOAE thresholds are elevated in Large(myd/myd) mutant mice, with decreased ABR wave 1 amplitudes and increased wave 1 latencies; 2) ABR but not DPOAE thresholds are modestly elevated in POMGnT1-KO mice; 3) alpha-DG and laminin alpha2 levels are diminished in the myd/myd and POMGnT1-KO mice, as shown by immunostaining and Western blot; 4) myelination is affected, with decreased MBP and CNPase levels and structurally abnormal myelin shown by EM; 5) Wave 1 is also delayed in patients with Fukuyama congenital MD. Thus, the authors conclude that “Impaired alpha-dystroglycan sugar chains at the peripheral cochlear nerve cause congenital hearing loss with dysmyelination.”</p>
<p>Overall, the study presents interesting new data highlighting the possibility of hearing loss in some (but not all) forms of MD. The data convincingly demonstrate that hearing is affected in two mouse models, both of which show associated changes in the levels of glycosylated alphya-dystroglycan and laminin in the region of the cochlea where SGN peripheral processes are myelinated. Further, the authors show changes in myelination that are stronger distal to the glial dome than proximal. My major criticism is that the data do not firmly link the observed cellular changes to the auditory phenotype. Specifically, although the data do support the conclusion that both mouse strains exhibit congenital hearing loss with dysmyelination, the data do not prove that the changes in the sugar changes in the peripheral nerve are responsible for all of the reported phenotypes (i.e. elevated thresholds, abnormal DPOAEs). Additionally, the dysmyelination phenotype needs to be quantified better.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>1. The title is not accurate. The studies convincingly show that alpha-dystroglycan and laminin protein levels are decreased at the peripheral cochlear nerve and that the mice do not hear well, but the experiments do not directly link these two observations. In fact, it is striking that the hearing phenotypes differ in the two mouse models: DPOAEs are essentially absent in the myd/myd mice but normal in the POMGnT1-KO mice. Since there is a strong DPOAE phenotype in the myd/myd mice, it is impossible to interpret the decreased wave 1 amplitude and increased latency, as these changes could be secondary to abnormal cochlear function. The POMGnT1-KO mice show only a transient change in wave I latency though thresholds are elevated at all ages. Since the abnormal myelination is shown at 10 weeks in that mutant, a time when latencies are recovered, it seems like the change in myelination cannot be responsible for the change in latency. Also, since both mice show changes in alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and dysmyelination in the peripheral cochlear nerve yet only one strain shows a DPOAE phenotype, these cellular phenotypes are unlikely to be the full explanation for the observed hearing loss. Other interpretations need to be considered.</p>
<p>2. The authors demonstrate changes in alpha-dystroglycan and laminin using both immunohistochemistry and Western blot. However, it is hard for me to interpret the immunohistochemistry since it is an enzymatic detection using DAB substrate, which is not a quantitatively reliable assay. The authors should note whether the control and mutant tissues were processed on the same slides and developed for the same amount of time. This information was not provided in the Methods section.</p>
<p>3. The dysmyelination phenotype is striking but needs to be better quantified. I do not understand what is meant by “dispersion of the longest diameter in the myelinated axon” (p. 10, 212-210). This made it very hard for me to assess the data shown in Fig. 6. Please explain exactly what was measured and how. Likewise, I do not understand the definition of “normal myelinated axons” or how that was assessed objectively. Since the effect on myelination in both mouse lines is a key finding, these data should be better quantified overall. For instance, Fig 6 illustrates naked axons, disrupted myelin, vacuolated axons, and aggregated axons. The authors should quantify the incidence of each of these pathologies, blind to genotype, in mutants and littermate controls.</p>
<p>4. The authors note that “None of the FCMD patients analyzed had complaint of deafness” (line 236, page 11), but go on to show that wave 1 latencies were increased. The authors should discuss this point in the Discussion, as it has an impact on the clinical value of the information presented. For instance, please discuss how increased latencies might affect hearing and whether there are assays that might reveal a deficit that is otherwise missed by both the audiologists and the patients.</p>
<p>5. Since the primary cellular phenotype seems to be a change in myelination, there should also be some discussion of how the hearing phenotype compares to what is observed in other mouse models with impaired myelination.</p>
<p>6. For the patient analysis, the authors should report auditory thresholds so that the effect on latencies can be properly interpreted. I am also curious whether patients with “mild” motor phenotypes also had “mild” effects on latency.</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>1. I expect this paper will be interesting to hearing researchers who are unlikely to be familiar with the various forms of muscular dystrophy. The introduction needs to be improved to make it easier for non-experts to follow the differences between the three mouse models presented as well as the human form of MD that is assessed. This could be achieved by reworking the introduction and perhaps adding a figure introducing the various enzymes related to the mouse and human mutants that are ultimately examined.</p>
<p>2. I do not think it is appropriate to use a phrase such as “To prove our hypothesis.” This wording suggests that the authors wanted to be right. It is more appropriate to say “To test our hypothesis.” This may seem minor but I think it is important to demonstrate a value for unbiased and objective approaches in official scientific publications.</p>
<p>3. The paper should be proofread and edited for improved clarity. For instance, I believe “torn bursts” is meant to be “tone bursts” (line 420, p. 20) and “spinal ganglion” should be “spiral ganglion” (line 822, p. 36).</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In the manuscript by Morioka et al., the authors catalog numerous phenotypes in mainly two mouse models (Large and Pomgnt1 deletion lines) for muscular dystrophy. Both mouse models show hearing impairment with some aspects being progressive. Importantly, the authors zero in on various Schwann cell phenotypic defects in their models, including defects in myelination, alpha-Dystroglycan expression, laminin expression and others. The data from the mouse models is correlated with auditory defects reported in patients with muscular dystrophy. Thus, with regard to muscular dystrophy, the authors draw a reasonable link between their mouse models and a patient population. In their analyses, the authors performed a battery of quantitative comparisons (between mutants and WT) and the sample power and statistical analyses throughout the manuscript are excellent. The experiments are reported in logical sequence and appropriate control experiments are provided.</p>
<p>One complaint is that the title of the manuscript suggests the authors have discovered a causal link between the loss of alpha-dystroglycan and hearing loss. This is not at all accomplished and so a more conservative title is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>The Discussion should provide more information on important future directions, like an investigation of the temporal and spatial expression patterns of Large and Pomgnt1. There should also be a more thorough discussion of possible defects in efferent fibers and OHC function, which could underlie the DPOAE defects reported. Also, have the Schwann cells started to die off at some point? Are they poorly differentiated? These questions should also be addressed in the Discussion.</p>
<p>A few minor issues:</p>
<p>The authors use excessive acronyms and these add a lot of visual clutter to the narrative. I suggest choosing only two or three terms to reduce to acronyms, and to otherwise spell out everything else.</p>
<p>The statement in the last two sentences of the 2nd paragraph (Discussion section, line 278-281) needs references to back up the hypothesis.</p>
<p>Figure 4D and S2B: Can authors show quantitative data for this experiment?</p>
<p>Line 399: Is this reference to figure 4C accurate?</p>
<p>Figure S6: Is this figure missing quantitative data? The Figure legend says that the results are presented as mean of at least 3 representative experiments.</p>
<p>Figure S6: The cartoon has some thick lines extending from HCs. What are these?</p>

<p>Reviewer #2: The authors put forth great effort to address the concerns that came from the first submission. The manuscript is well-suited for publication. One note -- during the revisions, the authors apparently had some survival issues in their POMGnT1-KO mice, which left them with limited sample numbers for quantifying Western blots. They included what they had in Supplementary Figures 2A and 2C. However, the small sample size precluded statistical significance and so statistical data are not shown. Given the small sample size, my opinion is that these data are preliminary and not suitable for publication. I suggest the authors remove Supplementary Figures 2A and C and note the trends and limited sample numbers in the Results section.</p>

<p>Before your submission can be formally accepted and sent to production you will need to complete our formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Please note: the accept date on your published article will reflect the date of this provisional accept, but your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until the required changes have been made.</p>
<p>Once your paper is formally accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you’ve already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosgenetics@plos.org</email>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pgenetics/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pgenetics/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production and billing process. Note that PLOS requires an ORCID iD for all corresponding authors. Therefore, please ensure that you have an ORCID iD and that it is validated in Editorial Manager. To do this, go to ‘Update my Information’ (in the upper left-hand corner of the main menu), and click on the Fetch/Validate link next to the ORCID field.  This will take you to the ORCID site and allow you to create a new iD or authenticate a pre-existing iD in Editorial Manager.</p>
<p>If you have a press-related query, or would like to know about one way to make your underlying data available (as you will be aware, this is required for publication), please see the end of this email. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming article at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. Inform journal staff as soon as possible if you are preparing a press release for your article and need a publication date.</p>
<p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Genetics!</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<bold>Data Deposition</bold>
</p>
<p>If you have submitted a Research Article or Front Matter that has associated data that are not suitable for deposition in a subject-specific public repository (such as GenBank or ArrayExpress), one way to make that data available is to deposit it in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.datadryad.org">Dryad Digital Repository</ext-link>. As you may recall, we ask all authors to agree to make data available; this is one way to achieve that. A full list of recommended repositories can be found on our <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories">website</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The following link will take you to the Dryad record for your article, so you won't have to re‐enter its bibliographic information, and can upload your files directly: </p>
