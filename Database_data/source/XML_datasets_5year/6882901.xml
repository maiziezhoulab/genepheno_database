<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic>, which encode proteins that negatively regulate mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). TSC is associated with significant cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral problems, collectively termed TSC-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TAND), and the cell types responsible for these manifestations are largely unknown. Here we use cell type-specific <italic>Tsc1</italic> deletion to test whether dopamine neurons, which modulate cognitive, motivational, and affective behaviors, are involved in TAND. We show that loss of Tsc1 and constitutive activation of mTORC1 in dopamine neurons causes somatodendritic hypertrophy, reduces intrinsic excitability, alters axon terminal structure, and impairs striatal dopamine release. These perturbations lead to a selective deficit in cognitive flexibility, preventable by genetic reduction of the mTOR-binding protein Raptor. Our results establish a critical role for Tsc1-mTORC1 signaling in setting the functional properties of dopamine neurons, and indicate that dopaminergic dysfunction may contribute to cognitive inflexibility in TSC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a ubiquitously expressed, conserved signaling cascade that integrates intra- and extracellular signals to regulate cellular metabolism and growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Deregulation of mTOR signaling is linked to numerous diseases, with particularly detrimental outcomes for nervous system development and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. mTOR functions as a kinase within two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that have distinct protein components, upstream activators, and downstream targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Activation of mTORC1 promotes anabolic functions, including protein and lipid synthesis, and suppresses autophagy, leading to cell growth and division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. mTORC1 activity is negatively regulated by the heterodimeric Tsc1/2 protein complex that exerts GTP-ase-activating (GAP) activity on the small GTP-ase Rheb, a direct activator of mTORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Disruption of the Tsc1/2 complex results in constitutively active mTORC1, leading to altered cell growth, metabolism, and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">In post-mitotic neurons, Tsc1/2-mTORC1 signaling controls neuronal communication in a cell type-specific manner via regulation of membrane excitability, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Loss-of-function mutations in negative regulators of mTORC1 cause neurodevelopmental syndromes associated with significant neurological and psychiatric impairments. In particular, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which results from mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic>, causes early-onset epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, patients frequently present with neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), affective disorders, and cognitive deficits, collectively termed TAND (TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. TAND is a major burden for patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; however, little is known about how mutations in <italic>TSC1/2</italic> cause neuropsychiatric and behavioral abnormalities. In particular, the specific neuronal populations responsible for TAND and the functional consequences of mTOR pathway mutations on these neurons remain to be defined.</p>
<p id="Par5">Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) modulate a host of motivated behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Given the involvement of DA signaling in many of the neuropsychiatric conditions associated with TSC, we hypothesized that changes in DA signaling may contribute to TAND. To test this, we selectively deleted <italic>Tsc1</italic> from mouse DA neurons. This cell type-targeted approach allowed us to test whether constitutive activation of mTORC1 signaling in DA neurons alone was sufficient to drive TAND-related phenotypes.</p>
<p id="Par6">Here we find that DA neurons are particularly sensitive to changes in mTORC1 signaling, as chronic activation of mTORC1 due to Tsc1 loss profoundly affects their structure and function resulting in significant impairments in striatal DA release. This dopaminergic deficit is associated with reduced cognitive flexibility in the absence of changes to motor or social behaviors. Our findings pinpoint mTORC1 as a critical regulator of midbrain DA neuron output and suggest that cognitive inflexibility in mTOR-related disorders may involve changes in DA signaling.</p>

<title>Loss of Tsc1 causes DA neuron somatodendritic remodeling</title>
<p id="Par7">The goal of this study was to test the sufficiency of manipulating mTORC1 signaling in DA neurons to drive cellular and behavioral phenotypes relevant to TAND. To do this, we conditionally deleted <italic>Tsc1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, which results in loss of function of the Tsc1/2 complex, from DA neurons using <italic>DAT</italic><sup><italic>IRES</italic></sup><italic>Cre</italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Mice were heterozygous for <italic>DAT</italic><sup><italic>IRES</italic></sup><italic>Cre</italic> and had either wild-type (DA-Tsc1 WT) or homozygous floxed alleles of <italic>Tsc1</italic> (DA-Tsc1 KO) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a, b</xref>). We quantified phosphorylation of the mTORC1 pathway target ribosomal protein S6 (p-S6) in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-labeled SNc and VTA neurons as a read-out of mTORC1 activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a–e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c, d</xref>). p-S6 levels were significantly higher in DA-Tsc1-KO neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1d</xref>), indicative of activated mTORC1 signaling. Consistent with the known function of mTORC1 in controlling cell size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, loss of Tsc1 caused a profound increase in DA neuron soma area (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1e</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>DA-Tsc1-KO SNc neurons are hypertrophic. <bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold> Confocal images of midbrain sections from DA-Tsc1-WT (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>) and DA-Tsc1-KO (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold>) mice labeled with antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phosphorylated S6 (p-S6, Ser240/244), scale bars = 200 μm. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>d</bold> show higher magnification merged images of the boxed regions in <bold>a</bold>, <bold>c</bold>, scale bars = 50 μm. <bold>e</bold>, <bold>f</bold> Cumulative probability plots of SNc DA neuron p-S6 levels (<bold>e</bold>) and soma area (<bold>f</bold>) (DA-Tsc1 WT: <italic>n</italic> = 759 neurons from three mice, DA-Tsc1 KO: <italic>n</italic> = 855 neurons from three mice). ****<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. <bold>g</bold> Three-dimensional reconstructions of SNc DA neurons. <bold>h</bold> Sholl analysis of SNc DA neurons.

<p id="Par8">In addition to somatic hypertrophy, altered dendrite branching has been observed in neurons with mutations in mTORC1 regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We performed Sholl analysis of neurobiotin-filled neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1f</xref>) and found that SNc and VTA DA neurons in DA-Tsc1-KO mice had more complex dendrites and increased total dendritic length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g–i</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1g–i</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that loss of Tsc1 strongly impacts the somatodendritic architecture of midbrain DA neurons.</p>

<title>Tsc1 loss from DA neurons reduces intrinsic excitability</title>
<p id="Par9">To test whether the extensive somatodendritic remodeling in DA-Tsc1-KO neurons resulted in a change to their membrane properties, we performed whole-cell recordings from DA neurons identified by a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). Consistent with their hypertrophy, SNc and VTA DA-Tsc1-KO neurons had significantly increased membrane capacitance and decreased membrane resistance compared to WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1j, k</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1j, k</xref>, and Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). In response to hyperpolarization, midbrain DA neurons often exhibit a membrane potential sag mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Although the absolute sag amplitude was significantly reduced in DA-Tsc1-KO neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1l</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1l</xref>), when expressed as a percentage of the maximum hyperpolarization from baseline, there was no difference between genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1m</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1m</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). This suggests that DA-Tsc1-KO neurons have normal HCN activation, but that changes in their passive membrane properties affect their overall response to hyperpolarizing current.</p>

<p id="Par22">Taken together, the EM analyses revealed profound axon profile hypertrophy and reduced vesicle density and clustering in the dorsal striatum of DA-Tsc1-KO mice. Since the TH + axon profiles in the NAc from the same DA-Tsc1-KO mice were either not significantly changed or only modestly affected, it is likely that these selective changes in axonal architecture underpin the observed striatal region-specific deficits in DA release (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>).</p>

<title>DA-Tsc1-KO mice exhibit reduced cognitive flexibility</title>
<p id="Par27">Cognitive flexibility is commonly disrupted in TSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and in several neuropsychiatric conditions including ASD and ADHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Dorsal striatal DA signaling has been implicated in cognitive flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and decreased striatal DA is associated with reduced cognitive performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. We therefore hypothesized that loss of Tsc1 from DA neurons may disrupt cognitive flexibility. To examine associative learning and cognitive flexibility, we used the four-choice odor-based reversal task (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, in which reversal learning is sensitive to changes in DA neuron function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. We found that male DA-Tsc1-KO mice exhibited intact acquisition learning, reaching criterion in a similar number of trials (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>) and making, on average, the same number of errors as littermate controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>). Plots of the cumulative rewards received by individual mice across trials showed that the genotypes were overlapping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d</xref>). By contrast, when the rewarded odor was changed the following day, DA-Tsc1-KO mice took, on average, significantly longer to reach criterion and made more total errors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e, f</xref>). The time course of cumulative rewards during reversal learning shows that half of the DA-Tsc1-KO mice went more than 20 trials before earning a reward, while all DA-Tsc1-WT mice had received a reward by trial 20 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7g</xref>). For both genotypes, the majority of errors were perseverative (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7h</xref>), meaning that the mice continued to choose the initially learned odor even when it was no longer rewarded. However, DA-Tsc1-KO mice made significantly more perseverative errors than WT littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7h</xref>). Thus, DA-Tsc1-KO mice exhibited a selective deficit in cognitive flexibility characterized by perseveration, wherein they were slower to update their behavioral strategy in the face of changed environmental demands.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>DA-Tsc1-KO mice exhibit reduced cognitive flexibility. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of the four-choice odor-based reversal learning task. Orange ring denotes the food reward.

<p id="Par28">It is unlikely that these findings were due to alterations in odor preference or sensitivity as mice of both genotypes showed similar spontaneous odor preference in the first four trials of acquisition learning and could clearly discriminate between the four odors prior to making a digging choice. Differences in hunger status or motivation were also unlikely as both groups consumed a similar number of total rewards during acquisition and reversal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7i</xref>). Additionally, during reversal learning, once the DA-Tsc1-KO mice made their first correct odor choice, they took a similar number of trials to reach criterion as DA-Tsc1-WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7j</xref>). These data indicate that perseveration to choose the initially rewarded odor at the expense of exploring other odors was the main driver for the slower reversal learning in DA-Tsc1-KO mice. This is further supported by plotting the average odor choices in four trial bins during the first 16 trials of reversal learning (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7k</xref>). This analysis shows that DA-Tsc1-KO mice continue to choose the initially rewarded odor for longer, while DA-Tsc1-WT mice are faster to switch their odor choice. Together, these results demonstrate that loss of Tsc1 from DA neurons is sufficient to increase perseveration and reduce cognitive flexibility in mice.</p>

<title>Systemic rapamycin does not suppress mTORC1 in DA neurons</title>
<p id="Par29">To test whether phenotypes observed in DA-Tsc1-KO mice could be rescued by pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR signaling, we treated mice chronically with rapamycin (8 mg/kg per day, 3 days a week) for 2 months starting at 4 weeks of age. We quantified p-S6 levels as a read-out of mTORC1 signaling, and found, surprisingly, that rapamycin treatment did not reduce p-S6 levels in DA neurons compared to vehicle in either DA-Tsc1-WT or DA-Tsc1-KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Importantly, however, when we analyzed hippocampal and cerebellar neurons from the same mice, we found the expected decrease in p-S6 levels after rapamycin treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>), consistent with prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par31">We found that homozygous deletion of <italic>Rptor</italic> from DA-Tsc1-KO mice completely suppressed mTORC1 activity in DA neurons, as shown by the lack of p-S6 immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7b–f</xref>). DA neuron soma size was significantly smaller in DA-Tsc1-KO/Rptor-KO mice, and TH levels were reduced (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7g, h</xref>). However, complete loss of Raptor was not able to rescue the dorsal striatal DA release deficits (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7i–l</xref>). This may be a result of impaired DA synthesis, given the reduced TH levels. These results demonstrate that overactivation or complete suppression of mTORC1 are similarly detrimental to striatal DA transmission.</p>
<p id="Par32">We next tested whether reduction, rather than complete suppression, of mTORC1 could prevent phenotypes in DA-Tsc1-KO mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par35">In this study, we used a cell type-targeted approach to investigate how loss of Tsc1 and deregulation of mTORC1 affect the dopaminergic system. We found that deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> from DA neurons strongly impacted their properties leading to somatodendritic and axonal hypertrophy, reduced intrinsic excitability, and impaired striatal DA release. These cellular changes were sufficient to reduce cognitive flexibility in a reversal learning task. We showed that DA release deficits and cognitive inflexibility in DA-Tsc1-KO mice could be prevented by genetic reduction of mTORC1 signaling. Together, these data provide insight into the potential cellular origins of cognitive inflexibility in TSC, and suggest a locus for possible intervention.</p>
<p id="Par36">Several prior studies have assessed the consequences of deletion of the mTORC1-negative regulator <italic>Pten</italic> on DA neurons. Similar to loss of Tsc1, selective deletion of <italic>Pten</italic> from DA neurons causes somatodendritic hypertrophy, increased TH expression, and elevated total DA tissue content in the absence of changes to gross motor behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. However, distinct from <italic>Pten</italic> deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, we find that loss of Tsc1 is sufficient to dramatically increase DA axon terminal size in the dorsal striatum. Since we observed region-specific effects of Tsc1 loss on DA terminals, the differences may be due to the striatal region sampled for EM in prior studies, or may reflect distinct biological consequences of <italic>Pten</italic> versus <italic>Tsc1</italic> deletion. One notable difference is that <italic>Pten</italic> deletion increases both Akt and mTORC1 signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, whereas deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> activates mTORC1 but suppresses Akt phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par37">Our findings also show some similarities with prior work that deleted the macroautophagy regulator Atg7 from DA neurons. One of the key consequences of increased mTORC1 signaling is autophagy suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Therefore, some of the Tsc1 phenotypes may result from impaired autophagy. Consistent with this, DA neuron-specific <italic>Atg7</italic>-KO mice also display increased soma size and axon terminal area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, suggesting that these phenotypes in DA-Tsc1-KO mice could be due to dysfunctional macroautophagy. That said, DA-Atg7-KO mice have increased striatal DA release and DA turnover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, which were not observed in DA-Tsc1-KO mice. Thus, while autophagy may be one downstream mechanism governing a subset of phenotypes in DA-Tsc1-KO neurons, there are likely additional cellular pathways that contribute to the overall complex phenotype resulting from Tsc1 loss.</p>
<p id="Par38">We found that constitutive activation of mTORC1 signaling profoundly affected DA neuron structure and significantly impaired striatal DA release. This deficit was present in young adult mice and stably persisted in aged animals. We attempted to reverse these alterations with the widely used mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. However, we found unexpectedly that chronic systemic rapamycin treatment did not reduce p-S6 levels in DA neurons in either DA-Tsc1-WT or DA-Tsc1-KO mice. Since this lack of change was specific to DA neurons, with other brain regions showing the expected reduction in p-S6, we hypothesize that this could be due to two possibilities: (1) there is differential brain penetration of rapamycin, with midbrain DA neurons receiving lower effective concentrations and/or (2) there may be cell type-specific responses to systemic metabolic changes induced by rapamycin. For example, it is known that chronic rapamycin induces metabolic side effects, including glucose intolerance, fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia due to actions on the liver and pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Regardless of the mechanism, these findings raise important caveats about the use of systemic rapamycin to treat the spectrum of neuropsychiatric phenotypes in TSC. We speculate that our findings provide a potential explanation for the failure of rapamycin derivatives to improve cognitive deficits in recent clinical trials in TSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par39">Given the challenges of systemic pharmacology, we utilized a genetic approach in which we selectively decreased mTORC1 signaling via deletion of the gene encoding the obligate mTORC1 protein Raptor in DA-Tsc1-KO mice. In addition to being cell type specific, this strategy avoids manipulation of mTORC2 signaling, which is known to occur with prolonged rapamycin treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Interestingly, when we completely suppressed mTORC1 with homozygous deletion of <italic>Rptor</italic>, we found similar deficits in evoked DA release as with <italic>Tsc1</italic> deletion alone. The failure of complete mTORC1 suppression to prevent release deficits is consistent with prior reports showing that acute treatment of striatal slices with rapamycin or Cre virus-mediated deletion of <italic>mTOR</italic> from VTA neurons both decrease evoked DA release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. By contrast, we found that heterozygous loss of <italic>Rptor</italic> in DA-Tsc1-KO mice, while not sufficient to prevent somatic hypertrophy, significantly improved striatal DA release and countered reduced cognitive flexibility. Together, these results indicate that tight regulation of mTORC1 signaling is essential for DA neuron output as too much or too little mTORC1 signaling is similarly detrimental. In addition, our findings show that changes in DA neuron soma size can be decoupled from alterations in axonal DA release.</p>
<p id="Par40">After ruling out several potential mechanisms for the release impairments in DA-Tsc1-KO mice, including DA neuron death, striatal denervation, and reduced DA synthesis, the most plausible explanation was ultrastructural changes in DA neuron axons. Specifically, we found that Tsc1 loss resulted in highly enlarged TH + axon terminals and reduced vesicle density in the striatum. In addition, the vesicles were further removed from the plasma membrane and were less tightly clustered together. Notably, axonal changes in the dorsal striatum, which is primarily innervated by SNc neurons, were much more pronounced than those in the NAc, which receives mainly VTA input. Given the stringent structural requirements for efficient vesicle release, for example, vesicle proximity to docking sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> and vesicle clustering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, it is likely that the observed ultrastructural changes in DA-Tsc1 KO axons led to impaired dorsal striatal DA release with a relative sparing of NAc DA release.</p>
<p id="Par41">Cognitive flexibility is commonly affected in psychiatric disorders, in particular ASD and ADHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. TSC patients frequently present with impairments in executive control processes, which include cognitive flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Here, we found that DA neuron-specific deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> was sufficient to reduce cognitive flexibility in a reversal learning task. This reduction was specific to reversal learning as initial discrimination learning was intact. Notably, during reversal learning, DA-Tsc1-KO mice made more perseverative errors, in which they continued to return to the previously learned odor even though it was no longer rewarded. Perseverative errors reflect an inability to flexibly adapt and update a previously learned association. Such a deficit may contribute to the inflexible behaviors often observed in individuals with TSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par42">Our findings are consistent with prior reports showing that brain-wide heterozygous deletion of <italic>Tsc2</italic> or disruption of the translational regulator eIF4E, which increases protein synthesis, impair reversal but not acquisition learning in water maze tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Our work suggests that these types of impairments may result from dopaminergic dysfunction; an interpretation consistent with the known involvement of DA in cognitive flexibility in rodents and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Our results are also in agreement with studies showing that moderate reductions in dorsal striatal DA levels in rats can impair cognitive flexibility without changing motor behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. While our study demonstrates the sufficiency of dopaminergic impairments to induce cognitive inflexibility, alterations in other brain regions, including the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, may also contribute to this complex phenotype in the context of TSC.</p>

Extracellular DA concentration ([DA]<sub>o</sub>) was monitored with FCV at CFMs using a Millar voltammeter (Julian Millar, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry). CFMs were fabricated in-house from epoxy-free carbon fiber ~7 μm in diameter (Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd) encased in a glass capillary (Harvard Apparatus: GC200F-10) pulled to form a seal with the fiber and cut to a final tip length of 70–120 μm. The CFM was positioned ~100 μm below the tissue surface at a 45° angle. A triangular waveform was applied to the carbon fiber scanning from −0.7 to +1.3 V and back, against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode at a rate of 800 V/s. Evoked DA transients were sampled at 8 Hz, and data were acquired at 50 kHz using AxoScope 10.5 (Molecular Devices).

<p id="Par69">Tissue DA content was measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection in tissue punches from dorsal and ventral striatum. Male and female mice (P60–P75) were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane and decapitated. Coronal slices (300  μm thick) of striatum were prepared on a vibratome (Leica VT1000 S) in ice-cold high Mg<sup>2+</sup> aCSF containing (in mM): 85 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, and 65 sucrose. Slices were recovered for 1 h at RT in aCSF containing (in mM): 130 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 glucose. All solutions were continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Following slice recovery, tissue punches from the dorsal striatum (2.5 mm diameter, aligned to the edge of the corpus callosum on the dorsolateral side) and ventral striatum (1.5 mm diameter, centered on the anterior commissure) from two brain slices per animal were taken and stored at −80 °C in 200 µl of 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub>. Ventral striatum samples hence included both NAc core and shell. On the day of analysis, samples were thawed, homogenized, and centrifuged at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was analyzed for DA, DOPAC, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid content using HPLC with electrochemical detection. Analytes were separated using a 4.6 × 150 mm<sup>2</sup> Microsorb C18 reverse-phase column (Varian or Agilent) and detected using a Decade II SDS electrochemical detector with a Glassy carbon working electrode (Antec Leyden) set at +0.7 V with respect to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The mobile phase consisted of 13% methanol (v/v), 0.12 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM OSA (osanetant), 0.8 mM EDTA, pH 4.8, and the flow rate was fixed at 1 ml/min.

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="Par71">Male and female mice (P60–P90) were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane and decapitated. Bilateral striata, including both dorsal and ventral regions, were rapidly dissected on ice, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. On the day of analysis, frozen samples were sonicated until homogenized (QSonica Q55) in 500 μl lysis buffer containing 1% SDS in 1× PBS with Halt phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Fisher: PI78420) and Complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche: 4693159001). Sample homogenates were then boiled on a heat block at 95 °C for 10 min, allowed to cool down to RT, and total protein content was determined by BCA assay (Fisher: PI23227). Following BCA assay, protein homogenates were mixed with 4× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad: 161-0747). Proteins (10–15  μg) were loaded onto 4–15% Criterion TGX gels (Bio-Rad: 5671084). Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad: 1620177) at 4 °C overnight using the Bio-Rad Criterion Blotter (12 V constant voltage). The membranes were blocked in 5% milk in 1× TBS with 1% Tween (TBS-T) for 1 h at RT, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk in TBS-T overnight at 4 °C. The following day, after 3 × 10 min washes with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. Following 6 × 10 min washes, the membranes were incubated with chemiluminesence substrate (PerkinElmer: NEL105001EA) for 1 min and exposed to GE Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (VWR: 95017-661).

<p id="Par72">Western blot analysis was performed blind to genotype. Bands were quantified by densitometry using the Image J (NIH) software. The striatal-enriched protein DARPP-32 was used to normalize striatal tissue content and histone 3 was used as a loading control. Samples were taken from the whole striatum, including both dorsal and ventral regions. Two striatum samples (i.e. left and right hemispheres) were analyzed per mouse and averaged together. Once normalized to DARPP-32, protein content was expressed as percentage of control within a given experiment.

<title>Sample preparation for EM</title>
<p id="Par73">Male and female mice (P75–P85) were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane, exsanguinated by transcardial perfusion with ice-cold 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4), followed by fixation with 0.1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich: G5882) and 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences: 15713) solution in 0.1 M PB. Perfusions were performed using a peristaltic pump (Instech). The brains were removed and immersed in the fixative solution for an additional 12 h at 4 °C. Brains were then stored in 0.1 M PB with 0.02% (w/v) NaN<sub>3</sub>. Coronal sections (50 µm) containing dorsal striatum and/or NAc core were cut using a vibrating-blade microtome (Leica VT1000 S). Tissue sections for analyses of dorsal striatum were promptly processed for immunolabeling. Tissue sections for analyses of NAc were stored in 1x PBS with NaN<sub>3</sub> at 4 °C for processing at a later date. To start the preparation of tissue for immunolabeling, sections were washed 3 × 5 min in 1× PBS, placed into cryoprotectant (0.05 M PB, 25% sucrose, 10% glycerol) for a minimum of 2 h and then freeze-thawed three times in liquid nitrogen to increase penetration of the reagents. Sections were washed thoroughly and blocked with 10% normal goat serum in 1× PBS (Vector Laboratories: S-1000) for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation in primary rabbit anti-TH antibody (1:1000, Chemicon: #AB152) at RT. Sections were washed 3 × 5 min in 1× PBS and incubated in a gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:400, 1.4 nm Nanogold, Nanoprobes: #2003) for a minimum of 4 h at RT. TH-positive axons were revealed with silver intensification of the conjugated gold particles. Silver reagent (1 ml; Nanoprobes: HQ Silver Kit, prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions) was added to each section and allowed to react for 4.5 min in the dark, washed 3 × 5 min in acetate buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate 3-hydrate, pH 7.0–7.5), and then 1× PBS for 5 min. All sections were then washed 3 × 5 min in 0.1 M PB. The sections were post fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M PB (OsO<sub>4</sub>; TAAB) for 12 min. After washing 2 × 5 min in 0.1 M PB, sections were dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol dilutions: 2 × 10 min in 50% ethanol; 45–60 min in 70% ethanol, which included 1% uranyl acetate (TAAB); 10 min in 95% ethanol; and 2 × 10 min in absolute ethanol. Sections were washed 2 × 10 min in propylene oxide (Sigma-Aldrich), placed into resin (Durcupan ACM; Fluka), and left overnight (~15 h) at RT. The resin was then warmed to reduce its viscosity, and sections were placed on microscope slides, coverslipped, and the resin cured at 65 °C for ~70 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>.

<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p id="Par74">All sections were examined under a light microscope to select those containing striatal areas that were similar to those sampled in FCV recordings. The selected areas of dorsolateral striatum and NAc core were cut from the slide, glued to the top of a resin block, and trimmed with razor blades. For each mouse, dorsal striatal regions from two sections across the rostro-caudal plane were examined; for the NAc, the core region was examined from one section. Serial sections, ~50 nm thick, were cut using an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC6), collected on pioloform-coated, single-slot copper grids (Agar Scientific), and lead stained with Reynold’s lead citrate to improve contrast for electron microscopic examination. For each region (block), ultrathin sections from at least two grids were examined. A Philips CM100 or a Hitachi HT7800 transmission electron microscope was used to examine the ultrathin sections of dorsal striatum or NAc, respectively. Analyses of pre-embedded immunogold sections were performed at a minimum of 5 µm from the tissue–resin border (i.e., section surface). The maximum distance from the tissue–resin border examined was determined by the penetration of the gold-conjugated antibody together with the angle at which the tissue–resin was sectioned, and was therefore variable. TH-positive structures were systematically analyzed in one of the serial sections on an electron microscopic grid. At a magnification at which it is not possible to clearly visualize synapses, an area was chosen at random, the magnification was then increased and the first structure positively labeled for TH was digitally recorded (with either a GatanCCD UltraScan US1000 camera [Gatan] fitted to the Philips CM100, or with a XAROSA CMOS camera [Emsis] fitted to the Hitachi HT7800). TH-positive structures were identified and imaged, in this way, continuing systematically in straight lines across the section, keeping the identified TH-positive structure central within the image frame. For immunogold-labeled structures, the criterion for an immunopositive structure was five or more silver-intensified immunogold particles. For dorsolateral striatum, this was repeated for the second block until a minimum of 60 TH-immunopositive structures were identified and imaged per animal (491 dopaminergic profiles in total, <italic>n</italic> = 4 mice per genotype). For the NAc core, 30 profiles were imaged per block (240 profiles in total, <italic>n</italic> = 4 mice per genotype). Symmetric synapses (Gray’s type II) were identified by the presence of presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane specializations, a widened synaptic cleft and cleft material. Any TH-positive structures seen to be forming such symmetric synapses were imaged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Electron micrographs were acquired using the Digital Micrograph (GATAN, release version 3) software for dorsal striatum and the Radius (EMSIS, release version 2) software for NAc core.</p>
<p id="Par75">EM analysis was performed blind to genotype. Digital images were analyzed using Image J (NIH) and the Image J plug-ins PointDensity and PointDensitySyn (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://liu.se/medfak/forskning/larsson-max/software?l=en">https://liu.se/medfak/forskning/larsson-max/software?l=en</ext-link>; ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>). Images were adjusted for contrast and brightness using Photoshop (version CS5; Adobe Systems). For analysis of TH-positive structures, the central TH-positive structure within the image frame was analyzed by tracing the perimeter. Other TH-positive structures completely within the electron micrograph frame were also analyzed. Analysis of immunogold-labeled TH-positive structures was performed using PointDensity; after the perimeter of the central structure within the frame was delineated, a point marker was placed within the center of each vesicle. Vesicles were marked if at least 50% of the vesicle membrane was visible. If a structure was observed to form a synaptic specialization, it was reanalyzed separately, and the length of the active zone(s) was delineated and measured. The active zone was defined as the length of plasma membrane directly opposing the postsynaptic density, across the synaptic cleft. TH-positive profiles that were forming synapses were analyzed separately using PointDensitySyn; the plasma membrane of the structure was traced, the active zone(s) were delineated, and points were placed in the center of the vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Cumulative distributions for EM data were analyzed using Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. Inter-vesicle distance data binned at 50 nm intervals for dorsal striatum or 70 nm for NAc was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons tests.</p>
<p id="Par76">To confirm that the increased sampling of dorsal striatum profiles compared to NAc profiles did not affect the statistical conclusions, we down-sampled the dorsal striatum data to match the NAc data by randomly taking 30 profiles per mouse, for a total of 120 profiles per genotype.

<title>Behavior testing</title>
<p id="Par77">Behavior testing was carried out in the dark phase of the light cycle under red lights, except the rotarod and four-choice reversal tests, which were carried out in the dark phase under white lights. Mice were habituated to the behavior room for at least 30 min prior to testing and covered by a black-out curtain. Mice were given at least one day in between different tests. All behavior equipment was cleaned between each trial/mouse with 70% ethanol, and additionally rinsed in diluted soap followed by water at the end of the day. If male and female mice were to be tested on the same day, male mice were tested first, returned to the husbandry room, after which all equipment was thoroughly cleaned, and female mice were brought in for habituation. Behavioral tests were performed with P60–80 male and female mice, except for the four-choice test for which P70–130 male animals were used.</p>

<title>Four-choice odor-based reversal task</title>
<p id="Par79">The four-choice odor-based reversal task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> was used to assess learning and cognitive flexibility in adult male mice. Animals were food restricted for 5–6 days in total with unrestricted access to drinking water, and maintained at 85–90% of ad lib feeding body weight. Food was given at the end of the day once testing was completed. Food restriction began 24 h before pre-training.</p>
<p id="Par80">The four-choice test was performed in a custom-made square box (30.5 cm L × 30.5 cm W × 23 cm H) constructed of clear acrylic. Four internal walls 7.6 cm wide partially divided the arena into four quadrants. A 15.2 cm diameter removable cylinder fit in the center of the maze and was lowered between trials (after a digging response) to isolate the mouse from the rest of the maze. Odor stimuli were presented in white ceramic pots measuring 7.3 cm diameter and 4.5 cm deep. Pots were sham baited with a cereal reward, either a Honey Nut Cheerio (General Mills, Minneapolis, MN) or Fruit Loop cereal (Kellogg’s, Battle Creek, MI) secured underneath a mesh screen at the bottom. The apparatus was cleaned with 2.5% acetic acid followed by water between mice. Pots were cleaned with 70% ethanol followed by water. The apparatus was cleaned with diluted soap and water at the end of each testing day.</p>
<p id="Par81">On the first habituation day of pre-training (day 1), animals were allowed to freely explore the testing arena for 30 min and consume small pieces of Cheerios placed inside empty pots positioned in each of the four corners. On the second shaping day of pre-training (day 2), mice learned to dig to find cereal pieces buried in unscented coarse pine wood shavings (Harts Mountain Corporation, Secaucus, NJ). On the shaping day, animals that failed to consume Cheerio pieces were switched to Fruit Loops, which they consumed successfully. A single pot was used and increasing amounts of unscented wood shavings were used to cover each subsequent cereal reward. The quadrant containing the pot was alternated on each trial and all quadrants were rewarded equally. Trials were untimed and consisted of (in order): two trials with no shavings, two trials with a dusting of shavings, two trials with the pot a quarter full, two trials with the pot half full, and four trials with the cereal piece completely buried by shavings. The mouse was manually returned to the center cylinder between trials.</p>
<p id="Par82">On the days for odor discrimination (day 3, aquisition) and reversal (day 4), wood shavings were freshly scented on the day of testing (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). Anise extract (McCormick, Hunt Valley, MD) was used undiluted at 0.02 ml/g of shavings. Clove, litsea, and eucalyptus oils (San Francisco Massage Supply Co., San Francisco, CA) were diluted 1:10 in mineral oil and mixed at 0.02 ml/g of shavings. Thymol (thyme; Alfa Aesar) was diluted 1:20 in 50% ethanol and mixed at 0.01 ml/g of shavings. During the discrimination phase (day 3), mice had to discriminate between four pots with four different odors and learn which one contained a buried food reward (footnote a indicates the rewarded odor in the table below). Each trial began with the mouse confined to the start cylinder, once the cylinder was lifted, timing began and the mouse could freely explore the arena until it chose to dig in a pot. Digging was defined as purposefully moving the shavings with both front paws. A trial was terminated if no choice was made within 3 min and recorded as omission. Criterion was met when the animal completed eight out of ten consecutive trials correctly.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Odors used during acquisition and reversal learning in the four-choice test.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Odor 1</th><th>Odor 2</th><th>Odor 3</th><th>Odor 4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Acquisition</td><td><sup>a</sup>Anise</td><td>Clove</td><td>Litsea</td><td>Thyme</td></tr><tr><td>Reversal</td><td>Anise</td><td><sup>a</sup>Clove</td><td>Litsea</td><td>Eucalyptus</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>The odor rewarded on each testing day</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
<p id="Par83">The reversal phase of the task was completed the following day after overnight consolidation (day 4). Mice first performed the task with the same rewarded odor as the discrimination day to ensure they learned and remembered the task. After reaching criterion on recall (eight out of ten consecutive trials correct), the rewarded odor was switched and mice undergo a reversal learning phase in which a previously unrewarded odor is rewarded. Perseverative errors were choices to dig in the previously rewarded odor that was no longer rewarded. Regressive errors were choosing the previously rewarded odor after the first correct choice of the newly rewarded odor. Novel errors were choices to dig in the pot with the newly introduced odor for reversal testing. Irrelevant errors were choices to dig in the pot that had never been rewarded. Omissions were trials in which the mouse failed to make a digging choice within 3 min from the start of the trial. Total errors are the sum of perseverative, regressive, irrelevant, novel, and omission errors. Criterion was met when the mouse completed eight out of ten consecutive trials correctly. The spatial location of the odors was shuffled on each trial.</p>

For group-housed animals, observations were made for one mouse at a time, with cage mates removed to a temporary cage and 30 min of additional habituation to the home cage once alone. Locomotor behavior was recorded using an overhead camera and analyzed using the ANY-maze (Stoelting Co.) behavior tracking software. Stereotypy behaviors were recorded using an HD video camera positioned level with the cage and at 45° angle to the cage floor, and scored manually during 1-min intervals every 6 min for the total of 10 min of observation. An observer blind to genotype scored video recordings for the number of instances a behavior of interest occurred. We examined grooming (full grooming sequence, from face to hind side), facial only grooming (whisker, ear and face grooming), taffy pulling (repetitive hand to mouth movements), twirling (tight turns, complete circle), circling (follows vaguely circular path, loose turns), route tracing (walks back and forth along the same path), repetitive jumping, repetitive sniffing, rearing (standing up on hind paws, without side of the cage support), gnawing (chewing on things without the purpose of eating them), yawning, swaying (whole body movements from side to side), and sleeping.</p>

<title>Accelerating rotarod test</title>
<p id="Par87">The accelerating rotarod test was used to examine motor coordination, balance, and motor learning. Mice were run on a rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile: 47650) for 4 consecutive days. Three trials were completed per day with a 5 min break between trials. The rotarod was accelerated from 5 to 40 revolutions per minute (r.p.m.) over 300 s for trials 1–6 (days 1 and 2), and from 10 to 80 r.p.m. over 300 s for trials 7–12 (days 3 and 4). On the first testing day, mice were acclimated to the apparatus by being placed on the rotarod rotating at a constant 5 r.p.m. for 60 s and returned to their home cage for 5 min prior to starting trial 1. Latency to fall, or to rotate off the top of the rotarod barrel, was measured by the rotarod stop–trigger timer. Motor coordination was defined as the <italic>y</italic> intercept of the line of best fit from the first to last trial, and motor learning was measured as the slope of performance from the first to last trial for each mouse.</p>

The testing apparatus was made of clear Plexiglas (60 cm L × 40 cm W × 22 cm H, Stoelting Co.). Two dividing walls had doorways allowing access to three chambers. Age- and sex-matched C57BL/6J mice were used as novel mice and were habituated to placement inside the wire cups (8 cm diameter, 11 cm tall) prior to testing in either three 10-min or two 15-min sessions. C57BL/6J mice that displayed persistent agitation, including climbing or biting behavior inside the wire cups, were not used for testing.</p>
<p id="Par89">The test mouse was placed in the center chamber of the apparatus and allowed to explore and habituate to all three empty chambers for 10 min. The mouse was then placed in the center chamber again for 5 min with access doors closed. During this time, a novel C57BL/6J mouse was placed under a wire cup in one of the side chambers and an empty wire cup was placed on the opposite side (novel object). The chamber doors separating the three chambers were then removed to open access to both left and right chambers. The mouse was allowed to explore the three chambers for 10 min, and allowed to interact with the novel object or with the stranger mouse inside the wire cup. The location of the stranger mouse and the novel object were alternated between mice. Behavior was recorded using a video camera positioned directly above the center of the apparatus and analyzed using the ANY-maze (Stoelting Co.) behavior tracking software. An observer blind to genotype manually scored time spent sniffing the novel mouse and the novel object during the test. Sniffing was defined as when the mouse’s nose was perpendicular to the vertical plane and &lt;1 cm away from the wire cup. If the mouse reared on the wire cup, climbed on the wire cup, or bit the wire cup, it was not scored as sniffing. Mice showing a strong side bias during the habituation phase of the test were excluded.
