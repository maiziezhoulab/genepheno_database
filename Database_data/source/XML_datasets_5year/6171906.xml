<abstract>
<p>Sodium-glucose transporters (SGLT) belong to the solute carrier 5 family, which is characterized by sodium dependent transport of sugars and other solutes. In contrast, the human SGLT3 (hSGLT3) isoform, encoded by <italic>SLC5A4</italic>, acts as a glucose sensor that does not transport sugar but induces membrane depolarization by Na<sup>+</sup> currents upon ligand binding. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of several extended pedigrees with high density of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) identified a triplet ATG deletion in <italic>SLC5A4</italic> leading to a single amino acid loss (ΔM500) in the hSGLT3 protein imperfectly co-segregating with the clinical phenotype of ADHD. Since mutations in homologous domains of hSGLT1 and hSGLT2 were found to affect intestinal and renal function, respectively, we analyzed the functional properties of hSGLT3[wt] and [ΔM500] by voltage clamp and current clamp recordings from cRNA-injected <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes.</p>
<p>The cation conductance of hSGLT3[wt] was activated by application of glucose or the specific agonist 1-desoxynojirimycin (DNJ) as revealed by inward currents in the voltage clamp configuration and cell depolarization in the current clamp mode. Almost no currents and changes in membrane potential were observed when glucose or DNJ were applied to hSGLT3[ΔM500]-injected oocytes, demonstrating a loss of function by this amino acid deletion in hSGLT3. To monitor membrane targeting of wt and mutant hSGLT3, fusion constructs with YFP were generated, heterologously expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes and analyzed for membrane fluorescence by confocal microscopy. In comparison to hSGLT3[wt] the fluorescent signal of mutant [ΔM500] was reduced by 43% indicating that the mutant phenotype might mainly result from inaccurate membrane targeting. As revealed by homology modeling, residue M500 is located in TM11 suggesting that in addition to the core structure (TM1-TM10) of the transporter, the surrounding TMs are equally crucial for transport/sensor function.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that the deletion [ΔM500] in hSGLT3 inhibits membrane targeting and thus largely disrupts glucose-induced sodium conductance, which may, in interaction with other ADHD risk-related gene variants, influence the risk for ADHD in deletion carriers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Membrane transport of glucose in mammalian cells is mediated either by members of the SLC2 or the SLC5 transporter family. Glucose transporters [GLUTs] of the SLC2 family facilitate diffusion of D-glucose across the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref001">1</xref>]. In contrast, members of the SLC5 family (sodium-glucose transporters or symporters; SGLTs) mediate co-transport of D-glucose in expense of the electrochemical sodium gradient across the plasma membrane. The secondary active transport by SGLTs allows the accumulation of D-glucose in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref002">2</xref>]. Genes of SGLTs code for membrane proteins that consist of 14 transmembrane segments with both amino- and carboxy-terminus located on the extracellular side as revealed by site-directed mutagenesis and crystal structure analysis (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref003">3</xref>]). Studies with human SGLT1 (hSGLT1) and the model homologue from <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> (vSGLT) have shown that fully functional transporters are formed by monomeric proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref005">5</xref>]. X-ray analysis of crystals from vSGLT discovered a core structure of inverted repeat topology of TM1-TM5 and TM6-TM10 with no amino acid homology but structural domains that can be superimposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref006">6</xref>]. The core structure is flanked by a single transmembrane segment on the amino terminal side and three of them at the carboxy terminus, named -TM1 and TM11-13, respectively (according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref007">7</xref>]). Within this core structure (TM1–TM10) specific amino acids were identified that are essential either for substrate or sodium binding. Moreover, mechanisms for the transfer of ions and substrate molecules from the extracellular to the intracellular side are attributed to this core element of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref006">6</xref>]. In contrast, the function and relevance of the additional TM segments (-TM1 and TM11-13) on the N- and C-termini are poorly understood. Evidence for the importance of several specific amino acids in hSGLTs was deduced from intestinal and renal diseases caused by mutations in these transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>In the intestinal tract the high affinity transporter hSGLT1 is responsible for the uptake of glucose and galactose across the apical membrane into intestinal cells. Mutations in the hSGLT1 lead to glucose- galactose malabsorption (GGM, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref011">11</xref>]). The majority of mutations are missense, distributed throughout the protein and most commonly causes reduced Na<sup>+</sup>/glucose transport activity by reduced glucose affinity or improper membrane targeting of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref008">8</xref>]. Human SGLT2 is expressed in the kidney and retrieves most of the glucose from the proximal tubule by coupling one sodium to the transport of one glucose molecule. In the distal part of the proximal tubule more potent reabsorption of glucose is coupled to two sodium ions by hSGLT1. Familial renal glucosuria (FRG) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder where glucose is excreted in the urine, when blood glucose level is normal. Missense, deletion and nonsense mutations in the coding region of hSGLT2 were identified in patients with FRG of different severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref010">10</xref>]. Attempts to link specific mutations to the severity of glucosuria failed due to ineffective expression of hSGLT2 in heterologous systems. Instead hSGLT3 [<italic>SLC5A4</italic>), was efficiently inserted into the plasma membrane when heterologously expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, but it was unable to transport glucose. However, under these conditions glucose caused a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent depolarization of the cell, which was reversed by the SGLT-specific antagonist phlorizin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref012">12</xref>]. Thus, based on its electrophysiological properties hSGLT3 is accepted to be a glucose sensor and not Na<sup>+</sup>/glucose transporter. High expression of hSGLT3 was found in small intestine and skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref013">13</xref>] whereas in other tissues including brain, hSGLT3 appears to be expressed at a lower level (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref015">15</xref>]).</p>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by increased motor activity, a persistent pattern of inattention and impulsivity that interferes with academic functioning, increased risk of drug abuse and negative consequences for family and peer relations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref016">16</xref>].

Recently, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms and duplication of SLC2A3 encoding the neuronal glucose transporter-3 (GLUT3) were found to be associated with ADHD. Upon testing, patients display deficits in working memory and cognitive response control, suggesting altered genes of the glucose metabolism as chancy for the development of ADHD.

WES data of two diseased individuals and subsequent genotyping of family members disclose a triple nucleotide deletion in <italic>SLC5A4</italic> on chromosome 22q12.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). As revealed by conventional and quantitative RT-PCR, transcripts of <italic>SLC5A4</italic> were found in various human brain regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205109.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This gene encoding the sodium-glucose transporter SGLT3 consists of 15 coding exons and within the 13<sup>th</sup> exon nucleotides 1498–1500 were deleted (c.1498-1500delATG), which results in the extinction of a methionine at position 500 in transmembrane segment 11 (TM11) of the protein (p.[ΔM500]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). When we analyzed the entire family for this mutation by Sanger sequencing, only imperfect segregation of the methionine deletion with the categorical ADHD diagnosis was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Whereas five patients display the mutation in the <italic>SLC5A4</italic> gene another three individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) do not show a match between geno- and phenotype.</p>
<p>Just as much, the structural and functional aspects of this mutation are important in order to evaluate the negative effect this mutation might have on a human carrier. In SGLT3 methionine at position 500 [ΔM500] is located in TM11 which was shown to be critical for proper function of SGLT1 and SGLT2. Mutations in TM11 of the two structurally related sodium-glucose transporters disrupt sugar translocation and cause intestinal and renal diseases, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref033">33</xref>].

Substantial Na<sup>+</sup> currents were recorded (V<sub>H</sub> = -50 mV) upon perfusion of oocytes with 10 μM DNJ (1-desoxynojirimycin), an imino sugar that specifically activates hSGLT3 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref034">34</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) but did not evoke a current response in control oocytes.

<title>Inactivation of hSGLT3 and hSGLT1 by WES-derived mutation</title>
<p>As methionine 500 in hSGLT3 was found to be deleted in a family densely affected with ADHD, the question arose if the mutated transporter is still functional. Moreover, experiments with this mutation in TM11 outside the core structure (TM1–TM10) of sodium transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref007">7</xref>] are adequate to verify the importance of such adjacent domains for fundamental function of transporters.</p>

Continuous recordings under voltage clamp conditions (V<sub>H</sub> = -50mV) revealed robust activation of Na<sup>+</sup> currents by successive application of glucose (75 mM) and DNJ (10μM) with a 3-fold higher efficacy of the synthetic agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g003">Fig 3A and 3D</xref>; n = 6 ± SD of two independent experiments; p = 0.001).

Current clamp recordings of the same oocyte reveal D-glucose- and DNJ-induced depolarization as well as phlorizin-induced hyperpolarization of the cell.

<p>Although TM11 of SGLT3 is not located within the functional core structure, a deletion of an amino acid at the boundary of the lipid bilayer to the extracellular side may have dramatic functional effects. We generated the hSGLT3[ΔM500] mutant by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzed its electrophysiological properties with the same protocol we executed on hSGLT3[wt] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g003">Fig 3A, 3B and 3D</xref>). In contrast to the wildtype, negligible responses were observed with hSGLT3[ΔM500] when recorded in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes under current clamp and voltage clamp conditions with both agonists (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g003">3A</xref>, middle panel and 3B and D).</p>
<p>Our WES study revealed patients of ADHD with heterozygous genotypes. To better understand the observed phenotype and to elucidate whether the phenotype is due to haploinsufficiency or the mutation has a dominant negative effect over the expression of SGLT3, we either expressed hSGLT3[wt] alone or co-expressed hSGLT3[wt] and hSGLT3[ΔM500]. Oocytes injected with cRNA of both, hSGLT3[wt] and hSGLT3[ΔM500] evoked the same glucose-induced current amplitude as oocytes injected with equal amount of wt cRNA only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205109.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Thus, the mutant carrier/sensor has no dominant negative effect. In other words, under heterozygous conditions, hSGLT3 derived from the healthy allele is not affected by hSGLT3 synthesized from the mutated allele.</p>
<p>To explore if this loss of function is a matter of structural disturbance or a missing function by the amino acid itself, we engineered another mutant with a deletion of the adjacent residue at position 501, hSGLT3[ΔI501]. But again, when recorded in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes this second mutant failed to evoke substantial currents or voltage changes upon application of glucose or DNJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, lower panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g003">Fig 3D</xref> for quantification).</p>
<p>Previously, in the glucose transporter hSGLT1 a substitution of arginine 499 by histidine in TM11 was found to reduce glucose-induced currents and transport of carbohydrates by more than 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref008">8</xref>]. Apparently in hSGLT1 the amino acid exchange is partially tolerated and thus we wondered if deletions that heavily eliminate hSGLT3 function, have less severe effects on the hSGLT1 isoform.</p>
<p>To monitor sodium currents of hSGLT1, oocytes were injected with transcripts of hSGLT1[wt], hSGLT1[ΔM500] and hSGLT1[ΔI501], respectively. Upon two-electrode voltage clamp recordings (V<sub>H</sub> = -50 mV) glucose–induced sodium currents with an amplitude of 161 ± 15.27 nA (n = 6 ± SD of two independent experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) were observed from wt-injected cells. However, no currents were recorded from cells expressing the mutants hSGLT1[ΔM500] and hSGLT1[ΔI501] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, regardless of different functional properties, both the glucose transporter hSGLT1 and the glucose sensor hSGLT3 entirely lose their activity upon deletion of amino acids being located in TM11 close to the extracellular space.</p>

<title>Membrane targeting of hSGLT3[ΔM500] is impaired</title>
<p>The absence of any electrophysiological recordings in cell systems may have two main reasons. On the one hand the protein is not synthesized or alternatively it is not translocated to the membrane (and therefore does not conduct charged particles). In both cases no currents would be observed. To investigate if protein processing is responsible for the absence of currents in oocytes injected with transcripts of hSGLT mutants we conducted Western immunoblots and fluorescence imaging with <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes.</p>
<p>When subjected to Western immunoblot, crude membrane fractions of oocytes injected with identical amounts of cRNA of wildtype and mutated transporters display specific signals that are absent in H<sub>2</sub>O-injected controls. For hSGLT3 and hSGLT1 the expected molecular weights are 72.4 kDa and 73.4 kDa, respectively. However, the majority of specific signals were found in the range of 58 kDa, which most probably results from proteolytic degradation during preparation of membranes. Simultaneous analysis and comparison of hSGLT1/3[wt] with their corresponding mutants document nearly identical amounts of protein in both preparations.

<p>Thus, production of SGLT proteins is not affected by the deletion of amino acids and in addition mutated transporters were still located in entire membrane fractions as almost no signals were found in cytosolic fractions of preparations (data not shown). However, the question remains if the mutated transporters were properly targeted to the plasma membrane. To monitor this capability, we generated SGLT:YFP fusion constructs and heterologously expressed them in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes. Prior to fluorescence imaging we tested the functional properties of fusion constructs by two electrode-voltage recordings and did not find any difference to “native” SGLTs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205109.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Upon confocal laser scanning microscopy both, hSGLT1[wt] and hSGLT3[wt] fusion constructs were detected at the equator of oocytes with similar fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In comparison to the wildtype, membrane fluorescences of the mutants hSGLT3[ΔM500] and hSGLT3[ΔI501] were reduced by 53% (n = 6 ± SD of two independent experiments; p &lt;0.01) and 42% (n = 6 ± SD of two independent experiments; p &lt; 0.01), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

These results indicate that deletions of single amino acid residues in TM11 of both hSGLTs markedly influence the trafficking of the proteins to the plasma membrane. Although the fluorescence intensity at the oocyte’s periphery of the hSGLT3 mutants was reduced by around 50% only, sodium currents or membrane depolarization were reduced by more than 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g003">Fig 3A, 3B and 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Disruptive rare variant of SLC5A4 may be involved in genetic risk for ADHD</title>
<p>ADHD has a high genetic risk component, and according to large twin and family studies heritability has consistently calculated to be approximately 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref037">37</xref>]. Genome-wide screening approaches and candidate gene studies have attempted to identify ADHD-associated risk genes, but so far no single variant has passed the significance threshold of replicable gene-disorder association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref040">40</xref>]. The SNP heritability of ADHD has been estimated at 0.28 indicating that common SNPs contribute substantially to ADHD susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref041">41</xref>], although each locus exerts only a very small effect (OR&lt;1.1). The contrast to the overall heritability of ADHD suggest that the genetic component of ADHD cannot be explained only by common genetic variants. Thus, presumably also rare variants contribute to the ADHD risk and account for the missing part of heritability. Previously, one exome sequencing study identified rare variant that might predispose to ADHD, although causality was not proven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Upon network analysis ADHD-associated genes were found to be enriched within specific functional categories. Based on protein-protein interaction a network was constructed showing that genes involved in biological processes such as synaptic transmission, catecholamine metabolism, G-protein signaling pathways and cell migration were over-represented in ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref044">44</xref>]. Although a putative category like energy homeostasis is not emphasized by this network analysis, there are conclusive concepts that explain characteristic symptoms of ADHD such as inattention or deficits in working memory function by energetic insufficiency in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref045">45</xref>]. Recently, common and rare variants of the glucose-transporter-3 gene (SLC2A3) were found to associate with ADHD and upon testing patients displayed deficits in cognitive processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref018">18</xref>]. In line with this notion hSGLT3 as a glucose sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref012">12</xref>] localized in various regions of the human brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205109.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) is an appropriate candidate for the concept of deficient energy balance in ADHD neuropathology.</p>
<p>In our WES approach in ADHD families we identified a triplet deletion in <italic>SLC5A4</italic>, suggesting profound functional deficits of hSGLT3. However, the co-segregation of the <italic>SLC5A4</italic> variant was imperfect. Two family members, one female individual (ID6) and her son (ID15) carry c.1498-1500delATG but are not affected by ADHD. This may indicate incomplete penetrance of the variant, which is commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref046">46</xref>]. One ADHD patient (ID19) in this family, who has been diagnosed with childhood ADHD, is not a carrier of c.1498-1500delATG. Behavioural dysfunction with similarities to ADHD but a different neurodevelopmental pathway resulting in a phenocopy are encountered frequently in core families with several sibling and one or both parent(s) affected with ADHD. Here, a severely affected mother with two more children suffering from ADHD likely associated with early pathogenic care, characterized e.g. by early separation, frequent change in caregivers, institutionalisation or neglect, may lead to severe global psychosocial and cognitive dysfunction and deviant developmental trajectories of brain maturation in terms of a reactive attachment disorder (RAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref047">47</xref>]. Despite the apparent dominant segregation pattern, ADHD is not a monogenic disorder in the pedigree investigated. WES revealed other rare SNVs in this family, suggesting that several genes may carry risk variants for ADHD in each of those. Based on the WES data, we did not expect a single gene to be associated with the clinical phenotype nor perfect co-segregation pattern of the rare, non-reference allele with ADHD in subsequent segregation analyses. A main contributing factor to the observed patterns may be incomplete penetrance and phenocopies, which is common in ADHD. Although we were quite liberal in selecting a rare variant for further analysis (through including suggestive linkage signals), the observed pattern is similar to findings in WES studies of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref020">20</xref>] and other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorders, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref048">48</xref>]).</p>

<title>hSGLT3 TM11 is critical for trafficking and thus functionality</title>
<p>Here we characterized the basic features of SGLT3 in the heterologous expression system of Xenopus <italic>laevis</italic> oocytes. We confirmed that SGLT3 mediates sodium specific currents in the presence of glucose and DNJ that were abolished following phlorizin treatment. These results are well in line with findings of Diez-Sampedro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref012">12</xref>] and Voss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>X-ray analysis of crystals from vSGLT revealed a core structure of 10 transmembrane helices (TM1-TM10) that could be associated with substrate and sodium binding and thus TMs 1 to 10 are particularly important for the transport activity of SGLTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g005">Fig 5</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref050">50</xref>]). This core structure is flanked by a single transmembrane segment on the amino terminal side and three TMs at the carboxy terminus, named -TM1 and TM11-13, respectively (according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref051">51</xref>]). Several amino acids were shown to be important for proper function of SGLTs as mutation caused intestinal and renal disease. Martin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref008">8</xref>] identified 31 mutations of SGLT1 in 25 families suffering from glucose-galactose malabsorption (GGM). Among the mutations in SGLT1, the mutation R499H was found in TM11. Heterologous expression combined with sophisticated electrophysiological analysis revealed that the mutation R499H decreased the current densities and lowered the substrate affinity from 0.3 mM in the WT to 2.4 mM in the mutant of hSGLT1. Moreover, via measuring charge movements and thereby determining Q<sub>max</sub> of hSGLT1[wt] in comparison to the mutant R499H, the authors could demonstrate that the mutation impairs the trafficking of the transporter to the plasma membrane. This finding is well in line with our results gained by fluorescence intensity measurements of YFP-fused hSGLTs and mutants thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Both deletions, M500 and I501, in hSGLT1 and 3 markedly decreased the fluorescence within the plasma membrane while the amount of expression probed with Western blots remained similar between WTs and mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This indicates that the deletion mutants of hSGLT3 and particularly of hSGLT1 are impaired in plasma membrane trafficking in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes. In contrast to the mutant hSGLT1[R499H] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref008">8</xref>], that was still able to transport glucose albeit with lower current amplitudes, the deletion mutants M500 and I501 in hSGLT1 and 3 did not respond to the application of substrates at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This may indicate that in contrast to the exchange of R499 by a histidine residue, the deletion of adjacent residues M500 and I501 in TM11 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g005">Fig 5</xref> for illustration) severely influence the trafficking and maybe also the function of SGLT proteins. However, given the resolution of light microcopy, the thickness of the plasma membrane in combination with the non-transparent oocytes’ cytosol, insertion of the YFP-tagged SGLT3 (and SGLT1) proteins into the plasma membrane cannot be proven by this technique. Thus, conclusions about the functionality of the SGLT1 and 3 deletion mutants remain speculative.</p>
<p>Although the insertion of hSGLT3 deletion mutants into the oocytes membrane could not be directly proven by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g004">Fig 4</xref>), previous studies of hSGLT1 indicate that TM11 severely impact on the function of the transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref052">52</xref>]. According to our model, M500 is in proximity to residue E457 (yellow sphere on TM10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g005">Fig 5</xref>) that is conserved as a glutamate in SGLT3s and as a glutamine in SGLT1s. Mutation of glutamine 457 in hSGLT1 to a glutamate (as found in SGLT3s) changes the transporter from a sodium/sugar transporter to a sugar-sensor like hSGLT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref054">54</xref>]. Therefore, a deletion at position M500 or I501 might also influence the critical residue E/Q457 and thus point to an impaired functionality of the deletion mutants in addition to their impaired membrane targeting.</p>
<p>Adjacent to M500 are the two hSGLT1/3 conserved residues hSGLT3-R499 and hSGLT3-E503 that were mutated and analyzed for their involvement in substrate binding, transport activity and the hSGLT1 transport mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref052">52</xref>]. hSGLT3-R499 is located on TM11 and facing TM12 towards hSGLT3-H525 (not highlighted in the model). Interestingly, mutation of hSGLT1-R499 to hSGLT1-C499 did not change hSGLT1s apparent affinity for glucose but drastically increased it for 6-deoxy-D-glucopyranose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref052">52</xref>]. Furthermore, the transport activity of hSGLT1-C499 was only 19±1% of WT. Based on the position in the homology model and chemical nature of R499, it is likely to be an indirect effect on the structural integrity rather than a direct sugar binding effect. In the hSGLT3 homology model, E503 (violet, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205109.g005">Fig 5</xref>) is positioned in the loop region between TM11 and TM12, in parts of the homology model that is not covered by the vSGLT1 template (2xq2). Mutation of hSGLT1-E503 to hSGLT1-C503 do not have an effect on hSGLT1 substrate specificity or transport mechanism but decreases the uptake activity to 12 ± 3% relative to wt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0205109.ref052">52</xref>]. More drastically, the hSGLT3-M500 and hSGLT3-I501 deletion mutants described in the current study lose all sugar induced Na<sup>+</sup> conductance. It is likely that the deletion of M500 and M501 compromise the helical structure of TM11 and/or its interaction with TM10 and TM12 that are in close proximity. How the deletion of either M500 or I501 influences the overall structural integrity of hSGLT3 and how this may impair the translocation of the protein to the plasma membrane awaits further study. However, the previous study of hSGLT1 and the current study of hSGLT3 highlight that the non-core TM helices and especially the residues M500 and I501 are crucial for proper targeting/functioning of hSGLT3. Whether and how transport processes via hSGLT3 are impaired in the patients, carrying the ΔM500 mutation, remains to be clarified.</p>
