<p id="P16">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is thought to emerge during early cortical development. However, the exact developmental stages and associated molecular networks that prime disease propensity are elusive. To profile early neurodevelopmental alterations in ASD with macrocephaly, we monitored patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) throughout the recapitulation of cortical development. Our analysis revealed ASD-associated changes in the maturational sequence of early neuron development, involving temporal dysregulation of specific gene networks and morphological growth acceleration. The observed changes tracked back to a pathologically primed stage in neural stem cells (NSCs), reflected by altered chromatin accessibility. Concerted overrepresentation of network factors in control NSCs was sufficient to trigger ASD-like features, and circumventing the NSC stage by direct conversion of ASD iPSCs into induced neurons (iPSC-iNs) abolished ASD-associated phenotypes. Our findings identify heterochronic dynamics of a gene network that, while established earlier in development, contributes to subsequent neurodevelopmental aberrations in ASD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P17">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental condition defined by deficits in social interaction and communication accompanied by restrictive, repetitive behaviors. Considerable genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity has complicated the efforts to find common biological substrates of the syndrome. Meanwhile, recent advances in systems biology approaches have caused a paradigm shift in the field of biomedical sciences from a single gene causation model to pathway perturbation models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Implementing high confidence risk variants discovered in ASD cohorts into a data-driven framework of gene network analysis revealed a convergence on molecular processes that implicate specific perturbations during human fetal cortical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. One complication is that many of the identified genes are involved at multiple time points and in different neural cell types, such as neural stem cells (NSCs), as well as in maturing neurons during human cortical development. Thus, a major challenge in the field is to determine the critical developmental periods, their associated cellular states and the molecular networks that might provide a basis for the emergence of common pathological phenotypes during ASD development.</p>
<p id="P18">Here we have performed a time series analysis to follow human idiopathic ASD patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) during their early neuronal development to examine when and how the earliest ASD-specific molecular abnormalities and phenotypes arise. Time series transcriptome and cellular phenotype analyses in ASD NSCs and their progeny identified dysregulation of specific transcriptional networks that caused aberrant neuronal maturation of ASD cortical neurons. Temporal reconstruction and network-based screening revealed that coherent neurodevelopmental gene modules were accelerated in ASD and appeared to be enriched with several ASD risk genes. Surprisingly, we found that dysregulation of these modules arose even before the neuronal stage, as module-specific signatures were already present during the NSC stage. Genome-wide comparisons of chromatin accessibility revealed a prevalent pathologically primed state in ASD NSCs that precedes the occurrence of aberrant gene network dynamics at the consecutive neuronal stage. Concerted transgenic expression of subsets of module genes was used to mimic ASD-associated gene network-related changes in healthy controls and was sufficient to recapitulate the occurrence of aberrant neurodevelopmental growth trajectories at the subsequent neuronal stage. We further demonstrated that skipping the NSC stage by direct iPSC-to-neuron conversion (iPSC-iN) also circumvented the critical period for the ASD signature to establish itself, thereby preventing neuronal ASD phenotypes from manifesting. Our study provides a thorough temporal analysis of the neurodevelopmental regulatory gene networks that become impaired in ASD and shows that some of these changes are triggered during early developmental periods.</p>

<title>Time series-based transcriptome analysis</title>
<p id="P19">All iPSC lines used in this study were obtained from a cohort of eight idiopathic ASD patients with early developmental brain overgrowth and five unaffected individuals as controls. Children with such signs of early brain enlargement have been shown to be part of a group of patients with high probability of receiving diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Primary skin fibroblasts were harvested and reprogrammed to iPSCs using retroviral vectors expressing the four Yamanaka factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. 1a and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Our previous study showed that neuronal cultures derived from these patients bear an impaired neuronal network connectivity at later, more mature neuronal stages. Other iPSC studies have also reported aberrant features of neuronal connectivity as a phenotypic hallmark for various forms of autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, whether dynamic neurodevelopmental aberrations exist that precede the appearance of such advanced phenotypic disease states remains unresolved. Integrative bioinformatics approaches suggest that ASD pathologies may arise from combined deficiencies during distinct phases of human cortical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. To model these early periods, we differentiated the iPSCs into NSCs and then further into functional excitatory MAP2<sup>+</sup> neurons (Extended Data Fig. 1b-d) using a reported protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. All patient-derived cells adopted a cortical fate (Extended Data Fig. 1e-h and 2a and b), and global transcriptional comparison to the BrainSpan dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> revealed high correspondence to the dorsal telencephalon (cerebral cortex with dorsolateral, medial and orbitofrontal cortical areas) during early human fetal cortical development (Extended Data Fig. 2c-e). Furthermore, continuous electrophysiological recordings showed a consecutive transition through stages of functional maturation, including the firing of multiple evoked action potentials after 22 days of differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 2f).</p>
<p id="P20">One major aim of this study was to model the temporal dimension of shifting biological processes by treating the disorder as an evolving, dynamic system. We reasoned that a tight recapitulation of the consecutive developmental stages of early neuronal development in ASD and control cases would allow us to reconstruct time-related maturational processes. We first used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify a homogeneous population of NSCs based on the expression of the cell-surface markers CD184<sup>+</sup>/CD271<sup>−</sup>/CD44<sup>−</sup>/CD24<sup>−</sup>/CD15<sup>+ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. To trace ASD and control neurons over time, we performed a series of retroviral lineage-tracing experiments to isolate the progenies of dividing NSCs using a retroviral vector expressing a membrane-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) (CAG::LckN-eGFP). Because differentiating neurons express PSA-NCAM on the cell surface (Extended Data Fig. 3a and b), we established a FACS-based protocol for purification of defined subpopulations of retrovirally labeled eGFP<sup>+</sup>/PSA-NCAM<sup>+</sup> double-positive neurons after 2, 4, 7 and 14 days of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), which allowed us to capture several consecutive maturational stages during lineage progression. We next performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis over the time course of neuronal differentiation and observed dramatic gradual changes in gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 3c). As expected, neuronal genes such as <italic>MAP2</italic>, <italic>MAPT</italic> and <italic>DCX</italic>, voltage-gated channels, synaptic proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors such as <italic>GRIN3a</italic> and <italic>GRIA3</italic> became gradually upregulated, whereas cell cycle-associated genes were consecutively downregulated (Extended Data Fig. 3c, left panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis of differentially upregulated genes revealed highly significant enrichment for biological processes that control neuron generation and function (Extended Data Fig. 3c, right panel). A highly significant enrichment for factors that control cell cycle and proliferation was present in the list of the most strongly decreased genes (Extended Data Fig. 3c, right panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), indicating efficient purification of maturing neurons from defined time points during neuronal differentiation.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Identification of aberrant gene network dynamics in ASD</title>
<p id="P21">We next sought to decipher the dynamics of regulatory gene networks to identify deviations in time-critical aspects during ASD development. To cluster genes with similar expression patterns in an unbiased manner, we applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> to all 65 time series samples (five control and eight ASD lines at five time points) and identified 44 modules of co-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Methods</xref>). Here, modules with high gene numbers mostly corresponded to changes within developmental time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), whereas cell stage-specific events appeared to be a more subtle transcriptional feature reflected in a number of smaller modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 4a). As developmental progression is based on a sequence of events that changes over time, we were particularly interested in those modules that showed enrichment for genes holding dynamic temporal profiles. Defining a time-based module significance measure (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>) allowed us to identify three modules that showed a highly significant correlation with the progression of neurodevelopmental timing, referred to as Time Modules (TM) 1, 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Alternative network construction strategies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary methods</xref>) further demonstrated the robustness in identifying all three TMs, suggesting a high preservation within our gene network (Extended Data Fig. 4d and e).</p>
<p id="P22">To identify temporal deviations within the developmental sequence between ASD and control neurons, we compared temporal gene expression dynamics on the level of the identified gene modules. To overcome the lack of sensitivity to distortion in the time axis when using the Euclidean distance metric, we applied dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithms to compare temporal module dynamics between ASD and control neurons. DTW is a variety of time series alignment algorithms designed to measure similarities between two temporal sequences that may vary in speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Module Eigengenes (ME) (first principal component of a given module) were used as a representative of the gene expression profiles in the three TMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). DTW was then applied to compare the module-based dynamics between ASD and control neurons, revealing distinct deviations between the two time series in TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> left). The two other TMs showed only subtle initial timeline deviations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> middle and right panels, Extended Data Fig. 4b and c), indicating that the temporal sequences in TM2 and TM3 were almost similar between ASD and control neurons. The temporal progression of TM1, however, appeared markedly accelerated in ASD neurons, with earlier time points in ASD neurons corresponding to later time points in control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), highlighting the emergence of an intrinsic molecular heterochronicity.</p>
<p id="P23">To further evaluate the identified developmental gene networks, we computed the relative enrichment for disease-related risk factors in each module based on a set of 859 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) evaluated by the knowledgebase SFARI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Remarkably, TM1 and TM2 showed specific enrichment for ASD risk genes, with TM1 and TM2 featuring highly significant enrichment scores as compared to other modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). As further evidence for this confined enrichment, gene expression changes identified in post-mortem ASD cortex studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and during human cortical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, as well as genes with de novo variants associated with intellectual disability (ID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, showed significant enrichment in both TMs (Extended Data Fig. 4f). This confined enrichment in TMs suggests an involvement of autism risk factors in early phases of cortical neuron development, consistent with other recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and relates our findings to relevant ASD-associated changes that are present at later stages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Characterization of the accelerated ASD TM1</title>
<p id="P24">GO term analysis of the genes assigned to TM1 revealed highly significant enrichment for biological processes that control specific aspects of nervous system development (<italic>P</italic> = 2.8×10<sup>−28</sup>) such as neuron differentiation (<italic>P</italic> = 2.7×10<sup>−18</sup>), the development of neuronal projections (<italic>P</italic> = 3.4×10<sup>−15</sup>), cell morphogenesis (<italic>P</italic> = 3.1×10<sup>−15</sup>) and synaptic signaling (<italic>P</italic> = 2.6×10<sup>−20</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). As TM1 increases expression with time, the large neurodevelopmental signature of this module suggests that these genes reflect gradually increasing neuronal differentiation. Highly connected genes (‘hub genes’) such as <italic>BRSK1</italic>, <italic>CACNB1</italic>, <italic>RAB3A</italic> and <italic>GPC2</italic>, together with several other interconnected hub genes, are involved in neuron generation and synapse organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). To further characterize TM1, we calculated individual gene significance (GS) measures for the top 60 hub genes by correlating their expression with developmental time and condition. As expression of these genes increases with developmental time, GS measures reach highly positive values at later, more mature neuronal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). When comparing the hub gene trajectories of ASD and control neurons, a pronounced shift of GS values markedly emerged at four days after differentiation and continued to be prominent at later time points, although differences were already present at the NSC stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), suggesting an ASD-specific priming of gene expression already in pre-neuronal cells. Thus, given the large neurodevelopmental signature of TM1, the presence of such a marked time shift suggests aberrant neurodevelopmental gene network dynamics that could directly disturb the maturational sequence in developing ASD neurons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Maturing ASD neurons show aberrant neurodevelopmental growth dynamics</title>
<p id="P25">We next explored the extent to which certain morphological aspects of ASD neuron development deviate from the ‘normal’ trajectory, in addition to the marked time shift observed at the transcriptional level. Therefore, a series of structural and morphometric analyses was performed on defined subpopulations of eGFP<sup>+</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup>/PSA-NCAM<sup>+</sup> neurons using a retrovirus-based lineage tracing approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a and b</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 5a). Strikingly, and consistent with the shift observed in TM1, systematic reconstruction of individual morphological growth trajectories revealed a significant developmental acceleration in differentiating neurons from ASD patients as compared to control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c and d</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 5b). In line with this finding, ASD neurons consistently featured branching patterns that were significantly more complex than those of control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 5c). Thus, given the marked time shift in TM1, these data highlight the presence of aberrant maturational dynamics, pertaining to the growth patterns of neuronal projections in developing ASD neurons. As the development of neuronal projections is a time-critical process, we further asked whether this growth acceleration might be accompanied by differences in the states of neuronal maturity. To query intrinsic maturational properties, we designed a retroviral tracing system expressing eGFP under the control of the human Dcx promoter (hDcx::eGFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 5d). Flow cytometry-based reporter analysis revealed a premature activity state of the introduced hDcx promoter in differentiating neurons from ASD patients when compared to the trajectory of control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g and h</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 5e), indicating differences in the initiation and the dynamics of the neuronal program. Additional measures of maturational features furthermore revealed significant deviations in the temporal progression of important developmental pathways (Extended Data Fig. 6a-d).</p>
<p id="P26">To further explore the developmental implications of this intrinsic neurodevelopmental heterochronicity, we used two different protocols to generate a three-dimensional (3D) model of cortical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. As monolayer cultures prove limited to reveal spatial effects on early cortical development, we used a subset of our cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table 7</xref>) to assess the formation of the cortical plate (CP) in situ. While no major shift in specification of TBR1<sup>+</sup> neurons was present in the monolayer system, cerebral organoids as well as TBR1<sup>+</sup> cortical regions of forebrain organoids revealed an increased thickness of the CP in the ASD condition (Extended Data Fig. 6f-j), consistent with the hypothesis of increased neuronal numbers and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. These results further emphasize the advantage of 3D models to dissect spatial developmental aberrations.</p>
<p id="P27">To exclude the possibility of cell heterogeneity and to study the aberrant cell-intrinsic trajectories, we labeled dividing radial-glia-like cells (RGLs) in the ventricular-like zones of four-week-old forebrain organoids using a GFP-expressing retrovirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This approach allowed us to follow the progenies of labeled RGLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, top panel) as they migrated and integrated into the evolving CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, bottom panel). In line with our findings from the NSC monolayer system, assessment of developing neurons revealed no difference in overall cell-fate commitment, as both ASD and control RGLs gave rise mostly to TBR1<sup>+</sup> deep-layer neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 6k and l). However, morphological assessment of early-born cortical neurons showed marked differences between the control and ASD groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Quantitative assessment of their early branching patterns showed that ASD neurons harbored aberrantly complex neurite structures at 14 days post infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e-f</xref>). Together with our findings from the monolayer system and in line with the observed transcriptional dysregulation, these data highlight the existence of intrinsic ASD-associated perturbations in the sequence of cortical neuron development.</p>

<title>TM1-specific priming causes aberrant neurodevelopmental growth dynamics</title>
<p id="P28">As the timing of neurogenesis is thought to be largely controlled by cell-intrinsic mechanisms encoded within the cortical lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, we asked whether the disruption of the neotenic neurodevelopmental gene program in ASD neurons could have been primed during an earlier pre-neuronal stage in the timeline. Differential gene expression analysis indicated early aberrant gene expression dynamics in the ASD group with an upregulation of twice as many TM1 genes within the first four days of differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Table 8</xref>), pointing to the possible involvement of priming during preceding developmental stages. To assess the stage-specific co-expression of genes in TM1, we excluded network genes weakly interconnected with TM1 (kME&lt;0.7) and calculated the significance of gene-wise correlations to the preceding NSC stage using a signed GS measure (Extended Data Fig. 7a). As expected, a high number of TM1-specific genes featured highly significant negative correlations with the NSC stage in the control group (FDR adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 7b), indicating that these genes were downregulated in comparison to all other stages. Remarkably, almost 80% of these downregulated genes (189 of 237 negatively correlated TM1 genes) lacked significant negative GS values in ASD NSCs (Extended Data Fig. 7c and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). This difference between groups was also reflected in a marked shift in GS values for these 189 TM1 genes (Extended Data Fig. 7c), suggesting a subtle primed state of the neuronal network program in ASD NSCs. Among the top negatively correlated TM1 genes, the <italic>F-box protein 2</italic> (<italic>FBXO2)</italic> gene is involved in regulating the postmitotic neuronal state and the initiation of synapse formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, whereas other genes encoding for the small GTP-binding protein RASD2 or the transmembrane protein ISLR2 have been implicated in schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> or have important functions in neurite extension and regulating forebrain connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. 7d-h). We tested whether an early, dynamically aberrant overrepresentation of TM1-related genes is sufficient to induce ASD-specific morphological and maturational changes. To assess their functional implication, we performed controlled overexpression of selected TM1 genes using <italic>FBXO2</italic> alone as well as in combination with additional network genes (Extended Data Fig. 7i and j). As expected, priming the expression of <italic>FBXO2</italic> at the NSC stage caused a dynamically aberrant initiation of the subsequent neurodevelopmental program, as measured by neurite outgrowth after four days of differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 7k and l). This effect was even more pronounced when combining <italic>FBXO2</italic> with two additional TM1-specific network genes (Extended Data Fig. 7l and m), pointing to synergistic gene network-wide effects. These findings highlight the possibility that the ASD-specific neurodevelopmental dysregulation is controlled by genes identified in TM1 and could arise even before the neuronal stage through an aberrant priming of network-related genes.</p>

<title>Circumventing the pathologically primed NSC stage restores ASD neuron development</title>
<p id="P29">To evaluate whether these ASD-associated changes are indeed primed during early periods of neural development, we sought to optimize a technology that could be used to force iPSCs to circumvent early NSC-like stages. We thus generated neurons directly from iPSCs by optimizing a Neurogenin2 (Ngn2)-based induced neuron (iN) protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. IPSCs were lentivirally transduced to express rtTA and a 2A-peptide linked transcript coding for Ngn2 and eGFP (N2AG), resulting in transgenic but silent and expandable N2AG iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Following iPSC-iN conversion, iPSCs underwent marked morphological changes by establishing neuronal projections as early as within four days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 8b). As seen with neurons derived from NSCs through directed differentiation, forced expression of Ngn2 also resulted in the generation of functional neurons with high correspondence to the dorsal telencephalon during human fetal cortical development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 8c-i and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). However, stringent assessment of early trans-differentiation events revealed that iPSC-iN conversion did not require proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>) and bypassed the emergence of NSC-specific signatures (Extended Data Fig. 9a-e), indicating that this iPSC-iN method indeed generated neurons that had never been in an NSC-like state.</p>
<p id="P30">We reasoned that applying this technology in the context of ASD could circumvent the critical NSC-associated priming period for the ASD signature to establish itself. A series of in-depth analyses focusing on maturation and structural development throughout early neuronal growth periods were performed to re-evaluate the differences between control and ASD iPSC-iNs during early neuronal differentiation. Both ASD and control iPSC-iNs underwent marked morphological changes over the time course of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). However, quantitative assessment of neuronal differentiation revealed no difference between iPSC-iNs from ASD patients and those generated from unaffected control individuals, as measured by neuronal commitment and neurite branching patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a and b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 9f and g). Further, in sharp contrast to the ASD-specific differences in the growth of neuronal projections observed in NSC-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), in-depth morphometric analysis of iPSC-iNs derived from the same iPSC clones did not show this aberrant trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). To compare the developmental gene network dynamics during iPSC-iN maturation with those identified in NSC-derived neurons, we performed time-series RNA-seq analysis at different stages during iPSC-iN conversion (Extended Data Fig. 10a). We applied WGCNA to identify modules of co-expressed genes, similar to the approach that was used for NSC-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 10b and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). Comparing the networks of NSC-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) with those of iPSC-iNs revealed a significant conservation of TM1 (Extended Data Fig. 10c-e). In sharp contrast to the NSC-differentiation data, DTW revealed no trajectorial difference in the progression of the TM1-equivalent gene network between control and ASD in iPSC-iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 10f and g). Furthermore, the prominent ASD-associated transcriptional shift among the top 60 TM1 hub genes, which was prevalent in NSC-derived neurons, appeared to be abolished in IPSC-iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>).</p>

<title>Aberrant gene network dynamics at early neuronal stages are associated with changes in chromatin accessibility at preceding NSC stages</title>
<p id="P32">Given the contribution of early NSC stages in the subsequent ASD-associated phenotype, we sought to further characterize possible mechanisms underlying this pathologically primed state. We reasoned that the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) in NSCs would allow us to obtain a depiction of preceding changes in the chromatin landscape. We thus isolated NSCs by FACS using the same surface markers as described above before subjecting them to ATAC-seq. All size-selected ATAC-seq libraries showed the characteristic fragment length distribution (Extended Data Fig. 11a), with the majority of reads falling in the nucleosome-free region (NFR) (Extended Data Fig. 11b). We assessed differential accessibility (DA) between the two conditions and discovered 833 peaks with greater accessibility in ASD NSCs and 760 peaks with decreased accessibility in the ASD group as compared to control NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a and b</xref>, FDR adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Hierarchical clustering based on the correlation of accessibility of DA sites separated the samples into two groups based on their condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). Similarly, the identified DA peaks could be used to separate the sample groups along the first and second principal component of variation, explaining 75% and 16% of variation respectively (Extended Data Fig. 11d).</p>
<p id="P33">DA peaks are significantly enriched in previously annotated chromatin states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, including promoters and enhancers, but depleted in regions containing quiescent and actively transcribed regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>). Previous studies have shown that regulatory modules as far as 50kbp and more from the transcriptional start site have important contributions to the prediction of a genes’ transcriptional activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Examining 50kbp windows around genes assigned to any of the three TMs uncovered that DA peaks with increased accessibility in ASD NSCs fall significantly more often in TM1 gene-distal regions than would be expected by chance, whereas gene-distal regions of TM2 and TM3 did not show any enrichment for DA peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 11 e and f). Remarkably, metagene analysis of gene promoters from TM1 hub genes (kME&gt;0.8) showed a significantly increased amount of nucleosomal depletion in ASD NSCs compared to control NSCs (273 elements, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 6.717×10<sup>−4</sup>); this depletion was not present in accessible promoters of randomly selected background genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8f</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 11g). These findings highlight the involvement of altered epigenetic chromatin remodeling processes and suggest that, at least in part, increased accessibility in promoter and gene-distal regions may contribute to the aberrant enhancement of transcription that occurs at the subsequent neuronal stage. In line with the finding that the manifestation of the aberrant TM1-specific signature establishes itself during early NSC-like stages, these data provide further evidence for the existence of early pathologically primed states that may trigger later occurring aberrations during ASD development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P34">Our work demonstrates how ASD-associated neurodevelopmental aberrations that disturb the maturational sequence of cortical neuron development are triggered by a pathological priming of gene regulatory networks that evolves during early neural development. These findings contribute to the emerging picture of convergent molecular pathologies in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and identify NSC stages as critical developmental periods that lay the groundwork for disease propensity.</p>
<p id="P35">Despite etiological heterogeneity, recent large-scale gene expression studies on ASD postmortem brain regions have shown consistent transcriptome changes that evolve during the first decade of brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. These ASD-associated changes are thought to represent the consequences of an ongoing process that is triggered largely by genetic and epigenetic factors early in development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. However, little was known about whether this plethora of heritable genetic components might converge on a coherent gene network during specific periods of fetal cortical development. Our current study is based on a carefully selected cohort of macro-cephalic ASD patients representing a highly replicated and significant phenotype within the spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Previous ASD postmortem studies have pointed to pathologies in neuronal and micro-columnar organization, spine growth and dendrite morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, suggesting aberrant processes during early brain development. Considering that live neurons from patients are inaccessible and most postmortem tissues are limited to later stages of disease pathogenesis, iPSC-based model systems provide an unprecedented tool to study the progression of early developmental events. Here, we have developed a time series approach that allowed us to follow human idiopathic ASD patient-specific iPSCs during their early cortico-neuronal development. Transcriptome-wide screening revealed an ASD-associated temporal dysregulation within a specific neurodevelopmental gene module that caused marked changes in the maturational sequence of cortical neuron development, including morphological growth acceleration and heterochronic initiation of the neuronal program. It is likely that a disruption of the neotenic gene expression program during cortical neuron development has wide-ranging consequences for a timely, coordinated establishment of interconnected neuronal networks. Experiments in rodents have shown that altering the trajectory of early postnatal cortical development can lead to structural and behavioral features of autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. In line with this finding, human iPSC-based studies have confirmed that neuronal connectivity is affected in various forms of autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, while cortical neurons are thought to be particularly susceptible for certain ASD risk genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, it is currently not well understood whether common ASD-associated changes that evolve at the neuronal stage are the consequence of an ongoing process that is primed early in development.</p>
<p id="P36">Here we show that the observed neurodevelopmental heterochronicity in ASD neurons originates from functional neurodevelopmental gene networks that become pathologically primed during the pre-neuronal NSC stage. By mimicking this ASD-specific signature in control NSCs using controlled overrepresentation of a subset of network genes, we show that pathological dysregulation in NSCs is sufficient to induce ASD-associated morphological and maturational changes at later neuronal stages. While we only tested a selected subset of network-related genes, it would be interesting to investigate how different combinations of network genes may contribute to the ASD-associated changes in a context- and subject-specific manner.</p>
<p id="P37">Trans-differentiation of somatic cells such as fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) has been used as an alternative technology to directed differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. More recently this technology has been expanded to enable rapid generation of functional neurons by transgenic overexpression of proneural transcription factors in iPSCs (iPSC-iNs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. However, it is well established that forced expression of iN pioneer factors during fibroblast-based iN conversion does not require proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. A recent study furthermore demonstrated that the direct programming path diverges into a novel transitional state, bypassing intermediate progenitors, but converging onto the same final state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. In line with our findings, these data indicate that iPSC-iNs indeed generate neurons that have never been in a NSC-like state, thus making them a promising tool to evaluate the implication of early neurodevelopmental states in priming disease progression. Using this technology, we demonstrate that bypassing NSC-like stages by direct conversion of ASD iPSCs into postmitotic neurons prevents the observed neuronal ASD-associated phenotypes from manifesting. Our analysis suggests that some ASD-associated changes are likely to be the consequence of pathological events that are triggered during NSC stages early in development. A genome-wide analysis of the chromatin state further identified a contribution of preceding epigenetic changes to priming disease propensity. Future studies are needed to assess the implication of specific epigenetic aspects on onset and severity of autism-related disease trajectories. Finally, given the growing evidence of specific neurodevelopmental alterations in ASD, these findings and the methodological framework will be valuable for guiding future mechanistic studies aimed at identifying a convergence of causal genetic variations that contribute to ASD risk.</p>

<p id="P38">Primary human dermal fibroblasts were obtained from subjects recruited through the University of California San Diego, Autism Center of Excellence, and reprogramming was performed using the classical retroviral approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. This study protocol was approved by Salk Institute’s IRB Committee (FWA 00005316) and the Embryonic Stem Cell Research and Oversight (ESCRO) Committee. The Salk Institute is committed to protecting the rights and welfare of human research participants and ensures compliance with all applicable ethical and legal requirements. After a complete description of the study, written informed consent was provided by the parents of the human participants. IPSCs were generated from eight male subjects diagnosed with ASD according to the DSM-IV (average age 13.25 ± 5.67 years) and five male control participants (average age 11.4 ± 5.22 years), which had no history of psychological, genetic or other disorders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Control subjects were selected randomly from lists of typically developing individuals who had the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan when they were toddlers. ASD subjects were selected from lists of ASD subjects who had been identified and diagnosed with ASD and MRI scanned when they were toddlers. From among these potential ASD subjects, those with larger than normal average total brain volume as compared with typically developing toddlers were selected. The iPSC lines obtained from this cohort have been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and were reprogrammed in the same facility (Salk Institute for Biological Studies, Laboratory of Genetics) and under the same conditions. Briefly, fibroblasts were transduced with retroviruses containing SOX2, OCT4, KLF4 and MYC to induce overexpression of these genes and were transferred to a co-culture system with murine embryonic fibroblasts. IPSC colonies were identified after around two weeks in this culture system, plated onto Matrigel-coated plates (BD Biosciences) and maintained in mTeSR1 media (Stem Cell Technologies). All cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination.

<title>Weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA)</title>
<p id="P44">A signed co-expression network was built using the WGCNA 1.51 package in R. All 65 time series samples were included in the network (five controls and eight ASDs at five time points) and 52 time series samples for the iPSC-iN time line (five controls and eight ASDs at four time points). Network construction was performed by first creating a matrix of pairwise correlations between all pairs of genes across the measured samples. The adjacency matrix was then constructed by raising the co-expression measure (0.5 + 0.5 X correlation matrix) to the power of β = 12 (and β = 14 for the iPSC-iNs time series), which is interpreted as a soft-threshold of the correlation matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Based on the resulting adjacency matrix, we next calculated the topological overlap as a robust and biologically meaningful measure of network interconnectedness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Average linkage hierarchical clustering was performed to group genes with highly similar co-expression relationships. Using the Dynamic Hybrid Tree Cut algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, we defined modules as branches resulting from the tree cutting of the hierarchical clustering tree. To obtain moderately large and distinct modules, we set the minimal module size to 30 genes and merged modules whose eigengenes were highly correlated (correlation above 0.6). The expression profiles for each module were summarized by representing them as the first principal component (module eigengene, ME), thus explaining the maximum amount of variation of the module expression levels. Module membership measures were defined for each module as the correlation between gene expression values and the module eigengene (module eigengene based connectivity kME). To identify modules that gradually changed over time, a time-based significance measure was defined as the absolute correlation between time (dpi or days of in vitro differentiation post lineage tracing) and the gene expression profiles across all 65 samples. This measure was used to compute the module significances as the average gene significance measure for all genes in a given module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

The more warping that is required, the greater the difference between the two timelines.

Thus, GS indicates whether the gene has a positive or negative relationship with the trait-specific time point. In combination with kME, GS was used to assess stage-specific expression or suppression of intramodular genes.

<p id="P50">Tiled image stacks were processed using the ZEN Imaging software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) and exported as TIFF files. Neurolucida version 11 (MBF Bioscience) was used to reconstruct individual retrovirus-labeled neurons over time. In total, 10 to 20 traces per line (eight ASD and five control lines with one or two clones per line, n<sub>total</sub>=564 cells) were analyzed at three different time points (4, 7 and 14 dpi) and plotted as mean for every individual. Identification of individual neurons was based on co-expression of markers PSA-NCAM and DCX. Reconstructions were based on the extent of membrane-bound GFP expression labeled through RV-CAG:LckN-eGFP. IPSC-iNs were traced at the time points indicated post induction (4, 7 and 14 days post doxycycline). In total, 10 to 30 traces per line (eight ASD and five control lines with one or two clones per line, n<sub>total</sub>=746 cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table 7</xref>) were analyzed and plotted as mean for every individual. For Sholl analysis, 5 or 10 μm increments were used to define the gradually increasing radius of concentric circles centered at the centroid of the cell soma. Subsequent analysis of global and subtle branching patterns was performed using the Neurolucida Explorer (MBF Bioscience) and Microsoft Excel.</p>

<title>Generation of cerebral organoids</title>
<p id="P51">Cerebral organoids were generated and processed for analysis as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> with minor modifications. Briefly, iPSCs were washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS, Invitrogen), dissociated with EDTA followed by Accutase to generate single cells. A total of 1X10<sup>4</sup> cells were then seeded into each well of an ultra-low-attachment 96-well plate (Nunc) to form single embryoid bodies (EBs) in medium containing DMEM/F12, 20% KOSR, 3% fetal bovine serum, 2mM GlutaMAX, 1% non-essential amino acids, 50nM b-mercaptoethanol and 4 ng/ml bFGF. ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (40uM) was included for the first 24 hrs. After two days, the medium was changed (same medium but without FGF) and EBs were grown for another three to four days. Medium was then changed to neural induction medium consisting of DMEM/F12, 1X N2 supplement, 1% non-essential amino acids, 2mM GlutaMAX and 1ug/ml heparin (Sigma). On days 10-12, EBs were embedded in 30 ul droplets of Matrigel and allowed to gel at 37°C for 20-30 min. Embedded EBs were subsequently cultured in cerebral differentiation medium (CDM) composed of 50% DMEM/F12, 50% Neurobasal, 0.5X N2 supplement, 1X B27 (without RA) supplement, 2mM GlutaMAX, 2.8 ng/ml human insulin (Sigma), 0.5% non-essential amino acids and 55 µM b-mercaptoethanol. Droplets were cultured in stationary condition in 6-cm suspension culture dishes (Corning) for four days, transferred to an orbital shaker (65-80 rpm) and cultured in CDM +RA media for up to five weeks.</p>

Human iPSC colonies were detached before reaching confluency with collagenase Type IV (Gibco) and transferred to an Ultra-Low attachment 10 cm plate (Corning Costar), containing 10 ml hPSC medium, consisting of DMEM:F12 (Invitrogen), 20% Knockout Serum Replacer (Gibco), 1X Non-essential Amino Acids (Invitrogen), 1X 2-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 1X GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 10 ng/ml FGF-2 (Peprotech) and ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (10μM). Twenty-four hrs later, the medium was replaced with induction medium containing hPSC media without FGF-2, 2 μM dorsomorphin (Cayman Chemical) and 2μM A-083 (Stemgent). At day five the media was replaced with Neural induction medium (NIM) consisted of DMEM:F12 (Invitrogen), 1X N2 Supplement (Invitrogen), 1X Non-essential Amino Acids (Invitrogen), 1X GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml Heparin (Sigma), 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco), 10 μM CHIR99021 (Cayman) and 1 μM SB-431542 (Stemgent). Seven days after induction, organoids were embedded in 20 μl Matrigel (Trevigen) droplets and continued to grow for an additional week in 6-cm Ultra-Low attachment plates (Corning Costar). From day 14 onwards, organoids were cultured in differentiation medium composed of DMEM:F12 (Invitrogen), 1X N2 and B27 Supplements (Invitrogen), 1X Non-essential Amino Acids (Invitrogen), 1X GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 1X 2-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco), and 2.5 μg/ml Insulin (Sigma), transferred to an orbital shaker (65-80 rpm). At day 20, residual Matrigel was removed and media changes were performed every 2-3 days using the aforementioned differentiation medium. Labeling with RV-CAG:LckN-eGFP was performed in four-week-old forebrain organoids by using a titer range of approximately 10<sup>5</sup> - 10<sup>6</sup> colony forming units/ml. After 12 hrs of incubation, organoids were washed and cultured for up to ten weeks.</p>
<p id="P53">Forebrain organoids were stained with TBR1 at six weeks to define CP-like regions and to measure the thickness of the evolving plate. Four independent measurements per ventricular structure of sub-segmented fields (specified in Extended Data Fig. 6g) were averaged and a total of three forebrain organoids with 2–3 ‘VZ-like’ regions per organoid were quantified for every patient line using three ASD and three control individuals (n<sub>total</sub>= 17 organoids; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table 7</xref> for details). Retrovirally labeled newborn neurons were analyzed in forebrain organoids at 14 dpi in regions that showed clearly defined VZ-like and CP-like structures. Three-dimensional reconstructions were based on the extent of membrane-bound GFP (RV-CAG:LckN-eGFP) in newborn neurons located within CP-like regions and analyzed with the software detailed above (morphometric analysis). In total, 30 to 60 traces per line (three ASD and three control lines with three organoid replicates per individual, n<sub>total</sub>=264 cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table 7</xref>) were analyzed and plotted as mean for every individual.</p>

<title>ATAC-seq data analysis.</title>
<p id="P56">For differential accessibility (DA) analysis, we used DiffBind v2.4.8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> to first perform a weighted overlap analysis (dba.count). The number of reads within each peak of the union peakset was counted and normalized for sequencing depth using the total number of non-mitochondrial reads present in the peaks for each sample. The edgeR v3.18.1 package was then used to contrast the control and ASD group using the DiffBind function ‘dba.analyze’ with the settings to use edgeR (method = DBA_EDGER). The DA heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>) displays the normalized peak accessibility scores for each sample. These scores were calculated using the DiffBind default setting ‘DBA_SCORE_TMM_READS_FULL’, which uses the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalization built into the edgeR package using read counts and full library size. Coverage plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 11f) display normalized read counts – the number of reads within a peak divided by the sequencing depth – and were generated with Gviz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> using hg38 NCBI RefSeq gene model annotations downloaded from the UCSC genome browser.</p>
<p id="P57">To generate metagene profiles of promoter regions, HOMER was first used to convert aligned and filtered reads into “tag directories” for further analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> that showed significance. No method of randomization was applied, however all biological assays and sequencing samples were randomly assigned to different experimental groups and batches to control for covariates. For data collection and data analysis (counting, tracing, imaging and FACS analysis), investigators were blinded with regard to the group category. All biological assays were performed with iPSCs derived from eight ASD patients and five healthy controls (n=8 ASD patient lines, n=5 control cell lines; all male), with the exception of the organoid validation experiments, for which we randomly selected a subset of three ASD patients and three controls (n=3 ASD patient lines, n=3 control cell lines; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and Extended Data Fig.6f-l). No other collected samples were excluded from the analysis. Statistical comparisons for biological assays were performed in Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software) using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test (MWU, one independent variable, single comparison), the one-way ANOVA using Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test (to compare means of three or more sets of unpaired measurements), and the two-way ANOVA using the Sidak multiple comparison test (two independent variables: dpi and neurite length per neuron). Threshold for significance (α) was set at 0.05. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Means, median, s.d., s.e.m., percentages and confidence intervals of all other quantitative data were calculated using Prism 6.0 and Microsoft Excel.</p>
