<title>Purpose</title>
<p id="Par1">To determine the role of mosaicism in the pathogenesis and
inheritance of Rett and Rett-like disorders.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="Par2">We recruited 471 Rett and Rett-like patients. Panel-sequencing
targeting <italic>MECP2</italic>, <italic>CDKL5</italic>, and <italic>FOXG1</italic> was
performed. Mosaicism was quantified in 147 patients by a Bayesian genotyper.
Candidates were validated by amplicon sequencing and digital PCR. Germline
mosaicism of 21 fathers with daughters carrying pathogenic <italic>MECP2</italic> variants was further quantified.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par3">Pathogenic variants of <italic>MECP2/CDKL5</italic>/<italic>FOXG1</italic> were found
in 324/471 (68.7%) patients. Somatic <italic>MECP2</italic>
mosaicism was confirmed in 5/471 (1.1%) patients, including 3/18 males (16.7%)
and 2/453 females (0.4%). Three of the five patients with somatic <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism had mosaicism at MECP2-Arg106.
Germline <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism was detected in 5/21
(23.8%) fathers.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p id="Par4">This is the first systematic screening of somatic and paternal
germline <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism at a cohort level.
Our findings indicate that somatic <italic>MECP2</italic>
mosaicism contributes directly to the pathogenicity of Rett syndrome, especially
in male patients. MECP2-Arg106 might be a mosaic hotspot. The high proportion of
paternal germline <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism indicates
an underestimated mechanism underlying the paternal origin bias of <italic>MECP2</italic> variants. Finally, this study provides an
empirical foundation for future studies of genetic disorders caused by de novo
variations of strong paternal origin.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="Par5">Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting females
almost exclusively, and the majority of patients are sporadic. Methyl-CpG-binding
protein 2 (<italic>MECP2</italic>) is the main causative gene of
RTT; 95% of classical RTT cases were found to be caused by <italic>MECP2</italic> pathogenic variants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (<italic>CDKL5</italic>) and Forkhead box protein G1 (<italic>FOXG1</italic>) are responsible for the early seizure variant
and congenital variant of atypical RTT, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> However, for a subset of patients with RTT
and RTT-like phenotypes, no pathogenic variants have been identified in <italic>MECP2</italic>, <italic>CDKL5</italic>, or
<italic>FOXG1</italic>. Recently, postzygotic variants have
drawn increasing attention in the field of disease
genetics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> More than 40 nontumorous monogenetic diseases
have been discovered to arise from mosaic variants of relevant
genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>
However, there have been only a few studies of mosaicism in
RTT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Somatic <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism has been described in sporadic RTT
cases, for which variants have been identified and estimated by Sanger
sequencing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> However, the epidemiology of <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism in RTT cohorts, mutant allelic
fractions (MAFs), and the relationship between these factors and the severity of RTT
are poorly understood.</p>
<p id="Par6">Several studies have reported that 94–96% of <italic>MECP2</italic> variants in sporadic cases of RTT were of paternal
origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> However, the mechanisms underlying RTT in these
cases remain unclear. Recent studies of Apert syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, and
Pfeiffer syndrome found that genomic mosaicism in paternal gametes is responsible
for the disease in their offspring. These results might also explain the significant
paternal bias in the origin of “spontaneous mutations”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> for diseases such as Apert
syndrome. For some diseases, a selection advantage for the mutant cells of fathers
has been identified, and this advantage contributes to the accumulation of
pathogenic variants in their offspring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> However, with regard to RTT, there is limited
knowledge about germline mosaicism in the fathers of disease-affected individuals.
Germline <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism has been identified in
only one man with two RTT daughters, who were half-sisters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> The occurrence rate of
<italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism in the parents of RTT
patients, especially in their germline cells, and the variance of MAFs between
different tissues from the same individual remains unknown. Therefore, this study
was conducted to investigate the role of somatic and paternal germline mosaicism in
the pathogenicity and inheritance of RTT spectrum disorders.</p>

<p id="Par8">Patients with typical/atypical RTT and RTT-like syndrome were
enrolled. The diagnostic criteria for typical and atypical RTT were adopted
from Neul.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> RTT-like syndrome refers to a clinical
manifestation that does not completely meet the criteria for RTT, but which
shares the main features of RTT, including psychomotor retardation with or
without regression, stereotypic hand movements, and other autism-like
behaviors. In total, 471 patients (453 females and 18 males;
Supplemental <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">material</xref>,
Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>) were recruited from
the child neurology units of Peking University First Hospital from January
2000 to January 2018.</p>
<p id="Par9">This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at
Peking University (IRBPU) and the Ethics Committee of Peking University
First Hospital under approval code IRB00001052-11087. Written informed
consent forms were obtained from the parents of each subject. All methods
used in this study were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines
and regulations of the IRBPU.</p>
<p id="Par10">Genomic DNA from peripheral blood was extracted using a
salting-out procedure. Genomic DNA from hair follicles, buccal swabs,
saliva, and urine was extracted using a QIAamp® DNA Micro Kit (#56304,
Qiagen, Germany).</p>

<p id="Par11">An AmpliSeq capture panel (Ion Torrent) targeting the whole
genomic region and regulatory sequences of <italic>MECP2</italic>, <italic>CDKL5</italic>, and
<italic>FOXG1</italic> was designed. A sample of
genomic DNA (10 ng, approximately 3000 genome copies) was used to prepare
the library using a standard Ion AmpliSeq library preparation protocol (pub.
no. MAN0006735) with some modifications. Illumina adapters were used to
maximize throughput and minimize sequencing cost. Two rounds of polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based enrichment were performed to add indexes to the
libraries. The pooled library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500
platform (CA, USA) to generate 100 bp paired-end reads. The average read
depth was approximately 1000×. Reads were aligned to a human reference
genome (GRCh37/hg19) with the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) mem algorithm in
the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> The workflow for
data analysis followed the best practice workflows of the Genome Analysis

Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>) without detectable
<italic>MECP2/CDKL5/FOXG1</italic> variants were
subjected to somatic mosaic screening. The next-generation sequencing (NGS)
data of the subjects were analyzed using MosaicHunter. Candidate mosaic
variants were selected and validated by microdroplet digital PCR
(mDDPCR).</p>
<p id="Par14">Seventy-four fathers were subjected to somatic mosaic detection
by mDDPCR. DNA from peripheral blood was measured (Supplemental
table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S6</xref>). Each of the tested
fathers had at least one daughter with RTT who was confirmed to possess a de
novo pathogenic <italic>MECP2</italic> variant.</p>
<p id="Par15">Next, germline <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaic
variants were tested in 21 available fathers (in addition to the 74 fathers
mentioned above) who volunteered to donate a semen sample. Ten of the 21
fathers also donated additional sample material, including hair follicles,
buccal swabs, saliva, and urine (Supplemental <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">material</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). mDDPCR was applied to test for mosaicism. Sperm from
two males (ACC1-sp and ACC4-sp) without a family history of RTT was used as
negative control material. mDDPCR was used to quantify <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaic variants.</p>

<title>DNA isolation</title>
<p id="Par16">Sperm samples were purified with a PureSperm 40/80 assay
(Nidacon, Sweden), and four different semen components were collected
separately, including Sperm, Layer 2, Layer 1, and Others (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). Genomic DNA from the four semen

<title>Filtration for mosaic candidates by MosaicHunter</title>
<p id="Par17">Reads generated from panel sequencing (see section on MLPA)
were realigned to human reference genome GRCh37/hg19 by BWA mem.
Postalignment processing, indel realignment, and base quality recalibration
were carried out following the GATK 3.2–2 best practice workflows. As
described previously, the processed reads were filtered by a simplified
Bayesian model (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Yyx2626/yyxMosaicHunter">https://github.com/Yyx2626/yyxMosaicHunter</ext-link>) to quantify the candidate mosaic variants. The MAF threshold
for the lower bound of the 95% Bayesian confidence interval (CI) was 0.5%
for the reference homozygous genotype. The MAF threshold for the
heterozygous genotype was 45.0–55.0% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec11">
<title>PGM amplicon sequencing of mosaicism</title>
<p id="Par18">Personal Genome Machine amplicon seuencing of mosaicism (PASM)
was used to validate candidate mosaic variants that were not located on
mutant hotspots. Targeted PCR amplification was used to capture a region of
400 base pairs around the candidate genome position. The amount of DNA used
for amplification was 20 ng (approximately 6000 genome copies). The primers
are listed in Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>. An
amplicon library was prepared using an Ion
Xpress<sup>TM</sup> Plus Fragment Library Kit and
sequenced on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) using Ion 318 V2
chips (ThermoFisher). The average read depth for PASM was approximately
12,000×. A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to calculate MAFs with
maximum a posteriori estimation and 95% Bayesian confidence intervals (CIs) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Yyx2626/yyxMosaicHunter">https://github.com/Yyx2626/yyxMosaicHunter</ext-link>). The MAF threshold for the lower bound of the reference
homozygous variants was 0.5%. The MAF threshold for the heterozygous
variants was 40.0–60.0%. According to our previous benchmark tests, the
validation sensitivity is 0.85, while the specificity is 0.92 (ref.

<sec id="Sec12">
<title>Measurement of allelic fractions by mDDPCR</title>
<p id="Par19">mDDPCR with single-molecule resolution was used to accurately
measure MAFs. To avoid potential contamination of low-fraction mutant
alleles, DNA from multiple tissue types was sheared separately. Ultraviolet
treatment was carried out after shearing DNA from each proband. Next, mDDPCR
analysis was carried out for the absolute quantification of
MAFs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> TaqMan genotyping assays targeting ten
mutational hotspots and two nonhotspot sites (Supplemental <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">material</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>) in <italic>MECP2</italic> were
designed. The mutant allele was labeled with FAM fluorophore, whereas the
wild-type allele was labeled with VIC fluorophore (P/N:4331349, Applied
Biosystems, IDs provided in Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). Genotyping quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments were
first performed on a StepOne Plus real-time system (Applied Biosystems by
ThermoFisher) to test the performance of the assays. The validated
genotyping system was subjected to the downstream digital PCR reactions.
Droplet emulsions were generated from a Raindrop Source droplet generator.
PCR amplification was carried out with a controlled temperature ramp of
0.5 °C/s. Fluorescent droplets were detected on a
RainDrop<sup>TM</sup> Sense droplet detector. RainDrop
Analyst V3 software was used for data analysis. Ninety-five percent
confidence intervals of MAFs were calculated with a binomial distribution.
The detection limit of mDDPCR was 10<sup>−4</sup>

<p id="Par22"><bold>R113.</bold> Patient R113 is a boy who
was 4 years and 4 months of age at the time of the study and had developmental
delay. The patient could raise his head at the age of 5 months, sit unsupported
at 7 to 8 months, and walk with aid at 1 year. He was capable of walking
unstably and could speak 1 to 2 words at 4 years and 4 months of age. He had
some hand skills, such as grabbing larger objects, but his fine motor skills
were poor. Although delayed, there was no significant developmental regression.
He was diagnosed with RTT-like syndrome. A mosaic variant of <italic>MECP2</italic>, c.317G&gt;A, p.(Arg106Gln), was found, with
a MAF of 6.50%.</p>
<p id="Par23">There was a female with a heterozygous variant at the same genomic
position as patient R113 in our cohort. At the time of the study, she was 3
years old with a typical RTT phenotype. She could raise her head at 4 months,
sit alone at 9 months, and walk at 20 months. Her gait was unstable at 3 years
of age. She could speak single words at 3 years old. Repetitive hand movements
occurred at 20 months, and then hand skills were gradually lost. In comparison
with this female patient, the symptoms of patient R113 were slightly milder in
severity.</p>
<p id="Par24"><bold>R365.</bold> Patient R365 is a girl with
typical RTT who was 2 years and 4 months of age at the time of the study. She
could raise her head at 2 months, sit alone at 8 months, and walk and speak at
16 months. Regression started at 17 months, at which point she gradually lost
her acquired language skills. Repetitive hand movements were observed at 19
months of age, after which purposeful hand skills were lost. Seizures occurred
at 19 months of age. She was found to possess <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaic variant c.316C&gt;T, p.(Arg106Trp) with a MAF of
38.08%.</p>
<p id="Par25">Heterozygous pathogenic variants of <italic>MECP2</italic> at this genomic position were identified in 16 female
patients in our cohort. With gross motor development, language learning, the
onset age of stereotypies, and the age of regression taken into consideration,
there was no significant difference between patient R365 and the heterozygous
females in this study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>

<p id="Par26"><bold>R782</bold>. Patient R782 was a boy who
was 2 years and 7 months of age at the time of the study. He was found to
possess <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism c.316C&gt;T,
p.(Arg106Trp) with a MAF of 26.3%, and he presented with typical RTT. The
patient achieved head control at 3 months, sat alone at 8 months, and was
incapable of walking independently at the time of the study. Hand clapping and
wringing occurred at 15 months of age. Psychomotor regression was noticed at 1.5
years of age. He had neither purposeful hand skills nor the capacity for
meaningful language.</p>
<p id="Par27">In comparison with 16 females carrying heterozygous variants at the
same genomic position, stereotypic hand movement occurred earlier in the mosaic
male patient (15 months vs. 20 months). In addition, the male mosaic patient
never acquired hand skills or language skills (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). Overall, the phenotype of the mosaic male patient was
slightly more severe than those of heterozygous females with the same mosaic
variant.</p>
<p id="Par28"><bold>R286</bold>. Patient R286 was a girl who
was 3 years and 1 month of age at the time of the study and was diagnosed with
typical RTT. Her developmental milestones were nearly normal, with head control
at 4 months and sitting at 9 months, but she was incapable of walking. Simple
language started at 9 months with words such as <italic>mama</italic>. Psychomotor regression was noticed at 15 to 16 months old.
Frequent hand stereotypies and loss of hand skills occurred at 19 months old.
Bruxism was also noticed. <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaic
variant c.502C&gt;T, p.(Arg168Ter) was identified in this patient with a MAF of
12.28%.</p>
<p id="Par29">A <italic>MECP2</italic> heterozygous variant at
the same site was identified in 11 females in our cohort. The phenotype of
patient R286 and those of the patients with the heterozygous <italic>MECP2</italic> variant were compared (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). The onset age of hand stereotypies and loss
of hand use were delayed in the mosaic patient in comparison with the
heterozygous patients. However, with regard to developmental milestones,
including raising her head, sitting, and walking, she lagged behind the
heterozygous patients.</p>
<p id="Par30"><bold>R734.</bold> Patient R734 was a
2.5-year-old boy at the time of the study. He could raise his head at 4 months
of age, sit at 1 year, and walk with assistance at 2.5 years. Simple language
started at 11 months and gradually disappeared after 13 to 14 months of age.
Stereotypic hand movement was noticed at 1 year of age, after which hand skills
regressed. Typical RTT was diagnosed. <italic>MECP2</italic>
mosaicism c.353G&gt;A, p.(Gly118Val) was identified with a MAF of 20.11%. This
variant was novel, and it was predicted as damaging by MutationTaster,
PolyPhen-2, and SIFT. The same variant was not identified in the parents of the
patient.</p>

<p id="Par31">A total of 74 paternal peripheral blood samples were subjected to
PASM and/or mDDPCR. However, no somatic mosaic variant was identified
(Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>, and

<p id="Par32">Germline mosaic variants were found in 5 fathers (5/21, 23.8%).
Three fathers possessed the c.502C&gt;T, p.(Arg168Ter) variant, one possessed
the c.880C&gt;T, p.(Arg294Ter) variant, and one possessed the c.806delG,
p.(Gly269Alafs*20) variant. The MAFs ranged from 0.03% to 7.55%
(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). As mentioned above, each
semen sample was separated into four different components (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). For three fathers (R846F, R873F, and R931F),
mosaicism was only detectable in Layer 2. For subject R831F, mosaicism was
detectable in Sperm and Others. For subject R848F, mosaicism was detectable in
all four layers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b, c</xref>). The sperm
viability of four fathers was tested. One father (R831F) was diagnosed with
asthenospermia (25%, 3/4), while one father (R848F) nearly met the diagnostic
criteria for asthenospermia (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>).
Subject R831F has two children (a RTT daughter and a normal son), whereas R848F

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="Par34">In this study, we identified <italic>MECP2</italic>
somatic mosaic variants in 5 RTT patients (1.1%, 5/471). This study is the first in
which mosaicism screening was carried out at a cohort level in RTT patients. Before
this study, mosaicism was only described in 8 RTT patients (6 males and 2 females)
with MAFs ranging from 10% to 37% (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). First, we estimated the contribution rate of
<italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism in the pathogenesis of RTT,
especially in those without detectable <italic>MECP2/CDKL5/FOXG1</italic> pathogenic variants. We found that the pathogenic
MAF could be as low as 6.50% in blood. Such low MAFs cannot be detected with
conventional Sanger sequencing or low-coverage NGS methods, so a more precise and
sensitive method of mosaicism detection is required. Although somatic mosaic
variants detected in blood samples might not directly reflect the corresponding MAF
in the brain, recent quantification by Huang et al. and mathematical modeling by Ye
et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> suggested that mosaic
variants with higher MAFs are more likely to be shared among different tissues.
Thus, postzygotic mosaic variants might exist in the brains of patients with
detectable mosaic variants in the blood. For the remaining patients without
heterozygous or mosaic pathogenic variants, the etiology remains unclear. Therefore,
new causative genes or somatic variants with lower MAFs may be the reason. We plan
to perform genome sequencing on them, hoping to identify new causative genes of
RTT.</p>
<p id="Par35">The rate of somatic mosaic in males (16.7%, 3/18) was significantly
higher than that in females (0.4%, 2/453) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0004492, odds ratio = 43.47 [95% CI 6.33 – inf] by a two-tailed
Fisher’s exact test). Among different studies, 69% (9/13) of reported RTT mosaic
patients were male.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> The application of mosaicism screening had a
significant impact on the genetic diagnosis of RTT males. Therefore, when
encountering male patients with RTT-related phenotypes, <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicism should be seriously taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="Par36">The position p.106Arg was a mosaic hotspot in our cohort. Patient R113,
a boy with the c.317G&gt;A, p.(Arg106Gln) variant (MAF = 6.50%) had a phenotype
milder than those of the other two patients with p.106Arg variants, i.e., female
patient R365 (c.317G&gt;A, p.[Arg106Gln], MAF = 38.08%) and male patient R782
(c.316C&gt;T, p.[Arg106Trp], MAF = 26.32%). Several studies, including ours, have
shown that male patients who had variants causing typical RTT in females usually
presented with severe neonatal encephalopathy and early
death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> Male patients with somatic mosaic variants may
have milder phenotypes in comparison with those of female patients with the same
variants and a heterozygous genotype primarily because of differences between their
MAFs. However, the correlation between MAFs and the severity of the disease, as well
as the minimum threshold of MAFs, requires further investigation in a larger
cohort.</p>
<p id="Par37">Mosaic variant (c.353G&gt;T, p.[Gly118Val]) in patient R734 has not
been reported previously. It is located in a highly conserved methyl-CpG-binding
(MBD) domain region, and it was predicted as damaging by MutationTaster, SIFT, and
PolyPhen-2. The variant might result in abnormal binding between MeCP2 and its
target DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> Therefore, mosaic variant (c.353G&gt;T,
p.[Gly118Val]) was considered to be the pathogenic cause of RTT in this male
patient, although it could be nonpathogenic in females.</p>
<p id="Par38">More than 99% of RTT cases are sporadic, and their pathogenic <italic>MECP2</italic> variants are mainly de novo and of paternal
origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Therefore, we wondered whether paternal
embryonic mosaicism (affecting both somatic and germline tissues) or clonal
expansion (germline-specific) mosaicism is the origin of <italic>MECP2</italic> de novo variants in RTT patients. Germline mosaicism in a
father with two RTT daughters (half-sisters) was first reported by Evans et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> No additional findings about germline mosaicism
in RTT parents were reported thereafter. This study is the first systematic research
assessing paternal germline and somatic mosaicism in RTT families. As a result, no
somatic mosaic variants were identified in the peripheral blood of 74 fathers, but,
notably, germline <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaicisms were
discovered in 5 fathers from 21 families (23.8%, 5/21) with RTT daughters, and the
MAFs ranged from 0.03% to 7.55%. The germline mosaicism rate (5/21, 23.8%) was much
higher than that of somatic mosaicism (0% for 74 fathers and 1.1% (5/471) for
patients). These results indicate that paternal germline-specific mosaicism is an
important, and yet underestimated, source of pathogenic gene variation in RTT
patients.</p>
<p id="Par39">In ten fathers, mDDPCR was performed using samples of blood, saliva,
hair follicle, urine, and semen. For four of the tested fathers, mosaic variants
were found only in the germ cells, indicating that the mosaic variants of these
subjects may have occurred during a later embryonic stage and might be present only
during self-renewal of primordial germ cells. One father also had somatic mosaicisms
in saliva and blood in addition to germline mosaicism, which might have occurred
during early embryonic development before the differentiation of germinal layers.
For this subject, the MAF in germ cells was higher (7.55%) than that in saliva
(0.43%) and blood (0.28%), but the reason for this difference is unknown. It has
been reported that mosaic variants accumulate in paternal germline cells with age
because of constant meiosis and “selfish spermatogonial
selection.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> This type of variant accumulation has been
described in several diseases, including Apert syndrome (caused by <italic>FGFR2</italic> pathogenic variants) and Costello syndrome
(caused by <italic>HRAS</italic> pathogenic
variants).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> An alternative explanation for high germline
mosaicism is that the primordial germ cells of males underwent methylation
reprogramming twice during embryonic development, whereas this process occurred only
once in other tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Therefore, the genomic DNA of sperm is more
unstable than that of other tissues and develops cytidine-to-thymine variation due
to spontaneous deamination of methylated CpG. However, the mechanism underlying the
high rate of germline mosaicism in comparison with other tissues requires further
investigation. The high rate of germline mosaicism observed in this study led us to
reconsider the concept of de novo variants; a large number of de novo variants in
patients might originate from parental germline mosaicisms.</p>
<p id="Par40">One father with germline mosaicism was diagnosed with asthenospermia
(R831F), while one father nearly met the diagnostic criteria for asthenospermia
(R848F, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). Moreover, although almost
all male mice of RTT model strains are infertile, including Mecp2-null (stock no.
003890), Mecp2<sup>T158M</sup> (stock no. 026762),
Mecp2<sup>T158A</sup> (stock no. 004781),
Mecp2<sup>R106W</sup> (stock no. 004781),
Mecp2<sup>R306C</sup> (stock no. 026762),
Mecp2<sup>A140V</sup> (stock no. 016207), and
Mecp2<sup>R168X</sup> (stock no. 006028) (Jackson Laboratory, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/search?q=Mecp2">https://www.jax.org/search?q=Mecp2</ext-link>), the mechanism underlying this phenotype remains unclear. MeCP2 was
reported to be involved in spermatogenesis in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Therefore, we proposed the
hypothesis that the mutant MeCP2 protein destroys the microenvironment of
spermatogenesis. MeCP2 is a very important epigenetic factor that plays crucial
roles in transcriptional activation/silencing for hundreds of genes,
posttranscriptional modifications, chromosome conformation, processing of noncoding
RNA, transposon insertions, and other processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Therefore, even a relatively small change in
MeCP2 might have serious consequences. For example, changes in the microenvironment
of spermatogenesis, including disrupted transposons or abnormal RNA retention, may
lead to abnormal spermatogenesis. Recent studies demonstrated that massive RNA
elimination and inhabitation of transposons are crucial for normal
spermatogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> Comprehensive functional studies are required to
confirm this hypothesis. However, subject R831F has a RTT daughter and a healthy
son, whereas subject R848F has a RTT daughter, which suggests that sperm carrying
<italic>MECP2</italic> variants might have a spermatogonial
selection advantage.</p>
<p id="Par41">The findings of this study indicate that somatic <italic>MECP2</italic> mosaic variants are partially responsible for the
pathogenesis of RTT, especially when they occur in RTT male patients. Identification
of germline mosaicisms in the fathers of RTT girls has important implications for
genetic counseling in RTT families. Finally, germline mosaicisms also reveal
important information about the genetic mechanism underlying the paternal origin
bias of RTT.</p>
