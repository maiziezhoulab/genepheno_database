<abstract>
<p>Sandhoff disease, one of the GM2 gangliosidoses, is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the absence of β-hexosaminidase A and B activity and the concomitant lysosomal accumulation of its substrate, GM2 ganglioside. It features catastrophic neurodegeneration and death in early childhood. How the lysosomal accumulation of ganglioside might affect the early development of the nervous system is not understood. Recently, cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have illuminated early developmental events altered by disease processes. To develop an early neurodevelopmental model of Sandhoff disease, we first generated iPS cells from the fibroblasts of an infantile Sandhoff disease patient, then corrected one of the mutant <italic>HEXB</italic> alleles in those iPS cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, thereby creating isogenic controls. Next, we used the parental Sandhoff disease iPS cells and isogenic <italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected iPS cell clones to generate cerebral organoids that modeled the first trimester of neurodevelopment. The Sandhoff disease organoids, but not the <italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected organoids, accumulated GM2 ganglioside and exhibited increased size and cellular proliferation compared with the <italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected organoids. Whole-transcriptome analysis demonstrated that development was impaired in the Sandhoff disease organoids, suggesting that alterations in neuronal differentiation may occur during early development in the GM2 gangliosidoses.</p>

<body><p>Sandhoff disease, Tay-Sachs disease, and the GM2 activator deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>) are lysosomal storage disorders known as the GM2 gangliosidoses [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>)]. They are rare autosomal recessive conditions caused by mutations in the <italic>HEXB</italic> (Sandhoff disease), <italic>HEXA</italic> (Tay-Sachs disease), or <italic>GM2A</italic> (GM2 activator deficiency) genes. The <italic>HEXA</italic> and <italic>HEXB</italic> genes code for the β-hexosaminidase (β-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase, EC 3.2.1.52) α and β subunits, respectively, which dimerize to form the three isoforms of β-hexosaminidase: A (αβ), B (ββ), and S (αα) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The <italic>GM2A</italic> gene encodes the GM2 activator protein, a GM2 ganglioside-binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Because β-hexosaminidase A, assisted by the GM2 activator protein, initiates the degradation of GM2 ganglioside through removal of the terminal β-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-galactosamine residue, mutations that inactivate any of these three genes result in lysosomal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, typically in the form of lamellar membranous inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Characterization of the infantile Sandhoff disease patient.

Onset occurs by 6 months of age, and death ensues typically at 2–5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p><p>Much of our understanding of the pathogenesis of GM2 gangliosidosis has been uncovered through studies using animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Sandhoff disease (<italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) mice have been the most extensively studied. Like the human infantile patients, the Sandhoff disease mice store abundant GM2 ganglioside in the nervous system, show progressive neurodegeneration, and have a severely shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). During the disease course, neuroinflammation is prominent, with monocytic infiltration and significant gliosis. Late in the disease, neuronal death occurs by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Whereas the acute neurodegenerative manifestations of the disease are believed to be primarily the result of postnatal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), studies with murine progenitor cells have suggested the possibility that ganglioside storage might also alter neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), raising the possibility that neurodevelopmental defects may also occur in GM2 gangliosidosis patients.</p><p>Little is known about early brain development in the GM2 gangliosidoses because of the general inaccessibility of human fetal tissue for study. However, probing human disease progression during development is now possible with the reprogramming of patient-derived somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and their further differentiation into cerebral organoids; three-dimensional cell-culture models of early brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). These systems recapitulate the complex cellular behaviors of the developing brain, allowing for the study of fundamental neurodevelopmental mechanisms, such as growth and differentiation, and how they may be altered by disease.</p><p>To investigate whether lysosomal β-hexosaminidase deficiency affects early neurodevelopment, we derived iPS cells from the fibroblasts of an infantile Sandhoff disease patient. In addition, we generated isogenic iPS cells in which we corrected the disease-causing <italic>HEXB</italic> mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We then used the Sandhoff disease and control <italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected iPS cells to generate cerebral organoids. We found that the gene expression profile of the cerebral organoids mirrored that observed in fetal neurodevelopment during the first trimester of pregnancy. The Sandhoff disease organoids, which accumulated GM2 ganglioside, exhibited an enlarged size with increased cellular proliferation, and a gene expression pattern indicating impaired differentiation, when compared with isogenic <italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected organoids. Our results suggest that, in addition to its devastating postnatal effects, lysosomal β-hexosaminidase deficiency may alter early neurodevelopmental processes.</p><sec sec-type="materials and methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sandhoff disease infantile patient</title><p>The Sandhoff disease patient included in this study was enrolled in National Institutes of Health protocol 02-HG-0107, “The Natural History of Patients with Glycosphingolipid Storage Disorders,” with parental consent. All studies involving human subjects were approved by the appropriate review board and abide by the Declaration of Helsinki principles. The patient, a female child of Western European ancestry, was diagnosed by examination of urine oligosaccharide and glycan profiles, and finally by sequencing of the <italic>HEXB</italic> gene from blood leukocyte DNA. During infancy, she developed seizures and neuromuscular weakness and died at 4 years of age. The patient exhibited the characteristic macrocephaly (referring to head circumference size exceeding the 98th percentile value for normal growth for age and gender) that is typical for GM2 gangliosidosis infantile patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Her head circumference measured 55.5 cm at 24 months of age.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Human primary fibroblasts were established from a skin biopsy of the patient and were grown in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, South Logan, UT). Control fibroblasts were derived from a normal donor skin biopsy.</p><p>To generate patient-derived iPS cells, skin fibroblasts from the Sandhoff disease patient were reprogrammed by transfection with episomal vectors encoding the four reprogramming factors, OCT-3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and L-MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) (Applied StemCell, Milpitas, CA). The cloned Sandhoff disease iPS cells had a normal karyotype, exhibited the pluripotent markers characteristic of human stem cells (OCT4, SOX2, and SSEA-4), and were able to form embryoid bodies that differentiated into the three embryonic germ layers. The Sandhoff disease iPS cells were grown in serum-free feeder-free culture conditions on Matrigel-coated (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) wells in mTeSR1 medium (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada).</p><p>Control normal iPS cells were purchased from Alstem (Richmond, CA; catalog number iPS11). They are a footprint-free human iPS cell line derived from normal human foreskin fibroblasts by ectopic expression of <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>KLF4</italic>, and <italic>MYCL</italic> genes using episomal plasmids.</p></sec><sec><title>Creation of isogenic control (<italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected) iPS cells</title><p>To create isogenic control iPS cells, we first corrected the intron 10 acceptor splice-site mutation in one of the Sandhoff disease patient’s <italic>HEXB</italic> alleles in the parental Sandhoff disease iPS cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). We designed a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) containing a 20 bp target sequence corresponding to the 3′ end of intron 10 and the 5′ portion of exon 11 of the human <italic>HEXB</italic> gene, 5′ GTAACGTTAATGGCTTGCGC 3′, which was followed by a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, NGG. The sgRNA forward (5′ GTAACGTTAATGGCTTGCGC 3′) and reverse (5′ GCGCAAGCCATTAACGTTAC 3′) sequence oligonucleotides were annealed, phosphorylated, and subcloned into the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) to create the SD/pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro plasmid. pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #48139; Addgene, Cambridge, MA). To correct the mutant sequence, a single-stranded 181-base repair oligodeoxynucleotide containing a G→A correction for the mutation in one of the patient’s <italic>HEXB</italic> alleles, and 90 bases of homologous sequence flanking each side of the correction were designed: 5′ AAATTATGTTCCTAGTAATAATGCCTTAAACTTTCAATTT­CATCTACTGTTCTAGGCCTAATAATATGTATTGCAATTTGT­AACGTTAATAGCTTGCGCCAGGTACCATAGTTGAAGTATGGAAAGACAGCGCATATCCTGAGGAACTCAGTAGAGTCACA­GCATCTGGCTTCCCTGTAAT 3′. The repair oligodeoxynucleotide also contained a silent point mutation, which would disrupt the <italic>HEXB</italic> target PAM sequence and prevent Cas9 recutting, as well as two additional silent point mutations to create a KpnI restriction enzyme site for screening.</p><p>Patient-derived iPS cells were then transfected using the human stem cell Nucleofector Kit 1 (Lonza, Rockville, MD) to deliver 20 μg of the SD/pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro plasmid and 100 pmol of the repair oligodeoxynucleotide. After 48 h, transfected iPS cells were treated with puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 48 h. After selection, iPS cells were grown in mTeSR1 until the colonies were large enough for hand-picking. Single colonies were grown individually and expanded for analysis (recovery of β-hexosaminidase activity and sequence confirmation).</p><p>For sequencing, the region in the <italic>HEXB</italic> gene containing the acceptor splice-site mutation was amplified by PCR using the flanking primers 5′ CAAACCTAAGGTTGATGAAAC 3′ and 5′ GTTTCATCAACCTTAGGTTTG 3′. The following conditions were used: denaturation 94°C for 1 min, amplification 58°C for 1 min, and extension 72°C for 1 min (40 cycles). The nonedited fragment was 453 bp in length. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the pCR 4-TOPO vector (TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequenced using the T3 primer.</p><p>Potential off-target regions for the sgRNA were predicted with the Optimized CRISPR Design website (crispr.mit.edu) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and amplified in the <italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected iPS cell clones using the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The following conditions were used for the five primer sets: denaturation 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min (40 cycles). PCR fragments were sequenced using the corresponding forward primer.</p></sec><sec><title>β-Hexosaminidase assays</title><p>iPS cell lysates or human fibroblasts prepared in 0.1 M citric buffer (pH 4.2) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 were assayed for β-hexosaminidase activity with 4-methylumbelliferyl <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Values were normalized using β-galactosidase activity and measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-galactopyranose (Sigma-Aldrich) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Activity was calculated as β-hexosaminidase activity normalized by β-galactosidase activity per minute and expressed as percentage of control cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of cerebral organoids from iPS cells</title><p>Cerebral organoids were generated using parental Sandhoff disease iPS cells and <italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected iPS cells according to the protocol designed by Lancaster and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), with the following modification on embryo body formation. Embryo bodies were generated on AggreWell 400 plates (StemCell Technologies) in AggreWell medium (StemCell Technologies) and maintained in AggreWell medium until neural induction on day 5 of culture. Cerebral organoids were grown in suspension in 125 ml spinner flasks on a low-speed microstirrer (Wheaton, Millville, NJ) at 25 rpm in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> tissue-culture incubator for up to 14 weeks, and harvested at indicated time points for analysis.</p><p>Organoid size was analyzed by determining perimeter of the individual organoids from digital images taken of the organoids at week 4 and week 10 using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).</p></sec><sec><title>Histological analysis of cerebral organoids</title><p>Organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4°C, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C in 30% sucrose in 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Thermo Fisher Scientific), frozen, and later sectioned for ganglioside immunodetection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Frozen sections were warmed to room temperature, air-dried for 10 min, fixed in cold acetone for 10 min at −20°C, and again air-dried. After PBS rehydration, sections were incubated with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with one of the following antibodies for 1 h at room temperature: anti-neuronal β3 tubulin monoclonal antibody clone TUJ1 (mouse IgG, catalog number 801201; BioLegend, San Diego, CA); anti-ganglioside GM2 monoclonal antibody, clone MK1-16 (mouse IgM, catalog number A2576; TCI, Tokyo, Japan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>); anti-ganglioside GD3, clone R24 (mouse monoclonal IgG3, catalog number ab11779; Abcam, Cambridge, MA); anti-galactosylceramide, clone mGalC (mouse monoclonal IgG3, catalog number MAB342; Sigma-Aldrich); anti-myelin basic protein (rabbit polyclonal IgG, catalog number AB5864; Sigma-Aldrich). After three washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-mouse IgM (catalog number A21042; Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific), Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-mouse IgM (catalog number 21044; Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific), or Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-mouse IgG (catalog number A11032; Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cryosections were mounted for microscopy on glass coverslips using Fluoroshield mounting medium with DNA-binding dye, DAPI (Abcam). Antibody-stained sections were examined using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 780; Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) and images were acquired using the Zen 2012 software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Average expression of GM2, GD3, galactosylceramide, and myelin basic protein was determined by the quantification of the fluorescence intensity of the anti-GM2 antibody corresponding to an entire organoid section using ImageJ software, normalized with the fluorescence intensity of DAPI for the same section. For cholera toxin B subunit staining, frozen organoid sections were fixed in cold acetone for 10 min at −20°C, air-dried, blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated with FITC-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min at room temperature. Fluorescence-stained sections were mounted and examined on a confocal laser-scanning microscope as described above. Cholera toxin B subunit staining fluorescence intensity was quantified as described above.</p><p>Cell proliferation within organoid sections was determined by labeling with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 4 h in culture. The cells that incorporated BrdU were detected using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-BrdU antibody (A23210; Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Fluorescently stained sections were mounted and examined on a confocal laser-scanning microscope as described above. Ten fields per organoid section were examined, and the percentage of BrdU<sup>+</sup> DAPI<sup>+</sup> nuclei was quantified. Similarly, proliferation of Sandhoff and <italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected iPS cells was determined by incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 4 h in culture. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4°C. EdU-labeled iPS cells were detected using the Click-iT Plus EdU kit (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s manual. Fluorescently stained samples were mounted and examined on a confocal laser-scanning microscope as described above.

A simple screen, based on the enzymatic detection of recovered β-hexosaminidase activity, was devised that facilitated identification of correctly edited Sandhoff disease iPS cells, which were confirmed by sequencing. This enzymatic activity-based screening procedure may be a useful adjunct for the genetic editing of iPS cells for other lysosomal storage or metabolic diseases in which enzyme deficiencies are present and easily determined.</p><p>The three-dimensional organoid model that was utilized mimicked neuronal differentiation processes occurring during fetal development in human cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Cerebral organoids have been used previously for modeling normal and pathological development in a variety of contexts, including microcephaly, autism, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). The Sandhoff disease cerebral organoids generated in this report stored increased amounts of GM2 ganglioside beginning at 4 weeks, which progressively increased with time in culture. Gene expression profiling suggested that the organoids at 8 weeks of culture were developmentally similar to 8–16 weeks postconception human fetal cerebral cortex. Lipid storage in the brains of fetuses affected with GM2 gangliosidosis has been noted as early as the first trimester of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>), in accordance with the results obtained here with cerebral organoids.</p><p>Cerebral organoids have been shown to mimic clinical conditions of abnormal head size in infancy and childhood, including microcephaly, in patients with <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and Zika infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and megacephaly, in autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The Sandhoff disease patient from whom the iPS cells were derived for this study exhibited megalencephaly, a general feature of GM2 gangliosidosis patients. The Sandhoff disease organoids were significantly larger in size than the isogenic <italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected organoids and the Sandhoff disease organoids injected with AAV-<italic>HEXA/B</italic> evoking a megalencephalic-like condition. It is unclear whether the abnormally increased cellular proliferation detected in the Sandhoff disease organoids substantially contributes to the GM2 gangliosidosis-associated megalencephaly in patients; however, if the proliferative defect extended into the postnatal period, it could be clinically impactful. Further studies will be required to clarify whether there is a causal relationship between the increased proliferation within the Sandhoff organoids and the clinical finding of megalencephaly in the GM2 gangliosidoses.</p><p>Transcript profiling indicated that pathways involved in neuronal differentiation and central nervous system development were altered in the cerebral organoids derived from the Sandhoff disease iPS cells compared with those generated from the isogenic <italic>HEXB</italic>-corrected controls. Strikingly, correction of the <italic>HEXB</italic> mutation and restoration of β-hexosaminidase activity upregulated several key transcription factor genes involved in neuron morphogenesis and central nervous system development. These findings suggest that neuronal differentiation is impeded in Sandhoff disease, and are in accordance with work in the Sandhoff disease mouse model that showed progenitor cells with lysosomal β-hexosaminidase deficiency exhibited impaired neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The elevated expression of GD3 ganglioside observed in the Sandhoff disease organoids is also consistent with reduced neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p><p>How the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase deficiency causes abnormal cellular proliferation and neuronal differentiation of cerebral organoids is not known. However, glycosphingolipids, which are substantially increased in the GM2 gangliosidoses, are known to influence growth and differentiation of cells in a variety of experimental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). The accrual of gangliosides can directly promote neural stem cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>) and has been implicated in neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). A variety of mechanisms have been described for the influence of gangliosides on cell behaviors, including direct modulation of signaling receptors and mediation of cell-cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>). Interestingly, lysosomal storage in cells from a related disorder, GM1 gangliosidosis, activates mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>), which is a pathway directly linked to cellular proliferation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a substrate of β-hexosamindase other than GM2 ganglioside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>) may influence cellular proliferation and differentiation within cerebral organoids.</p><p>Early neurodevelopmental processes are believed to have little impact on the major acute symptoms of Sandhoff disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). This conclusion was reached using an inducible adult mouse model of <italic>Hexb</italic> deficiency whose disease severity was indistinguishable from a germline deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Indeed, within the Sandhoff disease organoids, we did not observe an elevation of apoptosis, which is a major factor in the terminal neurodegenerative disease course. However, the results revealing an altered proliferation and neuronal differentiation status exhibited by the Sandhoff disease organoids raise the possibility of more subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities that might be masked by the severe stereotypical features of the GM2 gangliosidoses.</p><p>The three-dimensional cerebral organoid model of Sandhoff disease provides a new means to study the early developmental consequences of lysosomal ganglioside storage within a human context. Using this paradigm, alterations in fundamental cellular behaviors, proliferation and neuronal differentiation, were identified, which raise the possibility that they could impact fetal brain development in GM2 gangliosidosis patients. While perhaps not contributing to acute neurodegeneration, they may be consequential when treatments are eventually devised to reverse enzyme deficiencies postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>).</p></sec>
