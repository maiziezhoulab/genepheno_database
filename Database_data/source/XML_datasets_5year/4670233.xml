<abstract>
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent inherited form of mental retardation. The cause for this X-linked disorder is the silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<italic>fmr1</italic>) gene and the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (Fmrp). The RNA-binding protein Fmrp represses protein translation, particularly in synapses. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Fmrp interacts with the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (Adar) enzymes. Adar enzymes convert adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) and modify the sequence of RNA transcripts. Utilizing the <italic>fmr1</italic> zebrafish mutant (<italic>fmr1</italic>-/-), we studied Fmrp-dependent neuronal circuit formation, behavior, and Adar-mediated RNA editing. By combining behavior analyses and live imaging of single axons and synapses, we showed hyperlocomotor activity, as well as increased axonal branching and synaptic density, in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae. We identified thousands of clustered RNA editing sites in the zebrafish transcriptome and showed that Fmrp biochemically interacts with the Adar2a protein. The expression levels of the <italic>adar</italic> genes and Adar2 protein increased in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- zebrafish. Microfluidic-based multiplex PCR coupled with deep sequencing showed a mild increase in A-to-I RNA editing levels in evolutionarily conserved neuronal and synaptic Adar-targets in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae. These findings suggest that loss of Fmrp results in increased Adar-mediated RNA editing activity on target-specific RNAs, which, in turn, might alter neuronal circuit formation and behavior in FXS.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The most frequent inherited mental retardation disorder is fragile X syndrome, which is characterized by learning disabilities, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and hyperactive behavior. The genetic cause of this disorder is the silencing of the <italic>fmr1</italic> gene, which encodes the RNA-binding protein Fmrp. This protein inhibits the production of various proteins in the brain and interacts with the Adar enzyme, which converts the nucleotide A into I in RNAs. However, it is unclear by which mechanism the loss of Fmrp affects the sequence of neuronal genes and, ultimately, brain function. Here, we used the <italic>fmr1</italic> mutant zebrafish (<italic>fmr1</italic>-/-), which enables high-throughput genetics and live imaging experiments in a transparent and evolutionarily conserved brain. We found that loss of Fmrp altered neuronal circuit formation. Furthermore, similar to human patients, the <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae were hyperactive. Biochemical assays showed that Fmrp interacts with the Adar2a protein, which is increased in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae. Thus, we characterized global RNA editing in the zebrafish transcriptome and used a microfluidic-based high-throughput technique to accurately quantify RNA editing levels. Loss of Fmrp resulted in a mild increase in RNA editing in the coding sequences of conserved synaptic genes. These findings propose that altered RNA editing levels may affect neuronal and behavioral deficiencies in FXS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common single-gene inherited neurodevelopmental disorder causing mental retardation. This disorder is characterized by an array of behavioral and cognitive disabilities, including autism, anxiety, epileptic seizures, hyperactivity, attention deficits, and mild craniofacial abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref002">2</xref>]. The cause for FXS is a genetic loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (Fmrp) due to transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<italic>fmr1</italic>) gene. In the 5'-untranslated region (5’-UTR) of <italic>fmr1</italic>, an expansion of more than 200 CGG trinucleotide repeats results in abnormal DNA hypermethylation and diminished mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref003">3</xref>]. Fmrp is predominately a cytoplasmic protein and consists of two ribonucleoprotein K homology (KH) domains and a GAR/RGG (glycine-arginine-rich) box. It is an RNA-binding protein that is essential for the function of the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref004">4</xref>] (CNS). In neurons, it regulates neurite transport of a subset of mRNAs and inhibits protein translation by blocking both initiation and elongation. In synapses, upon metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) stimulation, the translation of Fmrp-targeted mRNAs is inhibited, allowing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor trafficking and synaptic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref003">3</xref>]. Recent findings showed that Fmrp also affects other aspects of post-transcriptional gene regulation, including the stability of certain transcripts, activity-dependent mRNA transport, and RNA interference pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref005">5</xref>]. Thus, Fmrp regulates the translation and trafficking of synaptic proteins, and subsequently affects synaptic plasticity and brain function.</p>
<p>The structure and sequence of the <italic>fmr1</italic> gene is conserved from invertebrates to mammals, allowing the development of various animal models to study the mechanism of the syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref010">10</xref>]. <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) and conditional KO mice mimics the typical characteristics of FXS patients, including molecular, electrophysiological, neurological, and behavioral defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref011">11</xref>]. The imaging of KO mice brains revealed structural abnormalities of dendritic spines and changes in synaptic protein distribution that affect synaptic formation and plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref012">12</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, several <italic>fmr1</italic> mutants demonstrated an array of behavioral and developmental defects. As in the case of mammals, the morphology and connectivity of the synapses were altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition to the mouse and fly models, a zebrafish <italic>fmr1</italic> mutant (<italic>fmr1</italic>-/-) model for FXS was established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref006">6</xref>]. The zebrafish is a transparent vertebrate that is suitable for genetic manipulations and live imaging of a simple and evolutionarily conserved CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref015">15</xref>]. Consistent with the expression pattern of <italic>fmr1</italic> orthologs in mammals, <italic>fmr1</italic> expression in zebrafish is enriched in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref016">16</xref>]. Although an apparent phenotype was not observed in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref006">6</xref>], adult <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- zebrafish demonstrated hyperlocomotor activity, impaired anxiety, and altered learning behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref018">18</xref>]. Furthermore, reduced long-term potentiation and enhanced long-term depression was found in the telencephalon of adult <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- zebrafish, indicating deficient synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref018">18</xref>]. Thus, accumulating evidence points to a specific role of Fmrp in regulating synaptic proteins that mediate the structure and activity of neuronal circuits; however, the molecular mechanisms of this process remain unclear.</p>
<p>An intriguing mechanism that may be involved in FXS is adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. In drosophila, dFMR1 interacts and modulates the activity of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (Adar) enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref013">13</xref>]. Adar acts on double-stranded pre-mRNA structures and deaminates A into I, which is recognized by the cell’s splicing and translational machineries as an equivalent to guanosine (‘G’), thus the A-to-G recoding process alters the mRNA coding sequences and enhances protein diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref019">19</xref>]. In addition, RNA editing can affect alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref020">20</xref>] as well as RNA expression and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref021">21</xref>], and Adar is a negative regulator of circular RNA (circRNA) formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref022">22</xref>]. Notably, deficient Adar can cause severe neurological defects or lethality in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref025">25</xref>]. Furthermore, key Adar target-sites are found in synaptic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref026">26</xref>], and functional studies have shown that mild alterations in RNA editing levels in AMPA receptor subunits (GluRs) affect channel activity and synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref027">27</xref>]. However, although Adar-mediated RNA editing is linked to neurological alterations, the significance of this process in neurological disorders, such as FXS, and the global Fmrp-Adar mediated effect on the transcriptome, particularly neurological genes, are unclear. Here, the live imaging of neurites and synapses, as well as the video tracking of behavior, revealed abnormalities in neuronal circuit formation and locomotor activity in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae. Furthermore, thousands of clustered RNA editing sites were identified in the zebrafish transcriptome, and an interaction between Fmrp and Adar was determined. These findings, in addition to high-throughput microfluidic RNA editing quantification, suggest that RNA editing plays a role in the mechanisms that mediate neuronal circuit formation and behavior in FXS.</p>

<title>Increased expression of the Fmrp target protein, mTor, is evolutionarily conserved in zebrafish</title>
<p>The RNA-binding protein Fmrp regulates the expression levels of a specific set of target proteins in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref028">28</xref>]. Since an apparent morphological phenotype was not previously detected in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- zebrafish larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref006">6</xref>](<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and in order to verify that the function of Fmrp in zebrafish is conserved with mammals, we sought to test the expression levels of three Fmrp target genes, <italic>mtor</italic>, <italic>sash1</italic>, and <italic>talin1</italic>, which showed elevated protein expression levels in FXS human brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref028">28</xref>]. mTor plays a key role in controlling protein homeostasis, cell survival, and synaptic density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref030">30</xref>]. Sash1 is a member of the SLY family of signal adaptor proteins, and is essential in intracellular signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref031">31</xref>]. Talin1 acts as an integrin-binding cytoplasmic adaptor that is a central organizer of focal adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref032">32</xref>]. To characterize the spatial expression pattern of <italic>mtor</italic>, <italic>sash1</italic>, and <italic>talin1</italic> in zebrafish larvae, whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) was used. Similar to <italic>fmr1</italic>, all three genes were widely expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref>). In order to quantify the expression levels of these genes, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed in 6 days post fertilization (dpf) <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and wild-type (WT) larvae. The mRNA levels of <italic>mtor</italic> and <italic>sash1</italic> increased by approximately 2.5- and 2-fold, respectively, in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- compared with WT larvae [<italic>mtor</italic> (WT = 1.03428, <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- = 2.73493), <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <italic>sash1</italic> (WT = 1.0617, <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- = 2.1338), <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g001">Fig 1E</xref>]. These results show that loss of Fmrp results in elevated mRNA levels of target genes. Since <italic>mtor</italic> showed the highest increase in mRNA expression levels, we monitored its protein levels, specifically in the brain of <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT zebrafish. Western blot analysis revealed an increase in mTor (250 kDa) protein levels in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- compared with WT brains, while the protein levels of actin (43 kDa) were similar in both genotypes. Thus, similar to the case of mammals, the loss of Fmrp increases the expression levels of the mTor protein. Taking into account previous characterizations of physiological and behavioral deficiencies in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref018">18</xref>], these results further establish the <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae as a valid model for the study of the genetic and neurological mechanisms of FXS.</p>

<title>Hyperlocomotor activity in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae</title>
<p>In the absence of Fmrp, FXS patients demonstrate hyperactivity, reduced anxiety-related behavior, and memory deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref002">2</xref>]. Similarly, hyperlocomotor activity was observed in <italic>fmr1</italic> KO mice and <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref018">18</xref>]. To monitor locomotor activity in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae, high-throughput behavioral systems were used. Larvae were kept under light/dark conditions (LD, light 14 h: dark 10 h), and the rhythmic activity of 6 dpf <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- (<italic>n</italic> = 34) and WT (<italic>n</italic> = 30) larvae was monitored during the day and night. While both genotypes exhibited rhythmic locomotor activity that peaked during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae exhibited a 36% and 37% increase in locomotor activity during both day (WT = 6.961 cm/min, <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- = 9.483 cm/min, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and night (WT = 6.499 cm/min, <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- = 8.888 cm/min, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These results indicate overall hyperlocomotor activity in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae, establishing that <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larval behavior complies with the typically observed FXS phenotype. The response of <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae to light and dark transition states was tested by exposing 6 dpf larvae to three cycles of alternating 30 min periods of light and dark during the day. The larvae responded to light and dark transitions with robust changes in locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Notably, during the light period, <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae increased their locomotor activity by 28% compared with WT larvae (WT, n = 177, 10.410 cm/min; <italic>fmr1</italic>-/-, n = 179, 13.358 cm/min; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), confirming that loss of Fmrp results in hyperlocomotor activity. Furthermore, behavioral analysis during the light-to-dark and dark-to-light transitions (comparing activity 5 min before and 5 min after the transition state) showed that while the response to dark stimuli was unaffected, the <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larval response to light stimuli was adverse to that of the WT larvae. Notably, this tendency was repeated in all three light/dark cycles. Altogether, these results show hyperlocomotor activity and altered behavioral response to light stimuli in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae. These findings suggest that the loss of Fmrp affects locomotor activity, possibly due to the misregulation of synaptic proteins by Fmrp.</p>

<title>Increased axon branching and synaptic density in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae</title>
<p>In the absence of an adequately functioning Fmrp, human FXS patients demonstrate severe cognitive and behavioral deficiencies. Taking into account these symptoms and the hyperlocomotor activity found in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae, we sought to resolve whether axon morphology and structural synaptic density of cholinergic motor neurons are affected in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- live larvae. The <italic>mnx1X3</italic> enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref033">33</xref>] was used to fluorescently label motor neurons. The constructs <italic>mnx1X3</italic>:<italic>GAL4</italic> and <italic>uas</italic>:<italic>memYFP</italic> were co-injected into one-cell-stage <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT embryos. At 2 dpf, <italic>mnx1X3</italic>:<italic>GAL4</italic>/<italic>uas</italic>:<italic>mem</italic>:<italic>YFP</italic> positive embryos were sorted out and single motor neurons were imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Image analysis revealed that the total length of the axon arbors and the number of branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>) increased by 59% and 120%, respectively, in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- compared with WT larvae (WT; n = 17, 208.050 μm, 6.823 branches; <italic>fmr1</italic>-/-; n = 27, 331.034 μm, 15 branches; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). These results suggest that Fmrp acts to stabilize hyper-axon arborization in motor neurons. Since synaptogenesis guides the growth and branching of axonal arbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref034">34</xref>], the increased axon branching in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae could attest to a deficiency in the number and distribution of synapses. Therefore, the <italic>mnx1X3</italic>:<italic>GAL4</italic>, <italic>uas</italic>:<italic>SYP-EGFP</italic>, and <italic>uas</italic>:<italic>tRFP</italic> constructs were co-injected into <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT embryos. At 2 dpf, synapse density was quantified by assessing the number of puncta along the axonal arbor of single motor neurons in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g003">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>). We found an increase of 53% (WT, n = 11, 0.490 puncta/micron; <italic>fmr1</italic>-/-, n = 17, 0.752 puncta/micron; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g003">Fig 3H</xref>) in synaptic density in <italic>mnx1X3</italic>:<italic>GAL4</italic>/<italic>uas</italic>:<italic>tRFP/uas</italic>:<italic>SYP-EGFP</italic>/<italic>fmr1</italic>-/- compared with <italic>mnx1X3</italic>:<italic>GAL4</italic>/<italic>uas</italic>:<italic>tRFP/uas</italic>:<italic>SYP-EGFP</italic>/WT embryos. These results show that loss of Fmrp increases total synaptic density in the axons of spinal motor neurons. Given that Fmrp is an inhibitor of synaptic protein translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref035">35</xref>], these findings suggest that Fmrp-dependent inhibition of synaptic proteins regulates axonal arborization and structural synaptic changes in cholinergic motor neurons.</p>

<p>The hyperlocomotor activity and disrupted behavioral response to dark-to-light transition states in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae, coupled with the broad expression of the <italic>fmr1</italic> gene, suggest that deficiencies in neuronal circuit formation are not restricted to motor neurons and may also be present in sensory neurons. In relatively early stages of zebrafish development, Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory neurons are the primary sensory spinal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref036">36</xref>]. They are located in the dorsal spinal cord and project axons toward broad areas in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref037">37</xref>]. In order to test the role of Fmrp in RB axons, we imaged single RB neurons using the <italic>huc</italic> pan-neural promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref039">39</xref>] in live embryos. The constructs <italic>huc</italic>:<italic>GAL4</italic> and <italic>uas</italic>:<italic>memYFP</italic> were transiently expressed in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT embryos and, at 2 dpf, positive embryos were sorted out and imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g003">Fig 3I and 3J</xref>). We found that total arbor length and the number of branches increased by 73% and 92%, respectively, in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- compared with WT embryos (WT, n = 9, 979.365 puncta/micron, 26.333 branches; <italic>fmr1</italic>-/-, n = 10, 1694.455 puncta/micron, 50.7 branches; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g003">Fig 3K and 3L</xref>). To quantify the number of synapses in live embryos, the <italic>huc</italic>:<italic>GAL4</italic>, <italic>uas</italic>:<italic>SYP-EGFP</italic>, and <italic>uas</italic>:<italic>tRFP</italic> constructs were co-injected into <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT one-cell-stage embryos.

Imaging of synapses in these neurons revealed that synaptic density did not vary between <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT larvae. These results show that Fmrp regulates axon branching in RB neurons that mediate sensory response.</p>
<p>Since Fmrp is widely expressed in the brain and spinal cord, and mGluR activation regulates Fmrp function, we tested whether loss of Fmrp affects structural synaptic density in glutamatergic neurons. We monitored synapse density in the glutamatergic hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) neurons. These hypothalamic neurons innervate downstream glutamatergic nuclei, such as the locus coeruleus, and regulate feeding, reward, sleep, and wake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref040">40</xref>]. The <italic>hcrt</italic> promotor was used to fluorescently label Hcrt axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref014">14</xref>]. The construct <italic>hcrt</italic>:<italic>SYP-EGFP</italic> was injected into one-cell-stage <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT embryos. At 2 dpf, <italic>hcrt</italic>:<italic>SYP-EGFP</italic> positive embryos were sorted out and single axons, projecting dorsocaudally toward the spinal cord, were imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g003">Fig 3P–3R</xref>). Image analysis of an <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- embryo revealed a 30% increase in synaptic density compared with a WT embryo (WT, n = 8, 0.1875 puncta/micron; <italic>fmr1</italic>-/-, n = 9, 0.2444 puncta/micron; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g003">Fig 3S</xref>). Altogether, these results show that loss of Fmrp increases synapse density along the axons of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons in the brain and spinal cord.</p>

<title>Fmrp-Adar interactions</title>
<p>The mechanism by which the RNA binding protein Fmrp regulates axonal and synaptic structural changes in zebrafish is unclear. Recent findings on Drosophila showed that Fmrp modulates Adar enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref013">13</xref>], which, in turn, serves as a modulator of neuronal excitability and function as well as gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref041">41</xref>]. Since Adar-mediated A-to-I editing was shown to affect the function of synaptic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref042">42</xref>], we hypothesized that Adar expression and activity will be altered in fmr1-/- larvae. Initially, we sought to genomically characterize the zebrafish Adar family members. The Adar enzymes are highly conserved in metazoans, although the number of genes and isoforms varies between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref043">43</xref>]. Mammalian genomes encode three Adars: Adar and Adarb1 (Adar1 and Adar2, respectively) which are both catalytically active, and Adarb2 (Adar3), which is considered to be catalytically inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref044">44</xref>]. An alternative promotor at the amino terminus of human Adar1 leads to the formation of two defined isoforms, commonly known as Adar1-p150 and Adar1-p110. While Adar1-p150 is localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the shorter Adar1-p110 isoform is constitutively active and localized mainly in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref045">45</xref>]. Genomic analysis revealed that the zebrafish genome encodes four adar genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref046">46</xref>]. A phylogenetic reconstruction of the zebrafish and human Adar protein sequences revealed that zebrafish Adar proteins converge into three distinct clusters and that human Adar2 has two zebrafish orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Notably, all zebrafish Adar enzymes share common domain architecture consisting of a variable number of amino-terminal dsRBDs and a carboxy-terminal catalytic deaminase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To determine the spatial expression of adar genes, we performed whole-mount ISH in WT zebrafish. At 2 dpf, all adars were primarily expressed in the brain and spinal cord, while at 6 dpf, adar transcripts were strongly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4C–4R</xref>).</p>

<p>Although evidence of an interaction between Fmrp and Adar has been shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref013">13</xref>], it is not known if these proteins associate in vertebrates. To explore the biochemical interaction between Fmrp and Adar2a proteins, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was performed. HEK293T cells were transfected with constructs that expressed the zebrafish Adar2a and Fmrp proteins tagged with EGFP and MYC, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4S</xref>). Extracts from HEK293T cells expressing EGFP-Adar2a and MYC-Fmrp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4T</xref>) were used for actin, MYC, and EGFP pulldowns, and eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4S</xref>). We found that Fmrp was purified with Adar2a and vice versa. In contrast, actin did not pull down nor purify with either Fmrp or Adar2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4S</xref>). These results indicate that zebrafish Fmrp and Adar2a proteins interact. Intriguingly, loss of Fmrp in FXS may affect the expression levels of Adar mRNA and protein. Previous work showed that FMRP can bind to many mRNA sequences via two major RNA recognition elements (RREs, conserved sequences: ACUK and WGGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref049">49</xref>]. Specifically, 75 RRE sequences were mapped to <italic>adar1</italic> [47 in coding sequences (CDS) and 28 in 3’-UTR] and 4 sequences were mapped to <italic>adar2</italic> (2 in CDS and 2 in 3’-UTR). Using computational sequence homology, we searched for RREs in the CDS of zebrafish <italic>adar1</italic> and <italic>adar2</italic> genes. We found 42 sequences that exhibit 100% homology between the two species. Of them, 40 sequences were mapped to the CDS of <italic>adar1</italic>, and 2 sequences were mapped to the CDS of <italic>adar2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4U</xref>). Thus, we determined whether Fmrp binds to <italic>adar1</italic> mRNA using RNA immunoprecipitation assays. HEK293T cells were transfected with the zebrafish MYC-Fmrp, and anti-MYC as well as anti-Actin antibodies were used to pull down specific protein-mRNA complexes. Following total RNA extraction from the cells, cDNA was amplified and <italic>adar1</italic> was identified in cells precipitated with an anti-MYC antibody but not in cells precipitated with an anti-Actin antibody. These results show that Fmrp protein can bind <italic>adar1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4V</xref>). In order to quantify the effect of Fmrp on <italic>adar</italic> mRNA expression levels, a qRT-PCR was performed in 6 dpf <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT larvae. All four <italic>adar</italic> genes showed increased expression levels in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae compared with WT larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4W</xref>).

<title>Transcriptome sequence analysis uncovers a multitude of hyperedited (HE) RNA sites in zebrafish</title>
<p>The location of known RNA editing sites in zebrafish is limited to a handful of sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref051">51</xref>]. To study whether RNA editing is altered in FXS, we initially assessed the global extent of RNA editing in zebrafish by analyzing transcriptome data. We probed RNA-seq datasets consisting of ~1.8Gb, strand-specific, 76-bp paired-end reads from a developmental study that contained 17 samples covering 8 different developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref052">52</xref>] (GSE32898). RNA-seq data were analyzed by a bioinformatic pipeline aimed at detecting dense clusters of HE RNA sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref053">53</xref>]. This approach is most suitable for detecting editing in cases lacking genomic information derived from the same sample. A total of approximately 350,000 DNA-RNA mismatches were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s003">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s004">S2</xref> Tables). We calculated the prevalence of all possible 12 DNA nucleotide substitutions and found massive A-to-G mismatch enrichment (93%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s003">S1 Table</xref>) in intergenic regions, introns, UTRs, and CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). This large enrichment strongly suggests that these substitutions are the result of Adar activity. Next, we examined whether the nucleotide sequence context of the detected RNA editing sites complies with the sequence motif typical of Adar targets. Mammalian Adar1 and Adar2 enzymes have an apparent preference for RNA uracil (‘U’) at position -1 located 5’ to the editing target site, while guanine (‘G’) is the least constructive option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref054">54</xref>]. Analyzing the sequence of adjacent zebrafish, HE sites revealed that, as in the case of mammals, ‘G’ is the underrepresented nucleotide at position -1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Since this position was shown to be imperative for RNA editing, our finding supports that the A-to-G mismatches are RNA editing sites. Further analysis of the genomic locations of the editing sites in humans and zebrafish revealed that the majority of the clustered sites (76%) are located in repeat sequences, mainly rich intergenic regions. Of these, we found that over 25% of all editing sites are located in the DNA hAT repeat family, which occupies about 8% of the zebrafish genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Using the <italic>mfold</italic> tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref055">55</xref>], we illustrated that both members of the hAT repeat family, ANGEL and TDR19, fold into stable dsRNA structures that are typical Adar substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Altogether, these findings profile a genome-wide RNA editing map in zebrafish that includes ample RNA editing sites in hundreds of Adar target genes.</p>

<bold>A.</bold> Out of the overall 12 possible mismatches between RNA and DNA, there was a cluster enrichment of A-to-G transitions (93%) compared with the other 11 mismatch possibilities (7%). Web-logo diagrams show the abundance of each nucleotide located 1 bp upstream (position -1) and 1 bp downstream (position +1) of every A/G mismatch found in zebrafish. Top panels show the results for both -1 and +1 positions in the zebrafish exons (top right) and whole transcriptome (top left). Consistent with the established motif, ‘G’ is the least represented nucleotide, with 8.4% in whole transcriptome and 11.4% in exons. Bottom panels show the results for both -1 and +1 positions surrounding the 42,500 editing sites comprising the RADAR dataset in humans (bottom left) and mice (bottom right). In position -1, similar to the case of zebrafish, ‘G’ is considerably under-representation with 8.4% and 4.4% in humans and mice, respectively. <bold>B</bold>.

Middle and bottom charts show the genomic location of the detected HE clusters. <bold>C.</bold> Most of the detected RNA editing sites were found in repeats. Comparison between the distribution of the total and edited repeat families in the zebrafish genome showed an enrichment of the hAT family DNA repeats.

<title>Altered RNA editing levels within gene transcripts in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae</title>
<p>The elevated levels of <italic>adar</italic> mRNA expression and Adar2 protein observed in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g004">Fig 4</xref>), along with the identification of a multitude of clustered editing sites in the zebrafish transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g005">Fig 5</xref>), provided the basis to examine whether the loss of Fmrp affects RNA editing levels in target genes. Until recently, in order to identify and quantify a single RNA editing site, traditional saturated PCR amplification of a single locus was used. The introduction of RNA-seq techniques led to the massive identification of new RNA editing sites; however, quantification of minute alterations in the levels of RNA editing is fairly limited due to typical low depth coverage of specific loci and the large dynamic range of RNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref057">57</xref>]. In this study, we focused on evolutionarily conserved RNA editing targets between mammals and zebrafish. We utilized a novel microfluidic-based multiplex PCR (mmPCR) approach to simultaneously amplify 48 target regions that contain the preselected RNA editing target sites across a 48-sample panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, Materials and Methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref058">58</xref>]. PCR products were index-tagged and subjected to deep sequencing, enabling single-molecule resolution of RNA editing levels in 6 dpf <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT larvae (n = 10 batches of larvae per genotype). Before analyzing the A-to-G ratio per site, we ran a correlation test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We found that the correlation between the number of reads taken from <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT larvae is consistently high and does not affect editing levels (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, two-tailed Pearson r = 0.978; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The zebrafish genome is highly polymorphic and does not consistently match the database (genome assembly Zv9, GCA_000002035.2); thus, for sequence comparison, we also sequenced and quantified genomic DNA from the same animals using the same targeted re-sequencing approach. This enabled a direct comparison of DNA and RNA sequences from the same source. In order to avoid quantification of genomic, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and sequencing errors, we set specific thresholds using the following criteria: i) sample incidence rate—target regions that were successfully captured in equal or more than 75% of the same genotype samples; ii) target site coverage—target regions with coverage depth of at least 400 reads; and iii) A/G ratio—an editing site with a ratio of [A/(A+G)] of at least 2%. Only target sites that met these criteria were further analyzed.</p>

</fig>
<p>Out of the initial 70 predicted RNA editing sites included in our target set, 28 target sites met all criteria. An additional 35 novel and previously untargeted editing sites, located in close proximity to the targeted sites in the same genomic region, were also detected during data analysis. Of these, 24 sites were RNA editing sites that met the selection criteria (‘off-target’ sites, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s005">S3 Table</xref>). Finally, after applying all criteria, a cohort of 52 novel RNA editing sites was quantified and characterized in both <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s004">S2 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). To validate the results, several RNA editing sites were sequenced using the customary Sanger method, and chromatogram analysis confirmed the presence of RNA editing sites (Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Final analysis of RNA editing results showed <italic>fmr1</italic>-dependent differential RNA editing levels in ten sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). These ten evolutionarily conserved RNA editing targets were located in seven genes. Four of these genes were synaptic genes: L-type calcium channel (<italic>cacna1da</italic>), ionotropic glutamate receptor kainate 2 (<italic>grik2</italic>), ionotropic glutamate receptor AMPA receptor subunit 4b (<italic>gria4b</italic>), and ionotropic glutamate receptor AMPA receptor subunit 3a (<italic>gria3a</italic>). Notably, <italic>gria3a</italic> showed differential RNA editing in four sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s006">S4 Table</xref>). These results suggest that altered RNA editing, specifically in synaptic genes, might modulate synaptic structure and function in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae.</p>
<p>The changes in editing observed in whole <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae were relatively mild. However, these changes may be larger in specific tissues. Therefore, we amplified and sequenced the genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA of three representative RNA editing sites, specifically from <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT adult brains. Sequencing revealed that the difference in RNA editing levels between genotypes in <italic>gria3b</italic> and <italic>grik2</italic> genes, which showed no change when sampling whole larvae, increased to 14% and 8%, respectively. In addition, we quantified the levels of RNA editing in acetylcholinesterase (<italic>ache</italic>), which is a key enzyme in cholinergic synaptic transmission, and found an 18% increase in RNA editing levels in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- compared with WT brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). These results show Fmrp-dependent tissue-specific changes of RNA editing levels in brains and suggest that these relatively large changes may be present in other specific tissues.</p>
<p>Next, we employed a second analysis aimed to transform the quantification of site-specific editing levels into the complete formation of mRNA variants, which more accurately reflect the effect of RNA editing on transcriptome diversity. Analyzing all the editing sites located adjacently on a single molecule enabled us to determine the abundance of each mRNA sequence within the gene mRNA repertoire. This analysis showed that <italic>gria2a</italic> and <italic>gria3a</italic> contain multiple RNA editing sites on the same amplicon. When analyzed separately, insignificant, differential editing levels were found between <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s006">S4 Table</xref>). However, when we analyzed the occurrence of RNA editing in conjunction with mRNA transcript formation, we identified small but significant changes in the relative abundance of the various mRNA transcripts generated by sequence recoding in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s007">S5 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). Analysis of the editing pattern of <italic>gria2a</italic>, which contains two adjacent editing sites (chr1:20124223 and chr1:20124224) showed a 2.6% increase in the genomically encoded, unedited form (LR) in WT compared with <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s007">S5 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g006">Fig 6E</xref>: unedited form in WT = 43.2%∓1%, <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- <italic>=</italic> 40.6%∓0.9%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). In <italic>gria3a</italic>, which also contains two adjacent editing sites (chr5:25066153 and chr5:25066156) the results exhibited a 1.6% decrease in the relative abundance of the fully edited version of AV formed by double editing in both T442A and I423V sites in WT compared with <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s007">S5 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g006">Fig 6F</xref>; double edited form in WT = 9.8%∓0.4%, <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- <italic>=</italic> 11.3%%∓0.6%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). This analysis shows that in clustered sites, even small changes in the editing levels can be manifested into different mRNA transcripts that can reshape synaptic proteins and thus contribute to functional diversity. Altogether, these results suggest that RNA editing sites, particularly in synaptic genes, are diversely regulated by Fmrp-mediated Adar activity. These molecular modifications may affect synaptic structure, axon processing, and the function of specific neuronal circuits that regulate behavior.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The epigenetic, neurological, and behavioral findings in the zebrafish FXS model suggest that Fmrp-mediated RNA editing plays a role in the molecular mechanisms that regulate structural plasticity of neuronal circuits that regulate behavior. In support of this model, Fmrp and Adar2a biochemically interacted, and loss of Fmrp increased the mRNA expression levels of the <italic>adar</italic> enzymes as well as Adar2 protein levels. Furthermore, we found that the zebrafish genome contains thousands of RNA editing sites, and that RNA editing levels are altered in conserved synaptic and neuronal transcripts in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- zebrafish. For example, in accordance with the increase of RNA editing levels in glutamatergic and cholinergic genes, synaptic density was increased in the glutamatergic Hcrt neurons and the cholinergic spinal motor neurons in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- zebrafish. Considering the role of these neurons in locomotor-activity regulation, the hyperlocomotor activity of <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae may be linked to increased synaptic density in these neurons. Altogether, these results suggest an intricate interaction between Fmrp, Adars, and RNA editing in target genes that may affect the neurological symptoms of FXS patients. However, further research is needed in order to causally link RNA editing in specific targets with neuronal circuit-specific deficiencies in an animal model for FXS.</p>
<p>In order to understand the mechanism of FXS, we used <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- zebrafish. In humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref028">28</xref>], loss of Fmrp increased the expression levels of the inactive mTor protein. In mice, the levels of expression of the active form phospho-mTor increased, while the expression of the inactive form did not change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref059">59</xref>]. As in the case of humans, in zebrafish, the loss of FMRP results in the increased expression of the mTor protein. The effect on phospho-mTor requires additional investigation. Taking into account the role of mTor in regulating structural, synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref030">30</xref>], it may play a role in the mechanism that regulates the assembly of neuronal circuits that regulate behavior in zebrafish and FXS. The behavior of <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- zebrafish was previously studied only in adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref018">18</xref>]. However, at larval stages, the zebrafish model provides unique high-throughput and transparency advantages. Thus, we studied the role of <italic>fmr1</italic> in regulating neural circuit formation and behavior. High-throughput, video-tracking behavior systems were used to monitor the rhythmic locomotor activity during both day and night. As in the case of mammals and adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref018">18</xref>], the larvae were hyperactive. Furthermore, under a 30-min alternating light and dark cycle, the larvae were hyperactive and their response to dark-to-light transition was altered. This hyperlocomotor activity is distinctive, since loss of gene function and neuron alterations typically result in reduced locomotor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref060">60</xref>]. An intriguing explanation for the hyperactivity of <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae could be that Fmrp mediates structural synaptic plasticity that affects behavior. A key role of Fmrp is inhibition of synaptic protein translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref061">61</xref>]. Thus, the loss of Fmrp may result in hyperactivity due to the augmented translation of synaptic proteins that interferes with synaptic degeneration and axon pruning processes. Supporting this hypothesis, the imaging of cellular and presynaptic fluorescent markers in live zebrafish showed increased axonal branching in both spinal motor and RB sensory neurons, and increased synaptic density in the axons of the Hcrt and motor neurons in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae. Since the spinal motor neurons regulate locomotor activity and the Hcrt neurons regulate arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref062">62</xref>], the structural axonal and synaptic abnormalities found may induce the increased locomotor activity in <italic>fmr</italic>1-/- larvae. Furthermore, the abundance of immature dendritic spines is one of the neuroanatomical hallmarks of FXS in both humans and Fmr1-KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref063">63</xref>]. However, the role of Fmrp in regulating the development of axonal and presynaptic structures has yet to be fully characterized. In the cortex of FMR1-KO mice, the axonal arbors are diffused and demonstrate reduced connection probability and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref064">64</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Fmrp limits axon growth and facilitates activity-dependent pruning of axonal branches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref066">66</xref>]. Thus, our findings in zebrafish support the findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice, and show that a lack of Fmrp results in excessive axonal processing and synaptic structures in neuronal circuits that induce locomotor activity.</p>
<p>The ability of a neuron to modulate synaptic protein composition and function relies on the fine-tuning of transcription and translation processes in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, as well as in cellular transport along the neurites. The RNA-binding protein Fmrp regulates translation and mRNA transport of synaptic genes. Another RNA-binding protein, the Adar enzyme, acts on an array of RNA molecules and expands protein diversity beyond that encoded by the genome. It also interferes with gene expression and coordinates miRNA biosynthesis to fine-tune neuronal plasticity and brain functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref019">19</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Fmrp and Adar interact in the nucleus to regulate RNA editing. Furthermore, Adars act downstream to Fmrp to regulate synaptic morphology of the neuromuscular junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref013">13</xref>]. Similarly, we found that zebrafish Fmrp and Adar2a biochemically interact. Moreover, zebrafish Fmrp binds <italic>adar1</italic> mRNA. Notably, while in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fmrp KO the levels of the single Adar protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref043">43</xref>] do not change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref013">13</xref>], in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- zebrafish, <italic>adar</italic> mRNAs and Adar2 protein expression levels are increased. These results suggest that Fmrp inhibits either Adar mRNA, protein or both, and further research is needed in order to elucidate the specific pathways. In either of the mechanisms, Fmrp likely affects Adar activity, which results in altered RNA editing levels in Adar-target genes. Furthermore, since a growing body of evidence links Adar activity to a broad array of the cell’s regulatory mechanisms, including the enhancement of A-to-I editing in the flanking intronic sequences of circRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref022">22</xref>], the potential increase of Adar activity in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae suggests a broad molecular modification of the transcriptome.</p>
<p>In order to quantify RNA editing in zebrafish, we first characterized a genome-wide profile of clustered RNA editing sites. The focus on clustered RNA editing sites allows an accurate evaluation of the prevalence of RNA editing even in the absence of genomic DNA data, and can be used as an indicator of overall Adar activity. Analysis of the zebrafish transcriptome showed that 0.2% of the total aligned reads were RNA editing sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s003">S1 Table</xref>), while the same analysis performed on RNA-seq data from the prefrontal cortex of healthy humans showed that 0.19% of the total reads were RNA editing sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref053">53</xref>]. Thus, as in the case of humans, these results demonstrate an extensive RNA editing process in zebrafish.</p>
<p>Whether the loss of Fmrp affects RNA editing in vertebrates was unknown. The Fmrp-Adar zebrafish protein interaction and the detection of hundreds of RNA editing sites within zebrafish genes provided the groundwork needed for RNA editing quantification in dozens of potential zebrafish target genes. We selected evolutionarily conserved Adar-targets in the CDS of annotated genes and used the mmPCR system to quantify RNA editing in those genes. The advantage of this system is its ability to simultaneously detect and accurately quantify A-to-G RNA editing events across multiple samples in a single experiment, independent of gene expression levels. We found Fmrp-dependent changes in RNA editing in several neuronal genes, particularly in glutamate receptors. Notably, although the RNA editing levels increased in most sites, the levels decreased in one specific site (cog3 chr9:55875506). This is also the case in the mutant <italic>fmr1</italic> fly, where the RNA editing levels increase in some genes and decrease in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref013">13</xref>]. The analysis of clustered RNA editing sites in <italic>gria2a</italic> showed that the overall prevalence of the mRNA containing the R/G recoding is higher in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae. Interestingly, this R/G editing site is located 2 nucleotides upstream to a splice site, which contributes to the generation of the Flip/Flop isoforms that modulate the kinetic properties of AMPA receptor channels, thus determining the time course of desensitization and re-sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref067">67</xref>]. Since the G forms of AMPA receptors have a faster recovery rate from desensitization compared to R forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref068">68</xref>], the increase in RNA editing at the R/G site may induce the synaptic response to glutamate. Thus, the changes in RNA editing in glutamate receptors may affect synaptic strength and morphology as well as cause hyperlocomotor activity in <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae. Although the changes in editing observed in whole <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae were mild, they were significant in several cases and might have been larger had the analyses been performed on a specific tissue or cell population. Indeed, quantification of RNA editing, specifically in the brain, showed greater changes in RNA editing levels. In addition, the relatively small changes in RNA editing were found in evolutionarily conserved targets that are carefully regulated. Furthermore, subtle editing changes are also typical in other model organisms for brain disorders. RNA-editing studies of various human neurological diseases, such as ALS, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, have all evidence for mild alterations in RNA editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref071">71</xref>]. Finally, since we found thousands of new RNA editing sites throughout the zebrafish genome, other untested target sites may exhibit more robust, Fmrp-dependent changes in RNA editing levels.</p>
<p>In summary, this study proposes a link between neurological deficiencies and RNA editing in the common mental disorder FXS. In order to elucidate the functional role of Fmrp in mediating Adar activity and RNA editing, further molecular and live-imaging studies should be performed. For example, establishing transgenic fish that overexpress edited and non-edited Fmrp-Adar target genes, combined with live imaging of the activity and structure of neurons and synapses throughout the brain, would help determine the pathogenesis of FXS symptoms. Taking into account that the zebrafish has become an attractive model for large-scale genetic and small-molecule screens, <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- larvae can provide the platform to elucidate the molecular mechanism and find therapeutic treatments for FXS.</p>

Editing sites were quantified by finding the maximal amplitude height of the A peaks (unedited) and the G peaks (edited), and also by calculating percentages of the population edited at each site [100% X (number of C nucleotides/total number of nucleotides)]. The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser was used to locate editing sites, mismatches between RNA and ESTs, as well as to establish conservation and homology between different species via alignments.</p>

<title>Analysis of clustered RNA editing sites</title>
<p>Several genes within our target set harbor a number of editing sites located in close proximity in the same amplified target region. In these cases, the calculated percentage of the A/G ratio did not reveal the actual impact of editing on the sequence composition of the mRNA transcripts leading off to the resultant protein. Since PCR amplification of target regions that contain more than one targeted editing site on the same PCR product (amplicon) was used, it enables identifying the presence of RNA editing sites and the correlations between neighboring editing sites.</p>

<sec id="sec023">
<title>Compiling the target set of A-to-G editing sites</title>
<p>The Fluidigm access array (Fl-AA) system enables the simultaneous amplification of at least 48 different target regions across a 48-cDNA-sample panel on a single microfluidic device. Thus, 2,304 separate PCR reactions are performed simultaneously, followed by in-parallel next-generation sequencing, allowing the precise quantification of A/G ratios. The basic modus operandi of the (Fl-AA) system is in a singleplex PCR mode that limits the number of primer pairs used for the amplification of target regions to 48 per run. We employed a selection process to determine the 48 target regions. We designed the primer set to amplify evolutionarily conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref072">72</xref>] editing targets that reside within the coding region of genes, preferably on editing sites that substitute for amino acids. The first step of the selection process was to screen the RADAR database of A-to-I RNA editing sites in humans and to select editing sites that are located within genes but that also reside outside of Alu repetitive regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref073">73</xref>]. Next, the UCSC and the lift-over tool were used to convert the list of all editing sites from its human genomic locations to zebrafish genomic coordinates. We compiled a list of 48 target regions containing a total of 70 novel zebrafish putative RNA editing sites located in 33 genes, of which 12 are directly linked with neuronal function. Of the total 70 target sites; 41 are located within the coding sequence of genes that mostly encode neuronal transcripts (59%), of which 27 target sites exert a non-synonymous effect (39%). Another 28 sites (40%) are located in the 3’-UTR of various genes, and one site was found to be located in an intron of the <italic>adar2</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref020">20</xref>]. Interestingly, this site is auto-edited by Adar2 and has been linked with the fine tuning of the mRNA re-coding process and affects behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005702.s005">S3 Table</xref>). Finally, we compared the selected target-site list with the list of HE sites found in genes for shared entries, due to the fact that HE clusters occur with high probability in regions that generate dsRNA structures supportive of RNA editing. Indeed, we found that 7 of the 12 Refseq genes included in the final list of target regions were also found to contain HE clusters. This represents a 20-fold enrichment compared to the fraction of genes containing HE clusters in the entire zebrafish genome (2.9%).</p>

<title>Amplifying targeted editing sites using microfluidic-based multiplex PCR (mmPCR) and next-generation sequencing</title>
<p>To distinguish between the <italic>fmr1</italic>-/- and WT samples, amplicons designed to contain the editing target sites were amplified across the sample panel containing both genotypes, using tagged fusion primers in a two-step consecutive PCR strategy. These primers were designed using Primer3.0 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/">http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/</ext-link>] and the 454 fusion primer design tool [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eu.idtdna.com/scitools/applications/fusionprimers/default.aspx">http://eu.idtdna.com/scitools/applications/fusionprimers/default.aspx</ext-link> (IDT, Coralville, IA)]. Using the mmPCR method, we automatically assembled 2,304 unique PCR reactions, each reaction including a portion from each of the 48 samples screened with each one of the 48 primer pairs. The mmPCR amplification and tagging strategy is based on two consecutive PCR reactions, each performed with specific fusion PCR primers. The first PCR is performed "on chip" and generates amplicons of interest containing the target sites, which are flanked by designed common sequences [CS1 (fused to the forward primer)/CS2 (fused to the reverse primer)]. The second "off chip” PCR is performed on a thermal cycler and uses the first "on chip" PCR products as templates. The amplicons, now containing the CS regions conjoined (by the previous PCR), enable forming the attachment with sample-specific barcodes and Ion-Torrent PGM adaptors, thus making all 48 mini-libraries compatible for in-parallel NGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005702.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>
<p>Four μl of singleplex primer (4 μM per primer in 1X AA-loading buffer) was loaded into the primer inlets of the 48.48 Access Array IFC (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA, USA).

<title>Data analysis of mmPCR results</title>
<p>We used FASTX Toolkit to demultiplex the raw reads. We used BWA26 to align the reads to a combination of the reference genome and exonic sequences surrounding known splicing junctions from gene models annotated in RefSeq and Gencode V12. We chose the length of the splicing junction regions to be slightly shorter than the reads in order to prevent redundant hits. For allelic-ratio count, we used the bases with a minimum quality score of 20. For read-depth count, we used the coverage of the representative sites in each amplicon. To obtain novel RNA-editing sites, we required variants to be supported by at least 10 mismatch reads with a base quality score and a mapping quality score ≥20. We also removed all known SNPs present in dbSNP (except SNPs of molecular type “cDNA”; database version 135; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/</ext-link>), the 1000 Genomes Project or the University of Washington Exome Sequencing Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>).

Larva-containing plates were placed in the Noldus DanioVision tracking system (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands) and acclimated for one hour prior to recording. Light intensity in the tracking system was 70LUX (25% in the operating software) for all experiments. To monitor rhythmic activity during a daily cycle, larvae were maintained under the same light-dark regime prior to the experiment. To monitor responses to light/dark transitions, larvae were subjected to 3 intervals of 30 min light/30 min darkness. Live video-tracking and analysis were conducted using the EthoVision XT 9 software (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005702.ref062">62</xref>]. Four independent assays were performed, with a total of 177 and 179 larvae for each genotype in the light/dark-transition experiments, respectively, and a total of 30 and 34 larvae for each genotype in the daily-cycle experiment, respectively.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic tree</title>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis was performed with PhyML 3.0 aLRT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phylogeny.fr/version2_cgi/one_task.cgi?task_type=phyml">http://www.phylogeny.fr/version2_cgi/one_task.cgi?task_type=phyml</ext-link>) using the "one click" program.</p>

<title>Imaging and quantification</title>
<p>An epifluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica M165FC) was used to image fixed larvae. Pictures were taken using Leica Application Suite imaging software v. 3.7. For confocal imaging, embryos and larvae were placed in low-melting-point agarose (0.5–1.0%) on a specially designed dish filled with embryo water. A similar mounting protocol was used to image fixed embryos subjected to whole-mount ISH. Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM710 upright confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To visualize single cells, optic sections of 0.5–1 micron were acquired. Positive cells were manually quantified using z-stack images of serial tissue slices. Images were processed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA) software. Calculation of total arbor length and axonal branching in single motor neurons, RB sensory neurons, and Hcrt neurons was performed using NeuronJ plugin in ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Synaptic density was calculated by quantifying the number of synapses per 10 μm in the axonal arbor of single motor neurons and Hcrt neurons, as well as 30 μm in RB neurons, using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).</p>
