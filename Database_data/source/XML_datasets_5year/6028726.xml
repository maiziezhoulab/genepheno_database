<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">The cellular complexity of human brain development has been intensively investigated, although a regional characterization of the entire human cerebral cortex based on single-cell transcriptome analysis has not been reported. Here, we performed RNA-seq on over 4,000 individual cells from 22 brain regions of human mid-gestation embryos. We identified 29 cell sub-clusters, which showed different proportions in each region and the pons showed especially high percentage of astrocytes. Embryonic neurons were not as diverse as adult neurons, although they possessed important features of their destinies in adults. Neuron development was unsynchronized in the cerebral cortex, as dorsal regions appeared to be more mature than ventral regions at this stage. Region-specific genes were comprehensively identified in each neuronal sub-cluster, and a large proportion of these genes were neural disease related. Our results present a systematic landscape of the regionalized gene expression and neuron maturation of the human cerebral cortex.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">The adult brain of vertebrate animals has extensive capabilities due to its astonishing cell type diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and precise arrangement of regional structures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> especially in the cerebral cortex as it is the most evolved organ with the most complex functions in human. The cerebral cortex contains convoluted, layered gray matter that is only 2–3 mm thick in human but with several hundred square centimetres of surface area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Neurons residing in the gray matter are the basic unit in the system and possess outgoing axons that club together to form the white matter of the cerebral cortex. Neurons located in different cortical layers and regions project to their specific destinations where they can receive and release signals by transmitting neurotransmitters to feel and control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Previous classifications for neurons were mainly based on their morphological, chemical, and electrical properties. As these properties are controlled genetically, neuron sub-cluster classifications have been defined by distinct molecular characteristics in recent studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup></p>
<p id="Par3">The enormous diversity of neurons with precise framework comes from genetically committed neural stem cell (NSC) and progenitor pools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Apart from the diverse neurons, progenitor pools produce more abundant glial cells including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> These glial cells do not transmit signals like neurons, but they constitute the environment to chaperon the neurons and shape the neuronal network,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and their dysfunction is associated with many neural system diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Although we have known that the neuronal and glial lineages share the same origin, the genetic determinants diversifying the neural progenitors into neuronal or glial specification are still not fully understood.</p>
<p id="Par4">As the major architecture of the adult brain is almost established at the embryonic stage, dissecting the cell complexity and specific regional features of the developing cortex is a promising strategy for studying the functional specialization of the cerebral cortex. Previous studies, which have analyzed temporal and spatial neural development in rodent, human, and non-human primate brains, and have uncovered specific regional and temporal molecular characteristics of brain development, were almost based on bulk RNA-seq analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> The molecular profiles of each structure can be unveiled by analyzing micro-dissected cortical tissues. However, such assessments are far from revealing the detailed mechanisms of cerebral cortex organization, as dissected structures are still composed of multiple cell types.</p>
<p id="Par5">Single-cell transcriptome analysis may provide more precise information according to current progress, especially on cell type diversities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> but barely approach the regional information to reveal the transcriptional landscape of the entire human embryonic cerebral cortex at single-cell resolution. In this study, we collected single cells for transcriptome analysis from different regions of the entire human cortex at 22 and 23 weeks post-conception (22 W and 23 W) and supplied the first data source to lay the ground for understanding the cell type constitution and molecular differences of regional development in the whole human cerebral cortex at the mid-gestational stage.</p>

<title>Global clustering and identification of the single cells</title>
<p id="Par6">To detect the molecular distributions of 20 major anatomical cortical regions together with the medulla and the pons, we picked single cells as summarized in Supplementary information, Table S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">1</xref>. A total of 4,213 single cells from the cerebral cortex of a 22 W embryo and two 23 W embryos were analyzed. An average of 1.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> mappable reads were generated for each cell, and on average, 4,318 genes were detected in each individual cell. We performed the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis to explore the diversity of all these cells. The even mixture of cells from different embryos in each cluster on the t-SNE plot reflected negligible individual variance or a batch effect for each cell type (Supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1a</xref>). Based on the global expression patterns, all cells were classified into three major groups, namely, neurons, glial cells and non-neural cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Cell type classification in human embryonic cerebral cortex. <bold>a</bold> The schematic diagram displaying the dissection of embryonic brain and how we obtained the single cell transcriptome data in 22 regions (for the abbreviations, see Supplementary information, Table S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">1</xref>). t-SNE showed the cell types identified with all the single cells and the shadows mark different general cell types: the blue shade indicates glial cell, the yellow shows neuron and the gray shows non-neural cell that is not supposed to be produced by neural stem cell. <bold>b</bold> Heatmap displaying the DEGs that were cell type specific in our analysis.

<p id="Par7">Further, each major group was divided using a random forest algorithm and we obtained eight major cell types, including inhibitory neurons, excitatory neurons, Cajal-Retzius cells, glial cells, microglia, endothelial cells, immune cells, and blood cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and Supplementary information, Table S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">2</xref>). Classical markers were specifically detected in the corresponding clusters of cells (Supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1b</xref>). In total, 1,672 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained among these major cell types using Seurat analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis also showed that each type of cell specifically expressed genes involved in the corresponding biological processes, as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref> and Supplementary information, Table S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">3</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par8">Neuronal cells (inhibitory neurons, excitatory neurons and Cajal-Retzius cells) accounted for 66% of the cells in the 22/23 W cerebral cortex, whereas glial cells (which could be further divided into NSCs, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes) only accounted for 8% of the cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref> and Supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1c</xref>). This cellular distribution is markedly different from that found in the gray matter of the adult cerebral cortex, where glial cells are thought to outnumber neurons by 1.5 times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> However, co-immunostaining for NEUROD1 and GFAP validated the much higher abundance of excitatory neurons than astrocytes in different cortical regions at this embryonic stage (Supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1d</xref>). Thus, we deduced that the preferential expansion of glial cells over neurons in the cerebral cortex occurs after 23 weeks post-fertilization in humans. Very different from the cortical regions, regions in the inferior surface such as the insular gyris (IG) and medulla contain more glial cells (Supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1e</xref>). More microglia were observed in the medulla than in the IG region, while these microglia in the medulla seemed less developed than those in the IG regions as the former are ameboid whereas the latter start to develop ramified form (Supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1e</xref>). This indicates that microglia development was unsynchronized in different brain regions. The vast majority of the cells in the cortex were in a quiescent/post-mitotic state at this embryonic stage, except that ~40% of the NSCs were still actively dividing (Supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1f</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Neuron sub-clusters in the human embryonic cortex</title>
<p id="Par9">To further reveal the subpopulations of each major cell type, we performed a more detailed analysis of each cell type with the random forest algorithm. A total of 968 inhibitory neurons were further divided into 8 sub-clusters, with each sub-cluster characterized by unique marker genes such as neural peptides (<italic>NXPH1</italic>, <italic>SST</italic>), enzymes (<italic>PAM</italic>), important calcium-binding proteins (<italic>CALB2</italic>, <italic>CAMLG</italic>), transcription factors (TFs) (<italic>LHX6</italic>), and non-coding RNAs regulating GABAergic cell fate (<italic>DLX6-AS1</italic>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Inhibitory neuronal subgroups 1-4 highly expressed <italic>LHX6</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>); these subgroups are thought to be generated in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), a major source of the GABAergic population in the cerebral cortex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> These cells expressed <italic>LHX6</italic> together with <italic>NXPH1</italic> and <italic>PAM</italic>, and accounted for 50.9% of all the inhibitory neurons in the cortex. Furthermore, 24.9% of the <italic>LHX6</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors developed into a somatostatin (SST)-expressing population (subgroup In_2). We identified a <italic>BOD1L1</italic><sup>+</sup> subgroup among the inhibitory neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b,c</xref>). This subgroup of cells did not express <italic>POLR2E</italic>, which encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II. The other 49.1% of the inhibitory neurons (subgroups 5-8) were <italic>CALB2</italic> positive. These cells expressed both <italic>DLX2</italic> and <italic>NR2F2</italic> (encoding COUP-TFII) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>), indicating that they may originate from the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) and then migrate into the cortex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> By calculating the proportions of <italic>LHX6</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>CALB2</italic><sup>+</sup> inhibitory neurons in each cortical region, we found that <italic>LHX6</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons are relatively enriched in the superior part of the cerebral cortex, whereas the <italic>CALB2</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons are enriched in the inferior regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c, d</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Neuron cell sub-clusters in human embryonic cerebral cortex. <bold>a</bold> t-SNE map showing the subtypes of all inhibitory and excitatory neurons.

Genes down-regulated during the differentiation course of the excitatory neurons were mainly associated with negative regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription and cytokine production. These genes were more enriched in germinal structures (VZ, ISVZ, and OSVZ), as reported by Miller et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref> and Supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2a</xref>). In contrast, the positively regulated genes were enriched in synaptic functions, such as membrane depolarization during action potentials, and showed higher expression levels in the upper structures of the cortex (IZ to MZ). These genes were enriched in neuron-related functions, such as membrane depolarization during action potential and signal release (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref> and Supplementary information, Figure S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2a</xref>).

<title>Comparison of human embryonic neurons to adult neurons in the cortex</title>
<p id="Par12">Lake et al. revealed the molecular signatures of neurons in different cortical regions of the human adult brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> We wondered whether these signatures were already formed in the mid-gestational embryonic cortex. First, we analyzed the expression levels of excitatory and inhibitory neuron sub-cluster markers identified in the adult cortex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). Approximately half of the excitatory sub-cluster markers were expressed in the embryonic excitatory neurons; these markers could be used to discern only the Ex_1/2 from the Ex_3/4 subgroups. Few of the inhibitory sub-cluster markers were detected in the embryonic inhibitory neurons, perhaps because both the excitatory and inhibitory neurons at this embryonic stage were not fully developed with functional projections, and most of these neurons were still progenitors during migration. Further analysis of the expression levels of the layer markers also showed no patterns of these adult neuron markers on the embryonic neuronal sub-clusters for either excitatory or inhibitory neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). Only the more mature sub-clusters of excitatory neurons, Ex_3 and Ex_4, showed a broad distribution across layer 6b to layer 2 and these cells expressed markers of multiple layers (Supplementary information, Figure S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2b</xref>). We suspected that these migrating neurons express multiple layer signatures at 23 W, and later, when they have arrived at their final destination, they will mature and express marker genes specific for the layer that they migrate into and develop full projections.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Maturation degree of embryonic neurons is different from the adult neurons. <bold>a</bold> Heatmap showing the expression of marker genes identified in the adult neuron subtypes. <bold>b</bold> Expression of layer markers in different sub-clusters of excitatory neuron (left) and inhibitory neuron (right). <bold>c</bold> Landscape showing the maturity level of each region in the cortex measured by <italic>CUX2</italic>-positive excitatory neuron ratio.

<p id="Par13">We noticed that the expression level of upper layer marker <italic>CUX2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> could clearly specify the four sub-clusters of excitatory neurons and the more mature neurons showed higher expression of <italic>CUX2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). Thus, <italic>CUX2</italic> could be used to evaluate the maturation degree of each region in the whole cerebral cortex. According to the <italic>CUX2</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cell ratio in each region, we found that the neurons in the pre-central cortex (PRC, also known as the primary somatomotor cortex) and the post-central cortex (PC, also known as the primary somatosensory cortex) were more mature than the neurons in other cortical regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). RNA in situ hybridization of <italic>CUX2</italic> was performed for the PC and the inferior temporal cortex (IT) regions, which indeed confirmed more <italic>CUX2</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells in the PC region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>). Similar mature patterns were revealed when we analyzed the expression levels of synapse formation and function related genes as measures of neuron maturity in each cortical region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par14">To obtain further insight into the differences between embryonic and adult cortex neurons, we compared our single-cell data with those of the adult neurons by principal component analysis (PCA) after removing batch effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). The findings showed that the heterogeneity of the excitatory neurons at mid-gestation stage was already comparable to that of the adult brain. Both PC1 and PC2 reflected the differences between immature and mature embryonic neurons, and the enriched terms were also associated with projection development and synaptic plasticity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). The results for inhibitory neurons were very different. PC1 genes clearly separated the embryonic inhibitory neurons from the adult neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). The adult inhibitory neurons highly expressed PC1 positive direction genes, which were enriched in neuron signaling genes, whereas the embryonic inhibitory neurons specifically expressed PC1 negative direction genes, which were associated with cellular metabolism. The PC3 and PC4 genes mainly reflected the differences among the subgroups of adult inhibitory neurons, whereas the embryonic inhibitory neurons exhibited no significant differences on these two axes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). We inferred that this difference might exist because the mid-gestation inhibitory neurons were still immature and had not differentiated into subtypes comparable to those in the adult cortex. Since the <italic>SST</italic><sup>+</sup> inhibitory subgroup is classified as a sub-cluster at this stage, we wondered whether this subtype of neuron matures earlier than other subtypes of inhibitory neurons. We combined our inhibitory neurons with those identified in the developing pre-frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and performed pseudotime analysis. Inhibitory neurons at 22–23 W in this study mainly located from early to the middle developing stages on the pseudotime path (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). The <italic>SST</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons randomly appeared in the whole developing course of the pseudotime path, indicating that they were not more mature compared to other inhibitory neurons. Thus we inferred that the <italic>SST</italic> expression should not be of the same function as those in adult neurons.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of embryonic neuron sub-clusters to adult ones. <bold>a</bold> PCA plot of both excitatory neuron sub-clusters and adult ones. <bold>b</bold> Heatmap of expression of the top genes in the PCs corresponding to panel (<bold>a</bold>) and the enriched terms for each PC gene set.

<p id="Par15">To more thoroughly analyze the cell types of the human cortex, we also compared our data with the single-cell data from Pollen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and Darmanis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> We analyzed all the single-cell samples by PCA after batch effect correction using mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) algorithm in Scran package.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> The PC2 positive direction genes were enriched for the neuron progenitor-specific genes, especially for those at early embryonic stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). PC3 and PC4 clearly separated the adult cells from the embryonic cells, except for the Cajal-Retzius cells identified in our study, which mixed well with the adult cells. Thus, Cajal-Retzius cells were probably the cells that kept the most similar expression signatures from mid-gestation stage to adult. All the cells could be clustered into 8 groups, each showing a specific gene expression pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). According to the marker gene expression signature for each group, both the actively dividing neural stem cell group and the quiescent neural stem cell group mainly consisted of GW16, GW21, and fetal neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b, c</xref>). The differences between adult excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons were milder than those between the embryonic excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons.

Similarly, the gene and transcript numbers increased along with the maturation of excitatory neurons.

<title>Spatial differences for different types of cells in the developing human cortex</title>
<p id="Par18">The spatial position recorded for each cell provided valuable information for investigating the regional differences in the embryonic cerebral cortex in terms of regional cell type diversity. The four main regions in the cortex, the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the occipital lobe, and the temporal lobe, consisted of more neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>), whereas regions in the inferior surface contained many more glial cells. We particularly observed a high abundance of astrocytes in the pons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref> and Supplementary information, Figure S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">6a</xref>). Immunostaining for GFAP to detect cells from the pons, the IT and PC regions showed the most astrocytes in the pons. Impressively, the astrocytes in the pons showed more mature morphology, with longer processes than those in the PC and IT regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>). To determine whether there was a distribution difference between the two sub-clusters of astrocytes, we performed in situ hybridization for <italic>RAMP3</italic> (marking the Astro_1 sub-cluster) and <italic>PTGDS</italic> (marking the Astro_2 sub-cluster) on the pons and cortical regions. Both sub-clusters were much more abundant in the pons than those in the PC and IT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>).

<p id="Par22">In this study, we uncovered 29 cell sub-clusters within the mid-gestation stage of human embryonic cerebral cortex in vivo and identified the unique signature of each type of cell related to their biological functions, such as in the cell cycle, TF networks, and metabolism. Inhibitory neurons originating from the MGE and the CGE exhibited clear differences in both their gene expression signatures and distribution patterns. The <italic>LHX6</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> inhibitory neurons tended to be enriched in the top dorsal regions of the cerebral cortex, whereas the <italic>CALB2</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> ones were in the inferior regions. Our findings indicate the potential in vivo molecular regulation of the maturation process of human excitatory neurons, which provides additional clues to aid in the generation of neurons in vitro with specific physiological functions.</p>
<p id="Par23">By comparing our single-cell data to those of previous studies, we observed drastic differences between embryonic neurons and adult neurons. The results also indicate that the embryonic excitatory neurons had different gene regulation networks during maturation compared to the inhibitory neurons, and the latter showed delayed maturation compared with the former. For the <italic>SST</italic><sup>+</sup> inhibitory neurons, they are the earliest to show up as a subgroup during embryonic development. However, these <italic>SST</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> neurons are still different from the adult ones as the former showed no maturity apart from the expression of <italic>SST</italic>. It is a very important question of why these <italic>SST</italic><sup>+</sup> inhibitory neurons show up earlier than other subtypes. Previous studies proved a key role of inhibitory neurons in circuit development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and thus <italic>SST</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> inhibitory neurons might play a vanguard role in constructing the local circuit. As different subtypes of inhibitory neurons have different impacts on circuits, for example, the efferents of SST neurons are to principal cells, whereas the efferents of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons are mainly to SST neurons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> which in turn lead to a disinhibition of those principal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> It is easy to understand that the VIP neurons are generated later than SST neruons during development as they need local cues from both exicitatory and inhibitory signals for their final positioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> and morphological development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> thus SST neurons should show up earlier in the cerebral cortex. Therefore, we infer that the early appearance of <italic>SST</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> inhibitory neurons at embryonic stage is not to inhibit functions of other neurons as they do in the adult circuits, but these <italic>SST</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> neurons are helping to form neural circuits. This hypothesis needs more experimental validation in the future.</p>
<p id="Par24">Regional differences were observed at different aspects. First of all, different cortex regions showed different cell type constitutions, for example, the regions in the inferior surface contain more glia cells, whereas the cortical regions contain more neurons. Moreover, both the excitatory and inhibitory neurons showed asymmetric distributions among the cortical regions. Regions in the frontal lobe contain more excitatory neurons, whereas regions in the temporal lobe contain more inhibitory ones. These differences in cell type constitution could possibly lead to regional specificity of the neural networks and their functions. Besides, neurons of the same sub-cluster showed different degrees of heterogeneity within each region of the cortex, and the frontal lobe was the most homogeneous region for a specific neuron sub-cluster. The different degrees of heterogeneity might be related to the complex neural connections when neurons are fully developed. Moreover, we observed that the maturation of different cortex regions was not synchronized, which may reflect the facts of regional difference in development. At last, we found that even for the same type of neurons, regional specific gene expression patterns existed, and these DEGs were strongly related to known neural diseases or region-specific neural functions.</p>
<p id="Par25">Neural disorders are affecting numerous patients’ health and life and they are still urgent issues currently without effective solutions.

<title>Human embryonic brain collection and dissection</title>
<p id="Par27">Human embryonic brains were obtained from the Third Hospital of Peking University with agreement of the donors. The 22 W and 23 W brains were collected from twins, and we collected each female cerebral cortex from the right hemisphere. We collected the right brain cortex from a 22 W male embryo. Only a few cells were collected from the male cerebral cortex of the right brain at 22 W. For dissection of cortical regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and Supplementary information, Table S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">1</xref>), we referred to <italic>The Human Brain during the Second Trimester</italic>, by Shirley A. Bayer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> For each female right brain, we dissected 19 regions from the cerebral cortex, and we also collected the insular gyrus, the pons and the medulla from the inferior surface.

<title>Tissue digestion and single-cell RNA-seq library preparation</title>
<p id="Par28">The dissected regions were transferred into 500 µl hibernate E medium (Invitrogen, Cat# A1247601) with 2 mg/ml collagenase IV (Gibco, Cat# 17104-019) and 20 U/µl DNase I (NEB, Cat# M0303L). The samples were roughly pipetted to break down the tissue and then added to 500 µl hibernate E medium containing 1 mg/ml papain (Sigma, Cat# P4762) and 20 U/μl DNase I. The tissue fragments were kept at 37 °C in a thermocycler for 5 min. The sample was then pipetted thoroughly to obtain single cells. To stop digestion, the tubes were centrifuged at 300×<italic> g</italic> for 2 min, the cell pellet was collected, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended with 1 ml hibernate E medium. We removed the block mass using a 40-μm filter. The cell suspension was kept on ice to prevent cell death during the single-cell collection procedure. We randomly picked single cells that appeared to be alive and placed them in 2.5 μl cell lysis buffer using a mouth pipet under a microscope. We modified the STRT-seq method for amplification of single-cell transcriptomes by changing the reverse transcription primer, the induced cell barcode, and the unique molecular identifier (UMI). The final primer concentration for reverse transcription was 300 nM. The amplification primers at the 3′ end were chemically modified with biotin. Before library construction, we enriched the fragments containing the cell barcode and UMI with streptavidin beads. The cDNAs of all 96 cells with different cell barcodes were pooled together for one library construction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> Each single cell was sequenced for 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> of 150-bp paired-end reads using an Illumina HiSeq 4000.</p>

<sec id="Sec13">
<title>Processing of single-cell RNA-Seq data</title>
<p id="Par29">Raw reads were first segregated based on the cell-specific barcode information in read 2 of the pair-ended reads. Then, sequences in read 1 were trimmed with customized scripts to remove the TSO sequence, the polyA tail sequence and sequences with low-quality bases (N &gt; 10%) or contaminated with adapters. Subsequently, the stripped read 1 sequences were aligned to the hg19 human reference genome (UCSC) using TopHat (version 2.0.12).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> Uniquely mapped reads were counted using htseq-count from the HTSeq package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> and then grouped based on the cell-specific barcodes. For each gene, we discarded duplicated transcripts with identical UMIs. Finally, the transcript number for each gene in each cell was quantified by the number of distinct UMIs of that gene.</p>
<p id="Par30">In total, we sequenced 4,664 single cells, and cells with fewer than 1,000 detected genes, 20,000 detected transcripts and 20% mapping ratio were removed. We also removed cells with too many raw reads, as these cells may not truly be single cells, thus leaving 4,233 cells for further analysis. Because most of our single cells did not reach one million UMIs, we normalized the expression value by log<sub>2</sub>(TPM/10 + 1) rather than log<sub>2</sub>(TPM + 1) (TPM: transcripts per million). By doing so, we avoided counting each transcript several times and overestimating the gene expressions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec14">
<title>Nonlinear dimensional reduction (t-SNE) and clustering</title>
<p id="Par31">We visualized our 4,233 single cells by t-SNE using the Barnes-Hut algorithm (implemented in the Rtsne package in R). First, we used the Seurat method to select the highly variable genes (HVGs) based on the log<sub>2</sub>(TPM/10 + 1) expression values. Only genes with an expression level &gt;1 and expressed in at least 3 single cells were considered, whereas single cells with &lt;1,000 expressed genes were excluded, leaving 4,213 cells for the subsequent analysis. HVGs with an average expression greater than 1 and a dispersion greater than 1 were used as inputs for the t-SNE analysis.</p>
<p id="Par32">To cluster the cells, we first used the Seurat Find Clusters function, which is an implementation of a graph-based clustering approach, to obtain clusters based on all the HVGs (for details, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://satijalab.org/seurat/pbmc-tutorial.html">http://satijalab.org/seurat/pbmc-tutorial.html</ext-link>). We merged the obtained clusters into three main groups, namely, a neuron group, a glial cell group, and a non-neural cell group (see Supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1a</xref>). Second, as the heterogeneity of fetal brain cells was limited, to further obtain accurate subgroups in each main group, we employed previously reported methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> For each iteration, this method can split a certain group into 2 subgroups. We could then decide whether the obtained subgroups should be separated into smaller subgroups based on the feature genes selected by the random forest algorithm and the DEGs of the obtained subgroups. Specifically, subgroups were classified and verified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a random forest algorithm in R. In brief, (1) we first calculated the gene expression variation for each gene across all cells as CV<sup>2</sup> = variance/mean<sup>2</sup>, which was then fitted to an inverse distribution, and we chose genes with a CV<sup>2</sup> beyond one standard error of the mean; (2) we then carried out hierarchical clustering and determined two clusters at the first split; (3) we performed a 10-fold random forest feature selection to select DEGs dividing the two clusters; (4) for each class, we selected samples with internal vote probabilities &gt; 0.6 as the training set to achieve an optimal classifier, which was used to predict the rest of the samples; (5) 100 runs of 10-fold random forest cross-validation (CV) were carried out, and the samples with internal vote probabilities &lt; 0.55 were abandoned; (6) we repeated steps 1–5 on the newly formed classes to obtain finer clusters. Finally, 13 clusters, including 8 inhibitory neuron clusters, 4 excitatory neuron clusters, and 1 Cajal-Retzius cell cluster, were identified for the neuron group (see Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>), 6 clusters for the glial cell group (see Supplementary information, Figure S<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>) and 10 clusters for the non-neural cell group (see Supplementary information, Figure S<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). In addition, subsequent t-SNE plots for each primary group were generated by the Rtsne package using the DEGs (see below) of all the clusters in that group, except in the neuron group, for which we did not include the Cajal-Retzius cell cluster.</p>

The corrected dataset was then used to perform PCA through the FactoMineR package in R. Due to the abundance of cells in our dataset, there would have been PCA bias if we had used all the cells. Thus, we randomly selected 200 excitatory and 200 interneuron cells to redo the PCA. For each of the first four PC dimensions, the top 50 correlated genes combining both positively and negatively correlated genes were selected.

Wilcox.test in R was performed to test the significance of correlation between two distributions.

<title>Developmental maturation degree across the whole cortex</title>
<p id="Par42">We used two independent methods to estimate the developmental maturation degree across the whole cortex. The first method evaluated synapse formation and function across cortical regions. The rationale was that a region is believed to be more mature if there are more cells that have formed synapses or whose synapses are functional. Thus, we calculated the mean expression of the gene set of GO terms 0007268-0007271 and 0016079-0016082 for each neuron (including both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and averaged the expression values for a certain region, which was regarded as an indicator of synapse formation and function for that region. In addition, regions with fewer than 50 excitatory neurons were excluded. We then displayed the values of the cortical regions using heatmaps (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par43">The second method estimated the ratio of excitatory neurons expressing <italic>CUX2</italic>. Because <italic>CUX2</italic> is an upper layer marker and cortical development follows an inside-out order for layer formation, a region is more mature if there are more excitatory neurons expressing <italic>CUX2</italic>. In this analysis, only excitatory neurons whose <italic>CUX2</italic> expression value based on the log<sub>2</sub>(TPM/10 + 1) was &gt; 1 were deemed to exhibit true expression. Thus, for a certain region, the ratio of excitatory neurons expressing <italic>CUX2</italic> was calculated as excitatory neurons expressing <italic>CUX2/</italic>all excitatory neurons. In addition, regions with fewer than 50 excitatory neurons were excluded. We also displayed these cortical region values using heatmaps (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>).</p>
