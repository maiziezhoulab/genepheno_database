<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease with a strong heritability, but recent evidence suggests that epigenetic dysregulation may also contribute to the pathogenesis of ASD. Especially, increased methylation at the <italic>MECP2</italic> promoter and decreased <italic>MECP2</italic> expression were observed in the brains of ASD patients. However, the causative relationship of <italic>MECP2</italic> promoter methylation and ASD has not been established. In this study, we achieved locus-specific methylation at the transcription start site (TSS) of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in Neuro-2a cells and in mice, using nuclease-deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) fused with DNA methyltransferase catalytic domains, together with five locus-targeting sgRNAs. This locus-specific epigenetic modification led to a reduced <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression and a series of behavioral alterations in mice, including reduced social interaction, increased grooming, enhanced anxiety/depression, and poor performance in memory tasks. We further found that specifically increasing the <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter methylation in the hippocampus was sufficient to induce most of the behavioral changes. Our finding therefore demonstrated for the first time the casual relationship between locus-specific DNA methylation and diseases symptoms in vivo, warranting potential therapeutic application of epigenetic editing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a group of neurodevelopmental diseases characterized by defective social interaction and stereotypic behaviors. It is highly heritable, but has great genetic and clinical heterogeneity. More than 700 risk genes have been identified for ASD, but the effect of each gene is quite small for the great majority of them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic factors may also play an important role in ASD pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. For instance, there is considerable discordance in ASD-related behaviors between the monozygotic twins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, epigenetic modification involving DNA methylation has been identified in ASD patients for several ASD-associated genes, such as <italic>MECP2</italic>, <italic>FMR1</italic>, and <italic>SHANK3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">The gene <italic>MECP2</italic> encodes methylated CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a putative transcriptional repressor that binds to methylated CpGs. Loss of <italic>MECP2</italic> results in Rett syndrome (RTT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and patients with RTT exhibit a broad range of impairment in social behaviors, cognition, and coordination. Recently, mutations in <italic>MECP2</italic> have also been identified in sporadic ASD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, increased <italic>MECP2</italic> promotor methylation and decreased <italic>MECP2</italic> expression were observed in the brain of ASD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, but their causative role in the ASD pathogenesis remains to be clarified.</p>
<p id="Par4">In this study, we examined the role of <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter methylation in ASD pathogenesis by using an epigenetic editing strategy. First, we developed an epigenome-editing approach using nuclease-deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) fused with DNA methyltransferase catalytic domains, together with five locus-targeting sgRNAs. We then demonstrated its reliability in specifically increasing the methylation at <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter using Neuro-2a cell cultures. We further generated mice with specific methylation at this TSS and demonstrated that its methylation down-regulated <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression and induced autism-like behaviors. Finally, we found that specifically increasing the <italic>Mecp2</italic> methylation in the hippocampus is able to induce most of the behavioral alteration.</p>

<title>Plasmid design and construction</title>
<p id="Par6">The pST1374-CMV-Cas9-NLS plasmid (Addgene, 44758) was used as the backbone for construction. Briefly, the CMV promotor was replaced by an EF1α promotor at first. In order to generate DNMT3L-DNMT3A single-chain fusion protein, we have introduced the C-terminal domain of human DNMT3L (amino acids M178-S380) to the N-terminus of the catalytic domain of human DNMT3A (amino acids P627-V912), with a 16-amino acid linker (SSGRSFSSGLVPRGSH). The DNMT3L-DNMT3A was then fused to the N-terminus of dead Cas9 (dCas9). Dead DNMT3A mutation (C710S in human DNMT3A) and dead Cas9 mutation (D10A, H840A, and N863A in Cas9) were introduced using Mut-Express II Fast Mutagenesis Kit V2 (Vazyme) following manufacturer’s instructions. The oligonucleotides for sgRNAs were synthesized, annealed, and cloned into the Bsa I site in the pGL3-sgRNA vector as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. For AAV-based methylation vectors, the same sequence of DNMT3A was fused to the N-terminus of dCas9, and dCas9 was split into two parts between amino acids E573 and C574. The sequences for primers were listed in Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">S3</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
<p id="Par7">Neuro-2a (N2a) cells (from male mice) were purchased from ATCC (ATCC, CCL-131) without mycoplasma contamination and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS in 37 °C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Twenty six cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s protocols.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">
<title>T7ENI cleavage assay and sequencing</title>
<p id="Par8">Cells were harvested with lysis buffer (10 μM Tris-HCl, 0.4 M NaCl, 2 μM EDTA, 1% SDS and 100 μg/ml Proteinase K) at 55 °C for 6 h. Genomic DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform and isopropyl alcohol precipitation according to standard procedures.</p>
<p id="Par9">The editing efficiency was estimated by T7 endonuclease I assay. Briefly, the TSS region of <italic>Mecp2</italic> were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and the products were purified by cleanup kit (Axygen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The sequences for primers were listed in Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">S3</xref>. Purified PCR products were denatured in NEB buffer2 (NEB), and then digested with T7ENI (Vazyme) for 30 min. Digested PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. PCR-amplified fragments were also ligated into pMD19T vector (Takara). After transformation, colonies with ligation products were sequenced for analyzing the editing efficiency.</p>

<sec id="Sec7">
<title>Immunofluorescent staining</title>
<p id="Par10">Mice were trans-cardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and brains were dissected into 4% PFA for post-fixation overnight. Following dehydration in 30% sucrose, brains were sectioned at 30 µm and subjected to immunofluorescence staining. Briefly, floating cryosections were washed in PBS, and then incubated overnight with primary antibody (rabbit anti-MeCP2, 1:1000; cell signaling, 3456 S) diluted in blocking buffer (1.5% BSA, 0.1% Triton-X, 5% NGS, pH7.4, 1 × PBS). After three washes in PBST (0.1% Triton-X, pH7.4, 1 × PBS), sections were incubated for 2 h with the secondary antibody (594-AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L), 1:1000; Jackson, 711–585–152). Hoechst 33258 (1:5000; Yeasen) was used for nuclei staining. After three washes in PBST, samples were mounted on the glass slices. Images were captured using a Zeiss Axioimager Z2 microscope and processed using the Image J Fiji software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec8">
<title>Western blot</title>
<p id="Par11">Brains were dissected into ice-cold PBS, the hippocampus and parietal cortex were rapidly dissected out. Tissue samples were lysed with 500 μl ice-cold RIPA buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology) containing 1 mM protease inhibitor PMSF (Beyotime Biotechnology) and PIC (Sigma). Cell lysates were homogenized by a homogenizer (PRO Scientific, Inc.) and the protein concentration was determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermofisher, 23227). Protein lysates were dissolved in SDS-PAGE protein loading buffer and heated at 95 <sup>o</sup>C for 10 min. Samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels (Epizyme, Lnc) and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Immobillon). After blocking with TBST solution containing 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-MeCP2, 1:2000; cell signaling, 3456S; mouse anti-Actin, 1:5000; Sigma, A4700–2ML) followed by HRP-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (1:5000; Vector lab). Blots were imaged with Amersham Imager 600 and quantified using the Image J Fiji software.</p>

<sec id="Sec9">
<title>RT-qPCR</title>
<p id="Par12">Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells or tissues using TransZol Up Plus RNA Kit (TransGen). RNA was converted to cDNA using RT Master Mix (Takara, RR036A). Gene expression levels were measured with ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primer information was described in Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">S3</xref>.</p>

<title>Mouse zygote injection and embryo transfer</title>
<p id="Par13">Female C57BL/6 mice (4-week-old) were super-ovulated and mated to C57BL/6 male mice. Zygotes were collected from oviducts of the female mice. For zygotes injection, well mixed plasmids (25 ng/μl 5U6 sgRNAs + 50 ng/μl DNMT3L-DNMT3A-dCas9 or 50 ng/μl DNMT3L-DNMT3A-mut- dCas9) were injected into the cytoplasm of zygotes in a droplet of M2 medium containing 5 µg/ml cytochalasin B (CB) using a piezo (Primetech) microinjector. The injected zygotes were cultured in KSOM medium at 37 °C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and transferred to oviducts of pseudopregnant ICR females at 0.5 dpc.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec11">
<title>Behavior test overview</title>
<p id="Par14">Male mice at the age of 3–18 weeks were used for all tests. The mice were transferred to the animal facility 2 weeks before the behavioral tests. Mice was allowed to habituate to the testing room for at least 30 min. Three chamber, EPM, open field tests were measured by automated software. STFP, novel objective recognition, tail suspension, and self-grooming tests were scored manually.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec12">
<title>Social interaction tests</title>
<p id="Par15">Three-chamber test: The three-chamber test was performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The apparatus was comprised of a rectangular box (70 cm × 36 cm × 30 cm) divided into three chambers with partitions. The test mouse was placed in the closed middle chamber to habituate for 5 min. Each side chamber contained an empty wire cage. After habituation, one stranger mouse (stranger 1, 10–12-week-old male) was introduced to the wire cage on one side. Another empty cage contained an inanimate object. The test mouse was allowed to explore the entire apparatus for 10 min, and time spent in each chamber was recorded. A new stranger 2 mouse (10–12-week-old male) was introduced to the cage containing an inanimate object before. The test mouse spent another 10 min in exploring the entire apparatus and time spent in each chamber was recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec13">
<title>Motor, anxiety-, and depression-related behavioral tests</title>
<p id="Par16">Open field: Locomotor activity was assessed over 10 min in an open field apparatus (38 cm × 38 cm × 38 cm). Locomotor activity was evaluated through total distance traveled by each mouse.</p>
<p id="Par17">Elevated plus maze: The elevated plus maze (EPM) was comprised of two close arms (26 cm × 7 cm) and two open arms (26 cm × 7 cm) elevated 50 cm above the floor. Mice were placed in the center facing close arms and allowed to explore for 10 min. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed by time traveled in the open arms.</p>
<p id="Par18">Tail suspension: Mice were gently suspended by the tail. Depression behavior was assessed over 6 min and evaluated through time of immobility except for respiration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec14">
<title>Memory-related tests</title>
<p id="Par19">Novel-object recognition: Novel-object recognition assay was carried out as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Two identical cubes were placed at the right and left corners of the apparatus. Mice were placed at the mid-point of the wall opposite the objects. After exposure for 10 min, mice were remove from the apparatus and have a rest for 1 h. One familiar object was placed at one corner of the apparatus, and one novel object was placed at the other corner. The animals were placed back into the apparatus and the duration of direct contact with two objects was recorded.</p>
<p id="Par20">Social transmission of food preference (STFP): STFP assay was performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In this test, each mouse (observer) was fasted for 16 h in a single cage before test. Another female mouse, unfamiliar with the “observer”, was fed with cocaine for 30 min as “demonstrator”. After 30 min interaction time between “observer” and “demonstrator”, “observers” were fed with two types of food containing cocaine or cinnamon. The consumption of cocaine- or cinnamon-containing food was measured to test the memory ability. Normal mice preferred eating food containing cocaine instead of cinnamon because of the memory of the scent.</p>

<sec id="Sec15">
<title>Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing</title>
<p id="Par21">Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) libraries were generated according to the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Genomic DNA (200 ng) was digested by <italic>Msp</italic> I to generate short fragments in a methylation-insensitive manner. After the digested DNA fragments were end-repaired and A-tailed, they were ligated to methylated Illumina adapters using Truseq DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) following the user manual. The ligation products at the range of 150–700 bp were selected to perform bisulfite conversion using MethylCode™ Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Life Technologies). Conversion products were PCR-amplified using uracil + PCR polymerase (Zymo). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq X Ten platform under control of Hiseq Control Software.</p>

<title>Primary neuron isolation and culture</title>
<p id="Par22">Hippocampus were dissected from E16 mouse embryos in DMEM-HG (HyClone) at 4 °C. After removal of all the meninges, the tissues were digested with the digest medium (1 mg/ml papain, 5 mM EDTA, DNase Ι 0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and the tissues were re-suspended in the digest medium. After stop the reaction with FBS, cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated plates. After culturing with plating medium (Neurobasal® Medium, 5% FBS, Supplement B27, GlutaMax Ι, Gentamycin) for 6 h, the cells were cultured in the culture medium (Neurobasal® Medium, Supplement B27, GlutaMax Ι, Gentamycin).</p>

<title>Targeted DNA methylation at the <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter in Neuro-2a cells</title>
<p id="Par26">To study the role of <italic>MECP2</italic> promoter methylation in the ASD pathogenesis, we utilized a dCas9-based DNA methylation-editing tool to specifically increase methylation at the transcriptional start site (TSS) of <italic>Mecp2</italic>. To enhance the targeting efficiency, we fused the catalytic domain of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A (DNMT3ACD) and its co-factor DNMT3L in tandem to the N-terminus of dCas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A catalytic dead DNMT3ACD mutant was used as a control. We also constructed a multi-sgRNA vector that simultaneously expresses five sgRNAs targeting the ~500 bp TSS region of <italic>Mecp2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). All sgRNAs were demonstrated to be active as they can induce site-specific DNA cleavage with CRISPR-Cas9 system (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S1A, B</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Targeted DNA methylation of Mecp2 promoter in N-2a cells using DNMT3L-DNMT3A-dCas9.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Graphical representation of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> locus showing sgRNAs target location.

<p id="Par27">To examine the targeted methylation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter, we transfected Neuro-2a (N2a) cells with DNMT3L-DNMT3A-dCas9 and multi-sgRNA vectors (referred hereafter as “methylation vectors”). At the same time, DNMT3L-DNMT3Amut-dCas9/multi-sgRNAs (“control vectors-1”) and DNMT3L-DNMT3A-dCas9/scramble-sgRNA (“control vectors-2”) were used as two negative controls. The transfected cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin and 20 μg/ml blasticidin for 2 days. The surviving cells were harvested to prepare for genomic DNA, and DNA methylation was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. As expected, the overall methylation level at the <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter was up-regulated to about 65% with the transfection of “methylation vectors”, while the methylation level of this region was barely detectable with the treatment of “control vectors-1” or “control vectors-2” (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression was significantly down-regulated as analyzed by qPCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par28">To analyze the potential off-target effects, we collected N2a cells at 48 h after transfection and performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analysis. We found that the global DNA methylation patterns, total methylation level, and methylation proportion were similar between the methylation and control groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S2</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par29">Furthermore, we measured the DNA methylation levels of 131 predicted off-target sites using bisulfite sequencing (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">S1</xref>). Only 4 out of 131 regions showed slightly higher levels of DNA methylation in the methylation group as compared to the controls (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">S1</xref>). Hence, our system represents a precise tool for locus-specific DNA methylation.</p>

<p id="Par31">The genomic DNA from the tails of 3-week-old mice were subjected to bisulfate sequencing for analyzing the efficiency of the targeted DNA methylation. We found that male mice in the control group displayed less than 5% methylation at the <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>). By contrast, the males from the methylation group showed a significantly higher methylation at the target locus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c, e</xref>). As <italic>Mecp2</italic> is an X-linked gene, the basal DNA methylation in this region is quite high in female mice. There was no significant difference in the DNA methylation in females from control and methylation groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S3</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par32">We also determined the levels of targeted DNA methylation in a variety of tissues. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>, the DNA methylation levels in the hippocampus and parietal cortex were significantly higher in the methylation group relative to the control group.

<title>Targeted DNA methylation at <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter causes autism-like behaviors</title>
<p id="Par34">It is well known that abnormal <italic>MECP2</italic> expression leads to ASD in human and ASD-like behaviors in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In order to investigate whether manipulation of DNA methylation at the <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter will cause abnormal behaviors in mice, we first examined the social interaction by using the three-chamber test. Prior to the social interaction, each mouse showed no preference in the chambers (data not shown). We found that mice from both methylation and control groups showed similar preference to the mouse over an object (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). When facing a familiar mouse versus an unfamiliar mouse, mice from the control group preferred to explore the unfamiliar mice, whereas mice from the methylation group showed no preference between familiar and unfamiliar mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). This result indicates that mice from the methylation group displayed a reduction in conspecific recognition or in their interest for social novelty compared with the control mice. Furthermore, we found that mice from the methylation group spent significantly longer time in self-grooming (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>), reflecting an increased repetitive behavior.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Targeted DNA methylation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> caused ASD-Like phenotypes in mice.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Social behavior as examined by the three-chamber test.

<p id="Par39">In this study, we demonstrated a critical role of <italic>Mecp2</italic> promotor methylation in the ASD pathogenesis, by locus-specific methylation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> promotor using an improved dCas9-based methylation targeting method. Methylation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> promotor led to reduction in <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene expression, and alteration of a panel of behaviors mimicking the ASD symptoms. We further showed that specifically increasing the <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter methylation in the hippocampus was sufficient to induce most of the behavioral changes.</p>
<p id="Par40">DNA methylation on cytosine of a gene promoter usually leads to the silencing of gene expression. Abnormal DNA methylation has been observed in cancer and neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The functional significance of DNA methylation has been exploited by using transgenic mice with disruption of specific genes involved in the DNA (de)methylation, or DNMTs inhibitors, such as azacitidine and decitabine. However, such approach can only be applied non-selectively at the global genome level, but not at specific loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par41">The recently developed genome-modifying tools, such as zinc fingers (ZFs), transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), or the CRISPR/Cas9 system have been successfully applied to loci-specific epigenome editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Several groups successfully repurposing the CRISPR-Cas9 system for targeted DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In this study, we further improved the targeting efficiency of the dCas9-based vector by adding a sequence encoding DNMT3L, which functions as a co-factor of DNMT3A to enhance DNA methylation. As a result, the locus-specific methylation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> promotor down-regulated <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression, and mice with <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter methylation exhibited ASD-like phenotypes. Our study thus provides the first evidence to support the causative relationship between DNA methylation and ASD-like phenotypes.</p>
<p id="Par42">Most of the behaviors from mice with Mecp2 promoter methylation were in agreement with previous findings from Mecp2-deficient mice. However, there are contradict data in the anxiety-related behaviors by using different strains of Mecp2-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In our study, increasing Mecp2 promoter methylation led to elevated anxiety levels. Furthermore, hippocampus-specific Mecp2 promoter methylation also induced increased anxiety, reduced social interaction, and defective memory, which is consistent with the results from hippocampus-specific Mecp2 knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, no significant abnormality in locomotive and grooming activities, and depression-like behavior were observed in the mice with hippocampus-specific <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter methylation, implying these behaviors may be related to other brain areas other than hippocampus.</p>
<p id="Par43">Loci-specific epigenome editing not only help understand the causative relationship between DNA methylation in a specific DNA loci and pathological situations, but also have potential therapeutic applications. Indeed, Choudhury et al. used dCas9-TET1 fusion to selectively de-methylate targeted regions within BRCA1 promoter as directed by the designed single-guide RNAs (sgRNA), leading to the transcriptional up-regulation of the gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Recently, Liu et al. demonstrated that a locus-specific demethylation of Fragile X mental retardation (<italic>FMR1</italic>) gene, a putative fragile X syndrome (FXS)-causative gene, could correct the phenotype of FXS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Xu et al. developed a high-fidelity CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-specific dioxygenase to rescue gene expression in vitro and attenuate renal fibrosis in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In this study, by targeted editing of DNA methylation, we demonstrated that methylation at the <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter is sufficient to down-regulated <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression and induce autism-like behaviors in mice. Further, <italic>Mecp2</italic> methylation specifically in the hippocampus is able to induce most of the behavioral alteration. Our finding therefore demonstrated DNA methylation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter plays a causative role in autism-related symptoms, warranted potential drug discovery targeting such epigenetic alteration.</p>
