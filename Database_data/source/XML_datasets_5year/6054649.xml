<p id="Par1">Induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) reprogrammed from somatic cells have great potentials in cell replacement therapies and in vitro modeling of neural diseases. Direct conversion of fibroblasts into iNSCs has been shown to depend on a couple of key neural progenitor transcription factors (TFs), raising the question of whether such direct reprogramming can be achieved by non-neural progenitor TFs. Here we report that the non-neural progenitor TF Ptf1a alone is sufficient to directly reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts into self-renewable iNSCs capable of differentiating into functional neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and improving cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer’s disease mouse models when transplanted. The reprogramming activity of Ptf1a depends on its Notch-independent interaction with Rbpj which leads to subsequent activation of expression of TF genes and Notch signaling required for NSC specification, self-renewal, and homeostasis. Together, our data identify a non-canonical and safer approach to establish iNSCs for research and therapeutic purposes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s, and glaucoma have become a global threat to human health. Traditional treatment attenuates disease progress but is overall ineffective since lost cells are not replenished in the lesion. Endogenous neurogenesis is insufficient for replenishment and results in only very limited self-repair in these diseases. Current focus of regenerative medicine emphasizes on how to generate a large number of neurons, glias or their progenitors that have the ability to integrate and function in the affected tissues, thereby providing a promising approach to lesion repair. At present, clinical application of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has been undermined by their tumorigenic risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. By contrast, neural stem cells (NSCs) have proven to be a safe cell resource that is not tumor prone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and therefore provide a powerful strategy to patient-specific cell replacement therapies. They also provide a useful tool for drug discovery and in vitro disease modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Somatic cell reprogramming is a valuable tool for deriving patient-specific NSCs. Recent work has demonstrated that mouse and human somatic cells can be reprogrammed to transdifferentiate into induced NSCs (iNSCs)/neural progenitor cells by defined tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and/or chemicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In most cases of TF-induced iNSCs, reprogramming is achieved by Sox2 alone or Sox2 in combination with various other TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. More recently, a single zinc-finger TF, Zfp521, has been shown to directly reprogram human fibroblasts into iNSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Thus, it appears that iNSC generation by TF-induced somatic cell reprogramming critically depends on Sox2 or Zfp521, which are normally expressed in proliferative neural progenitors and are key regulators of neurogenesis in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In fact, Sox2 has been postulated as a master regulator of direct iNSC reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This then begs the question of whether neural progenitor TFs are the necessity for such direct reprogramming and whether it can be achieved by non-neural progenitor TFs.</p>
<p id="Par5">Previously, we and others have identified numerous TFs, which are expressed in mitotic progenitors and/or postmitotic cells during retinal development, and have key roles in controlling retinal cell specification and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We were interested in finding out whether any of these progenitor TFs and non-progenitor TFs was capable of transdifferentiating fibroblasts into iNSCs or functional neurons. Ptf1a (pancreas TF-1α) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF that has an indispensable role in the development of retina, cerebellum, spinal cord, and pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Here we report that unlike other typical reprogramming TFs of iNSCs, Ptf1a is selectively expressed in postmitotic precursors in the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, unlike a number of other retinal TFs that we tested, ectopic expression of Ptf1a directly converts mouse and human fibroblasts into self-renewable and tripotent iNSCs with high efficiency. This reprogramming activity requires Notch-independent interaction between Ptf1a and Rbpj, as well as subsequent activation of expression of TF genes and Notch signaling involved in NSC homeostasis. Further, transplantation of Ptf1a-reprogrammed iNSCs improves cognitive function of AD mouse models.</p>

<title>Expression of Ptf1a in non-neural progenitor cells in the CNS</title>
<p id="Par6">In the developing CNS, Ptf1a has a limited expression pattern and has an essential role in specifying a few neuronal cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Previously, it has been shown to be transiently expressed in postmitotic neural precursors in the retina and spinal cord<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Indeed, at E12.5, immunolabeling with an anti-Ptf1a antibody revealed very few cells co-expressing Ptf1a and the pan-proliferation marker Ki67 in the retina, spinal cord, cerebellum, and hindbrain (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>), indicating that Ptf1a is mostly absent from dividing neural progenitor cells in the CNS. In agreement with this, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data show that there is only low expression of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> but high expression of TF neural progenitor markers <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> in the E14.5 mouse retina, and that <italic>Ptf1a</italic> is absent from the mouse SCR029 NSCs, whereas both <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic> are highly expressed in NSCs compared with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Ptf1a</italic> transcripts exist in very low abundance in E11.5–E18 mouse CNS compared with that of TF neural progenitor markers <italic>Pax6</italic>, <italic>Olig2</italic>, and <italic>Zfp521</italic>, as determined by the mouse ENCODE transcriptome project (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). These results suggest that Ptf1a is a non-neural progenitor TF that is unlikely involved in the generation of NSCs in vivo.</p>

<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Reprogramming of MEFs by Ptf1a into self-renewable iNSCs</title>
<p id="Par7">Given the demonstrated reprogramming activities of some TFs, the expression of Ptf1a in postmitotic neurons suggests a possibility that it may be able to convert fibroblasts into mature and functional neurons. However, repeated attempts to use Ptf1a to reprogram MEFs into differentiated neurons by established procedures all failed. We then tested whether Ptf1a had the ability to directly reprogram MEFs into iNSCs, albeit somewhat counterintuitively given the expression of Ptf1a almost exclusively in postmitotic precursors. However, when MEFs were infected with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Ptf1a lentiviruses and cultured in the N3 medium containing epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and Dox, they started to change morphology and form clusters at day 6, from which numerous neurospheres emerged by day 9 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b, d</xref>). Control MEFs infected with Dox-inducible green fluorescent protein (GFP) lentiviruses barely formed any normally shaped neurospheres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, d</xref>). When multiple Ptf1a-induced neurospheres were collected as a mixture, dissociated, and replated, they rapidly formed new secondary neurospheres starting from day 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>), indicating their self-renewal ability.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Ptf1a directly converts mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into self-renewable neurospheres. <bold>a</bold> Schematic depicting the procedure to generate neurospheres from MEFs by Ptf1a lentiviruses. MEFs were prepared from E12.5 C57BL6/J mouse embryos and infected with tet-on Ptf1a lentiviruses at day 0. Neurosphere-like structures gradually appeared in 9–14 days when cultured in N3 medium containing EGF, bFGF, and doxycycline. <bold>b</bold> Morphological changes of MEFs infected with control GFP or Ptf1a lentiviruses. Numerous cell clusters could be seen in Ptf1a virus-infected MEFs by day 6 in culture, but rarely in GFP virus-infected MEFs. From day 9 onward, many typical neurosphere-like structures formed in Ptf1a-transduced MEFs, whereas in GFP-transduced MEFs there were only few cell aggregates, which were morphologically different from typical neurospheres. <bold>c</bold> Dissociated cells from collected primary neurospheres formed secondary neurospheres in 3 days in culture and morphologically homogeneous larger neurospheres by day 7. <bold>d</bold> Quantification of Ptf1a-induced neurospheres. MEFs (4 × 10<sup>4</sup>) were seeded into each well of 12-well plates, infected with Ptf1a or GFP viruses, and neurosphere-like structures in each well were then counted at day 10 and 14 following virus infection. There were significantly more neurospheres in Ptf1a-induced samples at day 10 and 14. Data are presented as mean ± SD (<italic>n</italic> = 3).

<p id="Par8">We picked primary neurospheres individually to clonally derive multiple reprogrammed mouse iNSC (miNSC) cell lines (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). We seeded them in separate plate wells in the presence of Dox and found that cells with NSC morphology grew gradually from adhered neurospheres. They were further expanded and passaged in the presence or absence of Dox for 30 generations. At about passage 10, all miNSC lines ceased to generate neurospheres, became homogeneous, and grew in a monolayer as typical NSCs would (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Consistent with the self-renewal capability of each clonally derived miNSC line, we found that ~32.6% of miNSC10 cells were pulse-labeled by EdU, which was more than that (18.9%) of the wild-type mouse NSC line SCR029 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e, f</xref>). Thus, miNSCs reprogrammed from MEFs by Ptf1a were proliferative and self-renewable. By contrast, MEFs infected with GFP lentiviruses failed to generate neurospheres immunoreactive for typical NSC markers and the few spheroids likely formed spontaneously looked abnormal and lacked any ability to expand in culture (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par9">To confirm that Ptf1a indeed directly induced miNSCs from MEFs, we performed immunofluorescent staining using antibodies against several NSC markers. This revealed strong expression of exogenous Ptf1a in neurospheres, which in turn induced marked expression of NSC marker proteins Sox2, Pax6, Olig2, and Nestin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). In monolayered miNSCs, the expression of Sox2, Pax6, and Nestin remained high (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Consistent with protein expression levels, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assays demonstrated that the expression level of <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Pax6</italic>, <italic>Olig2</italic>, and <italic>Nestin</italic> transcripts was greatly elevated in miNSC5, 10, and 12 lines compared with MEFs, just like in the control mouse NSC line SCR029 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). By contrast, there was only minimal or no expression of pluripotent factor genes <italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic>, and <italic>Klf4</italic> in miNSC lines compared with mouse ESCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). Moreover, as a result of cell-fate change, the expression of MEF marker genes <italic>Snai1</italic>, <italic>Twist2</italic>, and <italic>Col1a1</italic> was drastically reduced in miNSC lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). In agreement with active transcription of the <italic>Nestin</italic> gene in miNSCs, its promoter was hypomethylated in miNSC and control SCR029 cells but hypermethylated in MEFs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). However, the promoters of <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> were hypermethylated in all three cell types (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>), consistent with the absence of pluripotent factor gene expression in these cells.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Characterization of Ptf1a-reprogrammed iNSCs. <bold>a</bold> Neurospheres induced from MEFs by Ptf1a at day 8 and 10 were immunoreactive for Ptf1a, Sox2, Pax6, Nestin, or Olig2. Monolayered miNSC10 cells were also immunoreactive for Ptf1a, Sox2, Pax6, or Nestin. Cells were counterstained with nuclear DAPI. Scale bars, 80 μm. <bold>b</bold> qRT-PCR analysis showed that in comparison with MEFs, there was a great increase in expression of <italic>Nestin</italic>, <italic>Olig2, Pax6</italic>, and <italic>Sox2</italic> genes in Ptf1a-derived miNSC5, miNSC10, and miNSC12 cells, as well as in control SCR029 NSCs. Data are presented as mean ± SD (<italic>n</italic> = 4). Asterisks indicate significance in unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test: *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0005. <bold>c</bold> qRT-PCR assay showed that compared with mouse ESCs, there was only minimal or no expression of pluripotent factor genes <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic>, and <italic>Oct4</italic> in miNSC and control NSC cells.

<p id="Par11">To further confirm the NSC identity of the miNSCs, we profiled transcriptomes of miNSC10, SCR029, and MEF cells by RNA-seq analysis. Scatter plots of gene expression levels among miNSC10, SCR029, and MEF cells revealed that miNSC10 and SCR209 cells were similar to each other but were highly divergent from MEFs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>a-c). In agreement with these results, hierarchical cluster analysis also showed a high degree of similarity between miNSC10 and SCR029 cells but great difference between them and MEFs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). Numerous genes were downregulated or upregulated in expression levels in miNSCs compared with MEFs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>). We performed gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the upregulated genes followed by network visualization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>). Two major groups of clustered networks emerged. One was enriched for neural development-relevant GO (Gene Ontology) terms such as neurogenesis, neuron differentiation, nervous system development, regulation of neurogenesis, brain development, and axonogenesis. The other was enriched for cell cycle-relevant GO terms including cell division, mitotic cell cycle, nuclear division, sister chromatid segregation, and regulation of cell cycle. These data are consistent with miNSCs as NSCs and their capacity to proliferate and self-renew.

<title>Tripotency of Ptf1a-reprogrammed miNSCs</title>
<p id="Par13">We asked whether miNSCs reprogrammed by the non-neural progenitor TF Ptf1a had the potential to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes as typical NSCs would (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). When cultured in neural differentiation medium, in a few days, miNSCs underwent robust morphological changes with decreased cell body size and pervasive neurite extension (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). At 2–3 weeks of culture, many cells differentiated into neurons immunoreactive for Tuj1, Map2, Dcx (doublecortin), NeuN, Tau, peripherin, or GABA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). Quantification at 3 weeks showed that 83.3% of all cells were positive for Tuj1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). Furthermore, different miNSC lines (miNSC5, 10 and 12) displayed a similar capacity to differentiate into neurons immunoreactive for Tuj1 or Map2 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). Under astrocyte differentiation condition, 87.2% of differentiated cells developed into glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c, e</xref>). In oligodendrocyte differentiation medium, miNSCs were able to differentiate into oligodendrocytes immunoreactive for O1, CNP, or MBP, and 26.6% of differentiated cells were O1-positive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c, e</xref>). Thus, Ptf1a-reprogrammed miNSCs are tripotent, being able to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>In vitro differentiation potential of Ptf1a-reprogrammed miNSCs. <bold>a</bold> Schematic showing that miNSCs reprogrammed directly from MEFs by Ptf1a are able to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes under proper culture conditions. <bold>b</bold> miNSC10 cells underwent drastic morphological changes to form neuron-like cells when the culture medium was switched from NSC medium to neural differentiation medium. <bold>c</bold> miNSC10 cells could be differentiated into neurons immunoreactive for Tuj1, Map2, Dcx, NeuN, Tau, Peripherin, or GABA.

<p id="Par14">The neurons differentiated from miNSCs exhibited active membrane properties. Following 2 weeks of differentiation, most of the neurons (seven out of nine) generated potassium currents and small sodium currents but no action potentials, suggesting that they were functionally immature. At 3 weeks, whole-cell patch-clamp recording showed that some differentiated neurons (4 out of 11) had typical sodium and potassium currents, and exhibited multiple action potential responses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>f–i). Moreover, some neurons (6 out of 26) showed spontaneous postsynaptic currents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4j</xref>). Consistent with this observation, double-immunostaining revealed that numerous neurons were labeled by punctate synapsin staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>), indicating the formation of synaptic connections between differentiated neurons. Therefore, Ptf1a-reprogrammed miNSCs are able to differentiate into functional neurons.</p>
<p id="Par15">We assessed the potential of Ptf1a-reprogrammed miNSCs to differentiate into the three cell lineages in vivo. miNSCs were tagged by GFP-expressing lentiviruses and transplanted into the hippocampal region of adult mice by injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a, b</xref>). One to 1.5 months after transplantation, immunolabeling showed that GFP-tagged miNSCs survived, integrated, and differentiated in the mouse hippocampus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Some of them differentiated into mature-looking neurons with multiple processes that were immunoreactive for Dcx, NeuN, GABA, or vGLUT3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>c–f). Some others differentiated into GFAP-positive astrocytes or Olig2-positive oligodendrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b, g</xref>). Quantification of colocalized cells revealed that there were 5.5%, 4.7%, 2.6%, 78.4%, and 10.5% of GFP-positive cells that differentiated into NeuN+ , GABA+ , vGLUT3+ , GFAP+ , and Olig2+ cells, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5l</xref>). Thus, Ptf1a-reprogrammed miNSCs have the multipotency to differentiate into the three neuronal and glial cell types in vivo. In addition, we observed that the differentiated neurons developed mature dendritic spines with typical head–neck structures, and that their dendrites were in direct contact with multiple synapsin+ presynaptic terminals of the surrounding host cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>h–k), suggesting that miNSC-derived neurons are able to form synaptic connections and functionally integrate into the existing neuronal circuitry.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>In vivo differentiation potential of Ptf1a-reprogrammed miNSCs. <bold>a</bold> miNSC10 cells were infected with lentiviruses containing CMV promoter-driven GFP and neomycin.

GFP-tagged miNSCs were transplanted into the hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mouse models of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par17">To investigate the learning and memory behavior, novel object recognition test, Y-maze test, and Morris water maze test were carried out. The results showed that between saline- and miNSC-injected mice, there was no difference in the time spent on the novel object in the novel object recognition test and no difference in the total percentage of correct spontaneous alternations (SAP) in the Y-maze test (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d, e</xref>). However, the Morris water maze test (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>) showed that the average escape latency was significantly decreased for miNSC-transplanted animals compared with the control group at D6 (testing day) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>), and that miNSC-transplanted mice spent more time in the target quadrant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>). Target annulus crossovers revealed that miNSC-transplanted mice appeared to have a preference for the target platform location but this preference did not reach statistical significance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>). Together, these results suggest that transplanted miNSCs can significantly improve spatial learning and memory of the APP/PS1 AD mouse model.</p>
<p id="Par18">We also evaluated the therapeutic potential of miNSCs in the Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> (amyloid β peptide 1–40)-injured AD mouse model, which was created by injection of Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> into the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

We found that in the novel object recognition test, the time spent on the novel object was significantly decreased for Aβ<sub>1-40</sub>-injected mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9d</xref>).

<p id="Par19">To test whether transplanted miNSCs produce any therapeutic effect in the Aβ<sub>1-40</sub>-injured AD mouse model, GFP-tagged miNSCs were transplanted into the same location 2 weeks after Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> injection.

<title>Dependency of Ptf1a reprogramming on Rbpj interaction</title>
<p id="Par20">It has been shown previously that Ptf1a forms a trimeric DNA-binding complex with Rbpj and an E-protein independent of Notch signaling to specify pancreatic lineages and GABAergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We investigated whether Notch-independent interaction between Ptf1a and Rbpj is also required for the Ptf1a reprogramming activity. In MEFs, western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Rbpj protein was endogenously expressed, and that exogenously expressed Ptf1a could co-immunoprecipitate Rbpj (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). A mutant form of Ptf1a, Ptf1a<sup>W298A</sup>, which contains a substitution of a conserved amino acid residue tryptophan by alanine at the C-terminus, has previously been shown to disrupt Ptf1a interaction with Rbpj but not E-protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). We found that MEFs transduced with Dox-inducible Ptf1a<sup>W298A</sup> lentiviruses did not undergo typical morphological changes to form cell clusters by day 6 and produced only few normal-shaped neurosphere-like aggregates by day 9–14, unlike those infected with wild-type Ptf1a viruses, which generated hundreds of neurospheres by day 9–14 in a well of 12-well plate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b, c</xref>). Consistent with this observation, MEFs infected with Ptf1a<sup>W298A</sup> lentiviruses failed to express NSC protein markers Sox2, Pax6, or Nestin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d</xref>). Thus, interaction with Rbpj is a prerequisite to Ptf1a reprogramming activity.

<p id="Par23">Notch signaling is a classic cell contact-dependent signaling pathway required for NSC proliferation and self-renewal, as well as for prevention of untimely neuronal differentiation of NSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

<title>Reprogramming of human fibroblasts by Ptf1a into iNSCs</title>
<p id="Par24">Using a protocol similar to MEF reprogramming, we generated neurospheres from human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) by transduction of Dox-inducible Ptf1a lentiviruses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a, b</xref>). Interestingly, completely monolayered hiNSCs (human iNSCs) were obtained only when we expanded and passaged neurospheres in the absence of Dox (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9c, d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">15a</xref>). At passage 20 in the absence of Dox, hiNSCs became completely monolayered without forming any neurospheres, whereas in the presence of Dox there were still many neurospheres present in the culture up to passage 32 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">15a</xref>), suggesting that Dox-induced exogenous Ptf1a had an inhibitory effect on the generation of typical monolayered iNSCs. qRT-PCR assays revealed that the expression levels of NSC markers <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>OLIG2</italic>, and <italic>NESTIN</italic> were several fold higher in hiNSCs cultured in the absence of Dox than in the presence of Dox (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">15b</xref>), providing an explanation why hiNSCs behaved more like typical NSCs in the absence of Dox.

By contrast, they exhibited high levels of NSC marker protein expression, including SOX2, PAX6, NESTIN, OLIG2, and FABP7(BLBP) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>e–i). Under various differentiation conditions, hiNSCs were able to differentiate into neurons immunoreactive for TUJ1, MAP2, NEUN, TAU, or GABA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>j–n), astrocytes immunoreactive for GFAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9o</xref>), or oligodendrocytes immunoreactive for O1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9p</xref>).

Therefore, Ptf1a has a similar activity to reprogram human fibroblasts into tripotent NSCs.</p>
<p id="Par26">We characterized the electrophysiological properties of hiNSC-derived neurons by whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Two weeks after in vitro differentiation, most of the neurons (11 out of 17) generated sodium and potassium currents, some of which looked typical of functional neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9r</xref>). Some of the differentiated neurons showed action potentials (5 out of 17) and some of them (5 out of 17) exhibited spontaneous postsynaptic activities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>s–u), suggesting that in vitro differentiated neurons can form synaptic connections. In agreement, many neurons displayed punctate immunolabeling for synapsin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9q</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par28">To our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the first time that a single non-neural progenitor TF has the ability to directly convert somatic cells into iNSCs, casting doubt on the hypothesis of Sox2 as a master regulator of direct iNSC reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We show that Ptf1a is absent from NSCs, exhibits very low abundance in the developing CNS, and is expressed only in a small population of postmitotic cells within a few selective CNS tissues. Thus, Ptf1a can be hardly considered as a neural progenitor TF and is unlikely involved in NSC generation in vivo. Yet, unexpectedly, it displays a strong activity in directly reprogramming somatic cells into tripotent iNSCs, suggesting that neural progenitor TFs are unnecessary in driving TF-mediated reprogramming of iNSCs, and that non-neural progenitor TFs may be able to do the same as long as they have a similar driving activity. Furthermore, Ptf1a appears to be very efficient in converting fibroblasts into neurospheres. The efficiency of Sox2 alone is &lt; 0.1%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In comparison, the efficiency of Ptf1a is &gt; 0.5% at day 14 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). In previous studies of TF-mediated iNSCs, reprogramming usually involved neural progenitor TFs Sox2 or Zfp521, either alone or in combination with other TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, both Sox2 and Zfp521 present tumorigenic risks. For example, Sox2 is associated with osteosarcoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, skin squamous-cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, and various other cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Zfp521 is linked with acute B-lineage leukemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> and medulloblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. By contrast, Pft1a is inversely associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Therefore, Ptf1a may offer a safer and more efficient solution than any other TF or combinations of TFs in generating iNSCs from somatic cells for potential therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p id="Par29">Our work has demonstrated the feasibility of using Ptf1a-reprogrammed iNSCs as a cell replacement therapy to treat neurodegenerative diseases. First, Ptf1a has the capacity to reprogram not only murine but also human fibroblasts into self-renewable iNSCs, providing a renewable human cell source. Second, Ptf1a-induced miNSCs exhibited proper survivability and tripotent differentiation potential (neuron, astrocyte, and oligodendrocyte) when transplanted into the hippocampus of normal mice. Third, we tested whether transplanted miNSCs had any therapeutic effect in treating murine AD models and found that transplantation of Ptf1a-reprogrammed miNSCs significantly improved cognitive dysfunction, in particular spatial learning and memory of the AD mice. The therapeutic effect achieved by Ptf1a-induced miNSCs is at least compatible with that of ESC-derived NSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> but without the potential tumorigenic risk.</p>
<p id="Par30">Multiple mechanisms appear to be involved in Ptf1a-mediated reprogramming of iNSCs from somatic cells. First, the reprogramming activity of Ptf1a critically depends on its interaction with Rbpj, similar to its role in determining pancreas progenitor fates. When Rbpj was knocked down by RNA interference, there were many fewer neurospheres generated. Since Rbpj is also a downstream integrator of the Notch signaling pathway, we determined whether the interaction between Ptf1a and Rbpj relies on Notch signaling. The W298A mutation of Ptf1a interrupts its interaction with Rbpj but keeps the Notch pathway intact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We found that Ptf1a<sup>W298A</sup> lost the ability to reprogram fibroblasts into iNSCs, demonstrating that the reprogramming activity of Ptf1a depends on its Notch-independent interaction with Rbpj.</p>
<p id="Par31">Second, upon association with Rbpj, Ptf1a activates a few key families of downstream TF genes involved in NSC specification and homeostasis including proliferation, self-renewal, and prevention of quiescence and neuronal differentiation. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data show that at least six families of TF genes were activated upon transdifferentiation from MEFs to iNSCs. These include Sox, bHLH, homeobox, and POU domain TF family members that have demonstrated functions in NSC generation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8h</xref>). For instance, several Sox TFs, in particular, Sox2 were upregulated in Ptf1a-reprogrammed iNSCs. Given the ability for Sox2 alone to reprogram fibroblasts into iNSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, the reprogramming activity of Ptf1a may be mediated in part by Sox2 through direct or indirect activation by Ptf1a. All four members of the class 3 POU domain TFs were also upregulated, which presumably bind in cooperation with Sox2 to distal enhancers to regulate the specification, proliferation, and neuronal differentiation of iNSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Olig2 is an upregulated bHLH TF, which has been shown to promote proliferation but prevent neuronal differentiation and quiescence of NSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The upregulated homeobox TFs Pax6 and Lhx2 are required for the determination, proliferation, multipotency, and neurogenesis of NSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par32">Third, Ptf1a activates Dll1-Notch signaling and perhaps other signaling pathways for efficient iNSC reprogramming. As a crucial pathway to regulate NSC proliferation and self-renewal, Notch signaling is indispensable for iNSC maintenance. Thus, neurospheres reprogrammed from MEFs by Ptf1a were decreased in the presence of Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT. Similar to its mechanism in pancreas progenitor cell expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, the Notch pathway is likely to promote iNSC proliferation in a paracrine manner. In this model (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">13k</xref>), the Ptf1a and Rbpj complex binds to <italic>Dll1</italic> promoter and activates its expression inside an iNSC cell; Dll1 binds to Notch receptors on a neighbor iNSC cell and activates Hes1, Hey1, and other downstream effectors. At the same time, Hes1 and Hey1 activate downstream genes to promote cell proliferation. This positive feedforward loop acts in a paracrine way to promote iNSC proliferation and expansion. Consistent with this model, our RNA-seq data reveal a dramatic upregulation of <italic>Notch1</italic>, <italic>Dll1</italic>, <italic>Hes1</italic>, and <italic>Hey1</italic> genes in iNSCs compared with MEFs. Apart from the Notch pathway, Ptf1a may activate other cell signaling pathways to promote iNSC reprogramming. For instance, many important molecules in the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-Akt, Wnt, mitogen-activated protein kinase and transforming growth factor-β signaling pathways were upregulated during the process of fibroblast to iNSC conversion (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16a</xref>), and these pathways have been proven essential in reprogramming and maintaining iPSCs and stem cells.</p>
<p id="Par33">Lastly, there are many changes at the epigenetic and post-transcriptional levels during Ptf1a-mediated reprogramming. Aside from differential modulation of DNA methylation in the promoter regions of representative genes such as <italic>Nestin</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic>, and <italic>Oct4</italic> between iNSCs and MEFs, we found that expression of many histone messenger RNAs, especially those from cluster 1, seems to be specifically regulated by Ptf1a, as these genes were downregulated in <italic>Ptf1a</italic>-deficient retinas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> but upregulated in Ptf1a-induced iNSCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16b</xref>). This might reflect a general principle of how a TF modulates chromosomal structure and specifies the cell fate. Shinagawa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> found that two of the histone variants, TH2A and TH2B (encoded by the unique genes <italic>Hist1h2aa</italic> and <italic>Hist1h2ba</italic>, respectively), could enhance the efficiency of iPSC reprogramming, indicating that functional connection with specific histones does exist. Another interesting finding is that, compared with MEFs, expression of the Dlk1-Meg3-Rian-Mirg lncRNA and microRNA cluster is downregulated more than 1600-fold in the iNSCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16c</xref>). This cluster is located on chromosome 12 in mouse and accounts for approximately 10% of total microRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Its expression is activated in fully pluripotent mouse stem cells but repressed in partially pluripotent cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>; however, its role in iNSCs remains to be determined.</p>
<p id="Par34">In summary, iNSCs have great values in patient-specific cell replacement therapies, in vitro modeling of disease pathogenesis, drug screening, and basic neurobiological studies. In this study, we have demonstrated that mouse and human fibroblasts can be successfully reprogrammed into iNSCs with a single, non-neural progenitor TF Ptf1a. The Ptf1a-derived iNSCs are clonogenic and self-renewable. They are tripotent and capable of differentiating into functional neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes with high efficiency. When transplanted into the damaged hippocampus, they can significantly improve cognitive impairment of AD mouse models. The reprogramming activity of Ptf1a depends on its Notch-independent interaction with Rbpj which leads to subsequent activation of expression of TF genes and Notch and other signaling pathways involved in NSC specification, self-renewal, and maintenance.</p>

Following the addition of 10 ml MEF medium to the plate, the digested tissues were triturated to dissociate cells by pipetting up and down several times with a 10 ml pipette. The dissociated cells were transferred into a 15 ml tube, centrifuged at 1000 r.p.m. for 5 min, and resuspended with fresh MEF media. Cells derived from three to four embryos were pooled into one 10 cm dish, cultured at 37 °C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator, and expanded by no more than three passages.</p>

After removal of the MEF medium next day, 1 ml of lentiviruses and MEF medium mixture containing polybrene (10 μg/ml) was added into each well. The viruses consisted of Ptf1a, Ptf1a<sup>W298A</sup>, or GFP viruses, and M2rtTA viruses in a volume ratio of 1:1. To achieve optimal reprogramming efficiency, virus titration was tested for each batch of prepared viruses. Following infection of MEFs by the desired viruses for 16 h, the virus and medium mixture was removed and replaced by fresh NSC medium containing 2 ng/ml Dox. During the course of iNSC induction, the Dox-containing NSC medium was changed every 2 days. By 8–10 days after infection with the Ptf1a lentiviruses, small spheroids appeared. The size of the spheroids increased rapidly over the following 3–4 days. The procedure to induce hiNSC neurospheres from HFFs by Ptf1a is essentially the same as that for MEFs.</p>

<p id="Par62">On the first day (visible platform), mice were placed into the water facing the wall. If the mouse reached the platform before a 60 s cutoff, it was allowed to stay on the platform for 5 s then returned to the home cage. If the mouse did not find the platform in 60 s, it was gently guided onto the platform and allowed to sit on it for 20 s before returning to the home cage. This procedure was repeated for three more trials, each starting in a different quadrant. Once the animal had completed every trial, it was dried off with a clean paper towel. The four-trial training procedure was repeated for all the mice. On the next 4 days (hidden platform), the mice were trained as on the first day but with the platform submerged. After 5 consecutive days of pre-training, the animals were tested with the platform removed. During the test, mice were placed into the water from the opposite quadrant where the platform used to be, and were tested for 60 s. Videos were recorded and analyzed using Ethovision 11.0 (Noldus).
