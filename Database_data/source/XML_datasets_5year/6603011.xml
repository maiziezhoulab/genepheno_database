<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Obesity is a disease with a complex etiology and variable prevalence across different populations. While several studies have reported gut microbiota composition differences associated with obesity in humans, there has been a lack of consistency in the nature of the reported changes; it has been difficult to determine whether methodological differences between studies, underlying differences in the populations studied, or other factors are responsible for this discordance. Here we use 16 S rRNA data from previously published studies to explore how the gut microbiota-obesity relationship varies across heterogeneous Western populations, focusing mainly on the relationship between (1) alpha diversity and (2) <italic>Prevotella</italic> relative abundance with BMI. We provide evidence that the relationship between lower alpha diversity and higher BMI may be most consistent in non-Hispanic white (NHW) populations and/or those with high socioeconomic status, while the relationship between higher <italic>Prevotella</italic> relative abundance and BMI may be stronger among black and Hispanic populations. We further examine how diet may impact these relationships. This work suggests that gut microbiota phenotypes of obesity may differ with race/ethnicity or its correlates, such as dietary components or socioeconomic status. However, microbiome cohorts are often too small to study complex interaction effects and non-white individuals are greatly underrepresented, creating substantial challenges to understanding population-level patterns in the microbiome-obesity relationship. Further study of how population heterogeneity influences the relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity is warranted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in Western populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Studies aiming to determine the cause of this precipitous increase are complicated by the mixed etiology and manifestations of the disease. Individuals vary greatly in their propensity toward obesity and in the extent to which obesity is associated with metabolic complications such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance and diabetes, or other adverse health conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Obesity is influenced by diet, behavior, and other environmental as well as genetic factors, and susceptibility to obesity differs by sex, age, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Racial/ethnic differences in obesity prevalence are especially high for women, with Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women having much higher prevalence compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p id="Par3">Many studies have reported differences in microbiota composition between obese and lean humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Mouse experiments have provided compelling evidence that these differences are not merely correlational, and many potential mechanisms for these actions have been elucidated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Studies of the nature of compositional differences that occur in obese versus lean humans, however, have been difficult to interpret because the results are often not in agreement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> One property that has been reported in multiple studies of obesity is reduced richness of microbes or their genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> However, although individuals with reduced richness are more often obese, low richness is not observed in the majority of obese individuals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> indicating that low richness only has the potential to be important in a subset of obese individuals. The specific taxa reported to differ with obesity have varied across studies. For instance, the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes in obese versus lean humans has been reported to decrease to increase or to not change at all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Similarly, one small study found that morbidly obese individuals had increased relative abundance of <italic>Prevotella</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> relative abundance positively correlated with BMI in a cohort of HIV positive individuals and controls in Mexico City,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> but <italic>Prevotella</italic> dominated communities were explicitly found to not correlate with Body Mass Index (BMI) in the Old Order Amish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> These inconsistencies may be influenced by methodological differences between studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> by differences in composition that are not readily captured by the current technologies, or they may reflect that genetic, environmental, and/or lifestyle heterogeneity across the surveyed populations has an influence on the nature of the microbial associations that occur with obesity and related metabolic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> These influences are poorly understood both in terms of effects on the gut microbiota composition overall and in the context of the disease-specific relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup></p>
<p id="Par4">In this study, we explore the hypothesis that population heterogeneity, particularly race/ethnicity, may impact the gut microbiota-obesity relationship. This hypothesis was motivated by a meta-analysis involving data from two previously published studies that included 16 S rRNA sequencing of the fecal microbiome: (1) a cohort of 152 obese and lean female adult twins and their mothers from Missouri<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> (<italic>N</italic> = 75 NHW / 77 black; we refer to this study as “Obese Twins”), and (2) a cohort of lean individuals across the age spectrum from the US and agrarian cultures in Malawi and the Amazonas State of Venezuela (we refer to this study as “Global Gut,” abbreviated GG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> We explored the patterns uncovered in this meta-analysis using three additional cohorts that included NHW, black and/or Hispanic individuals with a wide range of BMI (1) a healthy subset of individuals from the American Gut cohort (AG; <italic>N</italic> = 5035; 4784 NHW/188 Hispanic/63 black),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (2) a cohort of teenagers from the Exploring Perinatal Outcomes among Children study (EPOCH; <italic>N</italic> = 102; 59 NHW/43 Hispanic),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and (3) a cohort of HIV positive and negative Mexican individuals (referred to as the “Mexico City” cohort; <italic>N</italic> = 42 Hispanic).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> We examine the many correlates of race/ethnicity, including the prevalence and severity of obesity, diet, smoking status, and socioeconomic status, and we attempt to understand how these inter-related factors may impact the relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity.</p>

<title>Gut microbiota subtypes of obesity observed in Obese Twins</title>
<p id="Par5">We first observed that there may be distinct gut microbiota phenotypes associated with obesity while performing a meta-analysis that combined 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) data from Obese Twins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and the GG study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The GG dataset is useful for meta-analysis because it includes fecal samples from individuals across the two most dramatic microbiota-composition gradients observed across the human population:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (1) microbiomes cluster by age, with infants having a low-diversity microbiota with dramatically different composition from adults, and (2) microbiomes cluster by culture, with individuals from agrarian cultures having a <italic>Prevotella</italic>-rich/Bacteroides poor microbiota that differs substantially from individuals from the US and Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> We applied Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) to an unweighted UniFrac distance matrix of the combined data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> We note that we used previously unpublished sequence data from the Obese Twins and GG studies that were processed together using the same methods (see Methods for more detail). The PCoA analysis produced clustering from old to young age from left to right (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>; <italic>p</italic>-value for association with age ≤0.01), and from Western to Agrarian culture from top to bottom (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). The first principal coordinates axis (PC1) correlated negatively with alpha diversity (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 for Phylogenetic Diversity and Shannon diversity index). PC2 correlated inversely with relative abundance of the genus <italic>Prevotella</italic> (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01), consistent with high <italic>Prevotella</italic> being observed in agrarian populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup></p>

<title>Race correlates with gut microbiota subtypes in Obese Twins</title>
<p id="Par6">Obese individuals showed greater spread across both the age and culture axes of variation than either lean or overweight individuals from Obese Twins (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>; <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001). As seen in many studies, many obese individuals clustered with lean individuals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> but there were two notable clusters of outliers of obese individuals, one spreading towards infants/lower alpha diversity on PC1, and the other spreading towards the <italic>Prevotella</italic>-rich/<italic>Bacteroides</italic> poor communities of agrarian cultures on PC2. We noted that the obese outliers on PC1 tended to be white, while those on PC2 tended to be black (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c–e</xref>). Comparing individuals by obesity status and stratifying by race (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>), we noted that among whites, the average alpha diversity was lower among obese individuals, but not significantly so. Among blacks, average alpha diversity was significantly higher among obese individuals, which was surprising given the prior literature showing an association between lower alpha diversity and obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the individuals in the Obese Twins cohort overall and by obesity status, stratified by race</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"></th><th rowspan="2">All</th><th colspan="3">White</th><th colspan="3">Black</th></tr><tr><th>Non-obese</th><th>Obese</th><th><italic>p</italic>-value</th><th>Non-obese</th><th>Obese</th><th><italic>p</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of individuals</td><td>152</td><td>34</td><td>41</td><td></td><td>15</td><td>62</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of samples</td><td>270</td><td>62</td><td>71</td><td></td><td>21</td><td>116</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>34.0 (12.2)</td><td>32.7 (11.7)</td><td>35.9 (13.2)</td><td>0.266</td><td>37.7 (14.6)</td><td>32.6 (11.1)</td><td>0.136</td></tr><tr><td>Hispanic ethnicity</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.695</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.092</td></tr><tr><td> No</td><td>134 (88.2)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td></td><td>11 (73.3)</td><td>55 (88.7)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Yes</td><td>1 (0.7)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td></td><td>1 (6.7)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Unknown</td><td>17 (11.2)</td><td>4 (11.8)</td><td>3 (7.3)</td><td></td><td>7 (11.3)</td><td>3 (7.3)</td><td>0.736</td></tr><tr><td>Average BMI</td><td>34.8 (10.4)</td><td>22.8 (2.8)</td><td>39.2 (5.9)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td>24.3 (3.5)</td><td>41.1 (8.7)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td>BMI category</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&lt;0.001</td><td></td><td></td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td> Lean</td><td>34 (22.4)</td><td>26 (76.5)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td></td><td>8 (53.3)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Overweight</td><td>15 (9.9)</td><td>8 (23.5)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td></td><td>7 (46.7)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Obese (Total)</td><td>103 (67.8)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>41 (100.0)</td><td></td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>62 (100.0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Obese category I (30 &lt; BMI &lt; 35)</td><td>24 (15.8)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>11 (26.8)</td><td></td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>13 (21.0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Obese category II (35 &lt; BMI &lt; 40)</td><td>33 (21.7)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>13 (31.7)</td><td></td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>20 (32.3)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Obese category III + (BMI &gt; 40)</td><td>46 (30.3)</td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>17 (41.5)</td><td></td><td>0 (0.0)</td><td>29 (46.8)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Twin (versus mother of twin)</td><td>106 (69.7)</td><td>26 (76.5)</td><td>26 (63.4)</td><td>0.332</td><td>8 (53.3)</td><td>46 (74.2)</td><td>0.204</td></tr><tr><td>Monozygotic twin</td><td>60 (56.6)</td><td>17 (65.4)</td><td>13 (50.0)</td><td>0.4</td><td>7 (87.5)</td><td>23 (50.0)</td><td>0.113</td></tr><tr><td>

<p id="Par7">To further examine the relationship between these PC axes, obesity status, and race, we used adjusted hierarchical linear regression models of BMI versus the PC axes by racial group (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a–b</xref>).

<title>Gut microbiota-obesity relationship in other cohorts</title>
<p id="Par8">It is difficult to know whether these differential relationships by race are driven by genetic ancestry or by the many environmental correlates of self-described race. In the Obese Twins study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>), black individuals had higher prevalence and severity of obesity; there were many differences in diet by race (e.g., blacks had greater intake of meat and calories, higher proportion of carbohydrates and less of fat, saturated fat, and fiber from grains); and smoking prevalence was higher among whites. While we did not have information on socioeconomic status for this cohort, the larger Missouri Female Twin study has reported that whites had higher income, more education, greater family intactness and tended to live in less urban areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> It is challenging to untangle these complex inter-relationships, particularly given that most human studies of the gut microbiome have small sample sizes and are among predominantly NHW populations. However, we were able to explore variation in the gut microbiota-obesity relationship using 3 additional cohorts with at least some representation of other racial and ethnic groups (Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>): the American Gut (AG) project (non-Hispanic white/NHW, Hispanic white, and black); the EPOCH study (NHW, Hispanic white) and a cohort from Mexico City of HIV-positive individuals and controls (Hispanic white). These studies likewise showed marked differences in obesity prevalence and severity, diet and socioeconomic status by race/ethnicity.</p>
<p id="Par9">We first examined predictors of the overall gut microbiota composition in each of these studies using permutational ANOVA. Overweight/obese status, race, sex, and smoking status were generally associated with the gut microbiota composition across these studies (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Both the Obese Twins and AG showed a significant interaction between race/ethnicity and overweight/obese status.</p>
<p id="Par10">We also investigated whether there was variation in the gut microbiota-obesity relationship in these studies by race/ethnicity, as seen in Obese Twins. Since meta analyses of these other studies with GG would involve a study effect (i.e., the sequences were produced by different labs using different protocols such as PCR primers and DNA extraction techniques), rather than using PC axes in analyses (which did not correspond as directly with alpha diversity and culture), we explicitly examined the association between (1) alpha diversity and (2) <italic>Prevotella</italic> relative abundance with BMI in each study. These studies showed some corroboration that there may be differences in the relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity by race/ethnicity or its correlates.</p>

<title>Inconsistencies in the alpha diversity-BMI relationship</title>
<p id="Par11">To explore whether the observation of decreased alpha diversity with obesity varied by race, we used linear regression models of BMI as a function of alpha diversity (phylogenetic diversity and Shannon diversity index) by racial group, controlling for potential confounding variables that varied with each cohort (see Methods).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par15">In this study, we found preliminary evidence across four studies that race/ethnicity, or its correlates, may be associated with distinct gut microbiota subtypes of obesity. In all of the studies included here with NHW individuals, there was evidence of a low alpha diversity subtype of obesity, and the association between lower alpha diversity and higher BMI was most consistent and strongest among NHWs and in AG, which is a cohort of predominantly healthy individuals with moderate BMI and high socioeconomic status. This relationship was notably less consistent among black and Hispanic individuals. We additionally noted a novel subtype of obesity in which the gut microbiota composition was less “Western”, more similar to that of individuals from agrarian cultures and high in <italic>Prevotella</italic>. While we did see at least some evidence of this gut microbiota phenotype of obesity in three of four studies examined, and some indication of an association with race/ethnicity, it would need to be validated in larger and more diverse cohorts. It is notable, however, that we found some evidence of variation of the gut microbiota-obesity relationship with race/ethnicity in four very different cohorts in terms of the population characteristics: adult twins and their mothers from Missouri, a heterogeneous cohort of healthy highly educated Americans from across the country, teenagers from Colorado, and a cohort of HIV positive and control adults from Mexico City.</p>
<p id="Par16">These results raise many important questions about the role of race/ethnicity, ancestry, and genetics in the gut microbiota-obesity relationship, as well as the influence of lifestyle factors, such as diet, socioeconomic status, and smoking, all of which demand larger more racially diverse studies to thoroughly address. As obesity is known to have a genetic component and a link with microbiota composition, it stands to reason that genes may impact microbiota composition in a manner that in turn influences susceptibility to obesity. This notion was supported in a study of the microbiota of &gt;1000 fecal samples obtained from twins in the UK, where a co-occurring group of heritable bacteria were found to be enriched in individuals with low BMI; amendment of an obesity-associated microbiota with the heritable lean-associated species <italic>Christensenella minuta</italic> resulted in reduced weight gain when transplanted into germ-free mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> The demonstrated link between heritable bacteria and protection from obesity supports that varied rates of obesity in different ethnic/racial populations may be driven by genetic polymorphisms in those populations that in turn result in varied selections for different microbiotas. Links between microbiota composition and ethnicity across various body habitats, including stool, were also detected in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), where the greatest number of differentially distributed microbiota features (taxa, gene families, and metabolic pathways) with subject attributes were by race/ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> Similarly, recent analyses of HMP and AG found specific taxa consistently associated with ethnicity across these two studies, and many of these taxa also have prior evidence of high heritability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Likewise, in this study, we found that race/ethnicity were significant determinants of the overall gut microbiota composition in both of the cohorts that we examined with black and white participants, and both studies showed a significant interaction between race/ethnicity and overweight/obese status. The oral and vaginal microbiomes have also been shown to correlate strongly with race/ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Interestingly, one study found that BMI was significantly correlated with vaginal microbiota composition among African but not European Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> However, it cannot be ruled out that these microbiota-correlates with race/ethnicity may be driven by environmental factors instead of genes; we saw that dietary intake correlates with race/ethnicity in these cohorts and the gut microbiota-obesity relationship varied with diet. Prior studies that have compared the diets in black and white Americans, as well as in African Americans and rural Africans, detected differences in dietary intake between populations that correlated with differences in both fecal bacteria and its metabolites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Another recent study of over 1000 individuals concluded that genetic ancestry played a limited role in shaping the gut microbiome relative to the environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> However, this cohort was Israeli with limited racial and ethnic diversity, specifically very few black individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Thus, there is still a substantial gap in our understanding about how genetic ancestry shapes the gut microbiota, how the relationship between the gut microbiota and disease varies with genetic ancestry, and how these relationships differ with self-described race, which likely reflects diet, culture, socioeconomic status and other aspects of the environment more strongly than genetic ancestry.</p>
<p id="Par17">Our work suggests that ethnic/racial differences across populations may explain at least some discordance in the nature of associations between the microbiota and obesity reported in different studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Our observation that low alpha diversity may correlate with high BMI more consistently in NHWs than in black or Hispanic populations is consistent with many studies that are either exclusively or predominantly in NHW populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Socioeconomic and health status correlate with race/ethnicity, and it is difficult to untangle these effects; AG had a fairly consistent association between lower alpha diversity and BMI across racial and ethnic groups, and the AG cohort is predominantly healthy, highly educated, and fairly wealthy individuals since participants pay to submit their microbiota samples. A recent meta-analysis and re-analysis of numerous studies of obesity and the gut microbiome included two Hispanic populations; one Hispanic Mexican-American cohort showed a trend towards lower alpha diversity with higher BMI, while a Columbian cohort was one of only two populations examined (among 10) that showed no trend towards such an association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Hispanic ethnicity is a genetic admixture of European, Native American and African that varies in proportion across the United States and across different countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> Interestingly, Colombia is one of the most genetically diverse group of Hispanics in Latin America with many individuals having a high proportion of African ancestry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup></p>
<p id="Par18">Our observation that the association between <italic>Prevotella</italic> and BMI was most pronounced among blacks and Hispanics is consistent with a study in which three morbidly obese individuals, one black, one Hispanic, and one white (Krajmalnik–Brown, R. personal communication), were compared to three lean individuals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> but such an association was also been noted in a morbidly obese European individual and was not seen in Hispanic Americans living on the Texas–Mexico border.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> The <italic>Prevotella</italic>-<italic>Bacteroides</italic> ratio was also seen to predict fat loss during a fiber-rich dietary intervention in Danish individuals, suggesting that the our results may be driven more by diet than by race or ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>
<italic>Prevotella</italic> has been shown to be enriched in prevalence and in diversity in non-Westernized societies, particularly <italic>Prevotella copri</italic>, which is near ubiquitous in non-Westernized populations and includes four distinct clades that tend to co-occur but are generally absent in Westernized populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>
<italic>Prevotella</italic> is a complex genus that has been linked both to health and disease, and may interact with diet in complex ways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> For example, <italic>Prevotella</italic>-rich microbiomes have been linked with a dietary-fiber induced improvement in glucose metabolism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> but also with insulin resistance through the production of branched chained amino acids in the context of a high fat diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> While our analyses mainly focus on <italic>Prevotella</italic> and BMI, our meta-analysis of Obese Twins and GG imply that the relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity is not fully reflected by <italic>Prevotella</italic> relative abundance alone.</p>
<p id="Par19">Our findings should be taken in the context of certain limitations. Only two of the studies included in our analyses included black individuals, and many of the included studies had small sample sizes or small numbers of non-whites. In order to fully understand whether there are distinct gut microbiota phenotypes of obesity and their associations with individual characteristics, much larger sample sizes are needed. We did not find evidence of strong confounding or interaction effects by smoking, but the studies had relatively small numbers of smokers. Diet was measured in different ways across the studies, and we were unable to examine race-based differences in the effects of diet in AG due to limited numbers of Hispanics and blacks. Likewise, it is important to understand the role of genetic risk for obesity and genetic ancestry in the microbiota-obesity relationship. While there are numerous cohorts with both genetic and microbiome information, most of these cohorts are also lacking in racial and ethnic diversity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup></p>
<p id="Par20">Individuals with obesity vary in the extent of adiposity and also in the extent to which they suffer from other adverse health outcomes, including metabolic complications, such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Since obesity is a heterogeneous disease, and since several unique mechanisms by which the microbiota may influence obesity susceptibility have been proposed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> it is also not surprising that there may be multiple distinct microbiota types that associate with obesity and that these may differ in prevalence in different cohorts. In fact, obese individuals with a low-diversity microbiota type have been characterized by more marked adiposity, greater inflammation, and poorer metabolic health compared to a high-diversity type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Another interesting question is whether different types of obesity-associated microbiotas may drive obesity by diverse mechanisms. Experiments in gnotobiotic or humanized mice that use different types of obesity-associated microbiotas as donor samples could help to determine whether different mechanisms may be at play.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p>
<p id="Par21">Since obesity rates are particularly high in non-white populations, our observation that the microbiota-obesity relationship may vary in unique ways by race/ethnicity underscores an urgent need to evaluate links between the microbiota and obesity in diverse populations, while simultaneously evaluating the role of race-associated factors, such as diet and socioeconomic status. Research about obesity and the gut microbiota has been dominated by studies focused on NHWs (e.g., ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>), but there is growing awareness about the importance of race, ethnicity and geography in determining the gut microbiota,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and there are large racially and ethnically diverse cohorts that have more recently collected gut microbiome samples and will likely shed more light on these issues in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> As various treatments for obesity vary greatly in efficacy across individuals, experiments that test the effects of weight loss treatments, e.g., various diets, in obese populations may benefit from a deeper understanding about different microbiota types and how they vary with race/ethnicity. This could facilitate personalized interventions, where the most effective strategies can be predicted based on the composition of the microbiota. The gut microbiota may also offer opportunities to treat or prevent obesity through personalized probiotics. However, microbiota-based interventions that do not take into account the differences in the gut microbiota or microbiota-disease relationships across diverse populations may be less effective or even have unintended adverse consequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>Analysis of Prevotella and BMI</title>
<p id="Par31">We examined the relationship between <italic>Prevotella</italic> and BMI using the same methods as described above for alpha diversity. We modeled Prevotella using standardized relative abundance as well as the ratio of <italic>Prevotella</italic> relative abundance to the sum of the relative abundance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, as used previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> We used adjusted R<sup>2</sup> to choose the better predictor of BMI.</p>

<sec id="Sec17">
<title>Evaluation of interactions with diet and smoking status</title>
<p id="Par32">In the models of alpha diversity and <italic>Prevotella</italic>, described above, we checked for interactions with smoking and three dietary measures that we hypothesized may influence the gut microbiota-obesity relationship: fiber, fat, and meat intake. Smoking was only available for Obese Twins and AG; diet was additionally available in EPOCH. Diet was measured differently in AG compared to the other two studies; we chose the number of different types of plant consumed as the best marker for fiber; the only measure of meat and fat intake was a single measure called “high fat red meat.” In order to visualize significant interactions, we categorized alpha diversity and fiber as high (top quartile) and low-moderate (bottom 3 quartiles); plant intake as high (≥21) and low-moderate (≤20); high fat red meat as frequent (3–5 times per week or more) and low (&lt;3 times per week). We categorized high versus low <italic>Prevotella</italic> relative abundance slightly differently in the two studies due to the vastly different distributions, and to create a reasonable distribution of data across the categories. In Obese Twins, we used the top tertile to define high <italic>Prevotella</italic>, and in AG, we used the mean.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec18">
<title>Evaluation of the confounding by smoking status</title>
<p id="Par33">Associations between smoking and (1) alpha diversity, (2) <italic>Prevotella</italic>, and (3) BMI, were examined using regressions similar to those described for alpha diversity, but with alpha diversity/<italic>Prevotella</italic> / BMI as the outcomes and smoking status (non-imputed) as the primary exposure. We controlled for age and race in Obese Twins, and age, race/ethnicity, and sex in AG.</p>
<p id="Par34">For these analyses, we used R v3.5.0,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> SAS V9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina), and Qiime v1.9.1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> We considered two-sided <italic>p</italic>-values of 0.05 or less as statistically significant.</p>
