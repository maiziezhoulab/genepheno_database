<abstract>
<p>Sandhoff disease (SD) is caused by the loss of β-hexosaminidase (Hex) enzymatic activity in lysosomes resulting from <italic>Hexb</italic> mutations. In SD patients, the Hex substrate GM2 ganglioside accumulates abnormally in neuronal cells, resulting in neuronal loss, microglial activation, and astrogliosis. <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which manifest a phenotype similar to SD, serve as animal models for examining the pathophysiology of SD. <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice reach ~8 weeks without obvious neurological defects; however, trembling begins at 12 weeks and is accompanied by startle reactions and increased limb tone. These symptoms gradually become severe by 16–18 weeks. Immune reactions caused by autoantibodies have been recently associated with the pathology of SD. The inhibition of immune activation may represent a novel therapeutic target for SD. Herein, SD mice (<italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) were crossed to mice lacking an activating immune receptor (<italic>FcRγ</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) to elucidate the potential relationship between immune responses activated through SD autoantibodies and astrogliosis. Microglial activation and astrogliosis were observed in cortices of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice during the asymptomatic phase, and were inhibited in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup>
<italic>FcRγ</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Moreover, early astrogliosis and impaired motor coordination in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice could be ameliorated by immunosuppressants, such as FTY720. Our findings demonstrate the importance of early treatment and the therapeutic effectiveness of immunosuppression in SD.</p>

<body>
<p>Sandhoff disease (SD, GM2 gangliosidosis 0 variant, OMIM #268800) is a glycosphingolipid storage disease caused by mutations in <italic>Hexb</italic> gene. Such mutations result in defective β-hexosaminidase (Hex) activity with GM2 gangliosides and related glycolipid accumulation in the lysosomes of neuronal cells. The accumulation of glycolipids leads to severe neurodegeneration via unknown pathological mechanisms. β-Hex consists of two major isoforms, β-Hex A (HexA; αβ heterodimer) and B (HexB; ββ homodimer), as well as one minor isoform, β-Hex S (HexS; αα homodimer). The human <italic>Hexa</italic> and <italic>Hexb</italic> genes encode the α- and β-subunits, respectively. <italic>Hexb</italic> mutations result in insufficient HexA and HexB enzyme activities, which ultimately result in SD. As HexA, but not HexB, can degrade GM2, the absence of HexA enzyme activity in brains of SD patients leads to progressive GM2 accumulation.</p>
<p><italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice develop SD-like disease and serve as an animal model for dissecting the pathology of SD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Previous studies have shown that <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibit no obvious neurological disorders until ~8 weeks of age; however, by 12 weeks of age, they develop tremors, startle reactions, and increased limb tone, and these symptoms become severe by 16–18 weeks of age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Post-mortem dissections of SD patients have revealed gliosis in many regions, including the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, as well as significant nerve loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice also exhibit various neurological symptoms at 16 weeks, including neuronal loss in the thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord, which have been associated with apoptotic signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, the mechanisms whereby the excessive accumulation of glycolipids eventually results in neurological disorders have not yet been elucidated in detail.</p>
<p>Microglia/macrophage-mediated inflammatory processes in the central nervous system (CNS) have been implicated in glycosphingolipid storage diseases, including GM1 and 2 gangliosidosis, and possibly in neurodegenerative processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Previous studies showed that the inflammatory responses in the CNS caused nerve damage and rapidly induced neuronal apoptosis through the expression of inflammatory mediators in SD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Resting ramified microglia are readily activated and convert into amoeboid state under certain CNS pathologies. Although activated microglia play a role in neuron survival and neurogenesis by releasing neurotropic and anti-inflammatory factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, they are also involved in the neuronal injury by releasing pro-inflammatory factors such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Wada <italic>et al</italic>. reported that activated amoeboid microglia could be identified at 2 months of age and were increased in number at 3 months of age in parenchyma of the spinal cord, brainstem, and thalamus in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. At the same time as that of activated microglia, TNF-α levels were elevated by 2-, 7-, and 15-fold over control mice at 2, 3, and 4 months of age, respectively. No apoptotic neurons were detected at 1 and 2 months of age. Apoptotic neurons could be identified at 3 months of age and were increased in number at 4 months of age in parenchyma of the spinal cord, brainstem, and thalamus. In addition to microglia, astrocytes also respond to various CNS pathologies through a process referred to as reactive astrogliosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Inflammatory cytokines released by activated microglia play an important role for the conversion of astrocytes into a reactive state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Reactive astrocytes participate in regulation of inflammatory responses and play a role in the progression and severity of neurological disorders through the release of neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Therefore, both activated microglia and astrogliosis are key components of the CNS immune responses.</p>
<p>Fc receptors (FcRs) are expressed on immune effector cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, and play an important role in regulating immune responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In the CNS, FcRs are expressed on microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, and involved in mediating immune reactions in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Excessive activation of FcRs in the CNS may participate in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases. There are at least three types of FcγRs; FcγRI, and FcγRIII. Both FcγRI and FcγRIII are composed of multimeric subunits including the Fc receptor common γ chain (FcRγ) that contains an intracellular tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM), whose activation triggers phagocytosis, cytotoxicity, and release of inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, FcγRII is a single subunit receptor, which contains an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif and abrogates ITAM-mediated inflammatory responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. A balance between activated and inhibitory FcRs signaling regulates immune responses. FcRγ-deficient mice are deficient for all activating FcγRs, whereas the inhibitory receptor FcγRII expression is unaltered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Recent studies using FcRγ-deficient mice (<italic>FcRγ</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) indicated that the production of autoantibodies followed by FcRγ-dependent autoimmune response play an important role in the pathophysiology of SD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>. reported improved clinical symptoms, increased life span, and a decreased number of apoptotic cells following the disruption of <italic>Fcrγ</italic> in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. The level of ganglioside accumulation, however, did not change. These reports raise the possibility that ablation of autoimmune responses may represent a novel therapeutic target for SD.</p>
<p>Herein, we examined the relationship between immune responses and glial cell activation by autoantibodies in the brain of mice with SD-like pathologies. We investigated whether reactive gliosis was induced in the CNS by innate immune cell activation using double-knockout mice (<italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup>
<italic>FcRγ</italic><sup>−/−</sup>). Our present study shows that astrogliosis in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice is caused by FcRγ-dependent immune responses during the asymptomatic phase. Moreover, early astrogliosis and impaired motor coordination in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice could be ameliorated by immunosuppressants. Our findings demonstrate the importance of early treatment and the therapeutic effectiveness of immunosuppression in SD.</p>

<title>HexB-deficient mice reflect the pathology of Sandhoff disease</title>
<p><italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed no obvious symptoms by 8 weeks of age, when they were considered to be in the asymptomatic phase. However, they gradually developed bradykinesia and ataxia (e.g., gait disturbance) by 12 weeks of age, and exhibited neurological symptoms, such as epilepsy-like seizures, and died by 16–18 weeks of age. Therefore, we investigated whether these characteristics could be observed in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>
<p>In the gait analysis, we assessed potential disorders of the hind legs in 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. The footprint width of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice was similar to their body width, whereas that of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice was smaller, and slight limping was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Brain sagittal sections from <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have been histologically examined. We observed extensive accumulation of GM2 in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, but not in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, which served as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an intermediate filament protein specifically expressed in astrocytes in the CNS. Increased level of GFAP represents astroglial activation and gliosis during neurodegeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Only a few GFAP-positive activated astrocytes could be detected in the brains of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, whereas they were more abundant and even located in the cerebral cortices and striata of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, where only a very low GFAP signal is normally detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). Overall, the accumulation of GM2 and activated astrocytes could detect throughout almost the entire brains of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Microarray analysis was subsequently conducted on brain tissues from 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice using tissues from <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice as a control. The mRNA expression levels of chemokine genes (e.g., <italic>Ccl3</italic>) and inflammatory cytokine- and complement-related genes (e.g., <italic>Ifit3, Il1α, C3ar1</italic>, and <italic>C4b</italic>) were increased in the brains of 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Furthermore, genes known to be expressed by macrophages, such as Fc receptors (<italic>Fcgr2b, Fcgr3</italic>, and <italic>Fcer1g</italic>), <italic>Cd68, Gpr84</italic> (G protein-coupled receptor 84), and <italic>Mpeg1</italic> (macrophage expressed gene 1), were also up-regulated. The expression levels of <italic>GFAP</italic> and genes related to neuroinflammation were also elevated. Additionally, reduced levels of expression of <italic>Cd209f</italic> and <italic>Cd209a</italic> (associated with anti-inflammatory macrophages), myelin-associated proteins, <italic>Mal</italic> (myelin and lymphocyte protein, T-cell differentiation protein), and <italic>Opalin</italic> (oligodendrocytic myelin paranodal and inner loop protein) were detected. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of <italic>Gpr37</italic>, which is known to be an autism-related gene, were reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>

<title>SD-related immune reactions involve FcRγ in <italic>Hexb</italic>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice</title>
<p>Immunostaining revealed astrocyte activation in whole brains of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. In support of these observations, our microarray analysis showed increased expression of genes, such as <italic>Cd68</italic> and <italic>GFAP</italic>, associated with the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Therefore, brain tissues from 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup>, and <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup>
<italic>FcRγ</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were subjected to immunostaining to determine whether activation of microglia and astrocytes was inhibited by the genetic ablation of FcR. Additionally, expression levels of inflammatory cytokines known to be induced by immune reactions through autoantibodies were analyzed by RT-PCR.</p>
<p>Microglial and astroglial activation was examined in the cerebral cortices of 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. CD68-positive microglia could be observed in 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, whereas only a few CD68-positive activated microglia could be detected in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. In <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, Iba1-positive microglia were detected, and this number was significantly increased in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Iba1-positive microglia were reduced in double-knockout mice compared with <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, but not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Astroglial activation was also examined in motor cortices of 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). In the cerebral cortices of 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, GFAP-positive astrocytes could be observed, and this number was significantly increased in the <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice. In double-knockout mice, levels of GFAP-positive astrocytes were significantly lower than those observed in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice. Thus, brains of 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice showed immune reactions mediated through FcRγ and consequent immune response-induced astrogliosis.</p>
<p>The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were examined in brains of 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and double-knockout mice by quantitative RT-PCR. Levels of <italic>IL-1α, IL-1β</italic>, and <italic>TNF-α</italic> mRNA transcripts were significantly higher in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> than in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, with levels of <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>TNF-α</italic> being four- and five-fold greater, respectively. To examine the effects of suppressing immune responses through genetic ablation <italic>Fcrγ</italic> on the levels of these cytokines, double-knockout mice were compared with <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. We found that the expression levels of <italic>IL-1α</italic> and <italic>IL-1β</italic> were significantly reduced in double-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). The mRNA transcript levels of <italic>IL-6</italic> were not changed, while those of <italic>TNF-α</italic> showed a trend to be decreased that did not reach our threshold for statistical significance. Thus, production of some inflammatory cytokines could be suppressed by crippling the immune response through <italic>Fcrγ</italic> ablation.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Immune responses during the asymptomatic phase involve FcRγ</title>
<p>Gliosis derived from activation and proliferation of microglia and astrocytes of 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice could be reduced by suppressing autoantibody-mediated immune responses by deleting <italic>Fcrγ</italic>. Thus, to determine the time of gliosis, activation states of microglia and astrocytes were analyzed at 2–4 weeks of age by immunostaining. A similar analysis was also conducted in 4-week-old double-knockout mice to establish whether gliosis was caused by FcRγ-dependent immune responses.</p>
<p>Microglial activation was analyzed in the motor cortices of 2–3-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice by immunostaining. Iba1-positive microglia could be observed in 2–3-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, whereas only a few CD68-positive activated microglia could be detected. By contrast, microglia with robust CD68-positive signals were activated in 2-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, and these cells were also observed in 3-week-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4A</xref>). Subsequently, we investigated whether microglia were activated at the same time as astrocytes. We found that many GFAP-positive astrocytes could be detected in the motor cortices of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice at 2 weeks of age. GFAP-positive astrocytes were detected in layers I and VI, but were less prominent in layers II–V and in the motor cortices of 3-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. Strikingly, few GFAP-positive astrocytes were observed in layers I–VI of the motor cortices of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4B</xref>). Thus, the number of CD68/Iba1-positive microglia were counted in the cerebral cortices of 4-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, and double-knockout mice to determine whether immune responses that signal through FcRγ were involved in microglial activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). CD68-positive cells were not detected in 1-mm<sup>2</sup> sections from <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, while 212 (179–243) [median (25<sup>th</sup>–75<sup>th</sup> percentile)] cells per section were counted in the cerebral cortices of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which was higher than that observed in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, but not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In double-knockout mice, a median value of 159 (143–174) CD68-positive cells per section were detected, which was significantly lower than that observed in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. For Iba1-positive cells, 95 (87–108) cells per 1-mm<sup>2</sup> section were observed in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, while significantly more [244 (214–250) per section] were detected in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. In double-knockout mice, 193 (172–201) Iba1-positive cells per section were detected, which was significantly lower than that observed in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, microglia were already activated in 4-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, and FcRγ promoted microglia activation.</p>
<p>Immunostaining to detect GFAP was conducted to examine the involvement of FcRγ-dependent microglial-mediated immune responses in astrocyte activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), and we observed 443 (379–470) GFAP-positive astrocytes per 1-mm<sup>2</sup> section in the cerebral cortices of 4-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which was significantly greater than the 86 (50–90) astrocytes per section detected in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. In the double-knockout mice, 156 (114–204) GFAP-positive astrocytes per section were observed, which was significantly lower than that observed in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the brain, S100β is expressed abundantly in astrocytes and considered as an astrocyte marker. Double immunostaining for GFAP and S100β revealed that GFAP/S100β double-positive activated astrocytes detected in 4-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice were markedly increased in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>).

<title>Early astrogliosis in <italic>Hexb</italic>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice could be ameliorated by immunosuppressants</title>
<p>Astrogliosis developed in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice at 4 weeks of age, which we attributed to immune responses through FcRγ expressed by microglia. Therefore, we investigated whether astrogliosis could be improved by suppressing immune responses with immunosuppressive agents.</p>
<p>Diverse immunosuppressants (FTY720, minocycline, or FK506) with distinct mechanisms of action were intraperitoneally administered to in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> or <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice at 3–4 weeks of age to examine effects on astrogliosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). A median value of 86 (50–90) GFAP-positive astrocytes per 1-mm<sup>2</sup> section were observed in 4-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, while 443 (379–470) per section were detected in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. After the administration of FTY720, minocycline, or FK506, this number was significantly reduced to 104 (79–141), 175 (161–223), and 118 (84–130), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Thus, early astrogliosis in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice can be controlled by immunosuppressants.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Impaired motor coordination in <italic>Hexb</italic>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice could be ameliorated by FTY720</title>
<p>We investigated whether impaired motor coordination in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice could be improved by suppressing immune responses with FTY720. FTY720 was orally administered to in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> or <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice at 3–15 weeks of age to examine effects on motor coordination activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). The rotarod test revealed that the time lapse was shortened at 12 weeks in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice compared with <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, and this deficiency was gradually increased for up to 15 weeks. Impaired motor coordination observed in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice was significantly reduced by the administration of FTY720 at 13 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0318 vs. untreated <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice) weeks. Thus, the deficit in motor coordination in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice can be improved by suppressing immune responses.</p>
<p>Finally, brain tissues from 15-week-old mice were subjected to immunostaining to determine whether activation of microglia was inhibited by the administration of FTY720 at 3–15 weeks of age. CD68-positive cells were not detected in 1-mm<sup>2</sup> sections from the cerebral cortices of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>), while 256 (219–305) cells per section were counted in those of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which was significantly higher. In FYT720-treated <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice, this number significantly decreased to 173 (152–200) per section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). In <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, 205 (175–239) Iba1-positive microglia were detected per 1-mm<sup>2</sup> section, while this number significantly increased to 344 (327–410) per section in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice. A total of 261 (254–273) Iba1-positive microglia could be observed per section in FYT720-treated <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice, which was significantly reduced compared with untreated <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>We subsequently investigated whether astrocyte activation could be inhibited by the administration of FTY720 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). In the cerebral cortices of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, a median value of 30 (12–53) GFAP-positive astrocytes could be observed per 1-mm<sup>2</sup> section, while they were significantly increased to 242 (223–286) per section in the <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice. In FYT720-treated <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice, the median value of GFAP-positive astrocytes was 156 (110–185) per section, which was significantly lower than that observed in untreated <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8B</xref>). These results show that the microglial activation and astrogliosis observed in the cortices of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were inhibited by FTY720, suggesting a correlation between the severity of the neurological parameters and the severity of the histological abnormalities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The relationship between immune responses and gliosis was examined using <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> (negative control), <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (positive control), and <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup>
<italic>FcRγ</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (double-knockout) mice. In addition to movement disorders, <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited accumulation of GM2 and gliosis, the pathological hallmarks of SD, throughout brain tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Thus, <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice reproduce much of the pathology of SD and can serve as a model animal to examine the pathophysiology of SD.</p>
<p>The abnormalities observed in 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were examined by microarray analysis, which revealed increases in the expression levels of chemokine (e.g., <italic>Ccl3</italic>), inflammatory cytokine (e.g., <italic>Ifit3</italic> and <italic>Il1α</italic>), and complement-associated (e.g., <italic>C3ar1</italic>, and <italic>C4b</italic>) genes. Furthermore, the expression levels of macrophage-associated genes (<italic>Fcgr2b, Fcgr3</italic> and <italic>Fcer1g, Cd68</italic>, and <italic>Gpr84</italic>) were upregulated. The expression levels of <italic>Gfap</italic> and genes related to neuroinflammation were also markedly increased. Therefore, we examined the activation of glial cells in motor cortices by immunostaining. We then examined whether glial cell activation could be inhibited by the genetic ablation of <italic>Fcrγ</italic>. Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the levels of accumulated GM2 in the brains of 14-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup>
<italic>FcRγ</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice did not change when compared with <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup>
<italic>FcRγ</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Based on our microarray findings, CD68-positive microglial activation and GFAP-positive astroglial activation was studied. Activation of glial cells was reduced in double-knockout mice, suggesting that immune responses occurred via FcRγ and that astrogliosis was induced by immune responses that involved this receptor.</p>
<p>Expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in brain tissues of 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and double-knockout mice were subsequently examined by quantitative RT-PCR. The mRNA transcript levels of genes encoding IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly elevated in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice compared with <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. Thus, we investigated whether suppression of immune responses through the ablation of <italic>Fcrγ</italic> influenced these changes in cytokine expression levels by comparing double-knockout mice with <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. We found significantly reduced expression levels of <italic>IL-1α</italic> and <italic>IL-1β</italic> mRNA transcripts. IL-1β plays a role in memory impairment and locomotor activity, and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurological diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. No significant differences were noted in the expression levels of <italic>IL-6</italic>, whereas those of <italic>TNF-α</italic>, which encodes an inflammatory cytokine that is strongly involved in the pathology of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, were slightly decreased. Abo-Ouf <italic>et al</italic>. reported that depletion of TNF-α in 17-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice results in improved neurological function, decreased levels of astrogliosis, and reduced neural cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Kyrkanides <italic>et al</italic>. previously reported that expression of <italic>TNF-α</italic> and microglial activation could be markedly reduced and apoptosis was suppressed by specifically inducing HexB enzyme expression in neurons of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, whereas expression levels of <italic>IL-1</italic> and <italic>Gfap</italic> and the number of astrocytes remained unchanged<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Activated microglia are the main source of proinflammatory factors such as IL-1 and TNF-α<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In the present study, an increased number of CD68-positive activated microglia in 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were not significantly reduced in 16-week-old double knockout mice. Thus, TNF-α may be a strong driver of neuronal apoptosis that results from GM2 accumulation, but may play a less prominent role in FcRγ-dependent immune responses in 16-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cerebral cortices of the aforementioned mice were analyzed at younger ages by immunostaining to identify microglial activation and the onset time of astrogliosis. We found that astrogliosis was present during the asymptomatic phase in 4-week-old <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, but was markedly reduced in double-knockout mice. Thus, FcRγ-dependent astrogliosis developed during the asymptomatic phase of SD. Chronic nerve inflammation begins developing during the asymptomatic phase and progresses to death in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Neither anti-GM2/-GA2 antibodies in the blood nor the accumulation of IgG in neurons were previously detected in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice at 4 weeks of age during the asymptomatic period<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, Jeyakumar <italic>et al</italic>. reported that CD68-positive activated microglia disappeared from the brainstems of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice treated at 3 weeks of age with miglustat, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, suggesting the presence of unmetabolized substrates in the brain during the asymptomatic phase that could activate microglia.</p>
<p>We also investigated whether astrogliosis could be suppressed by immunosuppressants such as FTY720 (fingolimod), minocycline, and FK506. FTY720 is an immunosuppressant, which modulates sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. FTY720 has a similar chemical structure to sphingosine, and can phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> by sphingosine kinase to form FTY720-P [(S)-enantiomer], which can act as an agonist of 4 of the 5 S1P receptors (S1P<sub>1</sub>, S1P<sub>3</sub>, S1P<sub>4</sub>, and S1P<sub>5</sub>), excluding the S1P<sub>2</sub> receptor. FTY720-P acts as an S1P receptor functional antagonist by causing their internalization. S1P receptors are expressed in astrocytes and microglia/macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Genetic deletion of either sphingosine kinase 1 or the S1P<sub>3</sub> receptor in SD mice results in a reduced glial cell proliferation and astrogliosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. FTY720 treatment has been shown to reduce microglial activation in cerebral ischemic lesions in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. FTY720 has also been shown to downregulate TNF-α and IL-1β produced by activated microglia and astrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. We found that astrogliosis could be reduced by FTY720 treatment during the asymptomatic phase, suggesting that pathological conditions in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice may be improved through the inhibition of S1P receptor signaling. Minocycline, a tetracycline derivative with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, mediates neuroprotection in experimental models of neurological diseases including cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. FK506 (tacrolimus), an immunosuppressant currently used in the clinic, is known to have neuroprotective and/or neuroregenerative activity in animal models of neurological diseases including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, optic nerve crush, antiretroviral toxic neuropathy, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Both minocycline and FK506 have been shown to inhibit microglial activation and production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1ß<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. We found that astrogliosis could be reduced by either minocycline or FK506 treatment during the asymptomatic phase, suggesting that the inhibition of microglial activation and production of inflammatory cytokines may improve pathological conditions in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated whether impaired motor coordination in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice could be improved by suppressing immune responses with FTY720. We found that the deficiency could be reduced by FTY720, suggesting that the deficit in motor coordination in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice can be improved by suppressing immune responses through the inhibition of S1P receptor signaling. Brain tissues from 15-week-old mice were subjected to immunostaining to determine whether activation of microglia and astrocytes was inhibited by the administration of FTY720 at 3–15 weeks of age. The results showed that microglial activation and astrogliosis observed in the cortices of <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were inhibited by FTY720. This finding strongly supports the correlation between the severity of the neurological parameters and the severity of the histological abnormalities. Our findings demonstrate the importance of early treatment and the therapeutic effectiveness of immunosuppression in SD.</p>
<p>In summary, our present study shows that astrogliosis in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice is caused by FcRγ-dependent immune responses during the asymptomatic phase. Early astrogliosis and impaired motor coordination in <italic>Hexb</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/<italic>−</italic></sup> mice could be ameliorated with immunosuppressants, such as FTY720. Our findings suggest the importance of early treatments with agents aimed at inducing immunosuppression. Such treatments might suppress the production of autoantibodies, resulting in a significant delay of the development of neurological symptoms. In the future, the effects of administering early-, mid-, and late-stage treatments with immunosuppressants on survival and motor functions should be analyzed in detail.</p>

For ganglioside level data, the unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used (StatView for Mac). For rotarod data, repeated-measures ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc <italic>t</italic>-test was used (StatView for Mac).</p>
