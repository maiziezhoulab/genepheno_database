<abstract>
<p>Imbalanced protein homeostasis, such as excessive protein synthesis and protein aggregation, is a pathogenic hallmark of a range of neurological disorders. Here, using expression of mutant proteins, a knockdown approach and disease mutation knockin mice, we show that VCP (valosin-containing protein), together with its cofactor P47 and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology regulator ATL1 (Atlastin-1), regulates tubular ER formation and influences the efficiency of protein synthesis to control dendritic spine formation in neurons. Strengthening the significance of protein synthesis in dendritic spinogenesis, the translation blocker cyclohexamide and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reduce dendritic spine density, while a leucine supplement that increases protein synthesis ameliorates the dendritic spine defects caused by <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>Atl1</italic> deficiencies. Because <italic>VCP</italic> and <italic>ATL1</italic> are the causative genes of several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, we suggest that impaired ER formation and inefficient protein synthesis are significant in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological disorders.</p>

<body>
<p>Protein homeostasis, an integrated outcome of protein synthesis and degradation, is crucial for the maintenance of a variety of cellular functions. Imbalanced protein homeostasis caused by excessive protein synthesis, defective protein degradation and protein aggregation is known to be associated with many neurological disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. <italic>VCP</italic>, also known as <italic>P97</italic>, is one of the genes controlling protein homeostasis and is also associated with neurological disorders.</p>
<p><italic>Vcp</italic> encodes a hexameric AAA+ ATPase that functions as a chaperone to control diverse cellular processes, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, ER and Golgi morphogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The binding partners of VCP determine its diverse activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. For example, when the ubiquitin fusion degradation 1-like (UFD1L)–nuclear protein localization homolog 4 (NPL4) heterodimer binds VCP, the VCP complex is involved in ERAD and UPS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, bottom). While VCP interacts with another cofactor named P47, also known as the NSFL1 (P97) cofactor, it regulates membrane fusion in ER and Golgi morphogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, top). P47 competes with the UFD1L–NPL4 heterodimer to interact with the N-terminal region of VCP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Thus, it is expected that the expression levels of the cofactors influence the function of VCP in cells by competing for interactions and targeting VCP to different protein machineries.</p>
<p>VCP proteins are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. Mutations in the <italic>VCP</italic> gene results in multisystem disorders, such as inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and autism spectrum disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Neurological dysfunction is shared among these diseases. Our previous study showed that VCP interacts with another disease molecule, neurofibromin, which is encoded by the <italic>Neurofibromatosis type I</italic> gene, and acts downstream of neurofibromin to regulate dendritic spine formation—a subcellular location of excitatory synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The involvement of VCP in dendritic spine formation provides a potential explanation for the dysregulation of neuronal function in patients with <italic>VCP</italic> mutations, although it is unclear how VCP controls dendritic spine formation.</p>
<p>Because the function of VCP is determined by its cofactor, in this report, we investigate the functions of two major VCP cofactors—P47 and the UFD1L-NPL4 dimer—to explore how VCP controls dendritic spinogenesis. Our results show that P47, but not the UFD1L-NPL4 dimer, is involved in VCP-mediated dendritic spine formation. Our study suggests that the VCP-P47 complex acts with an ER regulator, ATL1, to regulate ER morphology and protein synthesis, which are critical for dendritic spinogenesis.</p>

<title>P47 acts with VCP to regulate dendritic spine density</title>
<p>In our previous proteomic study, P47—the cofactor guiding VCP-mediated regulation of ER membrane fusion—formed a complex with VCP and neurofibromin in rat brain extracts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. So we investigated whether P47 is also involved in dendritic spinogenesis. Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with <italic>P47</italic> at 12 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) and then we analyzed dendritic spine density at 18 DIV. We found that compared with a vector control, neurons transfected with <italic>P47</italic> had a higher density of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). To further confirm the function of P47, we applied an RNA interference approach to reduce P47 expression. A <italic>P47</italic> RNAi knockdown construct (P47i) that reduced <italic>P47</italic> expression in both transfected COS-1 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>) was transfected into cultured neurons. GFP signals from the knockdown vector and coexpressed GFP-actin were used to indicate transfected cells and also to outline the neuronal morphology and dendritic spines. Similar to previous results for <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>Nf1</italic> deficiencies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, the reduction of <italic>P47</italic> expression decreased the density of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Coexpression of the <italic>P47</italic> silent mutant that is resistant to P47i (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) rescued the dendritic spine defects caused by <italic>P47</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>), suggesting the specificity of P47i. To minimize personal bias, we conducted blind morphometry experiments for this report.</p>
<p>We then investigated the involvement of P47 in VCP-mediated dendritic spinogenesis. Both knockdown of endogenous VCP and overexpression of the VCP R95G mutant—an IBMPFD mutant—were shown to reduce the number of dendritic spines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown neurons (∼60% reduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), <italic>P47</italic> overexpression likely recruits the residual VCP to perform P47-dependent activities and may ameliorate the spine defects. In contrast, expression of the VCP R95G mutant impairs the activities of all hexameric VCP in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, right). Therefore, P47 overexpression was not expected to rescue the defect caused by the VCP R95G mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,h</xref>, left panels). Indeed, P47 overexpression increased the dendritic spine density in <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>), but not in the neurons expressing the VCP R95G mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>). The results suggest that VCP uses a P47-dependent pathway to regulate dendritic spine density.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>UFD1L-dependent protein degradation is not critical</title>
<p>In addition to the P47-dependent pathway, we also investigated whether protein degradation controlled by the VCP–UFD1L–NPL4 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) is involved in dendritic spine formation. Because UFD1L and NPL4 function as a dimer, a reduction of either one is sufficient to impair their function. We knocked down <italic>Ufd1l</italic> expression in COS-1 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b,c</xref>) and found that the dendritic spine density was not altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d,e</xref>). To ensure that <italic>Ufd1l</italic> knockdown by Ufd1i impairs protein degradation, we used an ERAD reporter (CD3δ-GFP) and an unstable fluorescence protein (Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-GFP) to monitor protein degradation. These GFP fusion proteins are unstable and rapidly degraded. An accumulation of GFP signal therefore indicates impaired protein degradation. Compared with the non-silencing control, Ufd1i expression induced clear punctate signals for both CD3δ-GFP and Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f,g</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Ufd1l</italic> knockdown promoted unfolded protein accumulation. To further confirm that unfolded protein accumulation does not impair dendritic spinogenesis, we treated the cultured neurons with tunicamycin, which blocks the synthesis of N-linked glycoproteins, to induce unfolded protein accumulation and ER stress. Tunicamycin treatment induced eIF2 phosphorylation and CD3δ-GFP accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). We also labeled newly-synthesized proteins for 1 h with the methionine analog <sc>L</sc>-azidohomoalanine (AHA) at 18 DIV using a well-established bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. After washing, AHA-labeled proteins were detected using tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-conjugated alkyne combined with TAMRA antibody. Notably, protein synthesis was transiently inhibited at 2 and 6 h after tunicamycin treatment, but then gradually recovered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). These analyses indicated that tunicamycin induced an unfolded protein response and led to protein accumulation in neurons. However, tunicamycin treatment did not alter the dendritic spine density and cell morphology of neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). Echoing the lack of effect of tunicamycin on dendritic spine formation, the expression levels of synaptic proteins—such as N-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-aspartate receptor subunits GRIN2A and GRIN2B (also known as NMDAR2A and NMDAR2B), <italic>α</italic>-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunit GRIA2/3 (also known as GluR2/3), metabotrophic glutamate receptor GRM5 (also known as mGluR5) and synaptic scaffold proteins PSD-95 and CASK—did not exhibit a noticeable reduction pattern after tunicamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>). Perhaps, these synaptic proteins are relatively stable<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and cannot be influenced by transient suppression of protein translation. Thus, although tunicamycin treatment induced an unfolded protein response, it had a very limited effect on dendritic spines.</p>
<p>Together, these results suggest that an unfolded protein response is unlikely to be involved in VCP-dependent dendritic spinogenesis.</p>

<title>VCP and P47 regulate dendritic ER distribution in neurons</title>
<p>In dividing cells, the VCP–P47 complex is well known to control the homotypic membrane fusion of intracellular organelles, including the ER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, the role of the VCP–P47 complex in ER morphogenesis and its subsequent physiological function is completely unknown in neurons. Because local tubular ER complexity in dendrites is correlated with the density of local dendritic spines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, we investigated whether the VCP–P47 protein complex regulates tubular ER formation and ER extension into the dendrites. DsRed-ER—a red fluorescent protein (DsRed) fused with the ER targeting sequence of calreticulin at its N-terminal end and the ER retention sequence KDEL at its C-terminal end—was used to label the ER in cultured neurons. The pattern of DsRed-ER in neurons overlapped well with that of endogenous calreticulin, as analyzed by 3D-SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), supporting that DsRed-ER signals reflect the endogenous ER distribution. Similar to a previous finding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, DsRed-ER was enriched at the dendritic branch points and the bases of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b,e,h</xref>).</p>
<p>The ratio of dendritic DsRed-ER to somatic DsRed-ER (D/S ratio) was then determined to investigate whether the <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>P47</italic> deficiencies regulate tubular ER extension in neurons. The D/S ratio of <italic>P47</italic> knockdown neurons was considerably lower than that of control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Because <italic>P47</italic> knockdown did not noticeably change the number of dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, bottom panel), the lower D/S ratio suggested that less ER was distributed into the individual dendrites in the <italic>P47</italic> knockdown neurons. When we measured the cumulative probability of DsRed-ER along the dendrites, a relatively higher percentage of ER was present in the proximal dendrites of <italic>P47</italic> knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), indicating a deficit in ER extension along dendrites. Similar ER defects were also found in VCP R95G mutant-expressing and <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e–i</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>P47</italic> deficiencies reduce ER extension from the somata into the dendrites.</p>
<p>For dendritic spinogenesis, <italic>P47</italic> overexpression effectively ameliorated the dendritic spine defect caused by <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>). If the ER defects are relevant to the dendritic spine defects, we expected that <italic>P47</italic> overexpression would rescue the ER defects caused by <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown. Indeed, overexpression of <italic>P47</italic> in the <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown neurons increased the D/S ratio of DsRed-ER to the level of control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h–i</xref>). Thus, VCP and P47 work together to control ER distribution and dendritic spine formation.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>VCP and P47 regulate ER distribution <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>In addition to cultured neurons, we further evaluated the role of VCP and P47 in ER distribution <italic>in vivo</italic> using in utero electroporated mice. VCPi and DsRed-ER were delivered into the cerebral cortex at embryonic day 15.5. Layer 2/3 cortical neurons were then analyzed at postnatal day 3. Consistent with the results from the cultured neurons, the D/S ratio of DsRed-ER was noticeably reduced in the <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). This suggests that ER extension into the dendrites was also impaired in layer 2/3 cortical neurons when the expression levels of <italic>Vcp</italic> were reduced <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, <italic>P47</italic> overexpression ameliorated the ER extension defects caused by <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Taken together, both the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggest that the VCP–P47 complex regulates tubular ER formation and extension in neurons.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Somatic rough ER is also impaired by the VCP R95G mutation</title>
<p>Because the ER is a continuous membrane structure extending from the nuclear envelope to the entire cell, the dendritic ER defect caused by <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>P47</italic> deficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>) suggests that the ER in soma is also likely to be affected. To investigate this possibility, we generated mutant mice expressing VCP R95G mutant proteins using a gene targeting approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a–d</xref>) and cultured hippocampal neurons from mutant embryos and wild-type littermates. Because IBMPFD is dominantly inherited, <italic>Vcp</italic><sup><italic>WT/R95G</italic></sup> mice (referred to as VCP R95G knockin mice hereafter) were used to examine the effect of the <italic>Vcp</italic> mutation. At 18 DIV, cultured neurons were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The length of individual rough ER (rER) and the density of attached ribosomes on ER were determined. We found that the rER length was noticeably reduced in VCP R95G knockin neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). Note that we collected blind a similar number of images from VCP R95G knockin neurons and wild-type neurons and found that rER fragments in VCP R95G knockin neurons were much fewer. This led to a lower sample size of rER in VCP R95G knockin neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>, wild-type, <italic>n</italic>=722; R95G, <italic>n</italic>=497). These data suggest that the VCP R95G mutation reduced rER extension and abundance. Moreover, we found that the density of ribosomes attached to ER was also much lower in VCP R95G knockin neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,g</xref>), which should influence protein synthesis activity in VCP R95G knockin neurons. Together, the results from TEM suggest that the VCP R95G mutation impairs ER morphology and function in soma.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Protein synthesis is impaired by <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>P47</italic> deficiency</title>
<p>Because abundance of and ribosomal attachment to rER was noticeably affected by <italic>Vcp</italic> deficiency and because the major function of rER is to synthesize proteins, including both membrane/secreted proteins and cytosolic proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, we investigated the effects of VCP and P47 on protein synthesis. Newly-synthesized proteins were labeled by a BONCAT method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. After extensive washing to remove free AHA, AHA-incorporated proteins were then detected by Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated alkyne. We found that the expression of the VCP R95G mutant inhibited protein synthesis in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Furthermore, protein synthesis in somata was also noticeably reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,c</xref>), suggesting a global defect in protein synthesis in VCP R95G mutant neurons. This global reduction of protein synthesis was also shown in cultured hippocampal neurons at 18 DIV prepared from VCP R95G knockin mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Expression of the VCP R95G mutant in cultured neurons exhibited time-dependent effects. Expression for 6 days (DIV 12+6) reduced newly-synthesized protein by an average of 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,c</xref>), while neurons expressing the R95G mutant for 2 (DIV 12+2) or 4 days (DIV 12+4) inhibited protein synthesis by ∼40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,c</xref>). In addition, when AHA labeling was extended to 4 or 6 h, there was no obvious difference between the AHA signals in the WT- and R95G mutant-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). The lack of a difference after the longer incubation time is not likely to be due to saturation of AHA labeling because the AHA signals are stronger with longer labeling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>Vcp</italic> deficiency impairs the efficiency of protein synthesis in neurons.</p>
<p>In addition to mature neurons, we also examined the effect of the VCP R95G mutant in immature neurons. Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with WT VCP or the R95G mutant at 2 DIV and were analyzed at 8 DIV. Similar to the results using mature neurons at 18 DIV, expression of the VCP R95G mutant also reduced protein synthesis in the immature neurons at 8 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f,g</xref>). The controls for omitting AHA and adding cycloheximide showed no obvious signal, supporting the specificity of AHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f,g</xref>). Consistent with the defects in protein synthesis, the ER distribution in the dendrites was also reduced in the VCP R95G mutant-expressing neurons at 8 DIV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Together, these results suggest that <italic>Vcp</italic> deficiency impairs both ER distribution and protein synthesis in immature as well as mature neurons.</p>
<p>Knockdown of <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>P47</italic> also had a negative effect on protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a–d</xref>). The negative effects were specifically due to the reduction of <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>P47</italic> expression because the expression of <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>P47</italic> silent mutants that are resistant to the <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>P47</italic> knockdown constructs rescued protein synthesis in neurons expressing the respective knockdown constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a–d</xref>). Moreover, similar to the ER distribution and dendritic spine formation, overexpression of <italic>P47</italic> effectively increased protein synthesis in <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e,f</xref>). Thus, VCP and P47 work together to regulate ER distribution, protein synthesis and dendritic spine formation in neurons.</p>
<p>In addition to BONCAT, we applied another method—surface sensing of translation (SUnSET)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>—to monitor protein synthesis through the incorporation of puromycin into neurons. Puromycin resembles the 3′ end of transfer RNA and incorporates into synthesizing polypeptide chains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Puromycin-labeled proteins can then be detected using puromycin antibody. Similar to the results using AHA labeling, <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown reduced puromycin labeling and <italic>P47</italic> overexpression rescued puromycin incorporation in <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). In conclusion, both BONCAT and SUnSET reveal the protein synthesis defects caused by <italic>Vcp</italic> and <italic>P47</italic> deficiencies.</p>

<title>Some synaptic ion channels are less expressed in <italic>Vcp</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To more closely examine its control over dendritic spine density, in addition to its effect on protein synthesis revealed by AHA and puromycin labeling, we also wondered whether <italic>Vcp</italic> deficiency influences the expression of synaptic membrane proteins. We screened several glutamate receptors, which are enriched at dendritic spines and are critical for their functioning, and found that expression levels of GRIN2B and GRIA2/3 were noticeably lower in VCP R95G knockin neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). GRIN2A levels also tended to be lower in VCP R95G knockin neurons, but the difference did not attain statistical significance. For GRIA1 and GRM5, their protein levels were comparable between WT and VCP R95G knockin neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). PSD-95 protein levels were also unaffected by the VCP R95G mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). These results suggest that some synaptic ion channels are particularly sensitive to the VCP R95G mutation.</p>

<title>Inhibition of protein synthesis reduces synapse density</title>
<p>The aforementioned results imply that defective protein synthesis likely reduces the dendritic spine density in <italic>Vcp</italic>- and <italic>P47</italic>-deficient neurons. Under this scenario, we expected that inhibition of protein synthesis with other treatments should also reduce dendritic spine density. Cycloheximide and rapamycin—an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>—were used to investigate this possibility. As expected, preincubation with cycloheximide and rapamycin reduced AHA incorporation in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). More importantly, cycloheximide and rapamycin treatment also reduced the dendritic spine density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). The inhibitory effects of cycloheximide and rapamycin on the dendritic spine density are consistent with our hypothesis that protein synthesis is critical for the regulation of dendritic spine density.</p>

<title>Restoring protein synthesis ameliorates the synapse defects</title>
<p>If protein synthesis is indeed the key downstream pathway of VCP and P47 that controls dendritic spine formation, upregulation of protein synthesis in <italic>Vcp</italic>- and <italic>P47</italic>-deficient neurons would be expected to ameliorate the dendritic spine defects. Leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, is known to increase protein synthesis by activating the mTOR pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Additional leucine was added into culture media to increase concentrations from the basal level (0.8 mM) to 2, 2.5 or 5 mM. We found that the additional leucine effectively induced S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation in neurons in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). The addition of leucine to 2.5 mM in cultured neurons was sufficient to ameliorate the defects in protein synthesis caused by the VCP R95G mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b,c</xref>). However, the additional leucine did not improve ER distribution in VCP R95G mutant neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9d,e</xref>). More importantly, we found that the additional leucine increased the dendritic spine density of the VCP R95G mutant-expressing neurons to the level of the WT VCP-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9f</xref>). To further confirm the role of protein synthesis in the effect of leucine on the dendritic spine density, rapamycin and CGP57380—an inhibitor of MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (MNK1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>—were applied to neurons treated with additional leucine. We found that both inhibitors effectively suppressed the effect of the additional leucine on dendritic spine formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that leucine is able to ameliorate the defects in dendritic spines caused by a <italic>Vcp</italic> deficiency by inducing protein synthesis. These results strengthen our hypothesis that inefficient protein synthesis is the critical impairment downstream of <italic>Vcp</italic> deficiency in controlling dendritic spine formation.</p>

<title>ATL1 and RAB10 control protein synthesis and synapse density</title>
<p>To further investigate the involvement of ER malformation and dysfunction in dendritic spinogenesis, we examined the function of ATL1 and RAB10 in cultured hippocampal neurons. <italic>ATL1</italic> is a causative gene of hereditary spastic paraplegia 3A (SPG3A) and encodes a dynamin-like GTPase to control homotypic membrane fusion of tubular ER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The R217Q mutation of <italic>ATL1</italic> with defective GTPase activity has been identified in patients with SPG3A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Cultured hippocampal neurons were cotransfected with DsRed-ER and the WT or R217Q mutant of ATL1. As expected, ATL1 R217Q mutant-expressing cells had a lower D/S ratio of DsRed-ER compared with neurons transfected with WT <italic>Atl1</italic> or control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10a,d</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, expression of the ATL1 R217Q mutant noticeably impaired protein synthesis, which was reflected in lower AHA incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10b,e</xref>), and a reduced density of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10c,f</xref>). This reduction was specifically caused by the <italic>Atl1</italic> mutation because expression of WT <italic>Atl1</italic> did not impair ER distribution or protein synthesis. In fact, we even found an increase in dendritic spine density for ATL1 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10a–f</xref>). Thus, these results suggest a role for ATL1 in the regulation of ER distribution, protein synthesis and dendritic spinogenesis.</p>
<p>The small GTPase RAB10 also regulates tubular ER formation. However, it is involved in ER tubule growth independently of ATL1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). To examine whether RAB10 also influences protein synthesis and dendritic spine formation, the effects of WT and a GDP-locked T23N mutant of RAB10 in cultured hippocampal neurons were compared. The RAB10 T23N mutant had been shown to inhibit the function of endogenous RAB10 in tubular ER formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. As expected, inhibition of endogenous RAB10 activity by expression of the RAB10 T23N mutant impaired the ER distribution in neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a,d</xref>). Although the mechanisms underlying the function of ATL1 and RAB10 in ER formation differ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, we found that similar to ATL1, the RAB10 T23N mutant also reduced protein synthesis and dendritic spine formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b,c,e,f</xref>). Together, the ATL1 and RAB10 results echo our hypothesis that regulation of the tubular ER network controls protein synthesis and consequently influences the density of dendritic spines.</p>

<title>VCP and ATL1 act together for dendritic spine formation</title>
<p>A recent study indicated that, in Drosophila, VCP functionally interacts with ATL1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). It seems very likely that VCP and ATL1 also work together in mammalian neurons to regulate dendritic spinogenesis. To examine this possibility, we first confirmed the interaction between VCP and ATL1 in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10g</xref>). The rescue effect of overexpression of <italic>Atl1</italic> on <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown was then investigated. We found that <italic>Atl1</italic> overexpression increased protein synthesis and partially rescued the density of dendritic spines in <italic>Vcp</italic> knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10h–j</xref>). Expression of both VCP R95G and ATL1 R217Q mutants in cultured neurons did not have an additive effect on downregulation of dendritic spine formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10k</xref>). These results suggest that VCP and ATL1 act in the same pathway to control dendritic spine formation. In contrast to ATL1, expression of the RAB10 T23N mutant further decreased the dendritic spine density in the presence of the VCP R95G mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10l</xref>). These results lend further credence to our hypothesis that VCP and ATL1, but not RAB10, work in the same pathway to regulate dendritic spine formation.</p>
<p>To investigate the involvement of protein synthesis in the effect of ATL1 on dendritic spine formation, extra leucine was added to neurons expressing the ATL1 R217Q mutant. Similar to <italic>Vcp</italic>-deficient neurons, extra leucine also ameliorated the dendritic spine defect caused by the ATL1 R217Q mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10m</xref>).</p>
<p>Since ATL1 is a well-known regulator for tubular ER formation, the physical and functional interactions between VCP and ATL1 further support that VCP controls tubular ER formation to regulate dendritic spine formation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>VCP is involved in multiple cellular processes. The current model of the pathogenic mechanism of VCP-related disorders mainly focuses on protein degradation involving UPS, ERAD and autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. One of the reasons why protein degradation is particularly interesting is because protein aggregation in patient tissues has been recognized as a hallmark of VCP-related disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. However, the evidence does not exclude the involvement of other functions of VCP in the pathogenic mechanism(s) of diseases. Previous studies have suggested that the influence of <italic>VCP</italic> mutations on different types of cells varies. In mouse myoblast C2C12 cells, expression of the <italic>VCP</italic> IBMPFD mutants induces the aggregation of polyubiquitinated proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. In contrast, although the <italic>VCP</italic> IBMPFD mutant proteins do not form obvious aggregates in cultured hippocampal neurons after expression for six days, dendritic spine density was reduced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, suggesting that protein aggregation is not required for the <italic>VCP</italic> IBMPFD mutant-mediated impairment of dendritic spinogenesis. These findings imply that the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the <italic>VCP</italic> defects in different tissues may vary.</p>
<p>In this report, we unexpectedly found that the ER is the critical target of <italic>Vcp</italic> deficiency in regulating dendritic spine density in neurons. Our data suggest that VCP, P47 and ATL1 work together to control tubular ER formation and influence protein synthesis. Previous studies have suggested that the VCP/P47 complex regulates the activity of an unknown membrane fusion regulator, thereby controlling tubular ER formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Based on our data, it seems possible that ATL1 is the membrane fusion regulator of the VCP-P47 complex that regulates ER membrane fusion. In our TEM analysis, we found that the length of rER, ribosomal attachment on rER and rER abundance were noticeably reduced in VCP R95G knockin neurons. Although rER is generally believed to contribute to synthesis of membrane/secreted proteins, several studies have demonstrated that a noticeable fraction of cytosolic proteins are also synthesized by ribosomes associated with ER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Thus, ER defects caused by <italic>Vcp</italic> deficiency likely results in a protein synthesis deficit. Using 1-h AHA labeling, we show here that protein synthesis efficiency is impaired by a <italic>Vcp</italic> deficiency, which is consistent with the ER defects revealed by TEM. Further, expression of synaptic glutamate receptors GRIN2B and GRIA2/3—the important ion channels of excitatory synapses—was reduced in VCP R95G knockin mutant neurons, indicative of VCP involvement in the impairment of the synaptic response and consequent elimination of dendritic spines. It would be intriguing to explore in the future whether the VCP R95G mutation results in impairment of electrophysiological responses and cognitive deficiencies using our knockin mutant mice.</p>
<p>In our experiments, we did find an unfolded protein response induced by <italic>Ufd1l</italic> knockdown and tunicamycin treatment. However, the dendritic spine density was not affected by <italic>Ufd1l</italic> knockdown or tunicamycin treatment, suggesting that an unfolded protein response is not involved in regulation of dendritic spine density. It is noteworthy that protein translation was transiently suppressed by tunicamycin treatment in neurons. Perhaps protein translation suppression is too transient to noticeably influence the total amounts of synaptic membrane proteins, thereby explaining the lack of effect on dendritic spines. Although an unfolded protein response, either induced by <italic>Ufd1l</italic> knockdown or tunicamycin treatment, seems not to be critical for regulation of dendritic spine density under our experimental conditions, it is still possible that an unfolded protein response influences other neuronal functions. This would be a topic worth pursuing in the future. In addition to protein degradation, the VCP–UFD1L–NPL4 complex also regulates other activities, such as the ubiquitin-governed DNA damage response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. As DNA double-stranded breaks are involved in expression of neuronal early-response genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, it would also be intriguing to investigate whether VCP contributes to regulation of neuronal early response genes. It may not directly control dendritic spine formation but likely regulates other neuronal functions.</p>
<p>In this report, we provide evidence that changes in ER structure and function may be a common characteristic of various neurological disorders, including IBMPFD and SPG3A. SPG3A is characterized by progressive motor weakness and spasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Degeneration of corticospinal tract axons with the onset of childhood is the major phenotypic feature of SPG3A. In addition, recent studies have also indicated hypometabolism in the frontal cortex and cerebellum and functional disorders in the frontal cortex in patients with SPG3A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Our data indicate that expression of the <italic>ATL1</italic> mutant reduces the efficiencies of protein synthesis and dendritic spine formation in cultured hippocampal neurons. It seems likely that protein synthesis is also involved in the pathogenesis of SPG3A.</p>
<p>Branched-chain amino acids, particularly leucine, have been shown to bind sestrin2 to activate protein synthesis through the activation of the mTOR pathway in a variety of cells, including neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. Our data show that restoring protein synthesis using a leucine supplement efficiently increases the activity of S6 kinase, protein synthesis and the dendritic spine density of neurons. In contrast, a recent study indicated that leucine is a less efficient mTOR activator in <italic>Vcp</italic>-deficient muscle cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. This is another example of a preferential effect of VCP on different cell types. Based on our observations, neurons are susceptible to leucine supplements, so taking a leucine supplement may be a good way of increasing protein synthesis in the brain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our present study reveals that ER morphogenesis and protein synthesis play roles in dendritic spine formation. VCP, P47 and ATL1 regulate tubular ER formation, influence protein synthesis and then control dendritic spine formation. In light of these findings, we propose that, in addition to unfolded protein accumulation and aggregation, the role of ER morphology and protein synthesis in controlling protein homeostasis should be evaluated in neurological disorders. Restoring protein synthesis with leucine provides a potential therapeutic strategy.</p>

Briefly, hippocampal neurons from E18.5 embryos were seeded on coverslips (18 mm in diameter and 0.12–0.17 mm in thickness) coated with poly-<sc>L</sc>-lysine. Calcium phosphate precipitation was carried out using Hepes buffered saline at pH 7.05–7.07. A total 2.5 μg DNA was used for two wells. Neurons were then fixed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose and permeabilized with PBS with 0.2% Triton-X-100. A PBS solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin was used for blocking and antibody incubation for immunofluorescence staining. Images of neurons were recorded with a confocal microscope (LSM700, Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63 × NA 1.4 oil objective lens (Zeiss) and captured with Zen acquisition and analysis software (Zeiss) at 20–22 °C as a Z-series of 5–12 sections spaced 0.6–0.8 μm apart. The Z-series was then projected into single images. For publication, the images were processed with Photoshop (Adobe), with minimal adjustment of brightness to the whole images. To analyze dendritic spine density, the spine numbers of dendrite fragments of 20 μm in length starting from a point 20 μm away from the soma were manually counted using ImageJ software.

<title>ER distribution</title>
<p>Cultured neurons were cotransfected with DsRed-ER and the various plasmids as indicated in each experiment. Immunostaining with corresponding antibodies to monitor expression of transfected genes was then performed. Cell images were acquired using a confocal microscope (LSM700, Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63 × NA 1.4 oil objective lens (Zeiss) and driven by Zen acquisition and analysis software (Zeiss) at 20–22 °C as a Z-series spaced 0.36 μm apart. The Z-series was then projected into a single image to quantify the ER intensities. Neuronal morphology was first outlined based on Myc tag (WT and R95G of VCP) or GFP (control vector, VCPi and P47i) signals using the ‘Segmented Line' tool of ImageJ software. The intensities of DsRed-ER in the entire cell and soma were then quantified using the ImageJ measurement tool. Total dendritic DsRed-ER signals were then obtained by subtracting the soma intensities from the whole cell intensities. The ratio of the dendritic signal to somatic signal indicates the dendritic distribution of the ER. To further analyze the ER distribution along dendrites, cumulative probability was also measured. Radius areas were plotted from the soma margin every 5 μm up to a distance of 60 μm away from the soma. The cumulative probability distribution of the ratio of each radius intensity to total dendritic intensities is shown. In addition to ImageJ, quantification was also conducted with the Imaris software package (BitPlane, MN, USA). For this, only one panel of triplicates was verified. The Z-series were processed with the ‘Surface Creation' function of Imaris for the DsRed-ER channel. The surface was created by the absolute intensity without filtering. To define the ER signals of the entire neuron, a threshold range (between 18–255 shades/levels of grey) was used to include ER signals in the somata and all dendritic branches. Soma intensities were then quantified by the ‘Segment of Interest Regions' tool to outline the soma area with the same threshold. Background surface intensities were manually deleted. The intensity results were then exported to excel for statistical analyses with GraphPad Prism. The representative images were outputted to a TIFF file by a ‘snapshot' of the scene. Images were then processed with photoshop for publication. For dsRed2-ER and calreticulin morphology in neurons, super-resolution microscopy and 3D-reconstruction was performed using an Elyra PS.1 microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with 63 × /NA 1.4 oil (Plan-Apochromat; Carl Zeiss) objective lens and iXon 885 EMCCD (Andor Technology) at room temperature. The Z-series spaced 0.13 μm apart was set and processed with Zen 2011 software: noise filter parameter value, -3; and SR frequency weighting value, +1.</p>

<title><italic>In utero</italic> electroporation and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Expression plasmids were delivered to ventricular radial glial cells by electroporation as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. Briefly, at E15.5, pregnant ICR (CD1) mice purchased from BioLASCO (Taiwan) were anesthetized with a MATRX isoflurane VIP 3000 vaporizer (Midmark). One μg μl<sup>−1</sup> of DNA plasmid mixture (with 0.01% fast-green dye) in 0.9% NaCl was then injected in the ventricles. Five pulses of 40 mV, 50 ms with 950 ms intervals were generated using Electro Square Porator ECM830 (BTX). Brain sections were then prepared from P3 pups regardless of gender for immunofluorescence staining as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. Briefly, the procedure was similar to the method described in above ‘Neuronal Culture and Analysis', except that 30-μm-think sections and 3% normal horse serum in Tris-buffered saline for blocking and antibody incubation were used. Images were collected and analyzed as described above.</p>

<title>VCP R95G knockin mice</title>
<p>A recombineering-based method was used to generate knockin mutant mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>. Briefly, a genomic fragment covering from intron 1 to intron 4 of the <italic>Vcp</italic> gene was subcloned from bacterial artificial chromosome clone RP23-343E15 into a modified pBluescript vector. The R95G point mutation at the third exon and an <italic>Eco</italic>RV site in the third intron were generated by direct mutagenesis. The <italic>lox</italic>P-flanked Neo cassette was then introduced into the third intron following the edited <italic>Eco</italic>RV site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The targeting vector was electroporated into C57BL/6 embryonic stem cells for production of chimeric mice. Breeding with C57BL/6-C2J albino strains was performed to accelerate germline transmission. Genotyping was examined by three methods: (1) Genomic Southern blotting was performed using a 5′ probe (nucleotide residues 106,884–107,133 of clone RP23-343E15) and 3′ probe (nucleotide residues nucleotide residues 106,884–107,133 of clone RP23-343E15), respectively. (2) Genomic PCR was carried out using primer set 1: 5′- GTGTCTGAAGACAGTGGACAGTGT -3′, 5′- GAAGAGCTTGGCGGCGAATG -3′ and 5′- CTTAGAAATGAGACCAGAACCGGG -3′ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). (3) After removing the Neo cassette by breeding with E2A-Cre mice (stock no. 003724, Jackson lab), offspring were genotyped using primer set 2: 5′- TCAGTGACCCAAAGTCCTTAGC -3′ and GGGAGACGGTGTCTATAATGCAGA -3′. Since the VCP R95G allele contains an edited <italic>Eco</italic>RV site, the PCR amplified product was further processed with <italic>Eco</italic>RV digestion (FastDigest, Thermo Scientific) to generate two fragments of comparable size. Sequencing was performed to confirm the specific mutated residues.</p>

<title>Transmission electron microscopy</title>
<p>For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study, cortical neurons were plated on Aclar embedding film (Electron Microscopy Sciences). At 10 DIV, cells were fixed with fixative buffer (2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with washing buffer (0.1 M sodium cacodylate (Sigma), 4% sucrose, 0.05% CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 5 min, cells were post-fixed with 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with cold ddH<sub>2</sub>O, for 5 min three times, and incubated in 1% uranyl acid (Polysciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were then dehydrated with graded ethanol solutions at RT for 7 min for each step: 50% once, 70% once, 90% once and 100% three times. Then, cells were filtrated with a series of solutions as follows: (1) EtOH:Spurr's Resin (Low Viscosity Embedding Media Spurr's, Kit Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA)=1:1 for 30 min; (2) EtOH:Spurr's Resin=1:2 for 40 min; (3) pure Spurr's Resin for 1 h. Cells were then polymerized at 70 °C for 20 h. Ultrathin sections were sectioned with a diamond knife (DiATOME) and stained with 4% uranyl acid for 5 min followed by lead citrate stain for 8 min. After washing with ddH<sub>2</sub>O, cells were examined by TEM (Tecnai G2 Spirit TWIN, FEI Company) with a Gatan CCD Camera (794.10.BP2 MultiScanTM) and acquisition software DigitalMicrograph (Gatan).</p>

<title><italic>De novo</italic> protein synthesis monitored by BONCAT and SUnSET</title>
<p>For BONCAT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, cells were washed with PBS once, then incubated with Met-free DMEM (GIBCO, Invitrogen) for 30 min. <sc>L</sc>-azidohomoalanine (AHA, 50 μM) was added into the medium for incubation for another 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Permeabilization was then performed with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After washing with PBS 3 times and blocking with 3% BSA, cells were processed with Click-iT Cell Reaction Buffer Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated with Click-iT reaction buffer (5 μM alkyne modified Alexa Fluor-488) for 30 min. To identify transfected neurons, cells were further washed with PBS three times, blocked with 3% BSA again and subjected to standard fluorescence immunostaining with Myc antibody and Alexa Flour-555-conjugated secondary antibody. Alexa Fluor-488 intensities (indicative of AHA incorporation) in the soma and dendrites (a 20 μm fragment 20 μm apart from the soma of transfected neurons) were analyzed using ImageJ. Some of the critical experiments were performed blind to minimize the effects of bias.</p>
<p>For SUnSET<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, cells were transferred to neuronal medium containing puromycin (10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>) for 10 min. Cells were then washed with PBS three times and returned to the original medium for another 50 min incubation. Fixation and permeabilization were then performed as described above.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>COS-1 cells were transfected with myc-tagged Atl1 and HA-tagged <italic>Vcp</italic> for 24 h. Cells were harvested with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH7.4 containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> leupeptin, 2 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> aprotinin, 10 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> pepstatin, and 2 mM PMSF, 2 μM MG132) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. The solubilized extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation using Myc antibodies and control non-immune IgG combined with protein A sepharose. After mixing by rotation for 4 h at 4 °C, the precipitates were sequentially washed with the following solutions buffered with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4): 1% Triton X-100, once; 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 M LiCl, twice; 0.5 M LiCl, once; and Tris buffer alone, once. The precipitated proteins were then analyzed by immunoblotting.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>To detect phosphorylated proteins, sodium fluoride (50 mM), sodium orthovanadate (1 mM) and sodium butyrate (1 mM) were included in lysis buffer (2% SDS in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 2 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> aprotinin, 2 mM PMSF, 2 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> leupeptin, 2 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> pepstatin, 2 μM MG132, 250 U of Benzonase endonuclease) to lyse cells. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk or 3% BSA in TBS-T (50 mM Tris, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl with 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h at RT and incubated with indicated antibodies in 3% blocking solution for 2 h. After washing with TBS-T buffer three times, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. For AHA incorporation, after washing with PBS three times, cells were harvested with lysis buffer (1% SDS in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 buffer with protease inhibitors and endonuclease as described above). Based on the Click-iT Protein Reaction Buffer Kit protocol (Invitrogen), each 100 μg of protein samples was then labeled with 40 μM alkyne modified tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). Protein samples were then subjected to immunoblotting as described above, except that anti-TAMRA antibody was used as primary antibody to detect AHA-labeled proteins. For SUnSET, anti-puromycin antibody was used. The antibody-bound complexes were detected with WesternBright Sirius HRP substrate (Advansta). The protein signals were then visualized and analyzed using ImageQuant LAS 4,000 with the software ImageQuant LAS 4,000 Biomolecular Imager (GE Healthcare). Images have been cropped for presentation.

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All the quantitative data in this report are presented as means plus s.e.m. or cumulative distribution. Graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad software). No statistical method was applied to evaluate the sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to a previous publication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. Basically, 20–30 neurons were collected each time from three independent experiments. For dendritic spine analysis, three dendrites of each neuron were quantitated. Data collection and analysis were conducted randomly and blind. Most of the data meet the assumption of the tests (normal distribution), except the dendritic spine density. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed unpaired Student <italic>t</italic>-test for two group comparisons. For three group comparisons, one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's test in GraphPad Prism 5.0 was used. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's test using SigmaStat 3.5 was performed to analyze the effects of two genetic factors combined with two different treatments. For cumulative probability distributions of spine density, the statistical significance was analyzed with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (SPSS software, version 10.0, SPSS, Chicago, Ill). <italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</p>
