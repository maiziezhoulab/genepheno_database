<title>Summary</title>
<p>Obesity is genetically heterogeneous with monogenic and complex polygenic forms. Using exome and targeted sequencing in 2,737 severely obese cases and 6,704 controls, we identified three genes (<italic>PHIP</italic>, <italic>DGKI</italic>, and <italic>ZMYM4</italic>) with an excess burden of very rare predicted deleterious variants in cases. In cells, we found that nuclear PHIP (pleckstrin homology domain interacting protein) directly enhances transcription of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a neuropeptide that suppresses appetite. Obesity-associated <italic>PHIP</italic> variants repressed POMC transcription. Our demonstration that PHIP is involved in human energy homeostasis through transcriptional regulation of central melanocortin signaling has potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications for patients with obesity and developmental delay. Additionally, we found an excess burden of predicted deleterious variants involving genes nearest to loci from obesity genome-wide association studies. Genes and gene sets influencing obesity with variable penetrance provide compelling evidence for a continuum of causality in the genetic architecture of obesity, and explain some of its missing heritability.</p>

<title>Context and Significance</title>
<p id="p0030">
<bold>Obese children are often stigmatized and experience health problems such as diabetes and heart disease in later life. Finding the cause of their obesity may lead to new treatments. In some cases, faulty genes underly severe childhood obesity. In this study, researchers in the United Kingdom and their colleagues aimed to discover new genes linked to severe childhood obesity and found three candidates. One gene, <italic>PHIP</italic>, affected childhood obesity with learning difficulties. They demonstrate that <italic>PHIP</italic> works by controlling another gene, <italic>POMC</italic>, which is known to regulate appetite. This finding means that children with faults in the gene <italic>PHIP</italic> may benefit from existing treatments. Further studies will be required to fully evaluate these genes in a broader context.</bold>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0035">The rising prevalence of obesity is largely driven by the consumption of high-calorie foods and reduced levels of physical activity at work and in leisure time, which contribute to sustained positive energy balance and weight gain. However, family, twin, and adoption studies have consistently demonstrated that 40%–70% of the variation in body weight in a given environment is attributable to genetic variation within the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allison et al., 1996</xref>). As such, finding even a single gene that contributes to the regulation of body weight is important as it provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of obesity and may identify potential targets for future weight loss therapy.</p>
<p id="p0040">To date, several different approaches have been used to identify genes involved in human energy homeostasis. Candidate gene studies led to the identification of very rare variants that cause monogenic forms of severe obesity mostly by impacting the function of proteins involved in the central leptin-melanocortin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doche et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Rahilly and Farooqi, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saeed et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Klaauw and Farooqi, 2015</xref>). These findings have had diagnostic value for patients and have paved the way for stratified therapy as seen with the treatment of congenital leptin deficiency by recombinant leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farooqi et al., 1999</xref>) and of <italic>POMC</italic> and <italic>LEPR</italic> deficiency by the melanocortin 4 receptor (<italic>MC4R</italic>) agonist setmelanotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clément et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kühnen et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0045">By focusing on more common forms of genetic variation (minor allele frequency [MAF] &gt; 5%) in population-derived cohorts, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 250 loci that are associated with body mass index (BMI) and/or obesity (defined as a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), mostly through modest effects on neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grarup et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Justice et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minster et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turcot et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Locke et al., 2015</xref>). While cumulatively these approaches have provided a framework for understanding the genetic architecture of weight regulation and susceptibility to obesity, a substantial proportion of the heritability of human obesity (including severe childhood-onset obesity) has yet to be explained. There is no biological reason why genetic risk factors for common complex traits/diseases should fall neatly into these two categories, as we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barroso and McCarthy, 2019</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katsanis, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marouli et al., 2017</xref>) have suggested. We therefore hypothesize that variants that contribute to this “missing heritability” in obesity will include a range of allele frequencies and effect sizes in a continuum of causality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katsanis, 2016</xref>), as seen for other complex traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marouli et al., 2017</xref>), and explore this in the work we present here.</p>

<title>Rare Variants Implicate Three New Genes in Human Energy Homeostasis</title>
<p id="p0050">Here, we studied a cohort of European ancestry individuals with severe childhood-onset obesity (SCOOP) in whom known causes of monogenic obesity, such as congenital leptin deficiency and <italic>MC4R</italic> mutations, had been excluded (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5">STAR Methods</xref>). Children were recruited into the cohort if they had a BMI standard deviation score (BMI SDS) greater than three and age of onset below 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wheeler et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5">STAR Methods</xref>). Our study design, focused on early-onset severe obesity, was aimed at increasing power to identify genes with an excess burden of rare, functionally significant variants with moderate to large effects on the phenotype (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5">STAR Methods</xref>). We analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 927 SCOOP cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendricks et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walter et al., 2015</xref>) and 4,057 UK healthy blood donors from the INTERVAL cohort (stage 1; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5">STAR Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S1</xref>). To test for different genetic effects, we performed single-variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref>) and three nested gene-based analyses: (1) burden of very rare (MAF &lt; 0.025%) predicted loss-of-function (LOF) variants (LOF analysis), (2) burden of very rare (MAF &lt; 0.025%) predicted deleterious variants by five different <italic>in silico</italic> programs (LOF and missense [STRICT] analysis), and (3) SKAT-O analysis of variants with MAF &lt; 1% and predicted deleterious by a single program (LOF and missense [BROAD] analysis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Tables S2</xref>A–S2C; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5">STAR Methods</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow Diagram of Approach and Headline Results</p><p>The overall analysis and main results from this study. Whole-exome sequence data from SCOOP and INTERVAL participants were analyzed as single-variant, gene-base, and gene set analyses. Overall, 48 variants from single-variant and gene-based analysis and 9 genes from gene-based analysis were identified and taken forward to stage 2 validation, by genotyping or targeted-sequenced. Combined stage 1 and stage 2 significant results were found in three genes (<italic>PHIP</italic>, <italic>DGKI</italic>, and <italic>ZMYM4</italic>), which were taken for functional follow-up. In parallel, gene set analysis performed on five primary gene sets (obesity, syndromic obesity, DDG2P, Constrained [pLI &gt; 0.9], Unconstrained [pLI ≤ 0.9], and Genes Mapping to known Obesity or BMI GWAS loci) is represented. The strongest enrichment, which was detected in loss-of-function constrained genes (pLI &gt; 0.9) mapping to obesity or BMI-associated GWAS loci, is shown (Genes in GWAS loci, pLI &gt; 0.9). Related to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="p0055">We identified nine genes with an excess burden of variants from LOF, STRICT, and BROAD analyses in cases versus controls, meeting the arbitrary threshold of p &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup>, which we took forward for stage 2 analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5">STAR Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Tables S2</xref>A–S2C). Targeted sequencing was performed in an additional unrelated 1,810 SCOOP cases and 2,647 controls from the Fenland cohort (stage 2), and validation of reported variants was undertaken by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5">STAR Methods</xref>). Validated variants from stage 1 and stage 2 results were combined in meta-analysis. Directionally consistent association with obesity in stage 2, and stronger p values from stage 1 + 2 in either LOF or STRICT analysis was detected in three genes. For each gene, we highlight the most significant association result: p<sub>meta-LOF</sub> = 1.23 × 10<sup>−5</sup>
<italic>PHIP</italic> (pleckstrin homology domain interacting protein), p<sub>meta-STRICT</sub> = 7.93 × 10<sup>−4</sup>

<p id="p0075"><italic>PHIP</italic> is of particular interest, as deletions and frameshift mutations in this gene have been reported in patients with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features, and in some cases, patients were reported to be overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Ligt et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jansen et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). In keeping with previous reports, some probands in SCOOP had learning difficulties and dysmorphic features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Repeat analysis of our obesity cases stratified by the presence/absence of developmental delay demonstrated a very strong association of a burden of <italic>PHIP</italic> very rare LOF variants with obesity in the presence of developmental delay (OR<sub>LOF_stage1+2</sub> = 95.01, CI<sub>95</sub> = 5.11,1765.21, p<sub>LOF_stage1+2</sub> = 3.19 × 10<sup>−10</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Human PHIP exists as two isoforms with distinct cellular localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>B).

A long (230-kDa) PHIP isoform is exclusively localized in the nucleus.

<p id="p0085">Here, using immunoprecipitation, we showed that cytoplasmic PHIP interacts with IRS-2 in cells stimulated with leptin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>A); however, this interaction is not required for and does not modulate leptin-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 or ERK1/2, key signaling pathways involved in energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>B). We next investigated whether nuclear PHIP could directly affect the transcription of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a neuropeptide that mediates the appetite-suppressing effects of leptin. Using a POMC luciferase reporter assay, we found that wild-type (WT) PHIP potentiated POMC transcription in the absence of leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>C); all PHIP mutants decreased POMC transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>D). Seven mutants repressed POMC transcription below levels seen for the null mutation R250X. In co-transfection experiments with varying concentrations of WT and mutant PHIP, four of these mutants (T289P, D594E, Q1343X, and R1505Q) exert a dominant-negative effect, repressing POMC transcription by WT PHIP in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>E). Using fluorescent microscopy, we found that most mutants did not alter cellular localization of PHIP, although variants found in cases led to a significant decrease in the ratio of nuclear:cytoplasmic PHIP compared to controls (p = 0.004) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>F–3H, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S5</xref>). This finding suggests that a reduction in the amount of nuclear PHIP available to enhance POMC transcription (with or without leptin) may contribute to the development of obesity. Leptin stimulation rescued the effects of some, but not all, PHIP mutants on POMC transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Genes in BMI GWAS Loci Are Enriched for Very Rare Predicted Deleterious Variants in Severe Obesity</title>
<p id="p0115">Lastly, we investigated whether particular groups of genes, as a gene set, were enriched in very rare predicted deleterious variants in severe early-onset obesity cases compared to controls. These analyses can overcome some of the power limitations when testing genes individually: though individual genes may have insufficient evidence of association with severe early-onset obesity, collectively, gene sets may be shown to associate with obesity. We performed analyses on 10 primary gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc6">Table S8</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5">STAR Methods</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0120">In gene set analyses, we found that the set of 157 genes mapping to BMI and obesity GWAS loci (GWAS set) was enriched for very rare functional variants in childhood obesity cases (OR<sub><italic>STRICT</italic></sub> = 1.18, CI<sub>95</sub> = 1.03,1.18, p<sub><italic>perm-STRICT</italic></sub> = 1.63 × 10<sup>−2</sup>; OR<sub>LOF</sub> = 1.39, CI<sub>95</sub> = 1.07,1.80, p<sub><italic>perm-LOF</italic></sub> = 1.39 × 10<sup>−2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc7">Table S9</xref>A).

<p id="p0125">We also noted that genes that are normally depleted in LOF mutations in the population, known as LOF intolerant genes (pLI &gt; 0.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lek et al., 2016</xref>), were more common in this GWAS set compared to all genes in the genome (33.8% versus 19.1%, p<sub>ChiSq-Ind</sub> = 3.11 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). In secondary analyses, we found that this subset of 53 LOF intolerant genes among the 157 genes in the GWAS set was further enriched in very rare deleterious variants in our obese cases compared to controls (OR<sub><italic>STRICT</italic></sub> = 1.34, CI<sub>95</sub> = 1.14,1.58 p<sub><italic>perm-STRICT</italic></sub> = 8.00 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; OR<sub>LOF</sub> = 3.54, CI<sub>95</sub> = 1.80,6.95, p<sub><italic>perm-LOF</italic></sub> = 5.00 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc7">Table S9</xref>D).

<title>LOF Intolerant Genes Are Enriched in Very Rare Deleterious Variants in Obese Cases with Developmental Delay</title>
<p id="p0130">As severe obesity is not normally reproductive lethal, it was surprising to find that 53 LOF intolerant genes among the GWAS set were particularly enriched for very rare deleterious variants in our cases. To further explore these results, we stratified our cases into those with developmental delay and those without. In this group of 53 LOF intolerant genes in the GWAS set, enrichment was similar whether or not obese cases had developmental delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc7">Table S9</xref>D).</p>
<p id="p0135">Next, we noted that the set of all 3,488 LOF intolerant genes in the genome (pLi &gt; 09-set) was also significantly enriched in rare variants in obesity cases (OR<sub><italic>STRICT</italic></sub> = 1.07, CI<sub>95</sub> = 1.02,1.13, p<sub>perm-<italic>strict</italic></sub> = 6.85 × 10<sup>−3</sup>; OR<sub>LOF</sub> = 1.17, CI<sub>95</sub> = 1.07,1.27, p<sub><italic>perm-LOF</italic></sub> = 3.00 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc7">Table S9</xref>A).

<title>Rare Genetic Variation Associated with Obesity Is in the Most Constrained Gene Sets</title>
<p id="p0140">Many diseases that are under strong negative selection, such as schizophrenia, have been shown to be enriched for rare, putative deleterious genetic variation in genes that are usually constrained to LOF variation (pLi &gt; 0.9). Given that obesity may not have undergone strong negative selection, we aimed to test whether the contribution of rare, putative deleterious genetic variation was also observed in gene sets regardless of the level of constraint against deleterious variation. To test this, we assessed gene set enrichment among the deciles of missense constrained genes where genes in the top decile are more constrained against missense variation (i.e., less likely to have missense variation in the general population) and genes in the first decile are less constrained to missense variation (i.e., more likely to have missense variation in the general population). We additionally assessed the deciles of LOF constrained genes. We did not find strong evidence of enrichment for rare deleterious variants beyond gene sets with the strongest constraint against missense or LOF variation, suggesting that, at least for extreme clinical obesity such as that studied here, enrichment for rare putative deleterious variants is primarily in genes that are strongly constrained against deleterious variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc7">Table S9</xref>E).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="p0145">Most genetic studies of obesity have to date identified very rare, likely fully penetrant monogenic mutations causal of severe forms of obesity, or common low-impact alleles influencing BMI and other measures of adiposity in large population-based cohorts. Here, by focusing our efforts on a clinical cohort of very severe early-onset obesity cases of unknown cause, and combining genetic evidence with functional work in cells and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we provide evidence for a continuum of causality in the genetic architecture of obesity. We identify three genes (<italic>PHIP</italic>, <italic>DGKI</italic>, and <italic>ZMYM4</italic>) newly implicated in obesity, harboring very rare predicted deleterious alleles, with intermediate effects and penetrance between those identified through family or large-population scale efforts.</p>
<p id="p0150">These findings have potential diagnostic implications. While <italic>PHIP</italic> has previously been linked to a complex syndrome of developmental delay, and some patients have been noted to be overweight, the gene is not currently included on any gene panel for diagnostic testing in obesity, nor is <italic>PHIP</italic> screening recommended in obesity syndromes. The patients we identified all presented with severe obesity—some did have developmental delay, but not all. We consider that this finding plus the associated molecular work identifying a mechanism by which disruption of <italic>PHIP</italic> can cause obesity (by disrupting transcription of <italic>POMC</italic>) establishes that some patients may present with obesity alone. While we find a broad spectrum of mutations, this alone cannot explain the divergence in phenotypic spectrum seen. It is likely that as <italic>PHIP</italic> affects transcriptional regulation, specific mutations may exert a variable effect clinically. Our data suggest that <italic>PHIP</italic> should be included in genetic testing recommended in clinical guidelines as part of the assessment of severe childhood-onset obesity, particularly in the presence of developmental delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Styne et al., 2017</xref>). These findings may also inform the mechanism-based treatment of <italic>PHIP</italic> variant carriers with a melanocortin receptor agonist currently in clinical trials, which leads to significant weight loss in severe obesity due to complete POMC deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kühnen et al., 2016</xref>). A subset of <italic>PHIP</italic> variant carriers may also benefit from treatment with recombinant leptin, leptin mimetics, or sensitizers.</p>
<p id="p0155">Little is known of the biological function of <italic>DGKI</italic> or <italic>ZMYM4</italic>, or the mechanism through which they influence energy homeostasis. Their discovery is therefore important as it provides new avenues for future biological exploration, and establishes a new link between these genes and as yet undescribed molecular pathways implicated in human metabolism and energy homeostasis.</p>
<p id="p0160">Our results also demonstrate the challenge in identifying novel molecular links between heterogeneous complex diseases and very rare variants that may not be fully penetrant. From a statistical standpoint, the burden of proof is high, possibly requiring in the order of tens of thousands of cases to attain established Bonferroni multiple-testing correction thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zuk et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, failure to meet the stringent Bonferroni threshold does not preclude the possibility of interesting and relevant results, especially when combined with other functional evidence, which is what we have sought to do to increase confidence in our findings. This challenge has been similarly documented in other heterogeneous disorders such as autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yuen et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">C Yuen et al., 2017</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Singh et al., 2017</xref>), where single genes with a burden of rare damaging variants in cases compared to controls have also not attained the required statistical burden of proof. Nonetheless, the results of those studies have provided important insights into the genetic etiology of those disorders. Namely, in the schizophrenia study, Singh and colleagues demonstrated that a group of 3,488 genes previously shown to be intolerant to LOF mutations were enriched with a burden of rare deleterious variants in cases, identifying this group of genes as a whole as important in schizophrenia.</p>
<p id="p0165">This result is analogous to our gene set analyses findings. We provide for the first time evidence that a group of 157 genes mapping nearest to BMI-associated GWAS loci are enriched in very rare deleterious variants in our cases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a subset of 53 out of those 157 genes (that have evidence of being LOF intolerant genes) is even more enriched in very rare functional variants in obese cases, compared to controls achieving effect estimates similar in size to the group of well-established monogenic obesity genes. This set of 53 genes is therefore a primary target to study in more detail in future large-scale obesity sequencing studies.</p>
<p id="p0170">Last, we demonstrate that collectively the 3,488 genes intolerant to LOF (pLi &gt; 0.9-set) are enriched in very rare predicted deleterious variants in severe early-onset obese patients who also have developmental delay, suggesting that further novel discoveries that are clinically relevant may be made by studying this particular subgroup of individuals and genes.</p>
<sec id="sec4.1">
<title>Limitations of Study</title>
<p id="p0175">Our study has a number of limitations. First, all the newly described genes linked to childhood obesity are driven mostly from our discovery dataset and, aside from <italic>ZMYM4</italic>, neither <italic>PHIP</italic> nor <italic>DGKI</italic> meet Bonferroni correction for all genes in the genome. Consequently, these findings merit replication in additional cases with severe childhood-onset obesity and also in adult obesity cases and other ancestries, to further investigate the impact of these genes in obesity more broadly. Second, while we observe enrichment of very rare predicted deleterious variants in <italic>PHIP</italic>, in cases with severe childhood obesity in the absence of developmental delay, this observation merits additional investigation in additional obesity cases (with and without developmental delay) to identify possible genotype-phenotype correlations. Third, the <italic>DGKI</italic> mouse exhibits increased fat mass only in males; further work is therefore needed to evaluate the apparent gender dimorphism, and to gain insights into the mechanism underlying the effect on body composition we observe. Overall, our results highlight the challenges in robustly linking very rare variants with incomplete penetrance to a complex and heterogeneous phenotype such as obesity.</p>
<p id="p0180">To conclude, we demonstrate that WES in clinically ascertained severe-childhood onset obesity, and follow-up in additional unrelated cases, identifies genes and gene sets newly linked to obesity. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms affected by rare obesity-associated variants in cells, model organisms, and humans may identify and validate potential targets for weight loss therapy.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec5.3.2">
<title>Samples</title>
<p id="p0210">Stage 1 used whole-exome sequence data from participants in the SCOOP and INTERVAL studies (details below). Stage 2 included targeted sequence and genotype data obtained for additional SCOOP participants and participants from the FENLAND study (details below). Whole-exome sequence adult obesity data was obtained for adult obesity participants in the UK10K project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walter et al., 2015</xref>) and 1958 Birth Cohort participants were used as controls, but only data for four genes surviving combined stage1+stage2 analysis were analyzed.</p>

<title>Childhood Obesity Cases</title>
<p id="p0215">The Severe Childhood Onset Obesity Project (SCOOP) cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wheeler et al., 2013</xref>), includes ∼4800 British individuals of European ancestry with childhood onset obesity (BMI standard deviation score (SDS) &gt; 3; onset of obesity before the age of 10 years). SCOOP individuals likely to have congenital leptin deficiency, a treatable cause of severe obesity, were excluded by measurement of serum leptin, and individuals with mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (<italic>MC4R</italic>) (the most common genetic form of penetrant obesity) were excluded by prior Sanger sequencing. All participants had age &lt; 10y at the time of recruitment, sex distribution was: Female 548 (59.12%), Male 379 (40.88%).</p>
<p id="p0220">In this study, SCOOP participants were included in stage 1 and stage 2 analyses. Stage 1 analysis comprised 982 SCOOP individuals with whole-exome sequence (WES) data obtained as part of the UK10K consortium project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walter et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendricks et al., 2017</xref>).

These data are available from EGA under accession codes EGA: EGAS00001000242 and EGA: EGAS00001000306. All TwinsUK participants were female, but age information was not available to us at the time of analysis. Age and sex of GS samples were not available to us at the time of analysis. The effect of age and sex was not considered in this study as our discovery study design did not allow us to investigate these parameters due to both power issues (low power for stratified analysis), and the fact that the discovery phase contrasted obese prepubertal children with age &lt; 10y at recruitment with control adults.</p>

<title>Population Controls</title>
<p id="p0230">Stage 1 analysis included 4,502 participants from the INTERVAL cohort. The INTERVAL cohort consists of 50,000 predominantly healthy blood donors in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore et al., 2014</xref>). All individuals were genotyped using the UK Biobank Axiom Array (Affymetrix Axiom Biobank Array) and imputed using a combined UK10K-1000G Phase 3 imputation panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). A subset of 4,502 individuals were selected for whole-exome sequencing, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singh et al., 2016</xref>), of which 4,499 survived QC and were used as controls in this study. Information on age and sex was available to us for 4,045 of the 4,057 participants (99.70%): Age mean (SD): 43.51 (14.31); Sex Female 1,994 (49.30%), Male 2,051 (50.70%).

<p id="p0235">Stage 2 analysis included participants from Phase 1 of the Fenland Study. The Fenland Study is a population-based cohort of 12,435 participants born between 1950 and 1975, recruited from participating General Practices from around the Cambridgeshire region in the UK. Exclusion criteria were: clinically diagnosed diabetes mellitus, inability to walk unaided, terminal illness (life expectancy of ⩽1 year at the time of recruitment), clinically diagnosed psychotic disorder, pregnancy or lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clifton et al., 2017</xref>). Participants were aged 29-64 years and 53.8% were female. For the stage 2 genotyping (see below) we used 3,800 randomly selected Fenland Study participants (age range 29-64, of which sex information was available to us for 3,777 that passed QC: Female 2,040 (54.01%), Male 1,737 (45.99%)), of which a subset of 2,660 (age range 29-64, of which sex was available to us for 2,627: Female 1,392 (52.99%), Male 1,235 (47.01%)) was randomly selected for the stage 2 targeted gene sequencing (see below).

<p id="p0240">Association analysis with adult obesity used 1,000 participants from the 1958 Birth Cohort as controls. The 1958 Birth Cohort Collection is a population-based collection of all individuals born in a week in 1958 in the UK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0110" xlink:href="http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk">http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk</ext-link>). Whole-exome data were obtained from EGA under accession code EGA: EGAS00001000971. Age and sex information of participants included in this study was not available at the time of analysis and was not considered in this study as our discovery study design did not allow us to investigate these parameters due to both power issues (low power for stratified analysis), and the fact that the discovery phase contrasted obese prepubertal children with age &lt; 10y at recruitment with control adults. Briefly, genomic DNA was used to prepare DNA libraries using the Illumina TruSeq sample preparation kit. DNA was fragmented using Covaris technology and libraries were prepared without gel size selection. Target enrichment was performed in pools of six libraries using the Illumina TruSeq Exome Enrichment kit. Captured DNA libraries were PCR amplified using the supplied paired-end PCR primers. Sequencing was performed with an Illumina HiSeq2000 (v3 flow cell, one pool per lane) generating 2x100-bp reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loveday et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<p id="p0255">All mice were given water and diet <italic>ad libitum</italic>, unless otherwise stated. Mice were maintained in a specific pathogen free unit on a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle with lights off at 7:30pm and no twilight period. The ambient temperature was 21 ± 2°C and the humidity was 55 ± 10%. Mice were typically housed for phenotyping using a stocking density of 3-5 mice per cage (overall dimensions of caging: (L x W x H) 365 × 207 × 140mm, floor area 530cm<sup>2</sup>) in individually ventilated caging (Tecniplast Seal Safe Plus GM500) receiving 60 air changes per h. In addition to Aspen bedding substrate, standard environmental enrichment of two nestlets, a cardboard tunnel and three wooden chew blocks was provided. Mice stocking density was typically 3-5 mice per cage. The care and use of mice was performed in accordance with UK Home Office regulations, UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 under a UK Home Office license (P77453634) and which were reviewed regularly by the WTSI Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body. Animal welfare was assessed routinely for all mice involved.

<title>Primary Standardized Phenotyping Pipeline</title>
<p id="p0320">Mice underwent primary standardized phenotyping from 4 weeks of age and had only previously undergone earclip biopsies to identify the mice and establish genotype before entering the pipeline. Mice were randomly assigned to cohorts by Mendelian inheritance by colony managers that were separate from the team performing the phenotyping. <italic>Dgki</italic> homozygous mutant mice on the C57BL/6NTac background were tested in 7 batches (2 batches of 2 females each, 1 batch of 1 male, 1 batch of 1 female, 1 batch of 2 females and 1 male, 1 batch of 2 males and 1 batch of 3 males). All 14 <italic>Dgki</italic> mutant mice completed the pipeline without loss due to welfare or health concerns. No health concerns or adverse effects were noted during or outside of procedures. With each batch of mutant mice, a cohort of typically 7 age and sex matched (though not littermate) wild-type C57BL/6NTac mice were also phenotyped, to provide longitudinal control values as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5.5">Quantification and Statistical Analysis</xref> section. Key phenotyping results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S7</xref>. Data collected include weight curves, basic behavioral/morphological assessment at 9 weeks of age, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) at 13 weeks and body composition assessment by dual emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at 14 weeks of age using a modified version of the MGP pipeline detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">White et al., 2013</xref>), using a mouse breeder’s chow (LabDiets 5021, 9% crude fat content, 21% kcal as fat, 0.276ppm cholesterol, LabDiet, London, UK) instead of a high fat diet. At 16 weeks, random-fed mice were anesthetized using 100 mg/kg Ketamine and 10 mg/kg Xylazine and blood was collected retroorbitally. Samples were used to measure total blood counts, clinical chemistry parameters and for analysis by flow cytometry. Death was confirmed by cervical dislocation and heart removal. As a high throughput screen where genes are selected for study without hypothesis and mice are studied in multiple batches and alongside mice with mutations for different genes, there is limited room for personal bias to influence the results. For mouse management purposes, the cages have both genotype and allele information and hence the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) and Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) screens are run unblinded. Basic behavioral/morphological assessments were run with the technician blinded to the specific allele of the mouse, but not whether the mouse was wild type or a mutant. Necropsies of mice were performed by staff blinded to genotype and allele. Analysis of blood samples for clinical chemistry were run blind using a barcode system. Typically, necropsies and blood collections are performed from 9am-12pm, fasting for GTT starts 9am with the sample collection beginning at 1pm. DEXA and behavioral analysis could be performed at any time between 9am and 4pm. The order of cages and mice treated and assessed in any given procedure was not predetermined. All data was collected using a bespoke mouse and data management system to allow QC of data under predefined conditions, and data was only analyzed once all data from that line had been collected. The standard operating procedures can be found at IMPReSS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0125" xlink:href="https://www.mousephenotype.org/impress">https://www.mousephenotype.org/impress</ext-link>).</p>
<p id="p0325">Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry: DEXA was performed using an Ultrafocus 100 (Faxitron Bioptics LLC, Tuscon, Arizona, USA) under isofluorane anesthesia (IsoFlo, Zoetis UK Ltd., London, UK), in order to minimize recovery times while immobilizing the mouse for data collection. Nose to tail base length measurements were performed using a ruler with 1mm graduations prior to DEXA measurement. Parameters measured included fat mass (g), fat percentage estimate (%), lean mass (g), bone mineral density (mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), and bone mineral content (g). Internal calibration was performed prior to any imaging.</p>
<p id="p0330">Intraperitoneal Glucose tolerance test: Mice were single-housed and fasted for 4 h. Approximately 0.5mm of the tail tip was removed with a scalpel blade and a fasting blood sample (T0) was directly taken (Accu-chek Aviva, Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Mice were then injected with 2g/kg glucose intraperitoneally and further blood samples were taken at 15 (T15), 30 (T30), 60 (T60) and 120 (T120) minutes post-glucose injection. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoid method, where glucose at T0 was used as the baseline value for the mouse. Two female and one male homozygous mice had their T15 to T120 data removed from analysis due to glucose injection failures.</p>
<p id="p0335">Clinical Chemistry (CC): Blood was collected from animals in the random-fed state between 08:30 and 10:30. Mice were anesthetized using 100 mg/kg Ketamine and 10 mg/kg Xylazine and blood was collected into heparinized pediatric tubes (Kabe Labortechnik GmbH, Numbrecht, Germany) using the retro-orbital route, followed by heart removal and cervical dislocation. This anesthesia/administration combination allowed the collection of a sufficient amount of non-hemolyzed blood, particularly for electrolyte parameters that may be strongly affected by hemolysis. Heparinized whole-blood samples were centrifuged at 5,000 rcf for 10 min at 4°C, and the plasma was collected and stored at 4°C until analysis, always within 1 h of collection. Plasma variables were assessed at room temperature using an AU480 chemistry analyzer (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK). Glucose levels were not analyzed from the clinical chemistry screen due to the rapid increase in plasma glucose under Ketamine/Xylazine based anesthesia.</p>

<p id="p0390">Details of sequencing and variant calling for the SCOOP cases, as part of the UK10K exomes, and INTERVAL controls can be found elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendricks et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walter et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, single–sample variant calling using GATK Haplotype Caller (v3.2) was performed on the union of Agilent v3 and v5 targets plus a 100 base pair flanking region on 9,795 UK10K and INTERVAL samples, including SCOOP cases (N = 982) and INTERVAL controls (N = 4,499). The called variants were then merged into 200 sample batches and were joint-called using GenotypeVCFs and default settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van der Auwera et al., 2013</xref>). To ensure high-quality variant calls across all datasets and sequencing batches, only variants with at least 7x coverage in at least 80% of samples were called. We applied further variant QC keeping only variants with a calibrated VQSR tranche above 99.75% sensitivity, missingness &lt; 20%, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium χ2 p value &gt; 10E-8, mean genotype quality ≥ 30, and variants in low-complexity regions as described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li, 2014</xref>). Further, individual genotypes were set to missing if any of the following were true: GQ &lt; 30, alternate allele read depth (DP1)&lt;2, allelic balance (AB, proportion of reads supporting one of the alleles of the genotype) &lt; 0.2, or AB &gt; 0.8.</p>

<title>Targeted Sequencing and Variant QC</title>
<p id="p0405">Targeted sequencing was performed at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WTSI). DNA samples (300ng), genomic (Fenland) or whole-genome amplified (SCOOP), were pooled in up to 384 uniquely indexed paired-end libraries using the Illumina TruSeq Custom Amplicon Library Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, ensuring a mix of SCOOP and Fenland samples in each 384-well pool. Amplicons (in the range 220bp-280bp) were designed using Illumina’s tool DesignStudio, to cover exons, UTRs and intron/exon boundaries of the 9 genes of interest, based on UCSC hg19. In total, 146 target regions were covered. Sequencing was performed using 384-plexing and paired-end 300 cycles on Illumina MiSeq v2 to give bi-directional coverage of all amplicons.</p>
<p id="p0410">Data were aligned to the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 2 GRCh37 human reference genome sequence (hs37d5). The CRAM files produced from these alignments were converted to BAM format, <italic>removing</italic> duplicate flagging (SamTools v1.3 and BioBamBam2 v2.0.65). Variant calling was performed using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v3.6 HaplotypeCaller to call germline SNPs and indels via local re-assembly of haplotypes, and GenotypeGVCFs to perform joint genotyping on all samples together. Variants were annotated with the NCBI dbSNP database build 149, limiting to target regions ± 100bp.</p>
<p id="p0415">Genotypes were set to missing if their depth was lower than 15, or if their genotype quality (GQ) was lower than 20 for SNPs and lower than 60 for indels. For heterozygous genotypes, we further considered the allele balance (AB). Heterozygous genotypes with AB outside of [15% - 85%] range were set to missing. Heterozygous genotypes with moderate AB in the ranges of [15% - 35%] or [65%–85%] were required to have a depth greater than 25, otherwise the genotype was set to missing. Indels genotypes with depth greater than 2000 were also set to missing.</p>
<p id="p0420">Variants were removed as part of the quality control process if: i) they mapped more than 100bp away from of any target region; ii) call rate was lower than 90% among cases or among controls; iii) difference in call rates between cases and controls was greater than 2.5%; iv) they failed any GATK hard filtering (QualByDepth &gt; 2 ; FisherStrand &gt; 60 for SNPs or &gt; 200 for indels ; RMSMappingQuality &lt; 40 for SNPs or &lt; 10 for indels; MappingQualityRankSumTest &lt; −12.5; ReadPosRankSumTest &lt; −8 for SNPs or &lt; −20 for indels; StrandOddsRatio &gt; 3.0 for SNPs or &gt; 10.0 for indels); v) window size for filtering adjacent gaps (GapWin) was lower than 3; vi) within 5bp around a gap to be filtered (SnpGap, for SNP). This process led to 858 variants of good quality in the 9 genes of interest.</p>

<title>Sample QC</title>
<p id="p0425">Of the 1,816 SCOOP samples sequenced five had a missing rate greater than 15% and one had a mean depth below 12. Those six samples were excluded, leaving 1,810 SCOOP cases for downstream analyses. Following the same process, 10 FENLAND samples were excluded for having a missing rate greater than 15%, and three a mean depth below 12. This left 2,647 FENLAND controls for stage 2 analysis.</p>

<title>Validation Sanger Sequencing</title>
<p id="p0430">Sanger sequencing was performed to validate singleton and doubleton variants identified in stage 1 and stage 2 analyses from genes with promising results (details below). Briefly, customized PCR primers were designed ± 250 bp surrounding the variant; sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator v3 kit (Applied BioSystems) and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI3730 DNA Analyzer platform (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Familial segregation analysis of variants was performed where family samples were available and where family members consented to genetic studies. In total 42 singleton/ doubleton variants (48 genotypes) identified by LOF and STRICT analysis in stage 1 analysis were validated by Sanger sequencing in the original cases and controls. All variants confirmed and all 9 genes were taken for stage 2 targeted sequencing. As targeted sequencing was done on genome-amplified case DNA, 19 variants from cases from stage 2 analysis in four genes (<italic>DGKI</italic>, <italic>PHIP</italic>, <italic>ZMYM4</italic> and <italic>ZNF32</italic>) with promising stage 1+2 LOF and STRICT results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc5">Table S6</xref>) were taken for sequence validation, of which 13 confirmed. Stage 2 variants seen in controls in the same four genes were also taken for validation: 9 variants were confirmed and 1 doubleton variant was not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc5">Table S6</xref>B). Final meta-analysis results of stage 1+ stage 2 validated variants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Adult Obesity Cases and 1958BC Data</title>

<sec id="sec5.5.5.1">
<title>Joint Calling, Sequencing and Variant QC</title>
<p id="p0440">BAM files from the 1958 Birth Cohort and the Adult obesity cases were converted into gVCF format files using HaplotypeCaller version 3.2-2-gec30cee of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) from the Broad Institute. The regions processed using HaplotyeCaller were restricted to the intersection of the Aigilent V3 and Illumina TruSeq baits, plus 100bp padding at both 3′ and 5′ ends of the baits. The resulting gVCF files were combined in batches of 200 into multi-sample gVCF files using the GATK tool CombineGVCFs. These multi-sample gVCFs were in turn further combined and variants called using the GATK tool GenotypeGVCFs so as to produce a single VCF file containing the genotypes of all the samples included in the study. Quality scores for SNPs described in the VCF file were improved by running GATK VariantRecalibrator, and subsequently applying these scores to the VCF file using GATK ApplyRecalibration.</p>
<p id="p0445">Variants were removed as part of the quality control process if: i) call rate was lower than 90% among Generation Scotland cases or among TwinsUK cases or among controls; ii) difference in call rates in at least one of the three comparisons was greater than 2.5% (Generation Scotland cases versus TwinsUK cases or Generation Scotland cases versus controls or TwinsUK cases versus controls); iii) they failed any GATK hard filtering available (QualByDepth &gt; 2 ; FisherStrand &gt; 60 for SNPs or &gt; 200 for indels ; RMSMappingQuality &lt; 40 for SNPs or &lt; 10 for indels; MappingQualityRankSumTest &lt; −12.5; ReadPosRankSumTest &lt; −8 for SNPs or &lt; −20 for indels); iv) window size for filtering adjacent gaps (GapWin) was lower than 3; v) within 5bp around a gap to be filtered (SnpGap, for SNP). This process led to 1,128,931 exome-wide variants of good quality.</p>

<title>Sample QC</title>
<p id="p0450">Sample quality control was done across good quality variants. We identified one control sample with a missing rate greater than 5%; 13 control samples showing outlier relatedness values with most of the cases and controls, pointing to potential contamination; and two control samples being non-European, based on the principal component analysis. No cases were further excluded. This left 431 adult obesity cases and 984 control samples for analysis.</p>

<title>Variant Annotation</title>
<p id="p0455">Variant frequency was annotated with respect to the UK10K-cohort reference panel and each of the four global populations in the 1000 Genomes Phase 1 reference panel: African population (YRI, LWK, ASW), American population (MXL, CLM, PUR), Asian population (CHB, CHS, JPT) and European population (CEU, TSI, FIN, GBR, IBS). Variants were annotated for functional consequences and damaging scores using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) version 79 with the dbNSFP plug-in (dbNSFPv2.9, Feb 3, 2015) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McLaren et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Allelic changes were defined as loss-of-function (LOF analysis, see below) if the VEP consequence in protein-coding transcripts was among splice_donor_variant, splice_acceptor_variant, stop_gained, frameshift_variant. For allelic changes annotated as missense (VEP consequence in protein-coding transcripts), we further considered five tools available in dbNSFP to classify the change as damaging: SIFT prediction “damaging,” PolyPhen2 HDIV predictions “probably damaging” and “possibly damaging,” PolyPhen2 HVAR predictions “probably damaging” and “possibly damaging,” LRT prediction “deleterious,” and MutationTaster prediction “disease causing automatic” or “disease causing.” Allelic changes were defined as strictly damaging (STRICT analysis, see below) if the VEP consequence in protein-coding transcripts was LOF as defined above or stop_lost or initiator_codon_variant or missense classified as damaging by all 5 prediction tools: this category aims to identify allelic changes that are likely to be damaging. Allelic changes were defined as broadly damaging (BROAD analysis, see below) if it was strictly damaging or missense classified as damaging by at least one of the 5 prediction tools: this category aims to discard allelic changes that are likely to be benign.</p>

<title>Stage 1 and Stage 2 Analyses</title>
<p id="p0460">Case-control association analysis was performed using SNPtest v2.5 with the -newml option, which implements a likelihood ratio test. Analyses were done unadjusted for age and sex because of insufficient power for stratified analysis and, since all obese participants were prepubertal with age &lt; 10yr at recruitment, the study was not designed to address the effect of age or sex. In stage 1, single-variant analysis was performed on all variants regardless of minor allele count (MAC) or imputation quality. Forty-seven variants with p value &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup> and with case MAF &gt; control MAF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref>), as well as an additional 14 variants driving gene-based analyses (based on 10 genes from BROAD analysis) were prioritized for stage 2 follow-up (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Table S2</xref>C). After LD pruning using PLINK (parameters:–clump-p1 0.0001–clump-p2 0.2–clump-r2 0.5–clump-kb 500), 53 variants remained. Of these, five variants failed assay design resulting in 48 variants that were assayed on the stage 2 samples. Four SNPs were removed due to having a call rate below 80% in either SCOOP cases or Fenland controls resulting in 44 SNPs for analysis in stage 2.</p>

<sec id="sec5.5.8.1">
<title>Stage 1, Stage 2 and Adult Obesity versus Controls</title>
<p id="p0470">Gene-based association analyses were performed using a nested approach considering three gene-burden tests filtering for variants with different MAF and with different <italic>in silico</italic> variant function predictions. Analyses were done unadjusted for age and sex because of insufficient power for stratified analysis and, since all obese participants were prepubertal with age &lt; 10yr at recruitment, the study was not designed to address the effect of age or sex. Manhattan and QQ plots for the three gene-burden tests are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>. The same approach was used in stage 1 (SCOOP versus INTERVAL, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Table S2</xref>), stage 2 (SCOOP versus FENLAND, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc5">Table S6</xref>), and adult obesity (Generation Scotland &amp; TwinsUK versus 1958BC, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0475">Rare alleles were defined as alleles having a frequency lower than 1% in each of the four 1000G populations and in the UK10K-Cohort reference panel, and also in at least one of the analysis groups. Namely, for stage 1 analysis, we required the alleles to be rare (&lt; 1%) across 4,057 INTERVAL control samples, or rare across the 927 SCOOP samples, or rare across the 431 adult obesity cases. For stage 2, we required the allele to be rare (&lt; 1%) across 2,647 FENLAND controls, or rare across 1,810 SCOOP samples. For adult obesity versus 1958BC, we required the allele to be rare (&lt; 1%) across 984 1958BC controls, or rare across 431 adult obesity samples.</p>
<p id="p0480">Similar to rare allele definition, very rare alleles were defined as alleles having a frequency lower than 0.025% in each of the four 1000G populations and in the UK10K-Cohort reference panel, and also in at least one of the analysis group. The MAF &lt; 0.025% was chosen to focus on variants likely to be private to any given family or clan, and avoid definitions based on “not seen in public databases” which change over time.</p>
<p id="p0485">We performed three nested gene-burden tests. 1- The LOF analysis considered variants with very rare alleles (MAF &lt; 0.025%) for which the change was categorized as being LOF as described above: 6,160 genes with at least 2 variants were analyzed. 2- The STRICT analysis considered variants with very rare alleles (MAF &lt; 0.025%) for which the variants were classified as having a deleterious effect by five <italic>in silico</italic> prediction programmes as described above: 13,496 genes with at least 2 variants were analyzed. 3- The BROAD analysis considered variants with rare alleles (MAF &lt; 1%) for which the change was categorized as broadly damaging as described above: 17,885 genes with at least 2 variants were analyzed.</p>
<p id="p0490">Gene-based analyses were performed using the <italic>SKATBinary</italic> function from the R package SKAT (version 1.1. 4, April 1, 2016) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). The p values were computed without adjustment (method.bin = ”UA”). LOF and STRICT analyses were performed using the burden test implemented in <italic>SKATBinary</italic> (method = ”Burden”), while the BROAD analysis (rare and broadly damaging allelic changes) was performed using SKAT-O (method = ”SKATO”). All other <italic>SKATBinary</italic> options were set to their default value. Stage 1 yielded seven genes based on LOF and STRICT analysis with OR &gt; 1 and p value &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Table S2</xref>), which were selected for stage 2 targeted sequencing. In addition, BROAD analysis yielded 10 genes with OR &gt; 1 and p value &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Table S2</xref>), of 10 genes, 8 genes were driven by 12 variants based on leave-one-out analysis (see below) and 2 genes were influenced by 2 variants, but signal remained after leave-one-out analysis so were also taken for stage 2 targeted sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Table S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec5.5.8.2">
<title>Leave-one-out Analyses</title>
<p id="p0495">To identify gene-based results driven by one or more variants, we applied the following leave-one-out strategy: 1- among the variants seen more than twice in our stage 1 sample (cases and controls together), we identified the variant with the lowest single-variant analysis p value whenever it is nominally significant (p &lt; 0.05); 2- we removed this variant and performed the stage 1 gene-based test again. We repeated steps 1 and 2 until the stage 1 gene-based p value was above 0.1 or there were no additional variants seen more than twice and with a single-variant analysis p value &lt; 0.05. For genes that were driven by one or two single variants (8 genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Table S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>), we genotyped single variants.

<title>Stage1+2 Meta-Analyses</title>
<p id="p0500">Gene-based meta-analysis was performed for 9 genes selected from stage 1 analysis and taken forward for targeted sequencing in stage 2.

<title>Association Analysis Using External Controls</title>
<p id="p0505">We used ProxECAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendricks et al., 2018</xref>), to perform case-control analysis of the burden of LOF and STRICT very rare variants in the gene region for 927 SCOOP cases versus 21,384 external common controls of non-Finnish European descent from gnomAD. ProxECAT tests for a difference in the ratio of very rare functional variants (LOF or STRICT) to very rare synonymous variants between cases and controls. Comparing the ratio of functional to synonymous variants enables the inclusion of external controls, but can reduce power to detect an association. As this analysis uses the same set of cases from the stage 1 analysis, it is not a true replication, but can provide more evidence for or against an association given the different control sample. This can be especially helpful for genes where there were no rare minor alleles identified in the controls from the stage 1 analysis (i.e., STRICT: <italic>ZNF32</italic>, <italic>HEPACAM</italic>; LOF: <italic>ZMYM4, PHIP, VIL1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S3</xref>).</p>

<p id="p0540">We performed gene set enrichment analysis similar to previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Purcell et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Gene set analysis was performed on five primary groupings, each of which had subsets, resulting in 10 primary gene sets for analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc7">Table S9</xref>B). We repeated primary analysis in patients with obesity and developmental delay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc7">Table S9</xref>C) and with obesity alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc7">Table S9</xref>D).

For each gene, we evaluated the three analysis groupings used in the gene-based tests: BROAD (MAF &lt; 1% and broadly damaging), STRICT (MAF &lt; 0.025% and strictly damaging), and LOF (MAF &lt; 0.025% and LoF). We then used the SMP utility to calculate the gene set enrichment while controlling for exome-wide differences between cases and controls. Twenty thousand case control permutations were used to estimate the empirical gene set enrichment p value. We report both the nominal p value and the adjusted p value, which adjusts for all ten primary gene sets investigated within each analysis grouping (i.e., BROAD, STRICT, and LOF). A Chi-square test of Independence was used to compare the overlap of genes in the GWAS gene set that were also LOF constrained.</p>

<title>Mouse Statistical Analysis</title>
<p id="p0555">For all analyses, the individual mouse was considered the experimental unit within the studies. All mutant data (7 females and 7 males) from the pipeline was collected across multiple batches and were compared to a year’s worth of overlapping control data collected on mice from the same genetic background (up to 226 females and 231 males) for DEXA, ipGTT and CC (total 43 parameters). As a high-throughput project, the target sample size of 14 mutant animals per strain is relatively low. This was determined after a community-wide debate to find the lowest sample size that would balance resource usage while detecting phenotypic abnormalities. For analysis of continuous data, the current work uses linear mixed models to allow modeling of multiple sources of variability on a phenotype. The approach was previously discussed by Karp and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karp et al., 2012</xref>) as a way of integrating factors like genotype (G), sex (S) and genotype<sup>∗</sup>sex (G<sup>∗</sup>S) when performing phenotypic analysis of the mice. These factors are assumed to have a fixed values. Given our multi-batch experimental design strategy, linear mixed models also allow us to include batch effects as a random effect, with the assumption that animals from the same batch will have correlated phenotypes. This arises from factors such as technician skill, reagent lot, cage environment, maternal ability and genotype, and litter size. In the study of Karp and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karp et al., 2012</xref>) two equations were put forward: <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd1">Equation 1</xref> (below) includes G, S and G<sup>∗</sup>S and batch effect as described. Equation 2 is similar to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd1">Equation 1</xref> but includes body weight as an additional factor affecting phenotype.<disp-formula id="fd1"><label>(Equation 1)</label>Y∼Genotype + Sex + Genotype<sup>∗</sup>Sex + (1|Batch)</disp-formula></p>
<p id="p0560">We used <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd1">Equation 1</xref> here since body weight is one of the phenotypes that we are interested in measuring and since body weight does not scale linearly (or at all) with many of the parameters that we are testing in our global phenotypic screen. Analysis were performed using PhenStat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurbatova et al., 2015</xref>), an R package version 2.18.0 available from Bioconductor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gentleman et al., 2004</xref>). The package’s mixed model framework was used as default except the argument equationType was set to withoutWeight and dataPointsThreshold was set to 2. The genotype contribution test p value was adjusted for multiple testing to control the false discovery rate to 5%. This statistical method has been studied through simulations and resampling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karp et al., 2014</xref>) and found to be robust and reliable with a multi-batch workflow, where the knockout mice are split into multiple phenotyping batches.
