<abstract id="ABS1">
<p id="P2">A growing number of youth suffer from obesity and in particular severe obesity for which intensive lifestyle intervention does not adequately reduce excess adiposity. A treatment gap exists wherein effective treatment options for an adolescent with severe obesity include intensive lifestyle modification or metabolic and bariatric surgery, while the application of obesity pharmacotherapy remains largely underutilized. These youth often present with numerous obesity-related comorbid diseases, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes/type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, musculoskeletal problems, and psychosocial issues such as depression, anxiety, and social stigmatization. Current pediatric obesity treatment algorithms for pediatric primary care providers focus primarily on intensive lifestyle intervention with escalation of treatment intensity through four stages of intervention. Although a recent surge in the number of Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for obesity treatment has emerged in adults, pharmacotherapy options for youth remain limited. Recognizing treatment and knowledge gaps related to pharmacological agents and the urgent need for more effective treatment strategies in this population, discussed here are the efficacy, safety, and clinical application of obesity pharmacotherapy in youth with obesity based on current literature. Legal ramifications, informed consent regulations, and appropriate off-label use of these medications in pediatrics are included, focusing on prescribing practices and prescriber limits.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Purpose: Rationale for the Formulation of an Opinion Statement on the Use of Medications to Treat Pediatric Obesity</title>
<p id="P3">An independent panel of 12 pediatric obesity medicine and obesity surgery specialists identified an urgent and time-sensitive gap of evidence-based guidance on the clinical use of obesity pharmacotherapy in adolescents. Until such a time when additional scientific evidence is generated justifying the creation of clinical guidelines, this group of experts felt it necessary to develop an initial clinical roadmap for the practical application of obesity pharmacotherapy in pediatric tertiary care centers in the form of an opinion statement. The paper, in essence, reflects the views of the authors. The overall goals were to build a framework to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) review published data about pediatric obesity pharmacotherapy (what is known and what is not known); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) have an intelligent, well-informed discussion regarding the fact that, that though these medications are approved in adults, there are limited safety, efficacy and follow up data in youth with obesity but that the consequences as well as risks of obesity may outweigh the potentially unknown risks of medications in these youth; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) recommend that these obesity medications currently be used only by well-trained experts in a team interdisciplinary environment with conscientious monitoring; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) advocate for more research resources for pharmacological intervention trials in youth with obesity to provide data for the use of these medications.</p>
<p id="P4">State-specific rules and regulations beyond routine standard of care on weight management practices in adults and children were determined by contacting individual State Medical Boards through either phone calls and/or email exchanges with the respective State’s Department of Health prosecuting attorney or representative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">Currently, almost one out of five youth (18.5%) are afflicted with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) and 9.5% of adolescents have severe obesity (BMI≥120% of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile or ≥35kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Treatment of childhood obesity is complicated by its intricate and multifactorial etiology with a myriad of contributing factors including but not limited to genetics, developmental effects, fetal programming and epigenetics, environment, behavioral and psychosocial issues, physical activity, medications, eating patterns, illness, and cultural and family norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Adolescent overweight and obesity are associated with deteriorating cardiometabolic health, increased cardiovascular mortality, future disease burden into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and strongly predict diabetes mortality up to the seventh decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Furthermore, children and adolescents with obesity have lower health-related quality of life compared with children and adolescents with normal weight, a quality of life similar to those with cancer, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and suffer from detrimental psychosocial stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Finally, obesity tracks strongly from childhood to adolescence and later adulthood, and reversion from having severe obesity to having moderate obesity or normal weight during childhood is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Many studies show that only 2–15% of adolescents with severe obesity respond to lifestyle modification therapy and achieve clinically significant and durable weight or BMI reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Therefore, prompt recognition, evaluation, and treatment of obesity are warranted, including swift initiation of intensive lifestyle intervention, with appropriate application of pharmacotherapy and/or surgical modalities as needed. Pharmacotherapy and metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) for youth with obesity fall under the domain of Stage 3 and Stage 4 Tertiary Care intervention respectively. In this staged approach, pharmacological and/or MBS are further integrated with lifestyle modification in a stepwise progression.</p>
<p id="P7">Reflecting an increased understanding of the underpinnings of the complex energy regulatory pathways, there are now six Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for the indication of obesity in adults (orlistat, phentermine, phentermine/topiramate extended-release [ER], lorcaserin, bupropion sustained-release [SR]/naltrexone SR, and liraglutide)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Obesity medications are FDA-approved in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) 18 years and older (with the exception of orlistat (≥12 years) and phentermine (&gt;16 years)) for BMI ≥27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with the presence of at least one obesity-related comorbidity such as hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, or hypertension or a BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> irrespective of comorbidities. This major milestone in the development and recent approval of obesity pharmacotherapy paves a pathway for potential future pediatric obesity clinical trials and the burgeoning field of pediatric obesity medicine that is still in its infancy. Pharmacotherapy for obesity in conjunction with lifestyle therapy has the potential to target physiological hunger, cravings, appetite, and hedonic eating behaviors, and elicit weight loss through the peripheral and central nervous systems, including reward-motivation pathways and executive decision-making function, that control food intake and satiety through efferent and afferent signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, long-term use, durability of effect, and safety profile might prompt concerns especially when applied to the pediatric population for whom treatment with pharmacotherapy is likely chronic. Therefore, determining overall risk/benefit ratios can be an arduous task for the clinician particularly when no current consensus or structured guideline exists for pediatric obesity pharmacotherapy. The rapidly growing number of youth with this serious and intractable chronic disease hastens the need for more aggressive treatment including pharmacotherapy. Moreover, the therapeutic application of obesity pharmacotherapy in pediatrics is not standardized across all practitioners though there is consensus among pediatric obesity medicine specialists who routinely utilize available adult FDA-approved obesity medications and recognize the benefits of treatment in certain phenotypes of severe obesity, which has not yet been studied in clinical trials. <italic>Consequently, we offer practical considerations regarding the responsible use of obesity medications by trained pediatric obesity medicine specialists in pediatric obesity care centers, taking into account existing evidence (unfortunately, currently limited), legal ramifications, and pertinent prescriber and prescribing-related concerns. We also highlight a revised and updated clinical approach to the treatment of pediatric obesity</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Though we outline the difficulty in the treatment of pediatric obesity once the diagnosis has been established, preventive measures to combat obesity cannot be understated.</italic></p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Definitions</title>
<p id="P8">The generally accepted measure for clinical screening of overweight or obesity in children and adolescents is age and sex-adjusted body mass index (BMI) plotted on US Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) growth charts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). For the purposes of classification and terminology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), “obesity” in children and adolescents is defined as a BMI-for-age/sex ≥95th percentile but &lt; 120% of the 95th percentile [Class I obesity], and “severe obesity” is defined as a BMI-for-age/sex ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile [Class II or higher; &gt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). This terminology was derived as per Flegal et al. in 2009 where extreme percentiles extrapolated from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supplied-supplied lambda-mu-sigma parameters did not match well to the empirical data for the 99th percentile(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). A better fit to the empirical data was obtained by using 120% of the smoothed 95th percentile. Furthermore, because we offer obesity pharmacotherapy clinical considerations in the context of adolescents, we define adolescence, according to the World Health Organization definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) and the US Department of Health and Human Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), for which adolescence is the period of development corresponding to the onset of physiologically normal puberty and ending with adult identity and behavior, spanning the ages 10–19 years. We also define intensive lifestyle modification therapy as per widely accepted guidelines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) with the general aim of helping patients adopt healthier eating habits, increase physical activity, and decrease sedentary time while changes are made in stepwise progression and treatment (individual, group, and/or family-based) is intensified if needed.</p>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Measuring Clinical Efficacy of Obesity Pharmacotherapy in Pediatrics: % BMI Reduction</title>
<p id="P9">For children and adolescents, clinically meaningful weight loss based on observational and interventional studies has been defined by some as a BMI z-score (or BMI standard deviation, s.d.) reduction between 0.20–0.25 s.d. over 6–12 months. This degree of BMI change has been associated with improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). However, in children and adolescents with severe obesity, BMI z-score correlates poorly to adiposity with wide variation associated with differences in age, sex and racial influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Accordingly, alternative measures for monitoring weight outcomes have been recommended including percent change in BMI and/or change in BMI percent of the 95<sup>th</sup> percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). A change in BMI z-score of 0.2 is approximately equivalent to a 5% change in BMI. (Similarly, for adults, 3–5% weight loss is considered clinically meaningful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).)</p>

<title>RECOMMENDATIONS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>)</title>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Pediatric Weight Management Multidisciplinary Team</title>
<p id="P10">We recommend that prescription of FDA-approved or off-label use of obesity medications be utilized with support of a trained pediatric multidisciplinary team and monitoring of both treatment adherence and possible adverse events. The multidisciplinary team is also responsible for comprehensive obesity assessment and treatment recommendations for youth with obesity. Exclusions for obesity pharmacotherapy (for example, pregnancy) and cautionary use (for example, as in children with growth deficiency, other endocrinopathies, eating disorders, syndromes affecting bone health) may require astute clinical skills and complex decision-making prompting consultation of a multidisciplinary weight team and other specialists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Team Member Qualifications</title>
<p id="P11">Team member qualifications for a pediatric weight management center are similar to those required for adolescent MBS and are adapted from the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) Pediatric Best Practice Guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p>

Currently, fellowship training and board certification in nutrition and in pediatric obesity are lacking. Training in Pediatric Cardiology, Pediatric Endocrinology, Pediatric Gastroenterology, Adolescent Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, General Academic Pediatrics or General Pediatrics with a focus study area such as in nutrition, lifestyles, motivational interviewing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) and obesity represent the most common routes to expertise in the field of pediatric obesity. Frequent and continuing clinical care of patients with obesity, ongoing continuing medical education in pediatric obesity medicine, scholarly work in obesity research or education, and certification by entities such as the American Board of Obesity Medicine or the American Board of Nutrition can enhance advanced understanding of obesity. In general, these activities currently serve to designate experts in the field of pediatric obesity care. Primary care and subspecialty pediatricians without this expertise should refer to their colleagues with these skills and experience.

<title>BMI Criteria</title>
<p id="P18">Pharmacotherapy is often considered to be a lower risk and less invasive form of therapy than surgical intervention in which a child may be exposed to risks of anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) and potentially other complications(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Established criteria for adult obesity pharmacotherapy utilize a lower BMI threshold (BMI &gt;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with at least one obesity-related co-morbidity [such as the presence of diabetes, sleep apnea, hypertension or hyperlipidemia] or BMI &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with or without comorbidity) than MBS. For MBS, the adult criteria (BMI 35–39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the presence of serious comorbidities or when BMI is ≥40 with or without comorbidity) are already recommended for adolescent indications (&gt;120 of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile or BMI ≥35 with comorbidity or &gt;140% of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile or BMI ≥40 with or without comorbidity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">We propose similarly that for pharmacotherapy, the adult criteria should be modified for pediatric indications; i.e. when BMI is in the obese range (≥ 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and sex or BMI &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> whichever is lower; Class I obesity) in the presence of at least one obesity-related co-morbidity or in the severe obesity range (≥120% of 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and sex or BMI &gt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> whichever is lower; Class II and Class III obesity) irrespective of the presence of co-morbidities. Of note, although adult clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) studying obesity pharmacotherapy have recruited patients in the BMI range of 27–45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the efficacy of these drugs may decrease with the clinical severity of BMI given the complex progression of the disease state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Because no upper BMI threshold is mentioned for the practical application of obesity pharmacotherapy, one should consider the initial BMI and long-term goals to assess need for early involvement of a bariatric surgeon if MBS is likely needed, especially in adolescents where BMI ≥120% of 95<sup>th</sup> percentile with the presence of an obesity-related comorbidity or ≥140% of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile with less severe comorbid conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S11">
<title>Age Considerations</title>
<p id="P20">With regard to age, there are currently no data defining a lower limit for the application of pharmacotherapy or MBS in the pediatric population. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) suggests that medication could be considered for children with <italic>severe</italic> obesity as young as six years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) and the 2018 adolescent MBS guidelines adopted the lower limit of 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), consistent with the World Health Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) and the US Department of Health and Human Services definition of adolescence (age 10–19 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Furthermore, FDA-approved obesity pharmacotherapy is applicable to adults 18 years and older, which interestingly includes older ‘adolescents’ as per World Health Organization definition. Specifically, two obesity medications (orlistat and phentermine) are already FDA-approved in younger adolescents. Notably, there are discrepancies in the definition of “adolescence” and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) strongly discourages the establishment of arbitrary age limits in pediatric care by health care providers due to the multifaceted approach encompassing a child’s overall physiological, physical, developmental, psychosocial, and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Care delivery must take into account the needs of the child and directs the provider to meet those needs. Of note, particularly in cases involving younger patients, clinical decision-making and consultation of a multidisciplinary team on risks:benefits ratio is paramount.</p>

<p id="P21">Intensive lifestyle therapy (without pharmacotherapy) can result in clinically meaningful weight loss in the short term in younger children (&lt;10–12 years) but older youth tend to respond less favorably to lifestyle intervention and have higher onset of disease progression with the development of co-morbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Combining intensive lifestyle intervention with pharmacotherapy may have enhanced synergistic or additive weight loss effects in patients with obesity as demonstrated in obesity pharmacotherapy trials(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). We recommend that documentation of previous (structured) attempts at lifestyle therapy upon initial encounter is sufficient as proof of non-response to lifestyle alone prior to consideration of obesity pharmacotherapy. It is understood that healthy behaviors and lifestyle modification be continued in conjunction with pharmacotherapy or MBS.</p>

<title>Growth and Development Considerations</title>
<p id="P22">Obesity affects adolescent growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). In girls, higher BMI is associated with earlier menarche age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). If the medication being prescribed is known to interfere with normal pubertal progressions, Tanner stage (sexual maturity rating) is a particularly relevant factor to consider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), though no lower limit of adolescent age is suggested unless evidence points to developmental risks of specific agents being prescribed. Certainly there is a paucity of data with regard to obesity medications on pubertal development as well as long-term effects on developing adolescent brain; further research and long-term studies are needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S14">
<title>Clinical Decision-making</title>
<p id="P23">Clinical decision-making is required when benefits far outweigh risks of obesity pharmacotherapy such as in an adolescent with several obesity-related medical comorbidities and severe obesity. Clinical presentation of the patient is vital in pharmacotherapeutic selection with dose titration for maximum benefit with minimal adverse effects. The patient is assessed for potential safety concerns and followed closely during the medical management visits. Obesity pharmacotherapy should not be initiated in the setting of severe psychiatric disturbance, eating disorders such as bulimia, untreated endocrinopathies, or with concomitant use of medications that have adverse interactions. Furthermore, discontinuation or substitution of medications associated with weight gain with weight-neutral alternatives before initiation of obesity pharmacotherapy is a critical consideration. Because obesity is a chronic disease, long-term treatment and follow-up care will be necessary (potentially life-long). One can expect rebound in weight and disease pathology if treatment is discontinued. Patients and family members should be counseled on the long-term use of obesity pharmacotherapy and disease chronicity along with lifelong lifestyle modification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S15">
<title>Decision to Continue or Discontinue Obesity Pharmacotherapy</title>
<p id="P24">We also recommend that the medication be continued if there is ≥5% BMI reduction from baseline at 12 weeks on the optimal dose or if arrest or slowing of weight gain is considered to be a reasonable clinical outcome, especially as linear growth occurs in adolescence. The medication should be discontinued if not tolerated by the patient or dangerous side effects occur or persist despite dose adjustment. This algorithm is consistent with adult and pediatric guidelines that recommend discontinuation of an obesity medication, at maximum appropriate dose, if less than 5% weight loss/BMI reduction from baseline is achieved within 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). When a medication or a combination is started, it can be continued longer-term based on therapeutic benefit, improvement of psycho-social comorbidities, tolerability, absence of or acceptable side effects, cardiovascular stability, and minimal effects on growth development and neurocognitive function with monitoring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S16">
<title>Assessment and Safety</title>
<p id="P25">The initial medical encounter includes a thorough clinical history and physical examination with documentation of Tanner stage, hemodynamics, and anthropometric measurements. Eating behaviors and dietary intake, family patterns, cultural cues, sleep hygiene &amp; disorders screening, school history and psychological or neuropsychiatric metrics are assessed. In addition to usual laboratory evaluation recommended in the context of obesity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), other laboratory assessments may be needed to monitor for side effects related to a given pharmacotherapy. Close follow-ups are recommended after the initial encounter. Pubertal stage, height, and weight, should be serially measured at all follow up visits to monitor for disruptions in pubertal development and linear growth. Because most obesity medications act through central nervous system pathways that may disrupt or affect neuropsychiatric axis, cognition and mood should be evaluated in the form of a clinical interview about school grades, concentration, memory and worsening depression/anxiety at serial follow up visits. Standardized clinical tools to track these potential side effects also need to be developed in the future. Given greater suicidality and depression risk among youth with obesity than of normal-weight youth, specific medications that may precipitate suicide or depression occurrence (e.g. such as bupropion or topiramate) also warrant uniform screening for these conditions upon the initial assessment and during subsequent follow up visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S17">
<title>Understanding Off-label drug use in Pediatrics</title>
<p id="P26">Off-label drug use involves the prescription of medications for indications, or using a dosage or dosage form, which have not been approved by the FDA. Off-label drug use is especially common in pediatrics, where conducting clinical trials in this population might be challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). More recently, in 2014, the AAP released a statement regarding off-label use of pharmaceuticals in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>): “Therapeutic decision-making must always rely on the best available evidence and the importance of the benefit for the individual patient.” Since obesity medications are FDA-approved for ages ≥18 years (with the exception of orlistat age≥12 years and phentermine age &gt;16 years), prescription of obesity medications in youth meeting patient selection criteria falls under the domain of off-label drug use. Because of limited efficacy and safety data in children coupled with potential unknown side effects, we caution off-label drug use in children. Though it is difficult to provide a generalized statement supporting or not supporting off-label drug use in pediatric obesity, we provide recommendations, based on our own combined clinical experience, in regards to off-label use for specific medications as described in the pharmacotherapy section of this paper. Oftentimes, off-label drug use in pediatric obesity depends on the clinical presentation, age, medical comorbidities, family history, social history, etc. among other factors influencing benefit/risk ratio and clinical decision-making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S18">
<title>Medical Malpractice: Informed Consent and Negligence</title>
<p id="P27">Previous legal claims involving physicians due to adverse reactions related to off-label drug use have primarily involved the use of a research drug (not yet FDA approved), failure to provide informed consent for an off-label drug use, and medical negligence leading to direct harm to the individual patient. To date, court systems have not mandated a formal informed consent process for off-label drug use due to concerns about impingement of direct patient care and impediments to communications along with unnecessary concerns or alarms elicited to the individual patient and/or family members involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). We therefore recommend standard informed consent (and assent) documentation within the electronic medical record describing that 1) the conversation about off-label drug use occurred, 2) patient/family member(s) understand risks/benefits, 3) description of potential major and minor drug side effects reviewed, 4) confirmation of the absence of contraindications to the drug, 5) appropriate follow-up care was advised, 6) the patient/family member(s) understand how to reach the medical provider should questions or concerns arise, and 7) advise urgent medical attention for emergencies including suicidal ideation and worsening depression. The clinical care team must also recognize the youth’s cognitive, emotional, and social development and take this into consideration when obtaining assent in the shared-decision making process. Supplemental Online <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> outlines the various medical-legal concerns with respect to individual State Medical Board rules and regulations surrounding weight management. Most States follow standard of care, with specific statutes and bylaws in some States. Obesity practitioners must understand and follow their respective State’s rules and regulations.</p>

<title>Available Pharmacotherapy (FDA-approved and Off-Label Drug Use for Obesity in Pediatrics)</title>
<p id="P28">Evidence for obesity medications in children is limited in scope due to the relatively small number of clinical trials conducted and small number of participants included in many of the trials; recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews have reported overall minimal or no benefit of obesity pharmacotherapy in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). However, an obesity specialist is well-trained in the clinical application of obesity pharmacotherapy for successful therapeutic benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Furthermore, patient criteria, obesity phenotype, contraindications and side effect profile must be considered when selecting specific agents for a pediatric patient. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> provides a summary of the efficacy, safety and clinical insights into the application of FDA-approved adult obesity medications and off-label drug use of specific highly utilized medications in the pediatric obesity population.</p>

<sec id="S22">
<title>Efficacy:</title>
<p id="P30">In a recent pediatric meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) involving 779 adolescents ages 12–18 years with baseline average BMI 37.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, there were small BMI differences between orlistat and placebo groups: −0.94 (95% CI, −1.58 to −0.30) to −0.50 (95% CI, −7.62 to 6.62), with absolute weight changes ranging from +1 to −12 lbs. with orlistat. The largest randomized-controlled trial evaluating orlistat combined with a hypocaloric (30% fat calories) diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy in adolescents (n=352; also included in the above meta-analyses) showed a −2.61 kg placebo-subtracted weight loss at one year after treatment (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S23">
<title>Safety:</title>
<p id="P31">Gastrointestinal adverse effects were quite common with orlistat use: abdominal pain or cramps (16–65% of participants vs. 11–26% placebo), flatus with discharge (20–43% vs. 3–11% placebo), fecal incontinence (9% vs. 0–1% placebo); changes in glucose, insulin, and lipid profile were not statistically significant in adolescents with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>).

</sec>
<sec id="S24">
<title>Additional Insight:</title>
<p id="P32">Orlistat is also available over-the-counter in a lower dosage formulation. A multivitamin is recommended with orlistat use due to increased risks of fat-soluble vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Due to little cardiometabolic benefit, expense and adverse tolerability in adolescents attending school where bathroom privileges may be limited, orlistat is not considered a first-line drug for the treatment of pediatric obesity as monotherapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S25">
<title>Effects on pubertal development or puberty:</title>
<p id="P33">Based on data from several human studies, treatment with orlistat for one year does not appear to affect pubertal development or the expected increase in lean body mass during puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>).

Participants did not have symptoms and need assistance from another person; the hypoglycemia was found only during routine glucose monitoring(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref>). Liraglutide had a similar safety and tolerability profile compared with adults when administered to adolescents with obesity, with no unexpected safety/tolerability issues. Results suggest that the dosing regimen approved for weight management in adults may be appropriate for use in adolescents(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>). Further studies evaluating the efficacy of liraglutide in the adolescent population are currently on-going.</p>

<title>Additional Insight:</title>
<p id="P58">GLP-1 agonist therapy has potential for weight loss and weight stabilization in patients with syndromic and hypothalamic obesity with hyperphagia. In patients with hypothalamic obesity as a result of tumor or trauma injury, exenatide therapy may help stabilize weight and increase satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref>). GLP-1 agonist therapy is frequently considered next in line for patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity in conjunction with metformin and intensive lifestyle modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Because insurance coverage for GLP-1 agonists may be limited in adolescents, especially for newer GLP-1 agonists, older generic analogs such as exenatide are more likely to be covered in some states for adolescents with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>

<title>Safety:</title>
<p id="P63">Careful follow up of children who received lisdexamfetamine for over 12 months had a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">105</xref>). Sudden death has been reported in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking amphetamines at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2–4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3–6 bpm). CNS stimulants can also provoke pre-existing psychiatric disorders and psychosis, delusions or hallucinations in children and adolescents with no prior mental illness. Post-marketing reports have also associated lisdexamfetamine with Raynaud’s phenomenon in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">105</xref>).</p>

<title>Additional Insight:</title>
<p id="P64">Because lisdexamfetamine is FDA-approved lower than age 10 years, <italic>it may be a beneficial option</italic> in younger children ≥6 years of age with ADHD and binge-eating disorder. Though it is approved for binge-eating disorder in adults, it is not approved for the same indication in children in the absence of an ADHD diagnosis. Long-term safety of amphetamines has been studied in the pediatric population with concerns for developmental growth retardation and careful monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment of children and adolescents who have impulsive behaviors such as impulsive excessive food intake as a manifestation of their ADHD may find benefit from lisdexamfetamine or other ADHD medications in achieving healthier eating behaviors. Given the history of abuse potential of amphetamines in the past coupled with potential adverse psychiatric side effects, caution is advised if used for the long-term treatment of obesity. In youth with obesity or binge eating disorder, regardless of an ADHD diagnosis, there is limited data, if at all, reporting potential benefits with lisdexamfetamine use.</p>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p id="P81">Childhood and adolescent obesity is already a global epidemic and poses significant health risks. As adolescent obesity often leads to obesity in adulthood and is already accompanied by a multitude of weight-related comorbidities including an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers, treating obesity in children/adolescents should not be delayed. As an adjunct to intensive lifestyle therapy and MBS, the potential role of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of pediatric obesity should not be ignored and may represent a useful additional option for some patients who suffer from obesity. Additionally, in clinically severe obesity, pharmacotherapy may play a larger role as adjunct to MBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>). This therapeutic need highlights the value of experienced pediatric obesity medicine specialists at tertiary care centers and yet presents challenges as clinical trials evaluating long-term safety and efficacy of obesity medications remain scant in the pediatric population. Emphasis needs to be placed on the concurrent development of appropriate, high-quality, well-designed pediatric obesity clinical trials to validate the use of medications for obesity in adolescents. Moreover, there exists a great need to develop specialized pediatric obesity medicine training programs, applicable protocols, screening tools, and guidelines to further advance the burgeoning field of pediatric obesity medicine.</p>

<title>Proposed Clinical Approach to Obesity Treatment for Adolescents with Obesity.</title>
<p id="P86">Progress through algorithm as clinically required for a patient with risk factors/ready to make change. Start with family-based therapy (can encompass basic education to more intensive therapy based on resources, time constraints, and psychosocial support) followed by microenvironment-targeted therapy with the help of ancillary services such as a dietitian, exercise specialist, nutritionist, and therapist if initial therapy is unsuccessful. Modifiable micro-environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), such as nutrient signaling, muscle activity, sleep, stress, circadian rhythm, and iatrogenic causes (weight promoting medications which are frequently prescribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>)), influence neuro-hormonal pathways affecting food intake and satiety. Prior to more aggressive intervention, these factors should be assessed and altered if perturbing the physiology leading to excess body fat accumulation. This may include physician and ancillary team evaluation providing more intense structure to weight management and medical evaluation with assessment of health targets and cardiovascular risk factors (usually prompting a corresponding AAP Stage 2–3 referral for intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>)). If microenvironment-targeted therapy fails, the option to add on adjunctive obesity pharmacotherapy falls under the domain of corresponding AAP Stage 3–4 intervention, either preceded or followed by MBS (corresponding to AAP Stage 4 intervention). Because obesity is a life-long disease, patients often may experience weight regain post-bariatric surgery and continue to need aftercare more closely especially in the adolescent population. As a result, they should continue to resume aftercare and may require lifestyle and/or combination pharmacological intervention later on in life.</p>
