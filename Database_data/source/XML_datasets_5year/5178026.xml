<abstract>
<p>Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is absent or highly reduced in Fragile X Syndrome, a genetic disorder causing cognitive impairment and autistic behaviors. Previous proof-of-principle studies have demonstrated that restoring FMRP in the brain using viral vectors can improve pathological abnormalities in mouse models of fragile X. However, unlike small molecule drugs where the dose can readily be adjusted during treatment, viral vector–based biological therapeutic drugs present challenges in terms of achieving optimal dosing and expression levels. The objective of this study was to investigate the consequences of expressing varying levels of FMRP selectively in neurons of <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout and wild-type (WT) mice. A wide range of neuronal FMRP transgene levels was achieved in individual mice after intra-cerebroventricular administration of adeno-associated viral vectors coding for FMRP. In all treated knockout mice, prominent FMRP transgene expression was observed in forebrain structures, whereas lower levels were present in more caudal regions of the brain. Reduced levels of the synaptic protein PSD-95, elevated levels of the transcriptional modulator MeCP2, and abnormal motor activity, anxiety, and acoustic startle responses in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice were fully or partially rescued after expression of FMRP at about 35–115% of WT expression, depending on the brain region examined. In the WT mouse, moderate FMRP over-expression of up to about twofold had little or no effect on PSD-95 and MeCP2 levels or on behavioral endophenotypes. In contrast, excessive over-expression in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mouse forebrain (approximately 2.5–6-fold over WT) induced pathological motor hyperactivity and suppressed the startle response relative to WT mice. These results delineate a range of FMRP expression levels in the central nervous system that confer phenotypic improvement in fragile X mice. Collectively, these findings are pertinent to the development of long-term curative gene therapy strategies for treating Fragile X Syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>F<sc>ragile</sc> X <sc>Syndrome</sc> (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by an expanded CGG repeat in the 5′ untranslated region of the X-linked <italic>FMR1</italic> gene, resulting in elimination or drastic reduction of the encoded fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP functions as an mRNA-binding protein to regulate the expression of hundreds of mRNAs in the brain and other organs. Most but not all of the symptoms of the disorder stem from deficient FMRP in the central nervous system (CNS). Neurological symptoms include cognitive impairment, hyperactivity, stereotyped behaviors, reduced and/or abnormal social interactions, and epileptic seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> Approximately 30% of patients with FSX meet the clinical criteria for autism, and as with autism, FXS is a lifelong disorder where the behavioral symptoms appear around 2 years of age and remain throughout life.</p>
<p>There are currently no drugs available to treat FXS directly. Instead, antipsychotics, antidepressants, stimulants, and anti-epileptic drugs are used to suppress symptoms in children and adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> Newer second-generation drugs acting at metabotropic glutamate and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors rely on single molecular targets, and were expected to be more effective in alleviating selected symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> However, to date, none of the small molecule drugs tested have shown convincing efficacy in Phase II clinical trials for FXS or autism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Given that FMRP regulates the stability and translation of hundreds of mRNAs in the CNS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> these narrowly defined molecular treatment strategies have not addressed the core underlying issue: the absence or reduction of FMRP in the brain.</p>
<p>In principle, FXS should be amenable to correction following treatment with viral vectors coding for FMRP. Key experimental parameters requiring consideration in viral vector–mediated gene therapy strategies for CNS disorders include the age at time of treatment and the route of administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> In the case of FXS, FMRP is distributed in neurons throughout the brain at all ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> Therefore, a gene therapy approach for treating FXS would likely necessitate widespread distribution of the transgene throughout the brain at appropriate levels and over a protracted time frame. The adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors now in use are well-suited for meeting these requirements,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12–14</xref></sup> and in fact, several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of AAV-based therapies in several mouse models of neurodevelopment disorders, including Angelman Syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> Rett Syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16–18</xref></sup> and tuberous sclerosis (TSC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup> In the context of FXS, early work by Zeier <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref></sup> showed that abnormal (enhanced) hippocampal long-term depression could be rectified after direct injection of an AAV serotype 5 vector coding for FMRP into 5-week-old <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mouse hippocampus. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated the utility of early postnatal intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of an AAV serotype 9 vector coding for FMRP in correcting selected abnormal behaviors, including elevated repetitive and reduced social dominance behaviors in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of several critical parameters that must be considered in treating genetic disorders is the level of expression of the recombinant transgene. Too little expression may be insufficient to restore the normal function of the protein, while over-expression could induce pathology. Biologically based therapeutic agents in general, and viral vectors in particular, differ from small molecule drugs in terms of biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and dose adjustability during treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref></sup> Unlike small molecule drugs where dosing is done on a repeated basis and opportunities exist for adjusting the dose up or down, viral vector–based drugs confer long-term transgene expression in the CNS and are typically administered only once or a few times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref></sup> Thus, with viral vector–based CNS therapies, it becomes important to optimize the dose upon initiation of therapy. The goal of the present study was to examine the consequences of inducing varying amounts of FMRP expression in neurons of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse. The results delineate a range of FMRP expression levels in the CNS that confer phenotypic improvement in fragile X mice, and conversely, an upper limit of expression above which is associated with pathological features.</p>

<title>Animals and AAV vectors</title>
<p>C57/BL6J wild-type (WT) mice and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice on the C57/BL/6J strain were used in this study. Single-stranded AAV vectors containing inverted terminal repeat DNA sequences from the genome of AAV2, the capsid proteins from AAV9, the human or rat synapsin-1 (Syn) promoter, the coding region of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> FMRP (isoform 1), a downstream Woodchuck Hepatitis posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), and a poly adenylation site were used. The vector designated here as “Syn-FMRP” containing these domains was previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup> The vector designated here as “Syn-mCMV-FMRP” also contains these domains, and a minimal cytomegalovirus (mCMV) sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref></sup> was inserted at the 3′ end of the synapsin promoter, upstream of the FMRP transgene (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Virus production was carried out at the University of Pennsylvania Vector Core Facility; purified AAVs were used at a concentration range from 0.5–1.0 × 10<sup>13</sup> genomes/mL in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at −80°C. A third single-stranded AAV vector of the same serotype containing the CMV promoter without the transgene (AAV null) was prepared in the same manner and used as a negative control.</p>

<title>Vector injections</title>
<p>A single bilateral i.c.v. injection of AAV vector was administered to WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup> with some modifications. Briefly, mouse pups between postnatal days (PND) 0 and 2 were immobilized by cryo-anesthesia for 2 min and then gently grasped by the skin behind the head and placed over a fiber-optic light to illuminate the transverse and midline sutures that were used as guides for the injections. A 30-gauge needle attached to a 1 mL Hamilton syringe (Hamilton) through long fluoropolymer tubing (internal diameter of 0.5 mm; Western Analytical) was used for injections. The needle was inserted at a depth of 2 mm perpendicular to the skull surface, 0.25 mm lateral to the sagittal suture, and 0.50–0.75 mm rostral to the neonatal coronary suture. A volume range of 0.75–1.0 μL of the AAV vectors was injected using a syringe pump at the rate of 1 μL/min into each lateral ventricle. After the injection, the needle was maintained for 1 min in the inserted position and then slowly retracted to prevent backflow. WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice injected with the AAV null vector served as the control groups.</p>

<title>Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Female mouse brains were used for immunocytochemistry. At 70 ± 3 days post injection, the mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Serial coronal or sagittal sections were cut at a thickness of 25 μm using a cryostat (Leica 9 Microsystems) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup> Free-floating sections were washed with PBS and antigen retrieval was performed as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref></sup> Mouse monoclonal anti-FMRP (5c2; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref></sup> was used with either rabbit anti-NeuN (1:1,000; Abcam) to immunolabel neurons, or rabbit anti-S100β (1:1,000; Abcam) to label astrocytes. After overnight incubation, sections were washed five times with PBS for 10 min and incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594; 1:1,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted in PBS containing 5% goat serum. DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to label nuclei. The images were captured using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 700; Carl Zeiss) at 10, 20, 40, or 63 × magnifications and analyzed using the Zen software (Carl Zeiss). The images for sagittal sections were captured using a Zeiss Mirax slide scanner at 20 × magnification.</p>
<p>For a comparative analysis of the transduction pattern in the brain, a semi-quantitative scoring system was used to analyze the transduction of the FMRP transgene in different brain regions of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice injected with AAV-Syn-FMRP or AAV-Syn-mCMV-FMRP. Scoring was done by classifying the number of transduced cells into four categories: regions with no detectable FMRP expression (–), regions with 0–100 FMRP positive cells/mm<sup>2</sup> (+), regions with 100–200 FMRP-positive cells (++), regions with 200–300 FMRP-positive cells (+++), and regions with &gt;300 FMRP-positive cells (++++). The cingulate cortex was used to calculate the total number of FMRP-positive cells in each KO + FMRP groups, the percentage of FMRP-positive cells that co-localized with the neuronal marker NeuN, and the percentage of FMRP-positive cells were counted.</p>

<p>The samples were homogenized in ice-cold Tris-SDS buffer (50 mM Tris, 1% SDS, pH 7.4) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein (10 μg) was loaded per well and resolved on 10% acrylamide gels. Following SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated overnight with primary antibodies, including mouse anti-FMRP 5C2 at 1:1,000, rabbit monoclonal anti-MeCP2 at 1:1,000 (D4F3), mouse monoclonal anti-PSD-95 at 1:250,000 (75-028; NeuroMab) dilutions, and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (GAPDH-71.1; Sigma-Aldrich) at a 1:40,000 dilution, which was used as a loading control. After washing, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), then SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) was added to the membranes, and the bands were revealed using an Alpha Innotec Fluorochem gel imager (Protein Simple). The AlphaEase SA software was used to analyze the images. Quantification of protein expression was normalized using GAPDH expression; 100% levels were based on the average of the WT null group's protein expression. Results are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism v5 by using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison test.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</title>
<p>Immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using a modification of the method described by Pacey <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref></sup> Briefly, whole mouse forebrains from naive PND 60 WT mice or HEK-293 cells were pooled and homogenized with 3 mL of IP buffer (10 mM of HEPES, 200 mM of NaCl, 30 mM of EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, with the addition of Ribolock RNase inhibitor; Thermo Scientific) and 1 × complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at 3,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. and pellets were washed once with 2 mL of IP buffer. Supernatants were combined, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 400 mM and centrifuged again at 70,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min, and total protein concentrations were adjusted to 4 mg/mL. The solution was pre-cleared using protein A magnabeads<sup>®</sup> (Genscript) for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was then incubated with the anti-FMRP 5c2 antibody for 2 h at 4°C under constant agitation. Protein A beads blocked with 0.1 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mg/mL of yeast tRNA (Thermo Scientific) were added to the solution and incubated overnight. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed four times with ice-cold IP buffer. The beads were re-suspended in TRIzol<sup>®</sup> reagent (Thermo Scientific), and RNA isolation was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was re-suspended in RNAse free H<sub>2</sub>O and reverse transcribed using random nanomers (Sigma-Aldrich) and the superscript II reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7900 HT (Thermo Scientific) using a SyBr green detection system (Sigma-Aldrich), and samples were evaluated for the housekeeping gene GAPDH (forward 5′-CGGTGCTGAGTATGTCGTGGAGTC; reverse 5′-CTTTTGGCTCCACCCTTCAAGTG) and MeCP2 (forward 5′-CGTGACCGGGGACCTATGTA; reverse 5′-AAGCTTTCGTGTCCAACC), as well as PSD-95 (forward 5′-AAGCCCCAGGATATGTGAACGG; reverse 5′-AGCCCAGACCTGAGTTACCCCTT) for the forebrain sample or HEK-293 cell homogenate, using the standard curve method. mRNA enrichment was calculated as the ratio of mRNA in the FMRP-immunoprecipitate divided by the total mRNA isolate and normalized to the GAPDH levels.

<title>Elevated plus maze</title>
<p>At PND 62 ± 2, the elevated plus maze (EPM) was used to monitor open field avoidance, exploration, and general anxiety. Each arm of the apparatus (San Diego Instruments, SR-Lab System) was 5 cm × 30.5 cm, and the closed arms contained a 15 cm high wall. The platform stood 40 cm above the table. The mice were allowed to acclimatize to the room for 15 min and then placed in the central pedestal and monitored for 5 min while the experimenter sat 2 m away, directly in line with the closed arms. Mouse activity was visually recorded from a bird's eye view using a camera mounted on the ceiling. An entry was defined as having all four paws completely outside the central segment.

<title>Prepulse inhibition and startle response</title>
<p>At PND 67 ± 2, acoustic startle responses and prepulse inhibitions (PPI) were measured to monitor sensorimotor gating.

Trials and settings were programmed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref></sup> Briefly, each session consisted of 48 trials divided into six blocks of eight pseudo-randomly presented conditions. Each block contained one “no stimulus” trial to measure baseline movement, a startle burst only (120 dB lasting 40 ms), three prepulse alone trials (74, 78, and 82 dB lasting 20 ms), and three PPI trials where a 120 dB burst followed 100 ms after either of the three prepulse bursts. Background noise inside the chamber was set at 70 dB. Startle responses were recorded for 65 ms following the onset of the pulse (or absence of). A randomly generated interval of 10–20 s was inserted between each trial.</p>

<title>Distribution of the FMRP transgene</title>

<p>Although FMRP expression, as determined by Western blots, was substantially higher in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice injected with Syn-mCMV-FMRP vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>) compared with <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice injected with Syn-FMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>), the overall distribution of the two vectors in the CNS administered at comparable titers was very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In the cerebellum, very low levels of the transgene were detected with both vectors where a few FMRP positive Purkinje neurons were observed. A semi-quantitative analysis of these brain regions showed that the most highly transduced regions were the cortex and hippocampus where &gt;200 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> where transduced, while regions more distal to the lateral ventricles such as the thalamus and inferior colliculus were still transduced but to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). WT animals injected with Syn-FMRP had a similar distribution of the transgene to that observed in KO-injected mice, but showed increased FMRP immunostaining in forebrain regions, including the cingulate cortex, striatum, and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>; Supplementary Data are available online at <uri xlink:href="http://www.liebertpub.com/hum" xlink:type="simple">www.liebertpub.com/hum</uri>).</p>
<p>Double labeling analyses using anti-NeuN and anti-S100β antibodies were carried out to assess neuronal versus glial tropism, respectively. Based on FMRP transgene co-localization with the neuronal marker NeuN, and as previously reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup> the synapsin 1 promoter incorporated into the Syn-FMRP vector endowed neuron-specific tropism of FMRP in the CNS. Examples of coronal images from 2-month-old <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice injected with Syn-mCMV-FMRP are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>. Despite the overall higher FMRP expression using this vector, the cellular tropism specific toward neurons was virtually identical to that seen with the lower expressing Syn-FMRP AAV vector. The cingulate cortex was selected for a full quantitative analysis of FMRP transgene cellular tropism with the two AAV vectors. Approximately 96% of NeuN-positive neurons in the cingulate cortex were transduced with Syn-mCMV-FMRP and 97% with Syn-FMRP. Extensive NeuN positive co-localization with FMRP indicated that 94–96% of the cells transduced with either vector were neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Thus, neuron-specific expression of FMRP using either Syn-FMRP or Syn-mCMV-FMRP is consistent with the native endogenous FMRP expression, which is predominantly neuronal in the adult mouse brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> Therefore, the main difference between the two FMRP vectors was the amount of FMRP expressed per neuron transduced.</p>
<p>In summary, a wider CNS distribution of the FMRP transgene was achieved following PND 0–2 bilateral i.c.v. administration compared with PND 5 injection, and cellular expression using both the Syn-FMRP and Syn-mCMV-FMRP vectors was nearly exclusively in neurons. Possible neuroinflammation induced by AAV vector injections into the lateral ventricles was also investigated. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was used as a marker to assess the status of astrocytes in a subset of injected mice. No signs of elevated GFAP immunostaining were seen near the ventricle or in nearby regions, including the striatum and hippocampus, indicating the absence of astrocytosis following bilateral i.c.v. administration of AAV vectors (data not shown).</p>

<title>PSD-95 and MeCP2 in AAV-treated mice</title>
<p>Taking advantage of (a) the modest transgene expression level achieved with the Syn-FMRP vector and higher levels obtained using the Syn-mCMV-FMRP vector, and (b) mouse-to-mouse variability in viral vector CNS transduction, this study sought to investigate the effects of inducing a range of FMRP transgene expression levels that would both translate into biochemical and behavioral correction in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, and delineate the lower and upper limits of expression in terms of phenotypic rescue versus induction of pathology.</p>
<p>PSD-95 is a synaptic adapter and transducer protein that is highly expressed throughout the CNS. Previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref></sup> showing that PSD-95 mRNA is a substrate for FMRP by conducting immunoprecipitation of FMRP from WT forebrain followed by quantitative RT-PCR for PSD-95 mRNA was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Gapdh mRNA was used to normalize the total amount of mRNA; Gapdh protein and mRNA levels did not show any significant changes in WT compared to <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO animals (data not shown). Previous studies also reported reduced PSD-95 protein in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref></sup> Therefore, the ability of FMRP transgene expression to normalize PSD-95 levels in adult KO mouse brain following neonatal administration of AAV vectors was examined. PSD-95 protein in the cerebral cortex of KO null vector–injected mice was reduced by 28 ± 7% compared with that observed in the WT null group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the Syn-FMRP-treated <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO group, PSD-95 levels were restored to the level seen in the WT null mice. No significant changes in PSD-95 protein were observed in WT mice injected with Syn-FMRP or in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice injected with Syn-mCMV-FMRP compared to the WT null group, indicating that FMRP over-expression above native WT levels had little impact on PSD-95 protein levels.</p>

<p>The effects of FMRP expression on the transcription regulator MeCP2 were also investigated. Mutations in the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene cause downregulation of MeCP2 protein and induce Rett syndrome, another neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autistic symptoms. MeCP2 mRNA was previously listed as a potential substrate for FMRP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> and MeCP2 mRNA contains G-quadruplex sites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref></sup> a motif present in many FMRP mRNA substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref></sup> To establish whether MeCP2 mRNA is indeed a <italic>bona fide</italic> FMRP substrate, additional FMRP immuno-precipitation/RT-PCR experiments were conducted to determine if MeCP2 mRNA was enriched in the FMRP immuno-precipitate. An enrichment of MeCP2 mRNA was seen in whole forebrain isolates from WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). An enrichment of MeCP2 mRNA following FMRP immunoprecipitation was also seen in human embryonic kidney-293 cells, which endogenously express FMRP and MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Thus, both <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> MeCP2 mRNA interacts with FMRP. To ascertain the functional relevance of this finding, MeCP2 protein expression levels in the cerebral cortex of AAV vector-treated mice were quantified. In contrast to reduced PSD-95 in null vector–treated Fmr1 KO mice, MeCP2 protein expression was elevated by 26 ± 6% in the cortex compared with WT null levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Importantly, the reintroduction of FMRP normalized MeCP2 expression in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, while FMRP over-expression in WT and KO mice had little effect on MeCP2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). These results demonstrate that the introduction of FMRP via AAV vectors recapitulates the native translational modulation normally conferred by endogenous FMRP.</p>

The <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO group treated with Syn-FMRP showed reduced horizontal and ambulatory activities and a non-significant elevation of rest time and episodes compared with the null-injected KO controls, indicating a partial rescue of some hyperactive behavioral parameters. Modest over-expression in the WT + FMRP injected with Syn-FMRP showed no effects on motor activity compared to null-injected WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A–D</xref>). In contrast, higher over-expression of FMRP in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice injected with the Syn-mCMV-FMRP vector resulted in elevated horizontal and ambulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A and B</xref>) and reduced rest time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>) compared with the WT null mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To study the efficacy of AAV FMRP viral vectors in the CNS, AAV serotype 9-based vectors that are capable of efficiently transducing brain parenchyma were employed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref></sup> The use of the synapsin promoter permitted long-term neuron-specific tropism of the FMRP transgene protein. This is important because FMRP is expressed predominantly in neurons throughout all regions of the adult mouse CNS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> Previous work demonstrated that AAV-mediated FMRP transgene expression in the brain remains relatively constant in terminally differentiated neurons for at least 7 months after i.c.v. administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup> In the present study, bilateral i.c.v. injection into mice on PND 0–2 provided superior diffusion of the vector within the forebrain compared with results obtained previously when the same vector (Syn-FMRP) was administered i.c.v. on PND 5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup> The superiority of immediate postnatal i.c.v. AAV treatment was also illustrated in a gene therapy study using a mouse model of TSC, another disorder on the autism spectrum. An AAV vector coding for TSC1 injected into the ventricles at PND 0 resulted in widespread diffusion of the vector, and in this case, therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated by increased survival time compared with vehicle-injected controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup> The ependymal lining surrounding the ventricles of the brain is still immature within the first 2 days after birth, and therefore AAV vectors can more easily diffuse to more distal regions within the brain parenchyma when injected at this early time point compared with injections made only a few days later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The experimental design used here employing three different AAV vectors and five different treatment groups provided an opportunity to examine a wide range of FMRP expression levels in the brain. These extended from no FMRP expression in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO null group to intermediate expression in the KO Syn-FMRP group, normal expression in the WT null group (designated as 100% of baseline), modest over-expression in WT mice treated with the Syn-FMRP vector, and, on the upper end, excessive over-expression in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO using the Syn-mCMV-FMRP vector. This experimental arrangement allowed the full spectrum of effects induced by variable levels of FMRP forebrain expression to be delineated.</p>
<p>FMRP is an mRNA binding and trafficking protein that regulates the localization and expression of hundreds of genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> In its absence, as in FXS, the levels of expression of proteins whose mRNAs are bound and regulated by FMRP, can be either up- or downregulated depending, in part, on the stability of the mRNA substrate. PSD-95 is a highly expressed protein crucial for synaptic integrity and plasticity. PSD-95 mRNA is an established substrate of FMRP and PSD-95 protein is downregulated in the absence of FMRP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref></sup> It was found that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice treated with Syn-FMRP displayed complete restoration of PSD-95 protein in the cerebral cortex. Thus, FMRP transgene-mediated correction of pathologically low PSD-95 demonstrates recapitulation of the normal translational control function of FMRP in neurons.</p>
<p>MeCP2 mRNA was also identified as a substrate for FMRP. This X-linked MeCP2 gene is mutated in Rett syndrome, another neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autistic features. MeCP2 functions as a transcriptional modulator of a wide array of genes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref></sup> and appears to be particularly important in the regulation of long genes (&gt;100 Kb) in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref></sup> Unlike PSD-95, which was reduced, levels of MeCP2 protein were elevated in null-treated Fmr1 KO mouse brains. The absence of changes in the expression profile of MeCP2 and PSD-95 protein in WT mice treated with the Syn-FMRP vector (modest over-expression) or in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice treated with the high expressing Syn-mCMV-FMRP vector indicates that the effect of FMRP on the translation on these two substrates does not follow a linear dose–response profile once brain FMRP levels rise above normal WT levels. Elevated MeCP2 in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO brain is consistent with FMRP acting as a translation inhibitor in WT mice. More importantly, abnormally increased MeCP2 expression in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO CNS suggests the possibility that increased MeCP2 might play a role in the overall FXS phenotype. MeCP2 over-expressing mice display impaired synaptic plasticity and autistic behaviors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref></sup> and like both FXS and <italic>FMR1</italic> gene duplication syndrome, duplication of the human MeCP2 gene is characterized by developmental delay, mental retardation, and seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44–47</xref></sup> The overlapping symptomatic features of FXS, Rett syndrome, and <italic>FMR1</italic> and MeCP2 gene duplication syndromes suggests that further studies investigating the relationships of these two key regulatory proteins is warranted.</p>
<p>Demonstrating the correction of abnormal behaviors is an essential requirement for studies seeking to develop treatments for FXS and other autism spectrum disorders. Several behaviors in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse were investigated that are known to be well-established endophenotypes in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice: motor hyperactivity, startle response for assessing sensorimotor gating, and analysis of non-social anxiety in the elevated plus maze (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Motor hyperactivity and abnormal behaviors in the elevated plus maze and the startle response in the null-treated <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice were significantly altered compared with null-treated WT mice, and these abnormal behaviors were fully or partially rescued after moderate FMRP expression.</p>

<p>Curiously, in the elevated plus maze, the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO null group displayed a highly significant increase in the number of entries and the time spent in the open arms and decreased time in the closed arms, indicative of reduced anxiety. Reduced anxious behavior in the elevated plus maze and other tests of non-social anxiety have previously been reported for the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref></sup> This phenomenon has also been observed in other mutant mouse lines. For example, μ opioid receptor KO mice, which display a general “autistic profile” on a battery of behavioral tests and have been proposed as a novel animal model of autism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref></sup> show reduced anxiety behavior in the elevated plus maze.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref></sup> Although the elevated plus maze test is traditionally viewed as an assessment of anxiety, in the context of an overall “autistic phenotype,” the test may additionally or instead reflect hyper-arousal to novel environments and/or reduced cognitive function in conjunction with reduced fear—that is, the mice may be less cognizant of the potential danger of open spaces (e.g., open arms in the elevated plus maze).</p>
<p>A primary objective of this study was to provide insight into the upper and lower limits of FMRP expression in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> mouse brain that rectify abnormal biochemical and behavioral parameters without inducing harmful effects from over-expression. Over-expression of FMRP likely has deleterious consequences, as persons carrying an <italic>FMR1</italic> gene duplication show profound physical changes and cognitive impairment. Several cases of this syndrome have been reported with common features that include severe mental retardation, developmental delay, and seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53–56</xref></sup> Transgenic mice massively over-expressing human FMRP at 10- to 15-fold above normal WT levels of the mouse gene showed increased anxiety and reduced motor activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref></sup> These results differ from the current results where <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice treated with the high expressing Syn-mCMV-FMRP vector showed no major changes in anxiety behavior and a robust increase in motor activity. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include (a) the large differences in protein expression levels (10- to 15-fold above WT in Peier <italic>et al</italic>., and 2.5- to 4.5-fold in the present study); (b) differences in the gene promotors used: (presumably) the endogenous human <italic>FMR1</italic> promotor in the transgenic mice versus the synapsin/minimal CMV promoter used here that directed expression solely to neurons; and (c) body-wide over-expression in the transgenic mice versus FMRP transgene expression restricted to forebrain regions in the present study.</p>
<p>Two additional important findings can be gleaned from this study. First, both biochemical rescue (as determined by measuring FMRP substrates) and behavioral rescue were apparent in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice expressing FMRP in the forebrain at levels moderately below and above the WT level. Second, low or modest over-expression of FMRP did not appear to induce pathology. The former point is based on normalization of FMRP substrates and reversal of behavioral abnormalities in KO mice expressing the FMRP transgene in the forebrain at approximately 35–115% relative to WT mice, depending on the brain region. The latter suggestion is based on the absence of effects on FMRP substrates (PSD-95 and MeCP2) and little or no effects on behavior in WT mice expressing FMRP at 115–235% above WT levels. Taken together, these results indicate that a certain degree of leeway exists in terms of the vector-mediated transgene expression levels required in CNS neurons for achieving phenotypic reversal without inducing deleterious effects. In light of the various dosing and pharmacokinetic issues associated viral vector-based therapeutics noted above, these findings provide encouraging support for the development of AAV-FMRP as a viable human biopharmaceutical therapeutic agent.</p>
