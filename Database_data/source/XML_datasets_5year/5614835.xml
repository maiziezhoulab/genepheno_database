<p id="P1">Regeneration of several organs involves adaptive reprogramming of progenitors, however, the intrinsic capacity of the developing brain to replenish lost cells remains largely unknown. In this study, we discovered that the developing cerebellum has unappreciated progenitor plasticity, since it undergoes near full growth and functional recovery following acute depletion of granule cells, the most plentiful neuron population in the brain. We demonstrate that following postnatal ablation of granule cell progenitors, <italic>Nestin</italic>-expressing progenitors (NEPs) specified during mid-embryogenesis to produce astroglia and interneurons, switch their fate and generate granule neurons in mice. Moreover, Hedgehog-signaling in two NEP populations is crucial not only for the compensatory replenishment of granule neurons but also to scale interneuron and astrocyte numbers. Thus we provide insights into the mechanisms underlying robustness of circuit formation in the cerebellum, and speculate that adaptive reprogramming of progenitors in other brain regions plays a greater role than appreciated in developmental regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The intrinsic plasticity of cells <italic>in vivo</italic> that enables adaptive reprogramming plays an important role in many regeneration processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Although, the principles that apply have been uncovered in a few mammalian tissues, the repair capacity of the postnatal brain remains largely unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Indeed, a critical alternative to stem cell therapies for complex brain structures like the folded cerebellum and cerebral cortex with an enormous surface area is to stimulate endogenous stem cells for repair. The cerebellum (CB), consisting of 80% of the neurons in the human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> (60% in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>), is involved in higher reasoning via neural circuits that connect throughout the cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Unlike other brain regions, the CB undergoes its major growth in the third trimester and infant stage in humans, primarily due to proliferation of granule cell precursors (GCPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Consequently, the CB is highly prone to injury in babies born prematurely, and more over cerebellar hypoplasia is the second highest risk factor for autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">The CB, which develops from the anterior hindbrain, has two embryonic progenitor zones. The ventricular zone (VZ), which gives rise to all the inhibitory neurons, including Purkinje cells (PCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and the upper rhombic lip that produces all the excitatory neurons, including granule cells (GCs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In mice, <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing granule cell precursors (GCPs) migrate over the surface of the CB at embryonic day (E) 13.5–15.5 and proliferate in the external granule cell layer (EGL) until ~postnatal day (P) 15 in response to Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) secreted by Purkinje cells (PCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Postmitotic GCPs migrate past the PCL to form the internal granule cell layer (IGL). Interestingly, the EGL was shown to be replenished following irradiation of the rat brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, the extent of the ultimate cerebellar recovery, as well as the cell type that replenished the EGL was not identified.</p>
<p id="P4">During CB development, only PCs and embryonically born interneurons derive directly from the ventricular zone. Other interneurons and astroglia (astrocytes and Bergmann glia) are generated by ventricular zone-derived progenitors that proliferate after birth in the cerebellar cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The cortical progenitors display traits of immature astrocytes and express neural stem cell (NSC) markers such as Nestin, SOX2 and TNC (referred to here as <italic>Nestin-</italic>expressing progenitors or NEPs), and are found in several locations (white matter, PCL and below the EGL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>). Interestingly, progenitors in the PCL produce only astroglia <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas bipotent interneuron/astroglial progenitors reside in the white matter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, NEPs have several subpopulations with distinct characteristics, but expansion of all is regulated by SHH-signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">There is increasing evidence in many organs that progenitors that normally are restricted to a particular fate have under appreciated plasticity following genetic manipulation or when cultured <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. For example, <italic>Ptf1a</italic> mutant ventricular zone-derived cells can produce a small number of GCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and ectopic expression of ATOH1 converts ventricular zone cells to a rhombic lip lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In culture, P3-7 cerebellar progenitors can form multipotent clonal neurospheres that include some granule cell-like cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Collectively these data raise the question of whether cerebellar NEPs have a greater differentiation capacity <italic>in vivo</italic> than is seen during normal development, especially following injury.</p>
<p id="P6">Here we report the ability of the developing CB to almost fully recover after a major depletion of the perinatal EGL. Using multiple genetic approaches and live imaging of cerebellar slices, we conclude that NEPs in the PCL proliferate, migrate into the EGL, initiate <italic>Atoh1-</italic>expression, and produce GCs that incorporate into the IGL. Furthermore, white matter NEPs undergo a transient delay in interneuron and astrocyte generation. HH-signaling in NEPs is crucial for both recovery of the EGL and scaling of interneuron numbers after injury. We provide a striking example of the adaptive reprogramming capacity of brain progenitors, as well as raising the possibility that NEPs could be harnessed for therapeutic repair of the developing cerebellum.</p>

<title>Minor adult cerebellar hypoplasia following GCP ablation</title>
<p id="P7">To determine the regenerative capacity of the newborn CB, we specifically irradiated the CB of P1 mice with a single dose of 4 G<italic>y</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A–B</xref>). Histology and TUNEL assay at P2 revealed the high sensitivity of the EGL (PAX6+ layer) to irradiation-induced cell death, compared to cells in the cerebellar cortex (n=4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C,D,G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>). Moreover, by P3 the EGL was greatly diminished and the CB smaller than control littermates (n=4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E,F,I,J</xref>). Nevertheless, by P30 irradiated (IR) mice (n=11) had a normal morphology and cytoarchitecture with only a small reduction in the size of the CB (mean=81.16% ± 0.07 % area of controls) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K–M</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">To test whether motor function in adults (5–6 week old) was disrupted after irradiation, we assessed two motor behavior paradigms, and confirmed normal grip strength in Non-IR (Normalized force=5.88±0.16) and IR (Normalized force=5.83±0.14) mice (n=18 for each condition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1N</xref>). Interestingly, no difference was observed in the performance on the accelerating rotarod of IR mice (259.5±7.12 sec) compared to Non-IR mice (245.5±8.49 sec) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1O</xref>). In the footprint analysis, IR mice had only a slightly different stride length compared to Non-IR mice (Non-IR= 6.522±0.119 cm; IR= 6.214±0.067 cm)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1P, R</xref>), with no significant difference in either sway (Non-IR= 2.474±0.051 cm; IR= 2.430±0.076 cm) or stance (Non-IR= 4.126±0.051 cm; IR= 3.979±0.054 cm) lengths (n=18 for each condition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1P, R</xref>), or in the ratio of R and L stance (% absolute [stance L – stance R]/longest stance)(Non-IR= 5.77±0.82%; IR= 5.63±0.67%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1Q, R</xref>). All together, depletion of the mouse EGL at P1-3 is not sufficient to induce major long-term cerebellar hypoplasia or motor behavior defects, raising the possibility of a compensation mechanism in the developing CB after acute injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>The EGL is replenished after injury</title>
<p id="P9">We next measured the area of midsagittal cerebellar sections at different stages, and found that the size of IR cerebella was reduced compared to Non-IR controls from P3 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), with a decrease in growth until P6 (~60% the area of controls at P6) and then a recovery phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Interestingly, after P8 a similar growth curve was seen in both control and IR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Measurement of EGL thickness at P5 and P8 revealed that the EGL was progressively replenished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C,E,G,K,M</xref>). Furthermore, at both time points, the EGL contained a higher proportion of Ki67+ GCPs in the outer EGL compared to controls, suggesting an expansion of the newly forming EGL due to delayed differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,F,H,L,N</xref>). Curiously, we observed SOX2+ cells within both the molecular layer and EGL at P5, something not seen in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I,O</xref>). By P8, only EGL cells expressing a low level of SOX2 were observed in IR cerebella, with none in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J,P</xref>). Our results highlight an unexpected ability of the CB to partially recover after EGL injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>NEPs do not normally produce GCPs/GCs <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p id="P10">The SOX2 expression in the regenerating EGL lead us to hypothesize that NEPs contribute to the cellular compensation mechanism by changing their fate and migrating to the EGL. To test this idea, we validated two genetic tools: a <italic>Nestin-FlpoER</italic> transgene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> to perform Genetic Inducible Fate Mapping (GIFM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> of NEPs with Flippase (Flp)-dependent <italic>R26<sup>FSF-cDNA</sup></italic> reporter alleles (FSF=Frt-Stop-Frt), and a <italic>Nes-CFP</italic> transgene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> to observe NEP behaviors. Analysis of P1 <italic>Nestin-FlpoER/+;R26<sup>FSF-TdTomato/+</sup></italic> (<italic>Nes-TDTom</italic>) mice administrated Tamoxifen (Tm) at P0 revealed that the initially marked cell population was SOX2+ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2B</xref>) and doesn’t express the GCP marker <italic>Atoh1-Gfp</italic> (n=3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A</xref>). Consistent with GIFM using <italic>Tnc<sup>CreER</sup></italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, in <italic>Nestin-FlpoER/+;R26<sup>FSF-GFPCre/+</sup></italic> (<italic>Nes-GFP</italic>) mice at P8 51.37±3.97% of the GFP+ cells expressed the interneuron marker PAX2 and 37.24±6.59% the astrocyte and Bergmann glial marker S100β (30.43±5.84% S100β+/SOX2+ and 6.81±2.72% S100β+ only) and 7.75±2.36% expressed SOX2 only (n=3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2C–F</xref> and also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S10</xref>). Importantly, the rare GFP+ cells located in the EGL (5.16±0.8% of total GFP+ cells, or ~27 cells per section per lobule 4/5) did not express PAX6 (n=3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2D</xref>) and in fact, 91.15±3.87% of these cells expressed PAX2 and 1.5±2.12% S100β. In addition, no PAX6+/GFP+ cells were observed in the IGL, except in lobule 10, which was excluded from further analysis since GCPs cannot migrate between fissures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. As expected, 96.74±0.15% of Nes-CFP+ cells expressed SOX2 and 41.12±1.48% expressed the mature astroglial marker S100β (with 97.54±0.42% of Nes-CFP+ S100β+ cells also expressing SOX2) at P4 (n=3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2G,H</xref>), and none expressed PAX6. Furthermore, at P3 only ~5 Nes-GFP+ cells were seen in the EGL of lobule 4/5 in non-irradiated mice per section, and only ~16 in irradiated mice, compared to ~3,000 [total] cells in the normal EGL (data not shown). Thus, we have effective tools to mark and fate map NEPs that normally generate interneurons and astroglia.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>NEPs form multipotent neurospheres</title>
<p id="P11">We next tested whether Nes-CFP+ cells isolated by FACs from P4 cerebella (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3A,B</xref>) can form multipotent neurospheres in culture, and found these cells efficiently generate neurospheres expressing CFP and SOX2 within 7 days (n=3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3C,D</xref>) at densities as low as 60 cells per well, whereas Nes-CFP- cells failed to form spheres even at densities of 6,000 cells per well (stem cell frequency = CFP+: 1/30.5 and CFP-: 1/22,500; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3E</xref>). Moreover, the Nes-CFP+ primary neuropheres gave rise to secondary and tertiary neurospheres, confirming their ability to undergo long-term self-renewal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3F</xref>). Finally, neurospheres could differentiate into cells expressing neuronal (TuJ1), astroglial (GFAP) and oligodendrocytic (O4) markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3G–J</xref>), demonstrating their multipotency. Thus, NEPs in the postnatal CB represent NSCs.</p>

<sec id="S7">
<title>NEPs switch their fate to become GCPs and produce GCs after EGL injury</title>
<p id="P12">We next performed <italic>Nes-</italic>GIFM following Tm administration at P0. CB area measurements revealed that, although Tm delayed recovery compared to untreated mice, the CB of IR <italic>Nes-TDTom</italic> mice progressively recovered and reached 74% ± 0.09% of the size of controls by P30 (n=7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4</xref>). The foliation pattern and the cytoarchitecture of IR cerebella appeared grossly normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>), although less so than in IR mice not given Tm. Significantly, and unlike Non-IR mice, we observed, not only a large increase in the number of <italic>Nes</italic>-derived TdTom+ cells in the IGL (3241±417 per mm<sup>2</sup> compared to 699.8±77.81 in Non-IR animals, n=3) but also that 60.63±2.26% were NeuN+ in IR mice and only 5.54±0.31% in Non-IR animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E–H</xref>). Importantly, only in IR mice was the ML strongly positive for diffuse TdTom staining, indicating that most of the NeuN+ cells in the IGL are GCs that project parallel fibers into the ML. Analysis at P5, P8 and P12 revealed a progressive increase in the number of <italic>Nes</italic>-derived cells in the EGL of IR mice (n=3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I–K,L–N,O</xref>). Interestingly, 35.66±13.2% of TDTom+ cells in the EGL expressed <italic>Atoh1-GFP</italic> at P8, with 80.63±3.24% of cells co-expressing TDTom at P12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3P</xref>). In contrast, in Non-IR mice ~10% of TDTom+ cells in the EGL (4±2.7 or 2.27±1.9 TDTom+ cells per section per lobule 4/5 at P8 or P12) expressed GFP at all stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3P</xref>). Importantly, the timing of TDTom+ cell accumulation in the EGL correlated with the maximum increase in growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). As with IR mice not administered Tm, we observed a progressive increase in the thickness of the EGL over time and higher proportion of proliferating cells compared to normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3Q</xref>). In addition, both the P12 and P16 EGL was thicker in the IR CB compared to controls, suggesting an extended period of GCP proliferation contributed to the recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K, N, Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">To validate the results we obtained using IR, we developed a second injury model specific to GCPs using Cre-inducible DTR (diphtheria toxin receptor) transgenic mice (iDTR). <italic>Atoh1-tTA/+;TRE-Cre/+;R26<sup>LSL-DTR/+</sup></italic> triple transgenic mice were administered doxycycline from embryonic day (E)8.5 to E12.5 (<italic>Atoh-DTR</italic>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6A</xref>) to specifically target the EGL and avoid DTR expression in the cerebellar nuclei, as shown by DTR protein expression at P1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6B,C</xref>). TUNEL assay showed that EGL cells died upon DT administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6D,E</xref>). <italic>Nes-</italic>GIFM (<italic>Nes-TDTom</italic>) and analysis of Nes-CFP+ cell behavior in the model confirmed that TDTom+ cells populated the EGL by P6 (n=1) and CFP+ cells were present at P4 and P6 (n=2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6F–K</xref>). Due to <italic>Atoh1</italic> transgene expression in respiratory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, the majority of mice died soon after P6. Our results demonstrate that using two different models of EGL depletion, NEPs change their fate, populate the EGL, turn on EGL genes (<italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pax6</italic>) and differentiate into GCs.</p>

<sec id="S8">
<title>NEPs in the PCL contribute to recovery of the EGL</title>
<p id="P14">We next analyzed the behavior of NEPs using our <italic>Nes-CFP</italic> reporter mice. Interestingly, evaluation of the number of CFP+ cells per length of PCL revealed a significant increase at P4-6 in IR animals compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A,C,E</xref>). Consistent with this increase, the percentage of CFP+ cells that were Ki67+ in the PCL was significantly higher than in controls at P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Using a 1hr pulse of EdU, we found a significant increase in the proliferation index (% [Ki67+ GFP+ EdU+] cells of all [GFP+Ki67+] cells) of PCL NEPs at P3 compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). Interestingly by P6, the number of CFP+ cells in the PCL of IR mice was more comparable to controls and CFP+ cells had clearly begun populating the molecular layer and EGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B,D,E</xref> and arrows/arrowheads in 4D′). Concomitantly, the percentage of Ki67+ CFP+ cells in the PCL was decreased, not only compared to P4 but also compared to P6 Non-IR controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Finally, GFP protein continued to be detected in cells in the EGL at P8, although more weakly than at P6, and it was not detected at P12, indicating that as with SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2O,P</xref>) expression of Nestin is extinguished once the NEPs enter the EGL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7</xref>). In summary, our results suggest two phases of EGL recovery: increased proliferation of NEPs in the PCL, followed by migration into the EGL and recovery of normal NEP proliferation.</p>
<p id="P15">To test whether PCL NEPs replenish the injured EGL, we performed time-lapse imaging of P6 <italic>Nes</italic>-<italic>CFP</italic> cerebellar slice cultures from Non-IR and IR mice. Strikingly, by tracking the movement of individual cells during ~6hrs of imaging we observed Nes-CFP+ cells actively migrating from the PCL to the EGL in slices from IR but not control mice at P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H–K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">supp. videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">3</xref>). We also observed significantly more cells migrating from the molecular layer to the EGL in slices from IR mice compared to controls. Furthermore, highly motile CFP+ cells were present in the EGL of only IR CB slices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">supp. videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">2</xref>).

<title>White matter NEPs delay their production of interneurons and Astroglia during EGL recovery to maintain the proper scaling of cerebellar cell types</title>
<p id="P16">Since the proper function of the cerebellum depends on the proper scaling of the different cell types, we hypostatized that the production of interneurons and astroglia was reduced during EGL recovery. To test this idea, we analysed the behaviour of NEPs located in the white matter (WM) and IGL. Using live imaging, we did not observe any Nes-CFP+ cells in the IGL+WM region migrate to the EGL, although as expected a few cells in both IR and Non-IR slices migrated to the PCL and from the PCL to the ML where interneurons reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A–C</xref>), suggesting that WM NEPs do not participate directly in EGL recovery.</p>
<p id="P17">Interestingly, we observed a trend towards a decrease in the percentage of Ki67+ NEPs in P4 WM+IGL of IR mice (21.33±1.76%) compared to non-IR controls (28±1.73%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Consistent with this decrease, we found a significant decrease in the proliferation index of WM+IGL NEPs at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D,E,G</xref>). However, this decrease was transient as the proliferation index progressively increased over time (29±1.73% at P3 and 42.67±1.45% at P6; p=0.0038) while staying constant in control animals (40.33±2.9% at P3 and 39±1.73% at P6; p=0.71) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). In addition, there was a significant decrease in the density of CFP+ cells in the WM+IGL of P3 IR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H,J,P</xref>) followed by an increase in the number of CFP+ cells at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H,K,Q</xref>), suggesting a delay in expansion of WM NEPs during initial EGL recovery. Indeed, there was a decrease in the density of NEP-derived PAX2+ interneuron progenitors in the WM+IGL at P4 but not P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I, L–M and R–S</xref>). Astrocyte density did not change, but the number must decrease because the CB is smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I, N–O and T–U</xref>). Thus, during recovery IGL+WM NEPs delay their expansion and production of interneurons and astroglia in order to maintain the proper scaling of cerebellar cell types.</p>

<title>SHH signaling plays a major role in NEPs for recovery after injury</title>
<p id="P18">RNA-Sequencing of FACS purified P5 Nes-CFP+ cells was performed to identify pathways involved in the two phases of recovery. As expected, the percentage of CFP+ cells of all cerebellar cells was significantly increased in IR cerebella (Non-IR: 5.26 ± 0.95% vs. IR: 12.63 ± 2.54%). 58 genes showed significant differences in expression (≥ 1.5-fold, adjusted p-value cutoff 0.05 and mean coverage of at least 15) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">supp. Table 2</xref>). Pathway analysis identified 7 major categories of differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S9B</xref>). As predicted, genes associated with cell cycle were markedly increased after IR, and cell adhesion and migration genes were down and up regulated, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S9B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">Our RNA-seq data suggested that the HH target genes <italic>Gli1</italic>, <italic>Ptch1</italic> and <italic>Ptch2</italic> were slightly up regulated in IR NEPs (1.2, 1.4 and 1.7 fold change respectively with un-adjusted p-value &lt;0.05)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supp. material</xref>). We validated this result by performing <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) and found that <italic>Gli1</italic> expression was higher in the PCL of P5 IR cerebella compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S9C,E</xref>), but not at P8 when Nes-derived cells had populated the EGL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S9D,F</xref>). Furthermore, FACS isolated Nes-CFP+ cells from P4 and P6 IR and Non-IR cerebella showed a transient increase in <italic>Gli1</italic>, <italic>Ptch1</italic> and <italic>Ptch2</italic> expression after IR at P4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S9G</xref>), suggesting a potential role for HH signaling in the recovery process. We first determined the effect of modulating HH-signaling in NEPs in normal development by ablating <italic>Smoothened</italic> (<italic>Smo</italic>) or overexpressing a constitutively active form of SMO (SmoM2) using our mosaic analysis (MASTR) technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). <italic>Nes-FlpoER/+;R26<sup>FSF-GFPcre/+</sup>;Smo<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> (<italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO) and <italic>Nes-FlpoER/+;R26<sup>FSF-GFPcre/SmoM2-YFP</sup></italic> (<italic>Nes-SmoM2</italic>) mice or <italic>Nes-GFP</italic> controls (<italic>Nes-FlpoER/+;R26<sup>FSF-GFPcre/+</sup></italic>) were given Tm at P0, and the number of GFP+ cells quantified at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B–E</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a reduction in the total number of GFP+ cells in the PCL and IGL+WM of <italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO cerebella compared to controls, but no change in the molecular layer and EGL. Furthermore, <italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO cerebella showed a decreased in the number of GFP+ SOX2+ (only) cells as well as <italic>NEP</italic>-derived PAX2+ interneurons and astroglia (S100β+ only or S100β+ SOX2+ cells) (n=3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S10A–B,D–E,G–J</xref>). In contrast, increasing the level of HH-signaling in NEPs led to an increase in the number of GFP+ <italic>NEP</italic>-derived cells located in the PCL but not elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D,E</xref>). Interestingly, whereas there was no difference in the number of GFP+ cells that expressed PAX2 in <italic>Nes-SmoM2</italic> cerebella compared to controls (except in the EGL) (n=6, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S10C,H</xref>), elevated HH-signaling induced an increase in the production of <italic>NEP</italic>-derived astroglia in the PCL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S10F,I,J</xref>). Moreover, GFP+ NEPs with elevated SHH signaling entered the EGL at P8 (n=2/4) and at P12 (n=2/3), something not observed in <italic>Nes-GFP</italic> controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S10K–P</xref>). <italic>Nes-SmoM2</italic> mice did not, however, develop cerebellar tumors (medulloblastomas) (n=0/9 &gt;3 months).</p>
<p id="P20">We next tested whether the CB of <italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO mice have impaired recovery after irradiation at P1. Indeed, the CB of IR <italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO mice administered Tm at P0 recovered poorly and the CB reached only ~49% of Non-IR <italic>Nes-GFP</italic> size compared to ~74% for IR <italic>Nes-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F–I–K</xref>). Importantly, no major cerebellar size reduction was observed in non-IR <italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO mice. Furthermore, no GFP+ cells were found in the EGL of IR <italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO mice at P12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S11</xref>).</p>

In addition, the percentage of stance difference was significantly higher in IR <italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO mice compared to other cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6N</xref>). Importantly, no significant difference was observed between Non-IR littermate control and <italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO Non-IR or IR littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6L–N</xref>). Finally, we found that IR <italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO mice (181.9±12.47 sec) performed poorly on the accelerating rotarod paradigm compared to both Non-IR littermate controls (236.6±17.18 sec) and <italic>Nes-Smo</italic> CKO non-IR (256.5±8.06 sec) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6O</xref>).

Thus, the CB recovers poorly after irradiation when HH-signaling is removed due to lack of expansion and migration of the NEP lineage to the EGL.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P22">There is emerging evidence in several organs for regenerative mechanisms that involve a change in identity, or adaptive reprogramming of normally lineage-restricted cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We have uncovered an extraordinary plasticity of cerebellar ventricular zone-derived committed progenitors <italic>in vivo,</italic> by their ability to switch their fate into the rhombic lip (granule cell) lineage after postnatal injury. Indeed, our data demonstrates that depletion of the EGL in neonates provides a potent environment for the expansion of PCL NEPs and their migration to and repopulation of the EGL. NEP-derived cells then lose their NSC markers (SOX2 and Nestin) and initiate expression of GC lineage-specific genes (<italic>Atoh1</italic>). The new GCPs proliferate before differentiating into GCs, and importantly have an extended proliferation phase compared to normal GCPs. <italic>Atoh1</italic> is specifically expressed in the proliferative outer EGL and is required for the generation of the EGL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, in part through inducing the expression of the critical transcriptional activator in the SHH pathway, GLI2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. According to the important role of <italic>Atoh1</italic> in generating GCPs, we speculate that the migration of PCL NEPs into the EGL represents a crucial step in the acquisition of an excitatory phenotype. The postnatal EGL must maintain cues that allow the proper integration of new progenitors and enables recovery from severe injuries that would not be possible in a mature brain. Since rare cerebellar NSCs persistent in the adult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, our study raises the possibility that given the right cues NEPs in the adult could be harnessed to contribute to cerebellar repair, and provides a rare example of adaptive reprogramming of committed progenitors to another normal state <italic>in vivo</italic> in mammals.</p>
<p id="P23">Although, our data clearly demonstrate the involvement of PCL NEPs to EGL regeneration, a population of NEPs located in the inner EGL could also participate in EGL recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Using our <italic>Nestin-CFP</italic> and <italic>Nestin-Flpo</italic> transgenes we confirmed that a rare population of NEPs that express SOX2 reside in the inner EGL. Our fate mapping data showed that by P8, 91.15±3.87% of NEP-derived cells in the EGL express PAX2 and 1.5±2.12% S100β, suggesting that the initial population of NEPs in the P1 EGL is normally dedicated primarily to producing interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S10</xref>). Thus, if this subpopulation of NEPs is involved in EGL recovery after injury, it must be by adaptive reprogramming of EGL NEPs, similar to that of PCL NEPs.</p>
<p id="P24">Our live imaging data provide evidence that WM NEPs do not contribute to EGL replenishment after injury, as well as our finding that there is a transient decrease in the number of WM NEPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Furthermore, our RNA-seq data of all NEPs revealed that one of the top down regulated genes after IR is the immature interneuron gene <italic>Pax2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supp. material</xref>), one of the cell types generated by WM NEPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, a small but nonsignificant decrease was observed for many astrocyte markers (e.g. <italic>S100β</italic> and <italic>Gfap</italic>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supp. material</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that the WM bipotent progenitors reduce their production phase in response to EGL loss. Importantly, interneuron production resumes by P8, a stage when the EGL has been replenished. Therefore, WM NEPs participate in the recovery, not by generating GCPs directly but by maintaining the scaling of the interneurons and glia during regeneration. Thus, two populations of NEPs are able to integrate proportional scaling of the numbers of several cerebellar cell types. Thus, there is a reset of the postnatal developmental clock of the CB after injury of the EGL to re-establish the correct proportions of cerebellar cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S12</xref>) to ensure normal cerebellar circuit formation.</p>
<p id="P25">We discovered that HH-signaling is both up-regulated in the PCL NEPs after injury and required for their expansion and migration to the EGL. Increasing HH signaling is also sufficient to induce migration of NEPs to the EGL. The polarized movement of NEPs indicates that there is a spatially organized factor that directs migration, possibly an attractant molecule produced by the pial surface of the CB. Although SHH has been described to act as a cellular chemoattractant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, since PCs are the only described source of SHH, it seems unlikely that SHH alone directs the migration trajectory of the NEPs toward the EGL.</p>
<p id="P26">The efficacy of the growth recovery following EGL depletion depends on the proper scaling of multiple cell types. Our demonstration that production of WM NEP-derived interneurons and astrocytes is transiently delayed during cerebellar recovery, suggests a very powerful cell-cell communication system exists that coordinates the response of the different NEP populations during recovery. Given that SHH regulates expansion of WM and PCL NEPs, and <italic>Smo</italic> is required in NEPs for cerebellar recovery, we propose that SHH is a critical component of the communication system via multi-directional signaling locally (to PCL NEPs) and through their dendrites (to the EGL) and axons (to WM NEPs). An attractive hypothesis is that PCs are able to sense a depleted EGL due to altered excitatory input because new GCs are not produced, and in response modulate the directionality of SHH signaling by concentrating the ligand locally in the PCL, inducing local expansion of NEPs, and possibly lowering its delivery through axons to WM NEPs, delaying expansion of WM NEPs and thus HH-dependent production of interneurons and astroglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S9</xref>). Thus one molecule (SHH) would direct the two NEP populations to have different acute responses to EGL depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S12</xref>) resulting in the proper scaling of cerebellar cell types. SHH is known to regulate regeneration in adult organs with progenitor populations that normally proliferate (e.g. skin) or can be stimulated to proliferate, such as the prostate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In the adult brain we observed an increase in the number of cells in the PCL that express Nes-CFP after ablation of GCPs, but the cells did not proliferate or produce GCs (unpublished data). Our finding that increased HH signaling underlies proliferation and the fate change of NEPs provides a candidate pathway for reprograming NEPs to support regeneration after injury, stroke or neurodegeneration.</p>
<p id="P27">Since GCs are the most abundant cell type in the brain, the final size of the CB largely depends on the size of the EGL. Thus, migration of NEP-derived cells to the depleted EGL and their proliferation is a critical step in CB recovery, or catch-up growth, following irradiation. Catch-up growth has been divide into two subtypes: Type B, whereby the growth phase is longer than normal with only a small or no increase in growth velocity compared to controls; and Type A, characterized by a growth velocity that exceeds the statistical limits of normality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In our study, once the EGL was replenished at P6, the size of the CB progressively increased with a growth rate similar to that of control mice, fitting the definition of Type B catch-up growth. However, unlike the whole CB, recovery of the EGL followed Type A catch-up growth, with an increase in the thickness of the EGL and a boost in the proportion of proliferating cells in the EGL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the EGL underwent an extended period of proliferation as in Type B catch-up growth. We speculate that growth recovery that involves both Type A and B, called Type C catch-up growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, is critical for effective recovery after injury to the CB, as the EGL must be replenished rapidly, and then a normal growth rate must ensue to maintain a cellular equilibrium in which the different cell types are produced in the correct proportions to ensure robust organ function.</p>
<p id="P28">In conclusion, the adaptive reprogramming capacity of NEPs and the signaling pathway (HH) we discovered provide critical insights for developing therapies to promote the intrinsic regenerative capacity of the CB. Our findings also raise the question of whether other regions of the brain have a greater developmental regenerative capacity than is appreciated.</p>

<p id="P40">The same groups of mice were also tested on an accelerating rotarod (model 47650; Ugo Basile), which was set to accelerate from 5 to 40 rpm over a period of 300 s. Each mouse was monitored for latency to fall (or three consecutive rotations if they gripped and rode around on the rod). Mice were tested using a paradigm of three trials per day, conducted on 3 consecutive days, with 10 min rest time given in their home cages between trials. Between-group differences were statistically evaluated by Student’s t test.</p>
<p id="P41">Mice had their fore limb grip strength tested using a force gauge (1027SM Grip Strength Meter with Single Sensor, Columbus Instruments). The mice were held up to the horizontal grip and then were pulled steadily backwards until they could not hold on any longer. This was repeated 5 times per mouse, and the average force measurement was recorded. Force measurements were normalized to the mouse weight and expressed in Force/gm. Between-group differences were statistically evaluated by Student’s t test.</p>

<title>Quantifications and Statistical Analyses</title>
<p id="P42">ImageJ software was used to measure the area (10<sup>4</sup> μm<sup>2</sup> or mm<sup>2</sup>) of cerebellar section near the midline. For all IHC stainings, cell counts were obtained by using ImageJ and Neurolucida Software. For each developmental stage, three sections were analyzed per animal and ≥3 animals. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad) and significance was determined at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. All statistical analyses were one or two-tailed. For two-group comparisons with equal variance as determined by the <italic>F</italic>-test, an unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test was used. Welch’s correction was used for unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests of normally distributed data with unequal variance. P values and degrees of freedom are given in the figure legends. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in the field. No randomization was used. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.
