<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">It is crucial that the host and intestinal microflora interact and influence each other to maintain homeostasis and trigger pathological processes. Recent studies have shown that transplantation of the murine intestinal content to recipient germ-free mice enables transmission of the donor’s phenotypes, such as low level chronic inflammation associated with lifestyle-related diseases. These findings indicate that intestinal bacteria produce some molecules to trigger pathological signals. However, fecal microbial metabolites that induce obesity and the type II diabetic phenotype have not been fully clarified. Here, we showed that the intestinal bacterial metabolite stercobilin, a pigment of feces, induced proinflammatory activities including TNF-α and IL-1β induction in mouse macrophage RAW264 cells. Proinflammatory stercobilin levels were significantly higher in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice feces than in the feces of control C57BL/6 J mice. Moreover, in this study, we detected stercobilin in mice plasma for the first time, and the levels were higher in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice than that of C57BL/6 J mice. Therefore, stercobilin is potentially reabsorbed, circulated through the blood system, and contributes to low level chronic inflammation in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. Since, stercobilin is a bioactive metabolite, it could be a potentially promising biomarker for diagnosis. Further analyses to elucidate the metabolic rate and the reabsorption mechanism of stercobilin may provide possible therapeutic and preventive targets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">It is becoming clear that the intestinal microflora and host communicate with each other to regulate homeostasis and sometimes trigger pathophysiological changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. A pioneering study reported that fecal microbiota transplantation enabled transmission of several phenotypes from the donor, including insulin resistance, fat accumulation, obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertriacylglycerolemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hyperphagia, and low level chronic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These conditions were negated by the treatment with antibiotics, showing that they originated from fecal microbiota transplantation. However, it is not understood which molecules mediate the transmission of pathophysiological changes from donor to recipient. Additionally, it has been pointed out that the deterioration of intestinal microbiota in humans is related not only to lifestyle-related diseases, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, but also to many other diseases, such as dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and mental diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. One reason for this is inflammation, which is a common risk factor. Therefore, moderate or low level chronic inflammation induced by bacterial molecules is thought to be a fundamental mechanism for triggering and promoting these disorders because of interactive communication between host and intestinal bacteria.</p>
<p id="Par3">In addition to 16 s rRNA sequencing, metabolomics analysis is an effective approach to understanding how the host and bacteria communicate in the intestinal environment. It has been revealed that some bioactive intestinal and microbial metabolites were strongly associated with homeostasis and disease etiology. For example, representative volatile organic compounds in the intestinal tract include short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs produced by intestinal fermentation are consumed as an energy source and function as bioactive metabolites for immune regulation, suppression of food intake, and enhancing the intestinal barrier function, which mediates anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, and anti-carcinogenesis effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, deoxycholate generated by the metabolism of intestinal microbiota induces DNA damage and inflammation, which might play a pivotal role in obesity-associated hepatic carcinogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Another example is the metabolites of dietary lipid phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), including trimethylamine <italic>N</italic>-oxide (TMAO) and betaine, whose levels are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Of note, TMAO and betaine have proinflammatory activities that induce scavenger receptors on macrophages. Similar to compounds such as deoxycholate, TMAO and betaine, bioactive metabolites have advantages as predictive biomarkers. These “bioactive” biomarkers trigger, initiate, and promote pathological events, and therefore might be useful in the diagnosis in early stage diseases.</p>
<p id="Par4">Urobilinoids are a naturally occurring bile pigment formed by intestinal bacteria in the heme catabolic pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Heme released from hemoglobin during several pathophysiological states is sequentially converted to biliverdin by hemeoxygenase, then to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Bilirubin diglucuronide formed by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) is secreted from hepatocytes to bile via the MRP2 transporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Bilirubin diglucuronide is deconjugated and converted by intestinal bacteria to form urobilinoids, which are a group of metabolites consisting of porphyrin derivative. The four major urobilinoids are urobilinogen, urobilin, stercobilinogen, and stercobilin. Among them, urobilinogen is a major primary urobilinoid, some of which is absorbed in the intestine and transported to the kidney. Then, urobilinogen and its oxidized form, urobilin, are excreted in urine. Another part of urobilinogen is enzymatically reduced by intestinal bacteria to form stercobilinogen. Then, stercobilinogen and its oxidized form, stercobilin, are excreted in feces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Indeed, some hepatopathies cause pathologically elevated levels of plasma bilirubin. However, the physiological level of bilirubin seems to be beneficial for preventing obesity and diabetes because bilirubin directly binds with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), and positively drive the fatty acid β-oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, although urobilinoids are used to monitor fecal pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, few studies addressing the bioactivities in the human body have been published previously.</p>
<p id="Par5">In this study, we performed metabolomics analyses to determine proinflammatory metabolites in the feces of obese/diabetic model <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). We found that stercobilin, a urobilinoid, induced proinflammatory activities and was higher in <italic>ob/ob</italic> feces and plasma compared with those of C57BL/6 J mice. These findings suggest that an elevated level of fecal stercobilin is potentially reabsorbed, systemically circulated in the body, and contributes to low level chronic inflammation in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Experimental protocols and pathophysiology of C57BL/6 J and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice.

<title>Pathological features of ob/ob mice</title>
<p id="Par6">The body weight of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice was significantly higher than that of C57BL6/J mice for all experimental periods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>). The fecal 16 s rRNA sequence in feces collected at weeks 6 and 22 demonstrated that, as reported by other studies, the number of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice increased with a corresponding decrease in <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> in an age-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C</xref>). Five bacterial family/genus were statistically significance by two-way ANOVA in week or mouse lineage (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Especially, the ratio of <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, one of the bacteria of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, was markedly higher in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Several fatty liver observations, such as hepatic ballooning degradation and fat droplets, were found in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1D,E</xref>). Additionally, adipocyte hypertrophy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1F,G</xref>) and macrophage infiltration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1H,I</xref>) were observed in white adipose tissues of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice, which was strongly associated with the low-level chronic inflammation. mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in the WAT of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice were, respectively, 17- and 4-fold higher than those of C57BL/6 J mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>). The iNOS and COX-2 in WAT were also, respectively, 5.4- and 2.2-fold higher than those of C57BL/6 J mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>). Hepatic gene expression of IL-6 was significantly increased in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice compared with C57BL/6 J mice although TNF-α and IL-1β were not markedly increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref>). In contrast, no obvious elevation of inflammatory genes was observed in the colonic mucosa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2C</xref>). These results suggest that the microbial composition changes and systemic low-level chronic inflammation were induced in <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Inflammatory gene expression in C57BL/6 J (BL) and <italic>ob/ob</italic> (<italic>ob</italic>) mice white adipose tissue (WAT) (<bold>A</bold>), liver (<bold>B</bold>), colonic mucosa (<bold>C</bold>).

<title>Proinflammatory activities of mice fecal aqueous and organic extracts</title>
<p id="Par7">Fecal extracts prepared by Bligh–Dyer extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>) were applied to LC-MS non-target metabolomics. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that feces samples collected at week 0 were clearly distinguished from others (collected from weeks 6 to 22), which was due to the changeover from breeder chow (CE-2) to experimental chow (AIN-76) during week-1 (when the mice were 4 weeks old) (Fig. S1). In other words, PCA distribution of samples collected at weeks 6 to 22 seemed to be homeostatically converged in PCA score plot (Fig. S1). Since fecal metabolomics directly reflects the diet-dependent change of gut environment, continuous consumption of same diet (AIN-76) enables to eliminate possible interferes in subsequent data analysis. Therefore, feces collected at weeks 10 and 20 were subjected to NF-κB reporter gene assays to evaluate the proinflammatory activities of the fecal extracts. Murine macrophage RAW264 cells transfected with pNL3.2 NF-κB-RE vector were exposed to fecal extracts. The aqueous phase, but not the organic phase, equivalent to 10 mg feces from C57BL/6 J and <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice collected at week 10 significantly induced NF-κB activation, as determined by relative luminescence units (RLUs) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>). The RLUs induced by the aqueous phase of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice was significantly higher than that of C57BL/6 J mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>). These RLUs were dose-dependently increased by treatment with fecal extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref>) We observed that the aqueous extract from <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice feces collected at week 20 also induced stronger NF-κB activation than that of C57BL/6 J mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3D</xref>). Additionally, higher levels of RLUs induced by the aqueous phase of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice feces were also observed in human colon cancer HCT116 and HT29 cells (Fig. S2). These findings suggest that the aqueous fraction of <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> fecal extracts contained potential proinflammatory compounds.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>NF-κB reporter gene assay for mice fecal extracts.

<title>Proinflammatory activities of fractionated fecal aqueous extracts</title>
<p id="Par8">Because fecal aqueous extracts of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice induced strong NF-κB activities, LC-MS analysis was performed to explore the proinflammatory compounds of the extracts. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>, chromatograms were roughly divided to four fractions. These fractions were collected and applied to NF-κB reporter gene assays. It was confirmed that NF-κB activities induced by fecal extracts (crude) from <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mice were significantly higher than those of C57BL/6 J mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4B</xref>). Moreover, we found that fraction #2 of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice eluted between 8 and 11 min significantly increased NF-κB activity compared with that of C57BL/6 J mice, although other fractions (fractions #1, 3, and 4) showed no difference in induction between the C57BL/6 J and <italic>ob/ob</italic> groups. A volcano plot revealed that one MS ion peak <italic>m/z</italic> 595.34 at 9.0 min was extracted as a characteristic MS ion peak in fraction #2 of the <italic>ob/ob</italic> group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). To identify the compound (<italic>m/z</italic> 595.34 at 9.0 min), MS/MS analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>, we observed two prominent fragment ions, which were <italic>m/z</italic> 345.1670 and 470.2452 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5A</xref>). The molecular formulas of the precursor ion (<italic>m/z</italic> 595.34) and fragment ions (<italic>m/z</italic> 345.1670 and 470.2452) were estimated as C<sub>33</sub>H<sub>46</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>24</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>26</sub>H<sub>35</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, respectively. A database search was performed, then this metabolite was predicted as stercobilin. An LC chromatogram and MS and MS/MS spectra were exactly matched to the standard, thus the metabolite was assigned as a stercobilin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5B</xref>). Although there was some individual variability within the group, the fecal levels of stercobilin in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice were obviously higher than those of C57BL/6 J mice at weeks 6–22 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5C</xref>). Although it was not significant, the plasma levels of stercobilin in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice was 1.8-fold higher than those of C57BL/6 J mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5D</xref>). These results suggest that stercobilin is a potential biomarker for diabetic/obese model animals.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>LC-MS analyses of mice fecal aqueous extracts at week 10.

<title>Proinflammatory activities of stercobilin in RAW264 cells</title>
<p id="Par9">To confirm the proinflammatory activities of stercobilin, we performed NF-κB reporter gene assay using a stercobilin standard. As a result, stercobilin significantly induced NF-κB reporter gene activities in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6A</xref>). Additionally, stercobilin significantly induced expression of several inflammation-related genes, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6B</xref>). These results suggest that the higher levels of stercobilin observed in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice feces contributed to the low level chronic inflammation in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Stercobilin induces proinflammatory activities.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par10">In this study, to explore proinflammatory fecal metabolites in obese/diabetic model <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, we performed metabolomics (LC-MS) and bioassay (NF-κB reporter gene assay). Here we showed that levels of stercobilin were higher in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice feces and plasma than those of control C57BL/6 J mice. Furthermore, stercobilin induced NF-κB activities and inflammatory gene expression in culture cells. Because bioactive metabolites themselves trigger subsequent pathological events, stercobilin is a potential biomarker for diagnosing disorders at an early stage.</p>
<p id="Par11">Stercobilin, a brown pigment in feces, is formed by catabolic conversion by intestinal bacteria. Metabolites formed by intestinal bacteria, such as urobilinogen, urobilin, stercobilinogen, and stercobilin, are collectively referred as urobilinoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Although the physiological roles of urobilinoids are not understood, the functional roles of bilirubin in the human body has been well studied. For example, in one study, bilirubin showed antioxidative activity via radical scavenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and in another study, bilirubin reduced adiposity and fatty liver in obese subjects via binding with PPARα<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. It is reported that plasma levels of bilirubin are lowered in obese humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and negatively correlate with colorectal cancer in people in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, bilirubin within the physiologically healthy range seems to play favorable roles to prevent lifestyle-related diseases, although a pathologically elevated level of bilirubin in plasma is reflective of liver disease. However, it is unclear so far whether stercobilin has direct roles in any signaling pathway associated with obesity, diabetes or cancer. Interestingly, in one study, the fecal stercobilin level was significantly lowered (by 40%–45%) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) model mice compared with sex matched controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, deletion of <italic>Chd8</italic>, a gene responsible for ASD, induced not only delayed the neurodevelopment directly associated with major ASD symptoms, but also induced slender habitus via inhibition of C/EBPβ-regulating adipogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that stercobilin is involved in obesity/diabetes mellitus through not only proinflammatory activities but also lipid metabolism in the C/EBPβ pathway. Another study used metabolomics of cecal and liver tissues to show that urobilinoids were elevated in high fat diet-induced obese C57BL/6 N mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, bilirubin formed by host metabolism and urobilinoids formed by intestinal bacteria have a similar chemical structure, but they may show opposite activities in the body. This plausible suggestion is supported by a secondary bile acid, deoxycholate, which is also formed by intestinal bacterial metabolism and is capable of inducing the cell senescence associated with liver carcinogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Bacterial 16 s rRNA sequencing, a powerful tool to clarify the profile of microflora, has opened new fields and markedly advanced our understanding of the interaction between the host and its bacteria. In the current study, 16 rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that the ratio of <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, one of the bacteria of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, was markedly higher in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Interestingly, it has been reported that intestinal colonization by a <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> contributed to the development of diabetes in germ-free <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Further analysis must confirm whether <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> has a capacity to produce stercobilin. Therefore, in addition to 16s rRNA sequencing, fecal metabolomics is a crucial approach to discovering the etiology of intestinal microbiota induced pathophysiological alterations of the host.</p>
<p id="Par12">Intestinal bacterial species, including <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, <italic>Clostridium ramosum</italic>, <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>, and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>, have been shown to catabolize bilirubin to urobilinogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, although we could not assign these bacterial species in our results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C</xref>). Additionally, we detected proinflammatory stercobilin in not only feces but also plasma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5D</xref>), suggesting the intestinal reabsorption of stercobilin. This absorbability of urobilinoids was found and reported in another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Multidrug resistant protein (MRP2) is a transporter for bilirubin diglucuronide excreted into bile and MRP3 is a transporter for bilirubin reabsorption into blood stream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, urobilinoid transporters that contribute to the enterohepatic circulation of urobilinoids have not been identified. Several mechanisms that describe how stercobilin is highly produced in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice can be speculated, for example, (i) increased heme degradation by hepatopathy, (ii) increased deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide by microbial changes and (iii) lowered reabsorption of urobilinogen. However, detailed mechanisms are not understood yet.</p>
<p id="Par13">The concentration of stercobilin required for the NF-κB activation in RAW264 cells were ~ 1000 times higher than those observed in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice plasma. RAW264 cells required ~ μm stercobilin to activate NF-κB, which was “one shot” treatment in <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the other hand, in a clinical condition and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, it is well known that a low-level but chronic inflammation is strongly associated with life-style related diseases. In the current study, we detected higher levels of plasma stercobilin during an experimental period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5D</xref>), suggesting a continuous exposure of higher levels of stercobilin to <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. Moreover, in our preliminary experiment using C57BL/6 mice, treatment with 10 ppm (0.001%) urobilinogen in drinking water for 8 weeks slightly (3-fold increase) but significantly up-regulated levels of plasma urobilinogen, and inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 in liver, suggesting that urobilinoids potentially induce proinflammatory activities in <italic>in vivo</italic>, even if the concentration is ~nM order (unpublished observations). Therefore, we must confirm in our further study whether ~nM stercobilin in circulating blood is able to induce a chronic inflammation associated with lifestyle related disease.</p>
<p id="Par14">Although levels of stercobilin were elevated in the feces in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, some other peaks in LC-MS were significantly higher in C57BL/6 J mice compared with <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). Among them, one metabolite was identified, 5′-deoxy-5′-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA). It has been reported that MTA showed anti-oxidative activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, a lowering of antioxidative metabolites such as MTA in the intestinal tract could be another mechanism that contributes to low level chronic inflammation in lifestyle-related diseases.</p>
<p id="Par15">In this study, we investigated intestinal metabolites soluble in aqueous and organic solvent and found that stercobilin was higher in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice feces than that of controls, and that it induced moderate proinflammatory activities. Many critical metabolites have been discovered and identified using LC-MS, GC-MS, CE-MS, and NMR. In contrast, another important class in the intestinal tract are “insoluble” interphase of Bligh–Dyer extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>), which includes the strongest inflammatory molecule, bacterial LPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Low grade elevation of plasma LPS (metabolic endotoxemia) was found in high fat diet fed mice and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>; therefore, LPS was thought to be an etiologic factor for inducing inflammation-related metabolic syndrome. Thus, further analysis might be required to determine how microbial compositional changes affect inflammatory activities of fecal and plasma LPS.</p>
<p id="Par16">Although metabolites have been identified, the physiological activities and function of stercobilin in the mammalian body have not been examined. In addition to these metabolites, it is speculated that 3118 small-molecule biosynthetic gene clusters in genomes of human-associated bacteria have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, fecal metabolomic analysis can possibly find novel molecules critical in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Further analyses are required to expand studies using other model animals and human specimens. Because the heme catabolic pathway maybe closely related to lipid metabolism, identification of the transporter for urobilinoids and regulation of bacteria producing urobilinoids by drugs or diet could be therapeutic targets and promising approaches for prevention of lifestyle-related diseases.</p>

<p id="Par17">All animal experiments were approved by the animal ethics committee of the University of Shizuoka (approval number 125005), and performed according to guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals at the University of Shizuoka. Six-week-old male <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> (n = 5) and C57BL/6 J (n = 5) mice were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). All animals were housed individually in plastic cages and had free access to a basal diet (AIN-76, Oriental Yeast, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and tap water under controlled conditions of humidity (55 ± 5%), light (12/12-h light/dark cycle) and temperature (23 ± 1°C). The experimental period was for 24 weeks, following a 1-week adaptation period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). During the experimental period, mice were placed into a metabolic cage, and their fecal samples were collected at indicated time points. Aliquots of collected feces were immediately stored at −80°C until use. Liver, white adipose tissues and colonic mucosa collected at week 24 were examined by RT-qPCR, hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). For IHC, frozen sections were treated with HistoVT One (Nakalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for of antigen retrieval, and inactivated endogenous peroxidase activity. After the blocking using Blocking One Histo (Nakalai tesque), the sections were incubated with primary antibody (Biotine anti-mouse F4/80 antibody, BioLegend, San Diego, CA). Visualization of antibody binding was performed using Streptavidin-HRP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and Histofine DAB Stain kit (Nichirei Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

The TOF-MS was operated in positive and negative ion mode using an electrospray ionization source. The detector conditions were as follows: capillary voltage at 4500 V, nebulizer at 1.6 bar, drying gas flow at 9 l/min, drying gas temperature 200°C, and the mass range between 80 and 2000 <italic>m/z</italic>.
