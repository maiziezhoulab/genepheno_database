<p>HOX proteins define a family of key transcription factors regulating animal embryogenesis. <italic>HOX</italic> genes have also been linked to oncogenesis and <italic>HOXA1</italic> has been described to be active in several cancers, including breast cancer. Through a proteome-wide interaction screening, we previously identified the TNFR-associated proteins RBCK1/HOIL-1 and TRAF2 as HOXA1 interactors suggesting that HOXA1 is functionally linked to the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway. Here, we reveal a strong positive correlation between expression of <italic>HOXA1</italic> and of members of the TNF/NF-κB pathway in breast tumor datasets. Functionally, we demonstrate that HOXA1 can activate NF-κB and operates upstream of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB. Consistently, we next demonstrate that the HOXA1-mediated activation of NF-κB is non-transcriptional and that RBCK1 and TRAF2 influences on NF-κB are epistatic to HOXA1. We also identify an 11 Histidine repeat and the homeodomain of HOXA1 to be required both for RBCK1 and TRAF2 interaction and NF-κB stimulation. Finally, we highlight that activation of NF-κB is crucial for HOXA1 oncogenic activity.</p>

<body><sec id="SEC1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>HOX proteins constitute an evolutionary conserved family of transcription factors critically involved in regulating biological processes during embryogenesis from patterning the main body axis to coordinating organogenesis and differentiation in all bilaterian animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Mammalian genomes contain 39 <italic>HOX</italic> genes which are clustered in four chromosomal loci and classified in 13 paralog groups with respect to their sequence similarity, their arrangement along the chromosomes and the timing of their expression during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p><italic>HOXA1</italic> is the first <italic>HOX</italic> gene to be expressed in connection with gastrulation during embryogenesis. It is primarily involved in hindbrain segmentation into rhombomeres. Next, <italic>HOXA1</italic> is required to determine the identity of rhombomeres r4 and r5, and to specify the associated neural crest. It also contributes to inner and middle ear development, basioccipital bone formation and patterning of the great arteries and outflow tract of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Over the last two decades, <italic>HOXA1</italic> has been linked to adult cancers in breast, lung, liver, prostate and the oral cavity, as well as to melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In the context of breast cancer, <italic>HOXA1</italic> has been identified as a mammary epithelial oncogene, where its forced expression is sufficient to induce the oncogenic transformation of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells to aggressive <italic>in vivo</italic> carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>While the functions and to some extent target genes of HOXA1 have been well documented, the molecular modalities of HOXA1 activities remain scarcely characterized. So far, two functional domains of the HOXA1 protein have been clearly identified. The 60 amino acids long homeodomain shared by all HOX proteins defines their DNA-binding domain which folds into three α-helices preceded by a flexible N-terminal extension. The third helix and the N-terminal extension are involved in specific contacts with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The so-called hexapeptide lies N-terminally to the homeodomain extension. It is a six amino-acid long motif conserved in HOX proteins from paralog groups 1 to 9 involved in the interaction with PBX proteins, the best characterized HOX interactors which belong to the ‘Three Amino acid Loop Extension’ (TALE) class of homeodomain transcription factors. The integrity of the hexapeptide and the interaction with PBX is crucial for HOXA1 transcriptional activity in several reported cases. In fact, hexapeptide mutations disrupting the HOXA1–PBX interaction lead to a phenocopy of the HOXA1 knockout in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) as well as to a loss of its oncogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In addition to these well-characterized functional determinants, the N-terminal moiety of human HOXA1 contains two histidine (His) repeats of ten and five residues, respectively. These repeats are conserved among HOXA1 orthologs, although the size of the longest His repeat varies, the mouse protein containing 11 and 5 His tracts, respectively. The function of these His repeats remains unexplored, but His repeat length variations have been reported in cases of autism in the Japanese population and <italic>in vitro</italic> expression of expanded His-repeat variants of HOXA1 resulted in a loss of cooperative binding with PBX1, leading to nuclear protein aggregation, impaired neuronal differentiation and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). His deletion within the HOXA1 sequence has also been found in ventricular septal defect patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Together, these results suggest that these His repeats critically influence the function of the HOXA1 protein.</p><p>Protein–protein interactions mechanistically support the function of regulatory proteins like transcription factors or signal transducers. For the HOX family, the large repertoires of proteins HOX transcription factors are expected to interact with still need to be identified. Only two extensive searches for HOX interactors have been previously performed focusing on UBX in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and HOXA1 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). From the proteome-wide yeast two hybrid screening we recently carried out to pinpoint HOXA1 protein partners, 41 candidate interactors were confirmed by both affinity co-precipitation and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation assays. Most significantly, the validated HOXA1 interactors comprised proteins known to be active in transcription regulation, but also proteins involved in cell signaling like in focal adhesion, receptor tyrosine kinase function, and the TGFβ/BMP and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)/Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>The HOXA1 interactor proteins we identified as part of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) family included RBCK1 (NCBI GeneID 10616, also known as HOIL-1) and TRAF2 (NCBI geneID 7186). TNF signaling is crucial for physiological processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, immune response modulation and inflammation induction. Binding of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα to TNFR initiates a signaling cascade starting with the recruitment of TRADD (TNF receptor-associated death domain) that further recruits other proteins: cIAP1 and cIAP2 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and 2), RIPK1 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 1), TRAF2 and TRAF5 (TNF receptor-associated factors 2 and 5). RIPK1 is then poly-ubiquitinated allowing docking of TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1) in complex with TAB2 and TAB3 (TAK1 binding protein 2 and 3), and the IKK (Inhibitor of NF-κB kinase) complex subunits IKKα, IKKβ and NEMO. The formation of the IKK complex can be enhanced by the presence of the LUBAC complex, constituted of three proteins: RBCK1 (HOIL-1), SHARPIN and HOIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Oppositely, RBCK1 has also been suggested to display an inhibitory influence toward NF-κB by negatively regulating TAB2/TAB3 and targeting them for proteasomal degradation, thereby impairing NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Downstream of the IKK complex are the NF-κB transcription factors (p65/RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50/NF-κB1 and p52/NF-κB2) that can form different heterodimers, the most common being the p65/p50 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Under basal conditions, NF-κB is held inactive in the cytoplasm by IκB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Upon activation of the pathway, the phosphorylation of IKKα and IKKβ by TAK1 acts as a switch; activating NF-κB by targeting IκB for phosphorylation, poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation, allowing NF-κB release and nuclear translocation to engage transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>Since NF-κB regulates more than 500 genes involved in inflammation, cellular transformation, survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), aberrant NF-κB activation is frequently observed in adult cancers in breast, lung, liver and the oral cavity, and in melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), just like HOXA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Genetic alterations in multiple actors of the NF-κB pathway have been shown to be essential for cancer initiation. The E3 ubiquitin ligase RBCK1 has for example been reported as implicated in breast cancer where it stimulates proliferation by promoting the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and TRAF2 is an oncogene that is amplified in 15% of human epithelial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Therefore, the NF-κB pathway and HOXA1 expression could be functionally connected in the context of defined cancers.</p><p>The validation of the direct interaction between HOXA1 and RBCK1 and TRAF2 led us to hypothesize that HOXA1 can functionally connect to TNFR-signaling at the protein-binding level, and thereby directly modulate TNFR stimulation output. To possibly link this interaction to tumorigenic processes and to highlight to what extent HOXA1 expression could be correlated to the NF-κB signaling pathway, we analyzed public breast cancer datasets. Next, we investigated whether HOXA1 could influence the TNFR-mediated NF-κB activation. In the present study we first establish a highly significant positive correlation between expression of HOXA1 and of members of the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway in breast tumors. Then, we demonstrate (i) that HOXA1 can activate NF-κB both independently and in synergy with TNFα stimulation, in a specific and non-transcriptional fashion, (ii) that HOXA1 operates upstream of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB and triggers IKKα/β and p65 phosphorylation as well as p65 nuclear translocation, (iii) that the RBCK1 and TRAF2 influences on the NF-κB response are epistatic to HOXA1, (iv) that removal of the HOXA1 His repeat or homeodomain diminishes both its interactions with RBCK1 and TRAF2 and its capacity to stimulate the TNF/NF-κB pathway and (v) that activation of NF-κB is crucial for HOXA1 oncogenic activity.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Analysis of public breast cancer expression profiling datasets</title><p>All genome-wide expression profiling datasets of breast cancer patients with a sample size &gt;80 available in the public domain (<italic>n</italic> = 20) were retrieved from the public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset on the NCBI website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>), and analyzed using R2: a genomics analysis and visualization platform developed in the Department of Oncogenomics at the Academic Medical Center—University of Amsterdam (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://r2.amc.nl">http://r2.amc.nl</ext-link>). The Chin-124 set was uploaded from EMBL EBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress</ext-link>) under E-TABM-158. Expression data (CEL files) were analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Briefly, gene transcript levels were determined from data image files using GeneChip operating software (MAS5.0 and GCOS1.0, from Affymetrix). Samples were scaled by setting the average intensity of the middle 96% of all probe-set signals to a fixed value of 100 for every sample in the dataset, allowing comparisons between micro-arrays. Five datasets that showed no HOXA1 mRNA expression (GSE1456, -3494, -5462 and -12 093), or did not yield HOXA1-correlating genes (GSE50948) were excluded from further analysis.</p><p>The TranscriptView genomic analysis and visualization tool within R2 was used to check if probe-sets had an anti-sense position in an exon of the gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://r2.amc.nl">http://r2.amc.nl</ext-link> &gt; genome browser). The probe-sets selected for HOXA1 (Affymetrix 214639_s_at and Illumina 1700382) and for all KEGG NF-κB pathway genes (Supplementary Table S1) meet these criteria. All expression values and other details for the datasets used can be obtained through their GSE or E number from the NCBI GEO and EBI ArrayExpress websites, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>Cell culture, transfection and treatment</title><p>MCF10A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) F12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) supplemented with 5% Horse Serum (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, Missouri, USA), 0.1 μg/ml cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen).

The HOXA1 deletion derivatives HOXA1<sup>ΔNter</sup>, HOXA1<sup>Δ11His</sup>, HOXA1<sup>Δ77-205</sup>, HOXA1<sup>ΔHD</sup> and HOXA1<sup>ΔCter</sup> were generated by overlapping polymerase chain reaction using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S2 and swapping in pEXP expression vectors for HOXA1 using the Gateway® system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA) following manufacturers's instructions. All HOXA1 constructs were based on the canonical 336 amino acid isoform (RefSeq NP_034579). Expression plasmids for HOXA9, HOXB9 and HOXD9 were kind gifts from Dr Deneen Wellik (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). HOXA9, HOXB9 and HOXD9 were entered in the Gateway<sup>®</sup> system (Life Technologies) to generate N-terminally Flag-tagged proteins. The TRAF2 dominant negative (TRAF2-DN) construct was obtained by removing the 87 N-terminal amino acids from the human TRAF2 cDNA. The remaining TRAF2 coding sequence (amino acid residues 88–501) was amplified from the pDEST-GST(Nter)-TRAF2 expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and inserted into the pDON-233 vector using the Gateway<sup>®</sup> BP recombination reaction (attB1F primer: GGGGACAACTTTGTACAAAAAAGTTGGC; attB2R primer: GGGGACAACTTTGTACAAGAAAGTTGGGTA). By Gateway<sup>®</sup> LR recombination cloning, TRAF2-DN was then transferred into the pDEST-Flag(Nter) destination plasmid resulting in an expression plasmid encoding TRAF2-DN protein tagged with an N-terminal Flag-tag.

The validation of the direct interaction between HOXA1 and RBCK1 and TRAF2 led us to hypothesize that HOXA1 might by functionally linked to the TNF/NF-κB-elicited signaling.</p><p>HOXA1 and NF-κB have both been associated to breast cancer development. To determine to what extent HOXA1 expression could be correlated <italic>in vivo</italic> to genes involved in the NF-κB functional network, we analyzed breast cancer datasets corresponding to genome-wide expression profiles. To this end, we downloaded and selected mRNA expression data of breast cancer patient cohorts in the public domain from the NCBI GEO depository using the R2 genomics analysis and visualization platform as described in ‘Materials and Methods’ section. We examined 15 breast cancer datasets in detail. We first collected all genes whose mRNA expression was significantly correlated to that of HOXA1. To obtain insight into signal transduction pathways within this collection, we subjected these genes to a KEGG pathway search. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> shows that the NF-κB pathway was significantly over-represented within the HOXA1-correlating genes in 12 of 15 datasets analyzed, more often than any other signaling pathway. For the largest dataset, Bertucci-266, 67 of the 87 NF-κB pathway genes expressed in tumor samples from this cohort were significantly associated with HOXA1 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This suggests an association with HOXA1 of almost the whole NF-κB signal transduction network. The pattern from Bertucci-266 was repeated in the other datasets: of 87 NF-κB pathway genes with significant negative or positive correlation to HOXA1 expression, 54 were consistently positively (<italic>n</italic> = 50) or negatively (<italic>n</italic> = 4) associated with high HOXA1 mRNA expression in 6 or more of the 12 datasets (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S1). Notably, NF-κB-activating ligands and cell surface receptors of all the different NF-κB upstream signaling routes are represented within these 50 positively correlated genes. As are the transcriptional target genes from all different NF-κB downstream effector pathways.</p><p>The 12 breast cancer datasets we analyzed are representative of the various breast cancer studies in the public domain. They have very different compositions with regard to clinical grade, (molecular) subtype, tissue site, patient age, etc. In addition, they were performed on three different array platforms. We therefore propose that the results observed are very robust.</p><p>We are aware that the NF-κB pathway contains signaling nodes that depend on protein modification or translocation, especially in the intermediate signaling routes, that cannot be detected using mRNA expression profiling. However, we observe a universal positive correlation with the NF-κB extracellular ligands and receptors, and a predominantly positive correlation with the NF-κB transcriptional target genes, that is consistent in the majority of the 12 expression datasets we analyzed. Together, this strongly suggests that the NF-κB pathway is activated in the presence of high HOXA1 expression in breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>HOXA1 triggers the activation of NF-κB in a specific and transcription-independent manner</title><p>To first address the ability of HOXA1 to stimulate the NF-κB pathway, we co-transfected human mammary epithelial cells MCF10A with a NF-κB reporter construct containing five copies of a NF-κB responsive element (PGL4.32[luc2P/NF-κB-RE/Hygro], hereafter referred to as ‘NF-κB reporter’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and a HOXA1 expression plasmid. This reporter assay revealed that HOXA1 expression triggered a 4-fold increased activity of the NF-κB reporter. This HOXA1-mediated activation of the NF-κB reporter appeared to be specific since other HOX proteins like HOXA2, HOXA9, HOXB9 and HOXD9 were also tested and could not significantly stimulate the reporter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The specific effect exerted by HOXA1 on the NF-κB reporter was further confirmed in a loss-of-function model by transfecting MCF7 cells with different shRNAs directed against HOXA1 (sh-HOXA1 #1 to #5). sh-HOXA1 #2 and #3 significantly diminished both the level of the HOXA1 protein and the activity of the NF-κB reporter, demonstrating that the activity of NF-κB reporter is enhanced by HOXA1. sh-HOXA1 #4 and #5 also provoked a slight decrease in HOXA1 abundance and NF-κB reporter activity, although this did not reach statistical significance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Transactivation assays on both NF-κB- and HOXA1-responsive reporters.

The HOXA1<sup>WM-AA</sup> variant has a substitution in the hexapeptide which makes the protein unable to interact with cofactors like PBX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). As already mentioned, PBX1 has appeared to be a crucial cofactor for the transcriptional activity of HOXA1 on well-characterized target enhancers. The integrity of the HOXA1 hexapeptide has also been shown necessary to the developmental and oncogenic HOXA1 functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). HOXA1<sup>QN-AA</sup> harbors a substitution in the homeodomain which impairs DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). In MCF10A cells, both the HOXA1<sup>WM-AA</sup> and HOXA1<sup>QN-AA</sup> mutant proteins, failed to activate the HOXA1 reporter as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). This therefore confirms these mutants as transcriptionally inactive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Surprisingly, all HOXA1 versions enhanced the activity of the NF-κB driven reporter, supporting that HOXA1 could act on the pathway in a transcription-independent manner. Moreover, addition of PBX1 or the alternative TALE HOXA1 cofactor PREP1, which normally allow HOXA1 to fully activate the HOXA1 reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) had no effect on the activation of the NF-κB reporter by HOXA1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>).</p><p>Similar results were observed upon stimulation of the pathway by TNFα addition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). The TNFα-mediated activation of the NF-κB reporter was about six times higher in combination with HOXA1 than without HOXA1. Since NF-κB can also be activated upon stimulation by other cytokines, the same experiment was performed by treating the cells with IL-1β, leading to similar results as with TNFα addition (data not shown). This together supports that HOXA1 activity synergized with cytokine-mediated activation of NF-κB.</p><p>To better understand at which level HOXA1 exerts its influence in the TNF/NF-κB signaling cascade, MCF10A cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for HOXA1 and a non-degradable variant of IκBα (IκBα S32/36A, hereafter called ‘IκB-SR’) which acts as a repressor of the pathway by preventing NF-κB nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The HOXA1-mediated activation of the NF-κB reporter was fully suppressed by IκB-SR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), as was also the TNFα-triggered activation of the reporter (data not shown). This therefore demonstrates that HOXA1 acts upstream of IκBα in the signaling cascade.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Effect of HOXA1 on the NF-κB pathway.

This is a representative experiment of three biologically independent duplicates ± SEM.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkw606fig3"></graphic></fig><p>The ability of HOXA1 to enhance TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation was further evaluated by investigating the phosphorylation status of NF-κB signaling proteins upon TNFα stimulation in the presence or in the absence of HOXA1. MCF10A cells were transfected with a vector coding for HOXA1 or an empty vector as negative control, and were treated with TNFα 24 h later. The cells were harvested at different time-points to evaluate the levels of both total and phosphorylated TAB2 (Ser372), IKKα/β (Ser176/180), IκBα (Ser32) and p65 (Ser536) using western blot analysis. Whereas whole protein levels of TAB2, TAB3, IKKα/β, IκBα and of p65 were similar between cells transfected for HOXA1 or with the negative control, expression of HOXA1 led to increased levels of phosphorylated TAB2 (Ser372), phosphorylated IKKα/β (Ser176/180), phosphorylated IκBα (Ser32) and phosphorylated p65 (Ser536) compared to the negative control upon TNFα stimulation. The phosphorylated forms of TAB2 and IKKα/β were detected earlier and were more abundant in cells expressing HOXA1 compared to cells transfected with the negative control. The phosphorylated forms of IκBα and p65 were detected for a longer period in cells expressing HOXA1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and Supplementary Figure S2). These results therefore show that HOXA1 could stimulate TAB2, IKKα/β, IκBα and p65 phosphorylation in combination with TNFα.</p><p>As mentioned above, NF-κB activation results in nuclear translocation of NF-κB dimers, the most common being p65/p50 dimers. We therefore investigated by immunofluorescence whether HOXA1 could trigger p65 relocalization to the nucleus in MCF10A cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Whereas p65 was located in the cytoplasm in cells transfected with an empty vector (negative control), p65 nuclear translocation was observed in cells treated 15 min with TNFα. Cells expressing HOXA1 displayed both a cytoplasmic and a nuclear p65 localization. This confirms that the HOXA1-dependent NF-κB activation can be associated to p65 nuclear translocation.</p><p>Finally, we evaluated the ability of HOXA1 to stimulate IL-8 secretion as a downstream effect of NF-κB target gene activation. Transfection of HOXA1 in MCF10A cells provoked a more than 2-fold increase in IL-8 secretion as detected in the culture medium. Similarly, TNFα and IL-1β addition resulted in a high level of IL-8 secretion. As expected, co-expression of HOXA1 and IκB-SR significantly reduced the positive effect of HOXA1 on IL-8 production (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). The specificity of HOXA1 to trigger IL-8 secretion was confirmed in a loss-of-function model by transfecting vector coding for sh-HOXA1 in MCF7 cells. As observed for the Luciferase assays, sh-HOXA1 #2 and #3 decreased the HOXA1-related IL-8 levels compared to the positive control corresponding to non transfected cells showing endogenous HOXA1 expression. Transfection of sh-HOXA1 #1, #4 and #5 led to IL-8 levels similar to the positive control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data show that HOXA1 can activate NF-κB in a specific and transcription-independent manner, acting upstream of IκB in the signaling cascade and triggering TAB2, IκBα, IKKα/β and p65 phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB target gene activation.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>The HOXA1-interactors RBCK1 and TRAF2 are epistatic to HOXA1 in modulating the activation of NF-κB</title><p>Since RBCK1 and TRAF2 were identified as direct HOXA1 interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), the ability of those proteins to modulate HOXA1 activity on NF-κB was evaluated in MCF10A cells. Activity tests were performed using an NF-κB reporter, with each interactor alone or in combination with HOXA1. RBCK1 did not activate the NF-κB reporter whereas TRAF2 triggered a high increase of its activity. Surprisingly, RBCK1, that is reported in lots of studies as a subunit of the LUBAC complex that stabilizes the TRADD-dependent complex and enhances formation of the IKK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), repressed the stimulatory activity of HOXA1 on the NF-κB reporter. In addition, RBCK1 also inhibited the NF-κB reporter activation mediated by TRAF2. This suggests that RBCK1 exerts an epistatic activity toward both HOXA1 and TRAF2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These data therefore support the hypothesis that HOXA1 is implicated in the TNF/NF-κB pathway upstream or at the level of RBCK1. Similar results were obtained upon stimulation of the pathway by TNFα (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) or IL-1β (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

Statistical analysis was carried out (E) with the condition involving the NF-κB reporter alone (NF-κB reporter) as control level, or (A–D; F) using comparisons between groups.

To assess whether TRAF2 is epistatic to HOXA1 in NF-κB signaling, we generated a dominant negative construct of TRAF2 (hereafter called ‘TRAF2-DN’) by removing its N-terminal RING finger domain. This abrogates its NF-κB activation capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Interestingly, TRAF2-DN inhibited the stimulatory effect of HOXA1 on the NF-κB reporter, as well as the activation exerted by TRAF2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Similarly, co-transfection of HOXA1 with vectors coding for sh-RNAs directed against TRAF2 resulted in a decreased ability for HOXA1 to trigger NF-κB activation. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Since HOXA1 is unable to activate NF-κB in the presence of TRAF2-DN or sh-TRAF2, this suggests that HOXA1 acts upstream or at the level of TRAF2 in the signaling cascade.</p><p>Quantification of IL-8 secretion was then performed to deeper characterize the effect of RBCK1 and TRAF2 on the HOXA1-mediated NF-κB activation. As already observed, HOXA1 expression led to increased IL-8 production. Addition of RBCK1, alone or in combination with HOXA1, led to an IL-8 level that was similar to the negative control. Consistent with our observations with the NF-κB reporter, the IL-8 level was greatly increased by TRAF2, whether HOXA1 was co-expressed or not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the influence of RBCK1 and TRAF2 on HOXA1 cellular localization was evaluated by immunofluorescence. In MCF10A cells transfected with HOXA1 only, the protein was exclusively located in the nucleus. Co-transfection of FLAG-HOXA1 and GST-RBCK1 or GST-TRAF2 resulted in both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of HOXA1. In TNFα-treated cells, HOXA1 was also located in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of most cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that HOXA1 is recruited from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic compartment of the cells by RBCK1 and TRAF2 or upon activation of the pathway by TNFα.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Effect of RBCK1, TRAF2 and TNFα on the HOXA1 intracellular localization.

Consistent with the results obtained for the transcriptionally inactive HOXA1<sup>QN-AA</sup> protein mutated in the homeodomain, HOXA1 insertion mutants P14, P15 and P16, showing a disrupted homeodomain, were not affected in their ability to activate the NF-κB reporter. Interestingly, mutants displaying a loss-of-activity on a HOXA1 reporter (P1, P5, P13, P15, P16, P17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) could still activate the NF-κB reporter as efficiently as wild-type HOXA1.

In striking contrast, HOXA1<sup>Δ11His</sup>, deleted for the 11-His repeat, and HOXA1<sup>ΔHD</sup>, devoid of its homeodomain, both lost their ability to activate the NF-κB reporter. However HOXA1<sup>Δ11His</sup> was as active as the wild-type on the HOXA1 reporter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). This therefore demonstrates that HOXA1<sup>Δ11His</sup> has not lost its ability to activate transcription but has lost its capacity to non-transcriptionally modulate the NF-κB pathway. Otherwise, consistent with the known involvement of the homeodomain in DNA binding and activation of transcription, HOXA1<sup>ΔHD</sup> could not activate the HOXA1 reporter. The ability of the HOXA1 deletion mutants to activate the NF-κB pathway was again evaluated by testing their capacity to trigger IL-8 secretion.

Upon co-expression of VN173-HOXA1 and VC155-HOXA1, the Venus protein is reconstituted and becomes fluorescent as HOXA1 can dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). Fluorescence complementation does not occur when unfused VN173 and VC155 are co-expressed. Co-expression of VC155-HOXA1 or VC155-HOXA1 deletion derivatives with unfused VN173 serve as controls for background signal. Co-expression of VC155-HOXA1 or VC155-HOXA1 mutants with VN173-RBCK1 or VN173-TRAF2 reveals that both HOXA1<sup>Δ11His</sup> and HOXA1<sup>ΔHD</sup> interact less efficiently with RBCK1 or TRAF2. This is a representative example of three biologically independent experiments. Although the relative expression levels of the three VC155-HOXA1 fusion proteins were not determined in this experiment, we propose that the comparable expression levels of the three native HOXA1 proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) suggest that also the VC155-HOXA1 fusions are expressed at similar levels.

In contrast, the large range of proteins that HOX transcription factors can be expected to interact with remain scarcely identified. We therefore performed an interactome screen with HOXA1 and significantly ended up with several interactors that are involved in the TNF/NF-κB pathway. In this study, we first demonstrated a highly significant positive correlation between expression of <italic>HOXA1</italic> and of members of the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway in breast tumor public datasets, including extracellular ligands, receptors, signal transducers and adaptor molecules from different converging signaling routes leading to NF-κB activation. Also the NF-κB transcription factor family members and some of their transcriptional target genes were found in this analysis. In addition to the <italic>HOXA1</italic> and TNF/NF-κB correlation in breast tumor datasets, we demonstrated in cell models, (i) that <italic>HOXA1</italic> can activate NF-κB both independently and in synergy with TNFα stimulation, (ii) that HOXA1 activates NF-κB in a specific and non-transcriptional fashion, (iii) that HOXA1 operates upstream of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB, by triggering TAB2 (Ser372), IKKα/β (Ser176/180), IκBα (Ser32) and p65 (Ser536) phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation, (iv) that RBCK1 and TRAF2 influences on the NF-κB response are epistatic to HOXA1 and finally (v) that the 11-His repeat and the homeodomain of HOXA1 are important for the functional interaction between HOXA1 and NF-κB activation as well as for the molecular interaction between HOXA1 and RBCK1 and TRAF2. Finally, we also showed that the HOXA1-mediated cell-proliferation and loss of contact inhibition are abrogated upon NF-κB pathway inhibition. Together our data demonstrate that the HOXA1 transcription factor can fulfill non-transcriptional functions as a stimulator of TNF signaling acting upstream or at the level of both RBCK1 and TRAF2 and leading to NF-κB activation in a context meaningful to breast tumorigenesis.</p><p>This study set out using <italic>in silico</italic> data in the public domain. The consistent over-representation of the NF-κB signaling pathway among the signaling routes correlated to HOXA1 expression, and the highly significant positive correlations between most genes in the NF-κB pathway and HOXA1 expression in breast tumor samples suggests a marked implication of HOXA1 in this pathway in the context of breast cancer pathogenesis. HOXA1 has already been associated to breast cancer development in multiple studies. Its forced expression is sufficient to induce the oncogenic transformation of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells to aggressive <italic>in vivo</italic> carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). HOXA1 can also modulate the p44/42 MAP kinase, STAT3 and STAT5B pathways to mediate the oncogenic transformation of human mammary epithelial cells and regulates <italic>Bcl-2, hTERT</italic> and <italic>c-Myc</italic>, all genes involved in cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). We previously demonstrated that the overexpression of <italic>HOXA1</italic> in MCF7 human mammary epithelial cancer cells enhanced their proliferation, their anchorage-independent growth and their loss of contact inhibition, which are recognized hallmarks of oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). The functional connection we highlighted here between HOXA1 and NF-κB is meaningful in the context of breast oncogenesis. Constitutive activation of NF-κB transcription factors p65 and p50 has been widely reported in breast cancers and has been associated with cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis and chemo-resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). <italic>TRAF2</italic> also has been reported as an oncogene in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The existence of cross-talks between NF-κB and other transcription factors and regulatory molecules is also well established for several kinds of cancers that display NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Therefore, in addition to oncogenic processes and oncogenes which have been shown to be controlled by HOXA1, we suggest here that HOXA1 also activates the NF-κB pathway to promote oncogenesis in mammary epithelial cells.</p><p>As mentioned above, RBCK1 (also known as HOIL-1), together with HOIP and SHARPIN, is a part of the LUBAC complex which stabilizes the TRADD-dependent complex and enhances formation of the IKK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). While investigating the influence of RBCK1 on the positive effect exerted by HOXA1 on NF-κB, we unexpectedly observed that oppositely to what is generally described in the literature RBCK1 has an inhibitory influence on NF-κB activity which was epistatic to both HOXA1 and TRAF2-mediated stimulation. Using over-expression of HOXA1 or TRAF2, we hereby confirm the ability of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RBCK1 to display the inhibitory effect toward NF-κB which has already been suggested by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In that study, it was demonstrated that RBCK1 physically interacts with TAB2/3 to target them to a proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation. We cannot currently report on the mechanism by which HOXA1 interaction with RBCK1, or with TRAF2 regulates NF-κB signaling in our experiments. Possibly, HOXA1 regulates the TRAF2 ubiquitin ligase activity. Further conclusions await studies into the ubiquitin signaling that could be involved.</p><p>The NF-κB and HOXA1 interconnection is reinforced by their functional relationship with <italic>miR-10a. HOXA1</italic> has been reported as a direct downstream target of <italic>mirR-10a</italic>. During megakaryocytic differentiation, <italic>miR-10a</italic> is sharply down-regulated and <italic>HOXA1</italic> is correlatively upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). In the chronic pro-inflammatory state of arterial endothelial cells in atherosclerosis regions, local <italic>miR-10a</italic> expression is lowered whereas HOXA1 expression is up-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). In human aortic endothelial cells, <italic>miR-10a</italic> inhibition causes HOXA1 upregulation both at the mRNA and protein levels. Strikingly, NF-κB-mediated inflammation was also identified as one of the most upregulated biological processes in <italic>miR-10a</italic> knockdown cells. Consistently, phosphorylation of IκB is significantly up-regulated upon <italic>miR-10a</italic> knockdown in human aortic endothelial cells, and this is accompanied by the increased nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers like TNFα and interleukin-8 (IL-8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). This NF-κB, HOXA1 and <italic>miR-10a</italic> relationship is therefore supportive of a possible link between HOXA1 and megakaryocytopoiesis as well as inflammation.</p><p>The HOXA1 sequence shows an intriguing feature in two His repeats. Among homopolymeric tracts, His repeats are relatively rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>) and it has been reported that only 86 human proteins contain stretches of five or more His residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). The physicochemical properties of His make it a versatile amino acid that can fulfill different roles, influencing protein conformation and enzymatic activity. Such His repeats can be found in Zn-finger domains that bind promoter DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). Nevertheless, the function of these His repeats is underexplored. Variations in HOXA1 His repeat length have been reported in cases of autism in the Japanese population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and His deletion variants within the HOXA1 sequence have also been pointed to critically influence the function of the HOXA1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Here we highlighted that the longer His repeat and the homeodomain of HOXA1 are crucial for establishing contacts with RBCK1 and TRAF2 and to activate NF-κB. We demonstrated that the HOXA1 mutants lacking the longest His repeat or the homeodomain are unable to activate NF-κB and to stimulate IL-8 secretion.</p><p>HOXA1 has been reported as a human mammary epithelial oncogene that modulates the STAT and the p44/42 MAP kinase pathways to promote cell survival, proliferation and relieves human mammary cells from contact inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Among the hallmaks of cancer, we focused on the ability of cancer cells to lose contact inhibition that gives rise to focus formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) whereas cell-to-cell contacts formed by normal epithelial cells when they reach confluence operate to suppress further cell proliferation. As the ability to HOXA1 to trigger foci formation in MCF7 cells has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), we here demonstrated that blocking the NF-κB pathway abolishes this foci formation related to HOXA1 expression. As HOXA1 was also reported as increasing the proliferation rate of human breast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), we hereby demonstrated that the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway prevents HOXA1 to enhance proliferation signaling, leading to oncogenic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). NF-κB activation is then crucial for HOXA1-mediated oncogenesis.</p><p>Together, our data are supportive of a model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) in which HOXA1 interacts with TRAF2 to stabilize the TRADD-dependent complex and/or to enhance TRAF2 activity, triggering NF-κB activation. On the other hand, HOXA1 is inhibited by RBCK1 as RBCK1 expression represses HOXA1-induced NF-κB activation. HOXA1 could also inhibit RBCK1 ability to mediate TAB2/3 degradation since the inhibitory input RBCK1 exerts on NF-κB is partially relieved by HOXA1. Thus, HOXA1 and RBCK1 could display reciprocally inhibitory influences. Finally, HOXA1 proteins lacking the 11-His repeat or the homeodomain are unable to activate NF-κB because they cannot bind TRAF2 and cannot inhibit RBCK1. Correlatively, considering that RBCK1 and TRAF2 seem to bind the same determinants of HOXA1, they could compete each other for HOXA1 interaction.</p><fig id="F9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Model for the HOXA1-mediated modulation of the NF-κB pathway. Upon TNF stimulation, TNFα binding to TNFR initiates the recruitment of TRADD that further recruits cIAP1/2, RIPK1, TRAF2 and TRAF5 to form the TRADD-dependent complex. This leads to the docking of TAK1 in complex with TAB2 and TAB3, allowing formation of the IKK complex. The IKK complex phosphorylates IκB, promoting its proteasomal degradation, allowing NF-κB release and finally its nuclear translocation to engage transcriptional programs. On the one hand, HOXA1 enhances TRAF2 activity or stabilizes the TRADD-dependent complex to activate the TNF/NF-κB pathway. On the other hand, RBCK1 inhibits HOXA1 as well as TAB2/3 to repress NF-κB activation. In addition, RBCK1 and TRAF2 can compete with each other to bind either the 11-His repeat or the homeodomain of HOXA1 (not represented).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkw606fig9"></graphic></fig><p>While TNFα or IL-1β exposure can lead to NF-κB activation, it could also activate other signaling routes like the JNK, p38 MAPK, necrosis or apoptosis pathways that share the need of the TRADD-related platform for complete activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). The ability of HOXA1 to interfere with those pathways remains to be further investigated, as well as the possible physical association between HOXA1 and the TRADD-dependent complex.</p></sec>
