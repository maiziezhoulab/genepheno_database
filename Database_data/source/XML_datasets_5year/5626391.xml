<abstract>
<p>Vaccinia-related kinases (VRKs) are multifaceted serine/threonine kinases that play essential roles in various aspects of cell signaling, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and neuronal development and differentiation. However, the neuronal function of <italic>VRK3</italic> is still unknown despite its etiological potential in human autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here, we report that <italic>VRK3</italic>-deficient mice exhibit typical symptoms of autism-like behavior, including hyperactivity, stereotyped behaviors, reduced social interaction, and impaired context-dependent spatial memory. A significant decrease in dendritic spine number and arborization were identified in the hippocampus CA1 of <italic>VRK3</italic>-deficient mice. These mice also exhibited a reduced rectification of AMPA receptor–mediated current and changes in expression of synaptic and signaling proteins, including tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), Arc, and CaMKIIα. Notably, TrkB stimulation with 7,8-dihydroxyflavone reversed the altered synaptic structure and function and successfully restored autism-like behavior in <italic>VRK3</italic>-deficient mice. These results reveal that <italic>VRK3</italic> plays a critical role in neurodevelopmental disorders and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for ASD.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vaccinia-related kinases (VRKs) belong to the casein kinase family, whose catalytic domain shares sequence homology with the vaccinia virus gene B1R. VRKs are multifaceted serine/threonine kinases that play essential roles in many aspects of cell signaling, cell cycle progression, nuclear envelope dynamics, histone modification, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang and Kim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klerkx et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Abnormal VRK functions result in various diseases. Dysregulation of <italic>VRK1</italic> and <italic>VRK2</italic> is reported to cause spinal muscular atrophies and schizophrenia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Renbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sohn et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>VRK3</italic>, one of the VRK subtypes, is highly expressed during development and promotes cell cycle progression by phosphorylating the nuclear envelope protein BAF (barrier to autointegration factor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>VRK3</italic> decreases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity through direct binding to a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase, vaccinia H1-related, which specifically inactivates <italic>ERK</italic> in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang and Kim, 2006</xref>). ERKs are hub kinases that activate various signaling pathways in many types of cells, including neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</xref>). Neuronal ERK signaling is involved in the regulation of synaptic protein synthesis, dendritic morphology, and functional plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas and Huganir, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelleher and Bear, 2008</xref>). Dysregulation of ERK signaling can result in autism spectrum disorder (ASD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faridar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Subramanian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yufune et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, deletion or duplication of chromosomal locus 16p11.2, which includes the <italic>ERK1</italic> gene, is commonly associated with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qureshi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>As a modulator of ERK signaling, <italic>VRK3</italic> is also thought to play a critical role in neuronal function. Amyloid-β oligomers induce a down-regulation of <italic>VRK3</italic>, which could contribute to synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sebollela et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, copy-number variants (CNVs) at the 19q13.33 region, which includes the <italic>VRK3</italic> gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:refseq" xlink:href="NM_016440">NM_016440</ext-link>), are associated with ASD and other intellectual disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). However, the synaptic function of <italic>VRK3</italic> is still unknown, although the role of <italic>VRK3</italic> in synaptic structure and function is critical to understand the etiology of ASD caused by <italic>VRK3</italic> mutations.</p><p>In this study, by generating <italic>VRK3</italic>-deleted mice with a reporter in the <italic>VRK3</italic> intron region, we explored whether <italic>VRK3</italic> deletion causes symptoms similar to those of psychiatric disorders in humans and investigated the mechanisms underlying this effect. We found that <italic>VRK3</italic>-knockout (<italic>VRK3</italic>-KO) mice exhibited autism-like behaviors as well as altered synaptic structure and function. Also, we found that activation of the tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling pathway alleviated these abnormalities in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO animals.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title><italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice exhibit autism-like behavior</title><p>In the present study, we generated <italic>VRK3</italic>-depleted mice (Fig. S1 A). The deletion mutation between exons 7 and 8 was verified using various PCR methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Loss of full-length VRK3 protein was verified by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The gene trap insertion sites on VRK3 protein are shown in Fig. S1 B. We first sought to determine whether <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice displayed unusual social interactions and repetitive behaviors, which are core symptoms of ASD. Both <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO and WT mice had no preference for the right and the left chambers during a habituation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). However, <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice did not show any preference for exploring a novel mouse-containing cage over a novel empty cage in a three-chamber test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). When a novel mouse was placed in the empty cage to assess discrimination between new and familiar mice, <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice showed no significant preference for exploring the novel mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice exhibited longer durations of grooming behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). To explore maternal care on pup behavior, we measured latency for pup retrieval from a scattered nest and found that <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO female mice retrieved pups less efficiently than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). In addition, <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice also performed less efficiently than WT mice in a nesting behavior assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>).

Even chronic 7,8-DHF treatment did not affect the increase in anxiety behavior of <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, C–F</xref>). However, in both a passive avoidance test and a novel object recognition test, chronic treatment with 7,8-DHF successfully reduced the impairment of learning and/or memory in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice (Fig. S5, A and B). These results clearly show that 7,8-DHF treatment ameliorates not only the impaired social interaction but also stereotyped behaviors and impaired learning and memory in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice and thus support the hypothesis that TrkB stimulation could affect autism-like behaviors in <italic>VRK3</italic>-deficient mice.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Recovery of social interaction deficits by acute treatment with 7,8-DHF in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice.</bold> (A and B) Sociability and preference for social novelty at 1 d (test 1) after acute treatment with 7,8-DHF or vehicle; sociability with mouse 1 (blank bar) versus object (filled bar; A: <italic>n</italic> = 7, 8 and 8, 9 for WT and <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice; WT vs. <italic>VRK3</italic> KO <italic>F</italic><sub>1,56</sub> = 49.99, P &lt; 0.0001, interaction <italic>F</italic><sub>3,56</sub> = 3.61, P = 0.0186, two-way ANOVA; ***, P &lt; 0.001; **, P &lt; 0.01; Bonferroni’s post-test) and preference for social novelty with familiar mouse (blank bar) versus novel mouse (filled bar; B: WT vs. <italic>VRK3</italic> KO <italic>F</italic><sub>1,56</sub> = 22.17, P &lt; 0.0001, interaction <italic>F</italic><sub>3,56</sub> = 4.58, P = 0.0069, two-way ANOVA; ***, P &lt; 0.001; **, P &lt; 0.01; *, P &lt; 0.05; Bonferroni’s post-test).

These mice showed an altered expression pattern of synaptic and signaling proteins such as aberrant ERK, Arc, and CaMKIIα. Ultimately, we found that long-term stimulation of TrkB by 7,8-DHF treatment markedly reversed autism-like behavior in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice. Thus, we provide compelling evidence that <italic>VRK3</italic> plays essential roles in synaptic structure and function, which eventually modulate a series of cognitive functions. In addition, our results strongly suggest that <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice represent an animal model of ASD and that TrkB activation can be a possible therapeutic approach to <italic>VRK3</italic>-related ASD.</p><p>A recent study suggests that de novo CNVs are predominant causes of ASD, although the genetic etiology of ∼70% of forms of ASD is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ebert and Greenberg, 2013</xref>). From the DECIPHER database and AutismKB database, we identified CNVs encompassing 19:50086504-52125032 (interval 2.04Mb) and 19:54013696-55502526 (AutismKB database–reported CNV ID AutCNV0000648), respectively, at the 19q13.33 region, which includes the <italic>VRK3</italic> gene, that are associated with ASD and intellectual disability (DECIPHER-reported patient ID 251777; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Haploinsufficiency, wherein a single functional copy of a gene is insufficient to maintain normal function, is a major cause of developmental diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, taking into account that 78.63% and 88.9% of haploinsufficiency reported in the DECIPHER database and UCSC Genome Browser, respectively, are expected mutations or deletions of <italic>VRK3</italic>, we can surmise that <italic>VRK3</italic> deletion may also constitute one cause of ASD. We found that <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO animals show a series of cognitive impairments that are frequently monitored in human ASD patients. <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO animals displayed autism-like behaviors, including hyperactivity, stereotyped behaviors, and reduced social interaction, as well as impaired context-dependent spatial memory. We also found that <italic>VRK3</italic>-heterozygote mice exhibit behaviors similar to those of <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO animals. These findings support a model in which <italic>VRK3</italic> gene haploinsufficiency leads to aberrations in neuronal functioning, resulting in impaired cognitive and behavioral abnormalities.</p><p>Because synaptic dysfunction is an important pathological mechanism in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delorme et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sztainberg and Zoghbi, 2016</xref>), we further characterized the synaptopathy in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO animals. The structural stability of synaptic spine is very important for neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin and Koleske, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caroni et al., 2012</xref>) and is one pathological mechanism in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hullinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). Our results show structural defects of <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice, along with a decrease in spine number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) and dendritic arborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 O</xref>). Electronic microscopy results clearly showed a decreased length and thickness of the PSD structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, L and M</xref>). These results lead us to conclude that the loss of function of <italic>VRK3</italic> results in a synaptic structural defect. The physiological characteristics are largely normal in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO synapses, so we assume two reasons for this defect: (1) relatively weak changes in signaling factors that fail to produce profound functional changes, and (2) compensation mechanisms, possibly from changes in binding partners, another subtype, or down-stream signal transduction. A clearer understanding of the physiological compensation mechanism observed in our VRK3-KO animals requires further study. Interestingly, <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO animals showed decreased rectification of AMPA receptor–mediated postsynaptic currents, which is mediated by altered AMPA receptor composition and a decrease in GluA2-lacking Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anggono and Huganir, 2012</xref>). In fact, the modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors caused by changes in AMPA receptor composition regulates neuronal function, and its perturbation causes neurological disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Zukin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clem and Huganir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Whitehead et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, our results provide an important clue about the relationship between ASD-related behavior and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors, offering a motivation to monitor the changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors in other animal models of ASD-related behavior.</p><p>We previously studied the mechanisms of <italic>VRK3</italic> action and found that <italic>VRK3</italic> is a negative modulator of ERK that affects many signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang and Kim, 2006</xref>). Because ERK has various effects on synaptic proteins as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santos et al., 2010</xref>), the expression of signaling molecules, scaffolding proteins, and receptors in relation to synaptic proteins are likely altered in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice. In our results, ERK phosphorylation in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO animals increased in a much slower and delayed manner compared with WT animals, which showed much faster kinetics of ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). We hypothesized that this was because (1) the basal level of phosphorylated ERK was already increased in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice, and (2) a lower level of TrkB expression in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice caused slow additional activation of ERK. It has been suggested that TrkB signaling is also a critical pathway modulating changes in synaptic strength for cognitive processes such as memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Bohlen und Halbach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Minichiello, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fortin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett and Lagopoulos, 2014</xref>). In our results, it is important to note that the difference between ERK phosphorylation in both WT and <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice was decreased when 7,8-DHF treatment was sustained (e.g., in 4–8 h), despite the different time course/kinetics of the 7,8-DHF effect. The phenotypes in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice are likely mediated by ERK, as <italic>VRK3</italic> interacts with ERK and negatively modulates ERK phosphorylation. Therefore, we hypothesize that changes in signaling factors such as Arc, phosphorylated TrkB, PSD-95, phosphorylated mTOR, and phosphorylated S6K in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice are caused by basally increased ERK activation. We confirmed that the difference in these signaling factors between <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO and WT mice was also reduced when 7,8-DHF treatment was sustained. CaMKIIα is also a major variable in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice and an important modulator of synaptic structure and function. However, we found that 7,8-DHF failed to reverse the increase in phosphorylated CaMKIIα in the PSD fraction of <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice to WT levels, whereas reduced levels of PSD95 and phosphorylated TrkB were significantly restored by 7,8-DHF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). These results lead us to confirm that 7,8-DHF treatment restores the structural and functional phenotypes in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice via an ERK-dependent signaling pathway.</p><p>For an in-depth look at the etiological mechanisms of autism-like behavior in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice, it is important to compare the characteristics of <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice with those of existing ASD animal models. Ube3a knockout is a well-known animal model of Angelman syndrome, and these mice exhibit autism-like behavior. Interestingly, some phenomena we observed in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice are similar to those observed in Ube3A-KO animals (e.g., analogous up-regulation of CaMKIIα and Arc and down-regulation of PSD-95, mTOR, GluA1, and TrkB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weeber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Woerden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ebert and Greenberg, 2013</xref>). An increase in Arc levels in the Ube3a-KO mouse is a phenotype that also appears in the <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mouse. However, Ube3a maternal-deficient mutant animals show a decreased LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weeber et al., 2003</xref>), whereas <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO animals show an intact LTP. In addition, Ube3a-KO animals have normal phosphorylated ERK levels, whereas <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO animals have increased phosphorylated ERK levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, the various characteristics of the ASD animal models make it difficult to define the etiological mechanism of ASD as a single factor/pathway. For example, NMDA receptor activity, the most widely recognized ASD-related factor to date, varies widely among ASD animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Because ERK is one of the downstream signals of NMDA receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomas and Huganir, 2004</xref>), it is also closely related to our <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO study. However, Ube3a-KO animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yashiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaphzan et al., 2012</xref>) and our <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>) commonly have a normal NMDA/AMPA ratio, whereas neurologin-1–KO animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blundell et al., 2010</xref>), Shank2-KO animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Won et al., 2012</xref>), and Shank3-KO animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peça et al., 2011</xref>) show reduced NMDA functioning, including a reduced NMDA/AMPA ratio. Even IRSp53-KO mice with autism-like behavior exhibit increased NMDA functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that the etiology of ASD cannot be elucidated with a single causal factor. For that reason, it may be difficult to treat patients with mutations in Ube3a in the same way as patients with neuroligin-1 mutations, suggesting that appropriate treatment can be provided by accurately assessing the cause of ASD in individual patients. Therefore, we expect that efforts to identify and analyze ASD-related factors such as <italic>VRK3</italic> will become increasingly important in the future.</p><p>Many studies have focused on applying exogenous BDNF to the brainstem preparation and found that it corrected synaptic defects and neuronal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). However, because of the difficulty in central nervous system delivery and the poor bioavailability of BDNF, 7,8-DHF, which imitates BDNF and acts as a robust TrkB agonist, has been proposed as a potential therapeutic tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro application of 7,8-DHF, we have found that acute and chronic TrkB activation by 7,8-DHF has beneficial effects on autism-like behaviors of <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice. Intriguingly, the acute application of 7,8-DHF in adult mice elicited a short-lasting effect, but long-term stimulation of TrkB by 7,8-DHF treatment in younger mice almost completely recovered the impairment of social interaction in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice. In addition, long-term treatment with 7,8-DHF restored stereotyped behaviors and impaired learning and/or memory in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice. It has been widely considered that developmental alterations of neuronal networks may be difficult to restore by pharmacological intervention after the expected onset of symptoms. Therefore, our results demonstrate that long-term stimulation of TrkB before the onset of ASD symptoms is an effective strategy for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Finally, 7,8-DHF treatment failed to significantly affect anxiety in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). The hypothesis that ASD and anxiety are consistently correlated is somewhat controversial, although it is generally assumed that ASD is linked to increased anxiety. For example, like <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice, MeCP2-KO and Cdkl5-KO mice exhibit reduced anxiety with autism-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Our results suggest that autism-like behavior and anxiolytic behavior in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice occur through different mechanisms.</p><p>Collectively, the key finding of the current study is that <italic>VRK3</italic> deletion can cause down-regulation of TrkB and evoke abnormal spine and PSD structure and synaptic dysfunction, which lead to cognitive impairment and ASD-related behaviors that are caused by chromosomal abnormalities. We have also found that chronic TrkB activation by 7,8-DHF treatment rescues impaired social interaction and learning/memory in <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice, which supports the hypothesis that TrkB stimulation could ameliorate autism-like behavior in <italic>VRK3</italic>-deficient mice. Our work is the first to validate that reduced <italic>VRK3</italic> expression affects synaptic and cognitive function and suggests that TrkB stimulation is a possible pharmacotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of <italic>VRK3</italic>-related ASD.</p></sec><sec id="s12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s13"><title>Generation of <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice</title><p>The gene-trapped embryonic stem cell line YTA189 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:3880442">http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:3880442</ext-link>) was obtained from BayGenomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stryke et al., 2003</xref>).

After 24 h, during the test phase, one object was replaced with a novel object that was of similar size but different shape and color. Then, the mouse was placed in the center and allowed to explore the arena and the two objects. Mouse movements were tracked and recorded by real-time video-tracking computer software Smart Version 2.5 (Panlab) linked to an overhead video camera. The time spent in each chamber and exploratory activity around the objects (2.5-cm zone around the objects) was recorded by real-time video-tracking computer software Smart Version 3.0 (Panlab) and video recording system (DT acquire software/Ancamcorder 3.3.4; Antools) and analyzed by two human observers blinded to genotype and not related to this experiment. All data are shown as mean ± SEM and analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Barnes circular maze</title><p>The test was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2012</xref>), with minor modifications. The Barnes circular maze consisted of a circular planar white Plexiglas platform (92-cm diameter) elevated 1 m from the floor with 20 evenly spaced holes (7-cm diameter) located 5 cm from the perimeter. A black escape box (15 × 7 × 7 cm) was placed under one hole. Spatial cues with distinct patterns and shapes were placed on the wall of the testing room. A 500-lux light was turned on during the trial. An experimenter was positioned in the same place with minimal movements throughout the trials. The platform and escape box were cleaned thoroughly with 70% ethanol and paper towels between each trial to remove olfactory cues. 1 d before the training trials began, test mice were habituated in the target box for 3 min. The training trials were repeated for four consecutive days, and three trials were performed each day with 20-min intertrial intervals. At the beginning of each trial, a mouse was placed in the cylindrical holding chamber (10-cm diameter) located in the center of the maze. After 10 s of holding time, the mouse was allowed to search for the target hole for 3 min. If the mouse failed to find the target hole in 3 min, it was gently guided into the target hole by the experimenter’s hands. When the mouse entered the escape box, the light was turned off, and the mouse remained undisturbed for 1 min. During training, the movement of the mouse was recorded and the number of errors and latency to find the target hole was measured by real-time video-tracking computer software Smart Version 2.5 linked to an overhead video camera. On days 5 and 12, a probe trial was performed. The escape box was removed during the probe trials, and the mouse was allowed 90 s to find the target hole. During the probe trial, total distance moved and latency to find the target hole were measured. The percentages of correct pokes and time in the target area were also analyzed by real-time video-tracking computer software (Smart Version 2.5). All data are shown as mean ± SEM and analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Stereotyped behavior</title><p>The time mice spent grooming during a 10-min open field test period was measured. Grooming behavior was defined as scratching or stroking of the face, head, or body with the two forelimbs or licking body parts. The observer was blind to mouse genotype.

The three-chamber apparatus was a transparent Plexiglas box (60 W × 45 D × 40 H cm<sup>3</sup>) with two transparent partitions dividing left, center, and right chambers (20 × 45 cm). Each partition had a square opening (10 × 10 cm) in the bottom center. A cylindrical wire cage (8.5-cm diameter) was used as an inanimate object. A cylindrical bottle filled with water was placed on the top of the wire cup to prevent the mouse from climbing to the top of the cup. The three-chamber unit and wire cups were cleaned with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels between each trial. The three-chamber test consisted of three phases. In the first phase, for habituation, a test mouse was placed in the center of the three-chamber unit and allowed to explore the environment for 10 min. After habituation, an age- and gender-matched same strain mouse that had never been exposed to the test mouse (M1) was placed in one of the two wire cages. The empty wire cage as an inanimate object (O) cue was placed on the other side. Then, the test mouse was placed in the center and allowed to freely explore the chamber for 10 min. In the third phase, a second age- and gender-matched C57BL/6J mouse (M2) that had never been exposed to the test mouse was placed in the previously empty wire cage. Thus, the test mouse would have the choice between a mouse that was already familiar (M1) and a novel mouse (M2). The test mouse was placed in the center and allowed to freely explore the chamber for 10 min. Exploration was defined as each instance in which the test mouse sniffed the empty cage/mouse or oriented its nose toward and came close to the object/stranger. The movement of the mouse was tracked and recorded by real-time video-tracking computer software (Smart Version 2.5) linked to an overhead video camera. Time spent in each chamber and in a circular area (5-cm radius) around each wire cage was analyzed by real-time video-tracking computer software (Smart Version 2.5). All data are shown as mean ± SEM and analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Pup retrieval</title><p>Virgin female mice were isolated for 4 d before the pup retrieval test. Three pups (1–3 days old; C57BL/6) were placed in three different corners of the home cage of the mouse. Mice were allowed to retrieve the pups for 10 min. If mice did not complete retrieval within 10 min, the test was terminated. The movement of mice was observed via an overhead video camera linked to a monitor with Smart Version 2.5.

The open field test was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chao et al., 2010</xref>). In brief, mice were placed in a wooden box (60 W × 40 D × 20 H cm<sup>3</sup>), and mouse movements were recorded and analyzed by real-time video-tracking computer software (Smart Version 2.5) linked to an overhead video camera. The total distance traveled and time spent in the center (20 × 20–cm imaginary square) were measured for 10 min. The open field arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels after each trial.

It consisted of two closed arms surrounded by 30-cm-high opaque walls and two open arms (110 × 110 cm). Each mouse was placed in the center (5 × 5 cm) of the maze facing one of the closed arms and allowed to explore the space for 15 min. The movement of mice was tracked and recorded via an overhead video camera and further analyzed by real-time video-tracking computer software (Smart Version 2.5). Time spent in the closed arms, center, and open arms was measured. The maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels between each trial. All data are shown as mean ± SEM and analyzed using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> tests.</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>Light–dark exploration</title><p>The light–dark test is based on the natural conflict of mice between an innate aversion to brightly illuminated areas and the desire to explore a novel environment. The apparatus consisted of a light compartment made of white plastic (20 × 20 × 20 cm<sup>3</sup>) and a dark compartment made of black plastic (20 × 20 × 20 cm<sup>3</sup>). The light and dark compartments were separated by a partition with a tunnel (13× 7.5 × 13.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) to allow passage from one compartment to the other. The light compartment was brightly illuminated with a light intensity of 400 lux, and the dark compartment was black-walled and covered at the top with black Plexiglas. At the beginning of the test, a mouse was placed in the center of the light compartment facing the tunnel, and the door of the tunnel opened 3 s later. The mouse was then allowed to freely explore the entire apparatus for 10 min. The movement of mice was tracked and recorded by real-time video-tracking computer software (Smart Version 2.5) linked to an overhead video camera. The total duration in the light box was measured. The apparatus was thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol after each trial. All data are shown as mean ± SEM and analyzed using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> tests.</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>Golgi–Cox staining</title><p>At 13 wk of age, 16 mice (<italic>n</italic> = 8 per group) were perfused first with phosphate-buffered saline and then with 4% paraformaldehyde. For Golgi staining, we used the FD Rapid Golgi staining kit (FD Neuro Technologies) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Coronal brain slices were prepared with a vibratome (Leica) at a thickness of 100 µm and mounted on gelatin-coated microscope slides. Images of dorsal hippocampal regions were taken with an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope and analyzed in a blinded manner using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). At least three neurons per animal (pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region and granule cells in the DG) were selected for quantification. Spine length and density were analyzed in &gt;10-µm segments of secondary and third apical dendrite images or primary and secondary basal dendrite images obtained from each dendrite image within a single focal plane at 63× magnification. For apical dendrites, 10-µm segments 100–150 µm from the cell soma were randomly selected and assessed. For basal dendrites, spines were also scored along 10-µm segments located 50 to 100 µm from the soma. The types of spines were divided into four categories (thin, mushroom, stubby, and branched) based on the approximate measurements according to previously described criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris et al., 1992</xref>). In brief, types of spines were defined as follows: thin (the length was greater than the neck diameter, and the diameters of the head and neck were similar), mushroom (diameter of the head was much greater than the diameter of the neck), stubby (the diameter of the neck was similar to the total length of the spine), and branched (it has more than one head). The dendritic branching patterns were analyzed using Sholl’s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sholl, 1953</xref>). 40× magnification images (Z-stack with 1-µm intervals) of pyramidal neurons in dorsal CA1 were captured, and each neuron was reconstructed using Adobe Photoshop CS6 and Image J (National Institutes of Health).

Synaptic responses recorded by ACSF-filled microelectrodes (1–3 MΩ) were quantified by the initial slope of the fEPSP. Recordings were performed using an AM-1800 microelectrode amplifier (A-M Systems), PG 4000A stimulator (Cygnus Technology), and SIU-90 isolated current source (Cygnus Technology). Baseline responses were collected at 0.07 Hz with a stimulation intensity that yielded a 40–60% maximal response. NMDA receptor–dependent LTP was induced by four episodes of theta-burst stimulation at 10-s intervals. Theta-burst stimulation consisted of 10 stimulus trains delivered at 5 Hz; each train consisted of four pulses at 100 Hz. NMDA receptor–dependent LTD was induced by single-pulse low-frequency stimulation consisting of 900 pulses at 1 Hz for 900 s. Group I mGluR-dependent LTD was induced by a 10-min bath application of 100 µM (R,S)-3,5-DHPG (Tocris Bioscience). Data from slices with stable recordings (&lt;5% change over the baseline period) were included in the analysis. All data are presented as mean ± SEM normalized to the preconditioning baseline (at least 20 min of stable responses). The experimenters were blind to mouse genotype.

Slices were equilibrated for 5 min before recordings. All recordings were performed in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, which were identified by their size and morphology. Patch pipettes (4–6 MΩ) were filled with 130 mM Cs-MeSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM TEA-Cl, 8 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM QX-314, 4 mM ATP-Mg, 0.4 mM GTP-Na, 10 mM phosphocreatine-Na2, and 0.1 mM Spermine (for the mEPSC, sEPSC, and evoked EPSC experiments), 130 mM CsCl, 1.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM ATP-Na (for mIPSC and sIPSC experiments), 145 mM K-gluconate, 5 NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 0.2 EGTA, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 ATP-Mg, and 0.1 GTP-Na (for excitability experiments) at a pH of 7.4 and 280–290 mOsm. The extracellular recording solution consisted of ACSF supplemented with 100 µM picrotoxin, 1 µM TTX, and 50 µM DL-AP5 for mEPSC experiments; 100 µM picrotoxin for the sEPSC and evoked EPSC experiment; 1 µM TTX, 20 µM CNQX, and 50 µM DL-AP5 for the mIPSC experiment; and 20 µM CNQX and 50 µM DL-AP5 for the sIPSC experiment. Neuronal excitability was measured by injecting step depolarizing currents for 500 ms. All evoked EPSCs were elicited by SC stimulation (0.1-ms current pulses) at 0.07 Hz using a concentric bipolar electrode placed 200–300 µm in front of postsynaptic pyramidal cells, and these experiments were conducted in external solution containing elevated divalent cations (4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) to reduce network excitability and prevent polysynaptic responses upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clem and Huganir, 2010</xref>). For the experiments testing paired-pulse responses, the AMPA/NMDA ratio, and the current–voltage relationship of AMPA receptors, we evoked EPSCs by applying stimulations at half-maximal intensity (80–100 pA). The paired-pulse responses were obtained by two closely separated stimulations at 50-ms interstimulus intervals. The paired pulse ratio was depicted by the amplitude ratio of second EPSP/first EPSP. For AMPA/NMDA ratio experiments, CA1 pyramidal neurons were initially held at −70 mV, and 10 AMPA receptor–mediated EPSCs were evoked. After recording AMPA receptor–mediated EPSCs, 20 µM CNQX was added to the ACSF, and the holding potential was changed to +40 mV to record NMDA receptor–mediated EPSCs. The AMPA/NMDA ratio was calculated by dividing the mean value of 10 AMPA receptor–mediated EPSC peak amplitudes by the mean value of 10 NMDA receptor-mediated EPSC peak amplitudes. To verify the current-voltage relationship of AMPA receptors in hippocampal SC-CA1 synapses in WT or <italic>VRK3</italic>-KO mice, recordings were made with 50 µM of the NMDA receptor antagonist DL-AP5 in the external solution. EPSCs were evoked at multiple holding potentials (−70, −60, −40, −20, 0, +20, and +40 mV).
