<abstract>
<p>Chronic neuropathic pain is associated with anxiety- and depressive-like disorders. Its treatment remains a serious clinical problem due to the lack of efficacy of the available therapeutic modalities. We investigated if the activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 could modulate the nociceptive and emotional disorders associated with persistent neuropathic pain and potentiated the analgesic activity of morphine. The possible mechanisms implicated in these effects have been also evaluated. Therefore, in C57BL/6 mice with neuropathic pain induced by the chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve (CCI), we assessed the antinociceptive, anxiolytic, and anti-depressant effects of the repeated intraperitoneal administration of a Nrf2 inducer, sulforaphane (SFN), and the effects of this treatment on the local antinociceptive actions of morphine. The protein levels of Nrf2, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), CD11b/c (a microglial activator marker), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and μ opioid receptors (MOR) in the spinal cord, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from mice, at 28 days after CCI, were also evaluated. Our results showed that the repeated administration of SFN besides inhibiting nociceptive responses induced by sciatic nerve injury also diminished the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with persistent neuropathic pain. Moreover, SFN treatment normalized oxidative stress by inducing Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, reduced microglial activation and JNK, ERK1/2, p-38 phosphorylation induced by sciatic nerve injury in the spinal cord and/or hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, treatment with SFN also potentiated the antiallodynic effects of morphine in sciatic nerve-injured mice by regularizing the down regulation of MOR in the spinal cord and/or hippocampus. This study suggested that treatment with SFN might be an interesting approach for the management of persistent neuropathic pain and comorbidities associated as well as to improve the analgesic actions of morphine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic pain, especially neuropathic, significantly alters human living conditions. That is, patients with neuropathic pain experience emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression that produce a significant deterioration in their quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Maletic and Raison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Attal et al., 2011</xref>). Therapies to treat neuropathic pain and associated comorbidities are limited with modest efficacy and significant side effects. Therefore, the investigation of new strategies to effectively relieve neuropathic pain and the emotional disorders associated is indispensable.</p>
<p>It is well known that the transcription factor Nrf2 coordinates the redox state in the cell and its activation serves as a barrier against the reactive species of oxygen through the activation of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1), glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzymes, etc…(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">de Vries et al., 2008</xref>). The transcription factor Nrf2 also modulates inflammatory responses of the organism by inhibiting the synthesis of various proinflammatory mediators, such as the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-6, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Davidson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, diverse studies revealed that the stimulation of Nrf2 reduced acute and inflammatory pain as well as neuropathic pain accompanying to diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Negi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Di et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">McDonnell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Redondo et al., 2017</xref>), but the potential inhibitory role played by this transcription factor on the allodynia and hyperalgesia caused by nerve injury-induced persistent neuropathic pain has not been evaluated.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated the anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects induced by Nrf2 in several stress paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) and in different animal models of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the fact that mice with the Nrf2 gene silenced by pharmacological or genetic tools exhibited greater anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors sustained the anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties induced by Nrf2 activation in different experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Muramatsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Khalifeh et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, the effects of the repetitive treatment with sulforaphane (SFN), a Nrf2 inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">de Figueiredo et al., 2015</xref>), in the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with chronic pain have not yet studied. Our objective was to evaluate if the activation of Nrf2 besides reducing nociception might also inhibited the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with persistent neuropathic pain and normalized oxidative stress and microglial activation induced by sciatic nerve injury.</p>
<p>Sulforaphane is an isothiocyanate bioactive metabolite derived from glucoraphanin which is abundantly found in cruciferous vegetables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Dinkova-Kostova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Fahey et al., 2017</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated the potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, antibiotic, as well as the protective effects of SFN for cognitive and memory impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Guerrero-Beltran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Catanzaro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Pu et al., 2018</xref>). SFN has been also proven in humans demonstrating that this treatment improves the glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Axelsson et al., 2017</xref>), has beneficial clinical effects against autism disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Singh et al., 2014</xref>) and gastrointestinal diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Yanaka, 2018</xref>). Recent studies also showed the analgesic properties of SFN in several animal pain models and its capacity to potentiate the antinociceptive effects of opioids in animals with inflammatory pain or diabetic neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">McDonnell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Redondo et al., 2017</xref>). Taking account the lower efficacy of opioids, particularly μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists in the management of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hervera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Zychowska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Popiolek-Barczyk and Mika, 2016</xref>), the investigation of new tools for increasing their analgesic efficacy is a priority in the current pain research. In this study we evaluated the possible potentiation of the analgesic actions of morphine triggered by SFN in animals with persistent neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Then, in a neuropathic pain model induced by the chronic constriction of sciatic nerve (CCI) in mice, at 28 days after surgery, our aims were to assess the effects of treatment with SFN on: (1) the allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by CCI; (2) the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with persistent neuropathic pain; (3) the local antinociceptive effects of morphine during neuropathic pain and (4) the expression of Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 signaling pathway, microglial activation, MAPK phosphorylation and MOR protein levels in the spinal cord, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from animals with persistent neuropathic pain.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec>
<title>Animals</title>
<p>The experiments were carried out with male C57BL/6J mice purchased from Envigo Laboratories (Barcelona, Spain). Mice weighing 21–25 g were housed under standard 12/12-h light/dark conditions in a room with a controlled temperature of 22°C and relative humidity of 66%. The animals had free access to food and drink and were used after 6 days of acclimatization to the environmental conditions mentioned. All experiments were conducted between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., and executed in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the local Committee of Animal Use and Care of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. All efforts were made to diminish the suffering and amount of animals used in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Induction of Neuropathic Pain</title>
<p>Neuropathic pain was induced by CCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hervera et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, sciatic nerve ligation was performed under isoflurane anesthesia (3% induction, 2% maintenance). The biceps femoris and the gluteus superficialis were separated by blunt dissection, and the right sciatic nerve was exposed. The injury was produced by tying three ligatures around the sciatic nerve as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bennett and Xie (1988)</xref>. The ligatures (4/0 silk) were tied loosely around the nerve with 1 mm spacing, until they elicited a brief twitch in the respective hindlimb, which prevented overtightening of the ligations, taking care to preserve epineural circulation. In these experiments Sham-operated mice, whose surgery was exactly the same as described above without sciatic nerve ligament, were used as control animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Experimental Protocol</title>
<p>In a first set of experiments, we investigated the mechanical antiallodynic, thermal antihyperalgesic and thermal antiallodynic effects of the intraperitoneal daily administration of 10 mg/kg SFN in sciatic nerve-injured or Sham-operated mice from days 14 to 28 after surgery (<italic>n</italic> = 6 animals per group). The evaluation of the antinociceptive effect was carried out on days 14, 18, 21, 25, and 28 post-surgery, at 3 h after SFN or vehicle injection.</p>
<p>In other group of animals, we evaluated the effects of treatment with SFN, also administered at 10 mg/kg during 15 consecutive days (from days 14 to 28 post-surgery), on the anxiety- and depressive-like responses associated with persistent neuropathic pain, 28 days after surgery, using the EPM test and TST, respectively (<italic>n</italic> = 8 animals per group).</p>
<p>In other experiments, the evaluation of the effects produced by the intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg of SFN combined with 50 μg of morphine, subplantarly administered, on the allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by CCI was carried out at 3 h after SFN administration (<italic>n</italic> = 6 animals per group). The doses of SFN and morphine were selected in accordance to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Redondo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Wang and Wang, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, at day 15 of treatment with SFN or vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide 1% in 0.9% saline solution), sciatic nerve-injured and Sham-operated mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and the Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, CD11b/c, MAPK, and MOR levels in the ipsilateral site of the spinal cord, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were evaluated. In these experiments, Sham-operated mice treated with vehicle were used as controls (<italic>n</italic> = 4 samples per group).</p>
<p>The number of animals per group was determined from a pilot study taking into account a value of α = 0.05 and β = 0.20 (power analysis of 0.80). In this work we used 60 animals in total.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Nociceptive Behavioral Tests</title>
<sec>
<title>Mechanical Allodynia</title>
<p>Mechanical allodynia was quantified by measuring the hind paw withdrawal response to von Frey filament stimulation. Animals were placed in methacrylate cylinders (20 cm high × 9 cm diameter) with a wire grid bottom through which the von Frey filaments (North Coast Medical, Inc., San Jose, CA, United States), with a bending force in the range of 0.008–3.5 g, were applied by using a modified version of the up–down paradigm, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chaplan et al. (1994)</xref>. The filament of 0.4 g was used first and the 3.0 g filament was used as a cut-off and the strength of the next filament was reduced or increased according to the response. The threshold of response was calculated from the sequence of filament strength used during the up-down procedure by using an Excel program (Microsoft Iberia SRL, Barcelona, Spain) that includes curve fitting of the data. Both ipsilateral and contralateral hind paws were tested. Animals were allowed to habituate for 1 h prior to testing to allow appropriate behavioral immobility.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Thermal Hyperalgesia</title>
<p>Thermal hyperalgesia was evaluated as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hargreaves et al. (1988)</xref>. Latency of paw withdrawal in response to radiant heat was measured using the plantar test apparatus (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy). In summary, mice were placed in methyl acrylate cylinders (20 cm high × 9 cm diameter) positioned on a glass surface. The heat source was positioned under the plantar surface of the hind paw and activated with a light beam intensity. A cut-off time of 12 s was used to avoid tissue damage in the absence of response. Mean paw withdrawal latencies (from both hind paws) were determined from the average of three separate trials, taken at 5 min intervals to avoid thermal sensitization and behavioral alterations. Mice were habituated to the environment for 1 h prior to the experiment so that the animals were quiet at the time of testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Thermal Allodynia</title>
<p>Thermal allodynia to cold stimulus was evaluated using the hot/cold plate analgesia meter (Ugo Basile) previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bennett and Xie (1988)</xref>. The number of elevations of each hind paw from mice exposed to the cold plate (4 ± 0.5°C) was recorded for 5 min.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Anxiety-Like Behavior</title>
<p>The anxiety-like behavior was measured by using the elevated plus maze (EPM) test such as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Walf and Frye (2007)</xref>. An apparatus with 4 arms of 5 cm wide and 35 cm long, two of which are open and two closed with walls of 15 cm high. The distance of the EPM to the ground is 45 cm. The animal was placed in the central square of maze facing one of the open arms and its behavior was recorded by a digital camera for 5 min. The number of entries in the open and closed arms, as well as the percentage of time spent in the open arms was calculated for each animal.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Depressive-Like Behavior</title>
<p>The evaluation of the depressive-like behavior was performed by using the tail suspension test (TST), in which the total duration of immobility of the animals was quantified according to the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Steru et al. (1985)</xref> with some modifications. Briefly, mice were individually suspended by the tail from a horizontal wooden bar (35 cm above the floor) using an adhesive tape (1 cm from the tip of the tail). The immobility time in seconds was recorded over a total period of 6 min.</p>
<p>All the behavioral experiments were performed by an experimenter blinded to the treatment applied.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Sham-operated and sciatic nerve-injured mice were killed at 28 days after surgery by cervical dislocation and tissues from the ipsilateral side lumbar section of the spinal cord, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were extracted immediately after killing, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Samples from two to three animals were collected in an experimental sample to obtain enough protein levels for doing western blot analysis of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, CD11b/c, MAPK (JNK, ERK1/2, and P38) and MOR. Tissues were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris⋅Base, 150 nM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM NaF, 0.5% protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail). All reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) excluding NP-40 which was acquired from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). The crude homogenate was solubilized for 1 h at 4° C, sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at 700 g.</p>
<p>Then, 60 μg of total proteins were mixed with 4 × laemmli loading buffer and loaded onto 4% stacking/10% separation sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membrane for 120 min, blocked with PBS or TBST + 5% non-fat dry milk or BSA and successively incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti Nrf2 (1:160, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), HO-1 (1:300, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), NQO1 (1:333, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States), CD11b/c (1:200, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, United States), phospho JNK, total JNK, phospho ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, phospho P38 and total P38 (1:250, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, United States), MOR (1:333, Merck, Billerica, MA, United States) or GAPDH antibody (1:5000, Merck, Billerica, MA, United States) which was used as a loading control. Proteins were detected by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and visualized with chemiluminescent reagents (ECL kit; GE Healthcare) and by exposure to hyperfilm (GE Healthcare). The intensity of blots was quantified by densitometry.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Drugs</title>
<p>Sulforaphane was acquired from Merck Chemicals and Life Science S.A.U. (Madrid, Spain), dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (1% in 0.9% saline solution) and intraperitoneally administered at 10 mg/kg, in a final volume of 10 ml/kg, 3 h before testing. Morphine hydrochloride was purchased from Alcaiber S.A. (Madrid, Spain), dissolved in 0.9% saline solution and administered via subplantar, in a final volume of 30 μl, at 30 min before conducting the behavioral tests. All drugs were prepared daily prior to its administration. For each group treated with a drug, the respective control group received the same volume of the corresponding vehicle.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS program (version 17 for Windows, IBM, Madrid, Spain). The effects of chronic treatment with SFN on the mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia and thermal allodynia induced by CCI were evaluated using the three way analysis of variance (ANOVA) repeated measures followed by a one way ANOVA and the Student–Newman–Keuls test, when appropriate. The antinociceptive effects produced by the combination of SFN plus morphine were assessed by using a one way ANOVA followed by the Student–Newman–Keuls test.</p>
<p>The effects of chronic administration with SFN on the anxiety-like behavior identified by the number of open arm entries, the percentage of time of stay in them and the number of closed arm entries obtained in EPM as well as on the depressive-like behavior defined by the immobility time in TST, in Sham and animals with neuropathic pain, were evaluated by using a two way ANOVA followed by a one way ANOVA and the Student–Newman–Keuls test.</p>
<p>Antinociception in the von Frey filaments and plantar tests is expressed as the percentage of maximal possible effect, where the test latencies predrug (baseline) and postdrug administration are compared and calculated in accordance with the following equation:</p>

<title>Effects of SFN on the Mechanical Allodynia, Thermal Hyperalgesia and Thermal Allodynia Induced by Sciatic Nerve Injury in Mice</title>
<p>For mechanical allodynia, the three way ANOVA repeated measures indicated significant effects of surgery, treatment and time (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.022), an interaction of treatment with time (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.007), surgery with treatment (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and among surgery, treatment and time (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.006). Indeed, nerve injury reduced the threshold of paw withdrawal to a mechanical stimulus from days 13 to 28 after surgery as compared to Sham-operated mice treated with vehicle (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, one way ANOVA) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This mechanical allodynia was progressively reduced from 1 to 12 days of SFN administration (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; one way ANOVA vs. CCI-vehicle treated mice) and completely inhibited at 15 days of treatment. In contrast, SFN did not produce any effect in Sham-operated mice for the total duration of the experiment.</p>

<p>Sciatic nerve injury also significantly decreased threshold for evoking paw withdrawal to a thermal stimulus from days 13 to 28 after surgery (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; one way ANOVA vs. Sham-operated mice) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

<title>Effects of Chronic Administration With SFN on the Anxiety- and Depressive-Liked Behaviors Associated With Persistent Neuropathic Pain in Mice</title>
<p>Anxiety-like behavior was observed in sciatic nerve-injured animals at day 28 post-CCI. The two way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of the surgery ant treatment on the number of entries and on the percentage of time of animals spent in open arms (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). That is, the EPM test showed a significant decrease in the number of entries into open arms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) and a reduced percentage of the time spent in these arms in sciatic nerve-injured mice treated with vehicle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; one way ANOVA; as compared to Sham-operated mice treated with vehicle). No differences in the number of entries to the closed arms were observed between sciatic nerve-injured and Sham-operated mice treated with SFN or vehicle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Chronic treatment with SFN inhibited this anxiety-like behavior by normalizing the decreased number of entries into open arms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; ANOVA) and the reduced time spent in open arms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, ANOVA) observed in CCI vehicle treated mice, without altering the number of entries to the closed arms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In Sham-operated mice, SFN also had an anxiolytic effect as demonstrated by an increase in the number of entries (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and the time spent in open arms as compared to Sham-operated vehicle treated mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, ANOVA).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that SFN besides inhibiting nociceptive responses induced by sciatic nerve injury also diminished the anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with persistent neuropathic pain, at 28 days after surgery. Moreover, the normalization of oxidative stress, microglial activation and/or MAPK phosphorylation produced by SFN in the spinal cord, hippocampus and/or prefrontal cortex of sciatic nerve-injured mice might explain the analgesic, anxiolytic, and anti-depressant actions of this treatment. In addition, treatment with SFN also potentiated the antiallodynic effects of morphine by normalizing the down regulation of MOR in the spinal cord and/or hippocampus from sciatic nerve-injured mice.</p>
<p>Our results showed that the mechanical and thermal allodynia as well as the thermal hyperalgesia caused by sciatic nerve injury, at 28 days after induction, were inhibited by the repetitive administration of SFN from day 14 to 28 after sciatic nerve injury in mice. These results are supported by the antinociceptive effects produced by SFN in the early stages of neuropathic pain, from days 7 to 14 after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Wang and Wang, 2017</xref>) as well as during inflammatory pain or diabetic neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">McDonnell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Redondo et al., 2017</xref>), and additionally demonstrated the analgesic properties of this Nrf2 inductor in advance stages of neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>It is well known that Nrf2 transcription factor is a regulator of two important cytoprotective pathways: anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory in the peripheral and central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>). In order to study the possible mechanisms involved in the antinociceptive actions induced by SFN in animals with persistent neuropathic pain, we evaluated the effects of this treatment on the expression of Nrf2, the antioxidant enzymes (HO-1 and NQO1) as well as on the protein levels of CD11b/c (a microglial marker) in the spinal cord from animals with persistent neuropathic pain. In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Riego et al. (2018)</xref>, peripheral nerve injury provoked prevailing oxidative stress conditions in the spinal cord as demonstrated by the decreased expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in this tissue. Interestingly, treatment with SFN reduced oxidative stress by normalizing the decreased expression of Nrf2 and HO-1. In accordance to these data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Riego et al. (2018)</xref> also demonstrated that treatment with an HO-1 inducer, cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP), was able to compensate for the reduced synthesis of HO-1 induced by neuropathic pain in this tissue. Taking account that HO-1 is downstream of Nrf2 and its induction in the spinal cord exerts potent antinociceptive effects during chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), it is suitable to propose that the antinociceptive effects induced by SFN during persistent neuropathic pain were principally associated with the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the protein levels of NQO1 were not altered by either nerve injury or SFN treatment in animals with neuropathic pain. This is in contrast to that happens during inflammatory pain or diabetic neuropathy, where SFN increased the expression of NQO1 or re-established its down-regulation in the spinal cord or sciatic nerve, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">McDonnell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Redondo et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, suggesting that this enzyme is not implicated in the antinociceptive effects of SFN in sciatic nerve injury induced neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>It is well known that microglial activation promotes the consolidation and progression of neuropathic pain state by the up-regulation of several inflammatory mediators, such as the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), COX-2, interleukins, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Popiolek-Barczyk and Mika, 2016</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that spinal microglial activation induced by nerve injury, at 28 days after surgery, was inhibited by SFN indicating that, in addition to the antioxidative effects performed by this treatment, it also exerted anti-inflammatory effects in this tissue contributing all of them to the inhibition of neuropathic pain. In agreement with our results, other previous studies also demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of SFN in chronic pain that were produced by inhibiting of NOS2 and COX-2 expression in sciatic nerves from nerve-injured mice or diabetic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Negi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Wang and Wang, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>It is well recognized that MAPK, such as JNK, ERK ½ and p38, are involved in pain sensitization after nerve injury. Moreover, while their phosphorylation participated in the maintenance of pain hypersensitivity, its inhibition attenuated chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Ji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Edelmayer et al., 2014</xref>). The fact that SFN inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK ½ and p38 in the spinal cord of sciatic nerve-injured mice showed that the inhibition of MAPK might be also involved in the anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects of this treatment during persistent neuropathic pain. In according to these data, this signaling pathway was also involved in the analgesic effects of SFN during inflammatory pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Redondo et al., 2017</xref>). In summary, the modulation of persistent sciatic nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain with the repeated administration of SFN might be explained by the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and the inhibition of microglial activation and MAPK phosphorylation induced by this treatment in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>In accordance with other preclinical pain models, our data verified that neuropathic pain induced by CCI, at 28 days after surgery, was associated with anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Jesse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Alba-Delgado et al., 2016</xref>). That is, while anxiety-like response was demonstrated by the reduced number of entries and time spent into open arms in the EPM test, the depressive-like behavior was confirmed by the increased immobility time in the TST. These results are in agreement with the clinical data showing a relationship among chronic pain and emotional disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Micó et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>More interesting is the finding that SFN treatment inhibited the anxiety-like behavior associated with persistent neuropathic pain, as demonstrated by the increased number of entries and the percentage of time spent in open arms in the EPM test observed in SFN treated mice. In addition, the fact that the number of entries into closed arms was not affected by SFN excluded the possibility that its anxiolytic effects might be result from alterations of mice locomotor activity. Our results supported the demonstrated anxiolytic effects produced by SFN in several stress models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Muramatsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) and further revealed, for first time, the anxiolytic action of this compound in the anxiety-like behavior accompanying to chronic neuropathic pain. Moreover, the anxiolytic effects induced by SFN in Sham-operated mice evaluated in the EPM test confirmed its anxiolytic effects measured in the open field test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data further revealed, for the first time, the anti-depressant effects induced by the repeated administration of SFN in animals with depressive-like behavior associated with neuropathic pain, as demonstrated by the decreased immobility time in the TST. These data are in agreement with the anti-depressant activities induced by some Nrf2 activators in several animal models of depression as well as to the depressive phenotype manifested in Nrf2 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Yao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the anti-depressant effects induced by SFN in our Sham-operated mice assessed in the TST confirmed the anti-depressant capacity of this treatment previously demonstrated in the forced swimming test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). It’s important to mention that in contrast to the effects produced by several typical antidepressants, such as pregabalin that inhibited the anxiety-like behavior, but not the depressive-like response associated with neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">La Porta et al., 2016</xref>), the repeated administration of SFN induced both anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects in animals with neuropathic pain. In brief, these results suggested the Nrf2 signaling pathway activation as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of anxiety and depression associated with chronic pain.</p>
<p>New theories of anxiety and depressive disorders revealed that beside inflammation, oxidative stress is also amply implicated in their development. Consequently, a significant decreased expression of the antioxidant enzymes activated by the Nrf2 signaling pathway in several anxiety- and depressive-like states has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hashimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Khalifeh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Martín-Hernández et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, in order to evaluate the mechanisms implicated in the anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties of SFN in animals with chronic neuropathic pain, we evaluated its effects on the expression of Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 signaling and CD11b/C in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of these animals. Our results showed a down-regulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, in addition to an up-regulation of CD11b/c in the hippocampus from animals with neuropathic pain, revealing that both brain areas are involved in the affective disorders associated to chronic pain. Interestingly, the fact that treatment with SFN normalized the diminished expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 and avoided the activation of microglia induced by nerve injury in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex might explain the anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects of SFN in animals with neuropathic pain. The lack of changes in the expression of CD11b/c in prefrontal cortex confirmed that sciatic nerve injury only activates microglia in specific brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Riego et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, our data also revealed that SFN improved the mechanical and thermal antiallodynic effects produced by morphine during neuropathic pain. Considering that neuropathic pain is difficult to treat with the most potent analgesic compounds, such as MOR agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Obara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hervera et al., 2013</xref>), the fact that SFN potentiated the antiallodynic effects of morphine represented a very interesting stratagem for the treatment of sciatic nerve injury induced neuropathic pain. These effects might be linked with the normalization of the decreased expression of MOR induced by SFN in the spinal cord and/or hippocampus from sciatic nerve-injured mice. These data are consistent with the up-regulation of MOR induced by the activation of Nrf2 in animals with peripheral inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Redondo et al., 2017</xref>) as well as with the neutralization of the down regulation of these receptors induced by CoPP in sciatic nerve-injured mice or diabetic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hervera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Castany et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Jurga et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggested that the modulation of the expression of MOR by SFN treatment is probably mediated via Nrf2/HO-1 activation. Nevertheless and considering that the pharmacological inhibition of microglia also increased the analgesic effects of MOR agonists during neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Zychowska et al., 2013</xref>), we cannot discard that the inhibition of microglial activation made by SFN in our animals might be also implicated in the increased antiallodynic effects of morphine in SFN pretreated animals.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results revealed that treatment with SFN reduced allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by sciatic nerve injury and inhibited the anxiety and depressive-like behaviors associated with persistent neuropathic pain by normalizing oxidative stress, inhibiting microglial activation and MAPK phosphorylation in the specific areas evaluated. It is also interesting to note that treatment with SFN enhanced the antiallodynic activity of morphine by restoring the down regulation of MOR in the spinal cord and/or hippocampus from sciatic nerve-injured mice. In summary, this study showed that treatment with SFN might be an interesting approach for the management of persistent neuropathic pain and comorbidities associated, as well as to improve the analgesic actions of morphine in animals with neuropathic pain.</p>
