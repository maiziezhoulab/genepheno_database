<abstract>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of developmental disabilities that affect social interaction and communication and are characterized by repetitive behaviors. There is now a large body of evidence that suggests a complex role of genetics in ASDs, in which many different loci are involved. Although many current population-scale genomic studies have been demonstrably fruitful, these studies generally focus on analyzing a limited part of the genome or use a limited set of bioinformatics tools. These limitations preclude the analysis of genome-wide perturbations that may contribute to the development and severity of ASD-related phenotypes. To overcome these limitations, we have developed and utilized an integrative clinical and bioinformatics pipeline for generating a more complete and reliable set of genomic variants for downstream analyses. Our study focuses on the analysis of three simplex autism families consisting of one affected child, unaffected parents, and one unaffected sibling. All members were clinically evaluated and widely phenotyped. Genotyping arrays and whole-genome sequencing were performed on each member, and the resulting sequencing data were analyzed using a variety of available bioinformatics tools. We searched for rare variants of putative functional impact that were found to be segregating according to de novo, autosomal recessive, X-linked, mitochondrial, and compound heterozygote transmission models. The resulting candidate variants included three small heterozygous copy-number variations (CNVs), a rare heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in <italic>MYBBP1A</italic> located within exon 1, and a novel de novo missense variant in <italic>LAMB3</italic>. Our work demonstrates how more comprehensive analyses that include rich clinical data and whole-genome sequencing data can generate reliable results for use in downstream investigations.</p>

There is a large collection of putative disease-contributing variants found in small subpopulations of people with ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C64">Zhou and Parada 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C5">Bernier et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C19">Iossifov et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C51">Ronemus et al. 2014</xref>), yet leaving most ASD cases of undetermined etiology. The lack of generality in these findings may be attributed to many factors, including the phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C35">Lyon and O'Rawe 2015</xref>), the need for larger sample sizes for statistical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C18">Iossifov et al. 2012</xref>), and the variability in the methodology used to analyze ASD-related data.</p><p>Another important factor contributing to the varying results among studies is the diagnosis methodology used for ASDs. Although there are efforts to achieve a clear and consistent method of diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C54">Schaefer and Mendelsohn 2013</xref>), ASD is by definition a spectrum with likely many different contributing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C20">Johnson et al. 2011</xref>). As a consequence of this, a carefully chosen study cohort is needed for statistical studies to reliably detect shared genetic variants.</p><p>Currently, many ASD studies focus on the analysis of microarray and/or exome-sequencing data for understanding the etiological contributions to and mechanisms of ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C29">Levy et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C18">Iossifov et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C19">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C46">O'Roak et al. 2012</xref>). These analyses are generally applied to large cohorts, such as those from the Simons Simplex Collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C13">Fischbach and Lord 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C29">Levy et al. 2011</xref>), which consists of families with a single affected child, unaffected parents, and at least one unaffected sibling. These large studies generally use and analyze only one of the high-throughput sequencing technologies, with varying levels of sequence coverage for whole-exome sequencing (WES) or genotyping markers (for genotyping microarrays). Furthermore, these studies use only one or a few analysis tools for detecting sequence variations, which can result in a loss of information in situations where one tool performs poorly. Although these approaches have led to significant genetic discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C63">Zhao et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C6">Betancur 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C29">Levy et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C18">Iossifov et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C19">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C44">Neale et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C46">O'Roak et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C64">Zhou and Parada 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C5">Bernier et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C50">Robinson et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C53">Rothwell et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C56">Sugathan et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C25">Krumm et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C35">Lyon and O'Rawe 2015</xref>), they are likely to miss-call or simply miss true and disease-relevant genetic variation. Some tools may perform better on just one or a few areas of the genome, and their performance may also differ depending on data set–specific characteristics, which has been studied previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C45">O'Rawe et al. 2013</xref>). To address these problems, we describe an integrative clinical and bioinformatics pipeline that makes use of a variety of analysis tools and orthogonal high-throughput sequencing technologies to obtain a more complete and reliable set of candidate ASD variants for validation and downstream functional analysis, resulting in a collection of different types of variants for a better understanding of the genomic burden of the three autism probands.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>This study consisted of the clinical recruitment of three simplex autism families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422F1">Fig. 1</xref>) for phenotyping and whole-genome studies. Human sequence variation spans a variety of genomic scales, ranging from single nucleotide to megabases and even whole-chromosome differences. Because of the variety of scales and mechanisms that can lead to variation in human sequence between individuals and populations, a variety of algorithms are needed to extract genomic signatures at all scales and that represent a wide variety of variant types. Several variant discovery algorithms and procedures were used during the course of this study, each designed to detect different classes of human sequence variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><fig id="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<italic>A</italic>) Pedigree structure of a simplex autism family.

The multinomial analyzer is an algorithm specifically designed to detect de novo SNVs, whereas additional steps were taken to obtain a list of putative de novo variants using FreeBayes and GATK. After filtering variants based on each algorithm's recommendations (refer to the Methods section for details pertaining to the filtering procedures), the mean number of variants detected by each caller dropped to 1692, 24,982, and 31,831 for the multinomial analyzer, FreeBayes, and GATK, respectively. The concordance between the three algorithms was generally low, with FreeBayes and GATK agreeing on 12.4% of their detected variants, and all three agreeing on &lt;1% of the total filtered call set, 0.113%. It is important to note that the low concordance between the multinomial analyzer and the other algorithms is influenced by the fact that its filtering step considers a “de novo score,” which is something that the other algorithms do not use for filtering purposes. Thus, the large difference in overall call rate makes a comparison of the mean overlapping calls somewhat uninformative, as the intersection between all three can only be as large as the smallest set. It is for this reason that the union of the three algorithms was considered during downstream prioritization steps, rather than the intersection.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>De Novo Unique INDELs</title><p>De novo INDELs from GATK, FreeBayes, and Scalpel were also compared.

The concordance between the three algorithms was, again, low. FreeBayes and GATK agreed on 10.7% of the total call set, and all three callers agreed on only one variant and only within the subset of a single family (i.e., there was only one instance in which all three callers found the same variant). One should keep in mind that the filtering criteria and size of call sets are very different across these three callers, so our a priori expectation is that a low number of calls will be within the intersection of all three.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Variant Classification and Prioritization for SNVs and INDELs</title><p>After obtaining high-quality call sets from the union of filtered variants from all algorithms and categorizing them according to different disease models, the number of variants was still too large to proceed to more detailed literature searches and putative functional interpretations.

In this study, we used a range of different software tools for detecting and analyzing human sequence variation stemming from WGS data, which has enabled the analysis of a more comprehensive data set composed of SNVs, INDELs, and CNVs. We found that only using the GATK pipeline for detecting SNVs would have resulted in a data set that left validated sequence variants undetected, highlighting the benefits of comprehensive analyses using aggregated data sets stemming from various detection tools. We have shown that the detection of CNVs from WGS data is naturally more sensitive, although the accuracy of WGS-based CNVs was not investigated here, as we did not perform validation experiments for CNVs. It is important to note that detecting CNVs from the same biological sample using microarray data and WGS results in data sets that are rather distinct both in number and in the characteristics of the CNV signal. Indeed, WGS resulted in an average of 1500 unfiltered deletions and 450 unfiltered duplications per sequenced individual whereas microarray resulted in an average of 60 unfiltered deletions and 80 unfiltered duplications per sequenced individual. Despite differences in the number of CNVs detected between microarray and WGS-based methods, having both data sets allowed for quick and relatively simple comparisons between these orthogonal technologies. This allowed for the detection of false-negatives and the evaluation of potential false-positive calls, as CNVs detected by both technologies can, in cases where both have adequate data, be used to cross-validate the calls.</p><p>Although we found CNVs and SNVs that fit the filtering and annotation criteria described in the Methods section, there is no obvious connection between any of them and ASDs, so they should be carefully considered only as possible disease-contributing variants that are in need of further functional analysis. In addition, we did not have the statistical power of a larger study to be able to associate our variants as contributing factors in the development of autism, and so our results are restricted to interpretation in the context of the three families studied here.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Aggregated Data Sets Are More Comprehensive</title><p>It is known that different algorithms are better at calling particular types of variants, each capable of detecting variants others cannot, and that they all usually agree on a subset of reliably called regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C45">O'Rawe et al. 2013</xref>). For this reason, the results of different algorithms were integrated, and instead of considering only the intersection of variants common to all algorithms, the union of all variant sets was obtained. This enabled the retention of variants that would have otherwise been excluded due to performing intersections with call sets, as only variants agreeing among all callers would have been retained. Indeed, one of the steps in which many variants are lost is during the initial filtering steps applied to each algorithm's raw call set, at which point one can decide how stringent the filter should be. Even recommended filtering parameters resulted in a detectable level of false negatives (i.e., true variants excluded from the final call set), despite these parameters being optimized for both sensitivity and specificity. Because the probands included in our study had already been part of previously reported targeted sequencing experiments, we were able to leverage available validation data to identify which informatics steps would have resulted in false-negative calls. Indeed and as stated above, we found that for the GATK HC (haplotype caller) call set, not all of the previously validated calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C18">Iossifov et al. 2012</xref>) passed the first initial recommended filtering steps.</p><p>It is important to note that to measure concordance between the different variant calling algorithms used in this study, we considered variants in agreement if they match in terms of the genomic positions where each algorithm made a call. Because of large differences in INDEL calling and reporting, the same INDEL can sometimes be reported differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C3">Assmus et al. 2013</xref>). For this reason, the reference and alternative fields were not included in the analysis of concordance between the different INDEL callers. Another reason for comparing callers in this way is based on the large differences seen in multiallelic calls reported by GATK HC (∼30,000) and FreeBayes (∼70,000). This nonstandard way of reporting INDELs has made the comparison between algorithms particularly difficult; thus, the comparisons performed in this study are approximate. These issues underscore the importance of carefully integrating sets of variants from different variant callers, as simple intersections can dramatically reduce the number of true positives even if all callers detect them, as their representations may be slightly different between the different callers. New tools that standardize discordant variant reporting into a unified schema have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C57">Tan et al. 2015</xref>), and we expect that these tools will aid in the more precise comparison and use of variants stemming from different callers.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Microarray versus WGS Data for Detecting CNVs</title><p>Microarray data provide researches with a cheap yet powerful way of detecting CNVs; however, depending on the particular technology used as well as the algorithms used to analyze the generated data, the results can vary widely. Sparse markers in some genomic regions make it difficult to define accurate breakpoints of detected CNVs, something that is less difficult with CNVs detected from WGS data. This is due, in part, to the fact that WGS data are more uniform, having an average coverage of reads which is less variable across the genome. For this study, we had both types of data for one of the quads, making it possible to call variants from both sources and compare the results. We found a large degree of variation in terms of the number of CNVs detected per person and also between the two detection methods used (i.e., WGS-based and DNA microarray–based methods). The genome-wide sensitivity of CNV detection using WGS is higher, because array-based methods do not densely cover the entire human genome with markers. We found that having data from these orthogonal technologies was useful in including or excluding true- or false-positive calls, as each should show some evidence of a CNV, if one does exist. Thus, in regions where both technologies had enough data to detect CNVs, discordant calls could be easily resolved by comparing the data profiles between the two.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Combining Prioritization Methods for More Robust Candidate Lists</title><p>Variant prioritization is another potentially delicate and important step in finding candidate disease-contributing variants. One could detect all true variants from WGS analysis yet still discount biologically important variants if the pertinent annotations are not used correctly. When filtering based on annotations that are numerically scaled, filtering threshold values should generally be strict enough to result in a small number of variants in which functional studies are feasible, without letting any biologically important variant go unconsidered. Obtaining this variant set from a single annotation or score is currently not possible, as each individually lacks the power to filter to a small and manageable set, which could otherwise be obtained by using multiple annotations for threshold-based filtering. For these reasons, several tools and annotations were combined to make sure that the results were robust and not due to systematic errors from one prioritization framework. Although two different frameworks were used, they were only slightly different in their results, likely because the VEP-GEMINI toolset has more annotations to determine if a variant is deleterious than does the in-house toolset. Unfortunately, using these two methods, we were unable to find a single candidate SNV or INDEL variant for the SSC_12596 pedigree. One alternative would be to use other prioritizing methods, such as the Variant Annotation, Analysis, and Search Tool (VAAST), which uses an aggregative variant association test that combines both amino acid substitution (AAS) and allele frequencies and incorporates information about phylogenetic conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C17">Hu et al. 2013</xref>). As human variation not only includes small variations (SNVs and INDELs) and CNVs, but also structural variants and repeats, other software tools have to be used on these WGS data to explore other sources of variation that might contribute to disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Diagnostic Yield of ASD Genetic Studies</title><p>The diagnostic yield for different studies in the genetics of ASDs have been reported to range from 6% to 15% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C54">Schaefer and Mendelsohn 2013</xref>). This variation depends on many factors including the type of technology used to generate the data, the tools used, the type of variants being studied, and the size of the cohort of study. Considering all of these variables, this pipeline tries to improve the strategies of those different studies by integrating them in a single pipeline that in principle would be able to improve the yield of diagnosis, as long as a larger cohort is studied to have statistical power. The diagnostic yield also highly depends on how many cases of the study would fall into the known autism-associated variants versus how many will be novel associated variants, but again, a larger cohort would be necessary to evaluate the improvement of the yield as well as to collect enough evidence to proceed with further functional analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Putative Candidate Variants</title><p>After initial filtering, variant prioritization, and segregation analyses, we found two de novo missense variants that were annotated as being highly deleterious (as defined by a CADD score of &gt;20) and rare on the population level (with population allele frequencies &lt;0.01).

Larger studies have focused on a subset of variant types, but here we have obtained a broader and more complete view of all the different types of genomic variation that could be contributing to the ASD phenotypes observed in this study. By combining different algorithms and variant prioritization methods, we were able to use the strengths of each and compensate for the different weaknesses by integrating their results in one computational framework.</p><p>There has been special interest in knowing to what extent de novo mutations contribute to ASD cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C18">Iossifov et al. 2012</xref>). In this study, four different variant detection algorithms and three different prioritization methods were used to detect de novo variants. This allowed us to improve detection sensitivity and to reduce the false-negative rate. We also searched for variants segregating according to other disease transmission models, including autosomal recessive, X-linked, mitochondrial, and compound heterozygote. As expected, the number of variants detected from each model varies widely (<xref ref-type="table" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422TB3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>As sequencing technologies improve in accuracy and their operational costs decrease, large-sequencing studies including thousands of people at higher sequencing depths are becoming more common. As such, it is useful and perhaps even necessary to design studies that search for and aim to detect all known variant types and to not just focus on a small subset. We suspect that such studies would, in general, obtain more biologically relevant results by doing so. However, study design must also consider the cost/benefit balance of sequencing whole genomes of a large number of people to high-sequence depth, as was done here with the SSC quads (∼75×). The previously reported ideal coverage for accurately detecting SNVs is 40×–45× where the detection saturates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C1">Ajay et al. 2011</xref>). It has recently been shown that for accurate INDEL detection in personal genomes, whole-genome sequencing coverage of 60× may be ideal, at least with 100 base pairs (bp) paired-end reads from Illumina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C10">Fang et al. 2014</xref>). Given the known complexity and heterogeneity of ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C63">Zhao et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C46">O'Roak et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C5">Bernier et al. 2014</xref>), it is clear that a large study capable of obtaining robust statistical signals is needed; yet a study of this magnitude with 60× coverage is still prohibitively expensive. Our study is useful in terms of contributing a small but rich data set to larger studies, so that the etiology of ASDs can be better understood.

Variants from the same sample coming from GATK, FreeBayes, Scalpel, and MA were merged into a single VCF file for downstream analysis. See Supplemental Document 1 for a complete list of the parameters or code used for each of the four algorithms.</p></sec><sec id="s5h"><title>Variant Classification and Prioritization</title><p>The final set of high-quality calls were divided into different models of inheritance, so that the way in which the mutations emerged and how they were possibly contributing to the condition could be interrogated. After obtaining model-specific subsets, the variants were annotated with a combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) score, a metric that evaluates the deleteriousness of SNV, as well as INDEL, variants in the human genome. CADD scores are generated by integrating multiple annotations, including PolyPhen and SIFT scores, into one metric by contrasting variants that survived natural selection with simulated mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C24">Kircher et al. 2014</xref>). Those variants with a CADD score of &gt;20 were kept as potentially deleterious, and the number of reads supporting each variant was compared among all family members to decide whether a call was a false positive or not. All variants were further filtered using a MAF &lt;0.01 from the 1000 Genomes Project (October 2014). The final set of variants was annotated with in-house tools as well as the ANNOVAR software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C61">Wang et al. 2010</xref>) using the UCSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C22">Kent et al. 2002</xref>) and RefSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C49">Raney et al. 2014</xref>) gene tables; the SSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C4">Basu et al. 2009</xref>), Exome Variant Server (<uri xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</uri>), and ClinVar databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C27">Landrum et al. 2014</xref>); and the recently released ExAC database (<uri xlink:href="http://exac.broadinstitute.org">http://exac.broadinstitute.org</uri>).</p></sec><sec id="s5i"><title>Models</title><p>There are several ways in which a disease-contributing genetic variant can be present in an individual. As we were not only interested in the variants, but also in their origin, they were divided into different models before prioritization.</p><sec id="s5j"><title>De Novo Model</title><p>De novo variants are those that emerge at some stage during the gametogenesis of one of the parents or embryogenesis of the child, so those mutations will be only present in the offspring and not the parents. Only those variants present uniquely in the proband and not in parents or unaffected sibling were kept for downstream annotation and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s5k"><title>X-Linked</title><p>Here only variants on chromosome X are considered. As all of the probands in this study are males, the only X chromosome copy they have comes from the mother, who by having two X chromosome copies could be masking the deleteriousness of a mutation, which is then expressed fully in the male offspring. All X chromosome variants present in the proband inherited from the mother but not present in the healthy sibling or father were kept for downstream annotation and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s5l"><title>Autosomal Recessive</title><p>In this model, a given variant is required to be present in both probands with one copy inherited by the mother and the second one from the father. The autosomal recessive variants found in the healthy sibling are also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s5m"><title>Compound Heterozygous</title><p>Sometimes a gene can bear two different heterozygous mutations; one in each chromosomal copy, affecting both copies of a gene but not with the same exact mutation, as is the case for the autosomal recessive model. For this set of variants, only those combinations of heterozygous mutations on the same gene and present in the proband were considered.</p></sec><sec id="s5n"><title>Mitochondrial</title><p>In a similar fashion as chromosome X, it is well known that the mitochondrial DNA is passed from mother to offspring; however in this case, if a mutation is contributing to the disease the mother would also be affected so the only mitochondrial mutations considered are under the de novo model described above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5o"><title>VEP-GEMINI</title><p>The VEP (Variant Effect Predictor)-Genome Mining (GEMINI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C47">Paila et al. 2013</xref>) toolset is a framework for annotating and prioritizing genomic variants by different criteria. Built-in analysis tools were used to obtain variants characterized by different classifications: de novo, compound heterozygous, autosomal recessive, and impact severity. The VEP-GEMINI toolset was used to get additional information about each variant, and to compare the results obtained with the model classifications and prioritizations performed with in-house tools. The criteria for keeping variants from each classification scheme were for variants to have a CADD score of &gt;20 or be annotated as having high impact severity for the proband.</p></sec><sec id="s5p"><title>Variant Calling for Copy-Number Variants</title><p>The estimation by read depth with SNVs (ERDS) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C65">Zhu et al. 2012</xref>) was used with default parameters to call CNVs from WGS data on each individual. It uses WGS data along with previously generated VCF files using the read depth and number of contiguous heterozygous and homozygous SNVs to call CNVs. Only calls with an ERDS score of &gt;300 were kept.</p><p>Additionally, CNVs were called with the microarray data from pedigree K21, which was genotyped with an Illumina Omni2.5 array and analyzed with the software package PennCNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C60">Wang et al. 2007</xref>). For kilobase-resolution detection of CNVs, PennCNV uses an algorithm that implements a hidden Markov model, which integrates multiple signal patterns across the genome and uses the distance between neighboring SNPs and the allele frequency of SNPs. The two signal patterns that it uses are the log <italic>R</italic> ratio (LRR), which is a normalized measure of the total signal intensity for two alleles of the SNP, and the B allele frequency (BAF), a normalized measure of the allelic intensity ratio of two alleles. The combination of both signal patterns is then used to infer copy-number changes in the genome. Microarrays often show variation in hybridization intensity (genomic waves), which is related to the genomic position of the clones, and that correlates to GC content among the genomic features considered. For adjustment of such genomic waves in signal intensities, the cal_gc_snp.pl PennCNV program was used to generate a GC model that considered the GC content surrounding each Illumina Omni2.5 marker within 500 kilobases (kb) on each side (1 Mb total). The joint-calling algorithm designed for parents-offspring trios was used, as it is the most accurate of the algorithms in the package for family-based studies. The hidden Markov model used is contained in the hhall.hmm file provided by the latest PennCNV package, and the custom population frequency of B allele (PFB) file for all the SNPs in the Illumina Omni2.5 array was generated from 600 controls, which consist of 600 unaffected parents from the Simons Simplex Collection (provided by Dr. Stephan Sanders from Yale University). The GC model described above was also used during CNV calling.</p><p>Chromosome X CNVs were called separately using the -- test mode with the --Chrx option. Using BEDtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C48">Quinlan and Hall 2010</xref>) and in-house tools, consensus CNV calls were obtained for parents from the two separate trio calling processes that had to be done for each child in the quad. CNVs were quality filtered by considering the length of the CNV event (for both algorithms: ERDS and PennCNV) and for microarray data, the number of SNPs embedded on the CNV region and the number of expected SNPs for that given region (Supplemental Fig. 5), histocompatibility regions, and centromeric and telomeric regions were also filtered out as it is common to find nonpathogenic variants there (both algorithms).</p><p>For pedigree K21, ERDS and PennCNV calls were compared and the union of each pipeline's set of variants was annotated with in-house tools and the ANNOVAR software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C61">Wang et al. 2010</xref>) using dbVar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C28">Lappalainen et al. 2013</xref>), DGV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C36">MacDonald et al. 2014</xref>), ClinVar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C27">Landrum et al. 2014</xref>), DECIPHER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C12">Firth et al. 2009</xref>), ENCODE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C52">Rosenbloom et al. 2013</xref>), and the SFARI Gene database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIMNEZ-BARRNMCS000422C4">Basu et al. 2009</xref>) and those variants in which <underline>&gt;</underline>90% of their total length overlapped reciprocally with variants found in controls were ruled out. ERDS-filtered output for pedigrees SSC_12596 and SSC_12605 were annotated with the same software and criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s5q"><title>Sanger Sequencing</title><p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for the Chr17:4458481(hg19) variant in <italic>MYBBP1A</italic> (Supplemental Document 7) were designed to produce a 911-bp amplicon, using Primer3 (<uri xlink:href="http://primer3.sourceforge.net">http://primer3.sourceforge.net</uri>). Primers were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and tested for PCR efficiency with an in-house DNA sample using a Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies). The optimized PCR reaction was then carried out on patient DNA. PCR products were visually inspected for amplification efficiency using agarose gel electrophoresis and were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN). Purified products were then diluted to 5–10 ng/µL in water for use with the ABI 3700 sequencer. The resulting *.ab1 sequence files were loaded into the CodonCode Aligner V5.1.2 for analysis. All sequence traces were manually reviewed to ensure the reliability of the genotype calls.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</title><sec id="s6a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Research was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.
