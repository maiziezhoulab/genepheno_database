<abstract>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are prevalent neurobiological conditions with complicated causes worldwide. Increasing researcher awareness of ASD and accumulated evidence
suggest that the development of ASD may be strongly linked to the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. In addition, most of the current studies have compared autistic children and
neurotypical children or have compared ASD patients before and after antibiotic treatment. Treatment of autism with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has increasingly been
promoted, but the relationship between its efficacy and intestinal flora has rarely been reported. Under the premise that treatment with the TCM <italic>BuYang HuanWu Tang</italic>
is effective, we conducted a comparative bioinformatics analysis to identify the overall changes in gut microbiota in relation to ASD by comparing the intestinal flora before and
after treatment with TCM and contrasting the intestinal flora with that of healthy controls. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria showed a significant increase in children with ASD,
which may be a signature of dysbiosis in the gut microbiota. At the genus level, <italic>Blautia, Coprococcus</italic> 1<italic>,</italic> the <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>
family, and the <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> family were found at the lowest levels of relative abundance in children with ASD, whereas the abundances of
<italic>Escherichia-Shigella, Klebsiella</italic>, and <italic>Flavonifractor</italic> were significantly increased compared with those in the healthy control group. In sum, this
study characterized the alterations of the intestinal microbiome in children with ASD and its normalization after TCM treatment (TCMT), which may provide novel insights into the
diagnosis and therapy of ASD.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders that are highly influenced by strong genetic underpinnings and have their onset in infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. ASD is a chronic condition that can be lifelong and irreversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that severe
social skill deficits and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behavior patterns, interests, and activities are core clinical signs. Furthermore, some other features, such as
communication deficits, regression, and Asperger Syndrome, contribute to the diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Although the exact etiology is still unknown, ASDs
are universally accepted as the most heritable of neurodevelopmental disorders, with an incidence in males that is significantly higher than that in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. We face difficulties in diagnosis and treatment because of the unknown etiology whereby both genetic and environmental
factors play important roles in the pathogenesis of ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>The microbiota–gut–brain axis is a bidirectional communication pathway between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and brain, which is important for maintaining a constant internal
environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In addition, the gut microbiome is vital to the
normal physiologic function of the microbiota–gut–brain axis. Currently, researchers are paying more attention to the relationship between gut microbiota balance and psychological
diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that altered gut microbiota and decreased diversity affect both GI function and central nervous system (CNS) physiology by regulating the
brain–gut axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Based on these discoveries, the relationship between depression and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been studied, and it
highlights the possibility for prevention and therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Considering the similarity between depression and ASDs, growing studies indicate that there is a strong positive correlation
between GI problems and ASD severity, and GI problems are associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. A previous study mentioned that gram-negative bacteria, particularly, an increase in the population abundance of
<italic>Desulfovibrio and Bacteroides vulgatus</italic>, were observed in autistic children compared with healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. However, gram-positive bacteria, including <italic>Clostridium,</italic> are reported to be present at a higher level in autistic individuals
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Although several studies have reported that
dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been identified in children with ASDs, the specific bacterial genera or species that are commonly dysregulated have not yet been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Therefore, further studies are necessary to confirm specific changes in flora in ASDs, which would then deepen our understanding of the
etiology and treatment of ASDs.</p>
<p>To date, most studies have been interested in the genetic, behavioral, and neurological aspects of ASD, and therapies for ASDs have been used clinically with the aim of normalizing
patient behaviors instead of addressing the core internal factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. For instance, risperidone treatment is administered to children with ASDs characterized by aggression, temper outbursts, and self-injurious behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Behavioral approaches are widely regarded as the most effective methods to address delays and deficits, which are common in ASDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. However, these treatments do not have a substantial therapeutic effect for the core symptoms, and all have some side effects. In traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, it is believed that congenital deficiency (<italic>xiantianbuzu</italic>), deficiency of kidney essence (<italic>shenjingkuixu</italic>), lack of
support for the heart (<italic>shenshisuoyang</italic>), dysfunction of unchoking and excretion of the liver (<italic>ganshitiaoda</italic>) are the major facets of autism etiology
and pathogenesis. In general, the condition is considered a syndrome called Qi_stagnation, also known as ‘<italic>Yu</italic>’ in TCM. A previous study indicated that an ancient TCM
formula can be an effective therapy for depression without any side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Therefore, we conducted this study of the TCM <italic>Buyang
Huanwu Tang</italic> and observed improvements in clinical symptoms after treatment with this TCM (TCMT). Although there have been studies aimed at analyzing the difference in
intestinal florae between children with ASDs and healthy controls, there are few studies comparing conditions before and after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. In the present investigation, we collected a total of 48 fecal samples from children with and without ASDs and then pyrosequenced the
V3/V4 regions in bacterial 16S rDNA from fecal DNA samples to compare the intestinal flora of children before and after treatment with that of healthy controls. To the best of our
knowledge, this study is the first to provide new insights into the application of TCM as a novel therapy for ASDs.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec>
<title>Patients and samples</title>
<p>The subject population consisted of 14 ASD patients who received TCMT. Additionally, 18 healthy controls were obtained from a children’s hospital. This study was approved by the
First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University (clinical trial number: 2014036). Prior to the study, written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians, and the
study was conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Subject recruitment</title>
<p>We locally recruited 14 children with ASDs from Jiangxi Provincial Children’s Hospital. The enrolled subjects ranged from 1 to 10 years old and did not use any type of antibiotic
or antifungal medications for at least 3 months prior to sample collection. The control group included 18 age-matched children who were unrelated to autistic individuals from the
hospital. To assess and confirm the ASD symptoms of the children, we asked parents or guardians to fill out the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). Detailed information on the
survey and eligibility criteria can be found in the Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplemental Table S1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Sample collection</title>
<p>Fecal samples were collected from the children with ASDs on the day of hospitalization and the day of discharge. The fecal samples for the children with ASDs and healthy controls
were collected and stored in germfree containers, and the sample weight was limited to 100–200 g to ensure that there were enough bacteria for culture. All samples were immediately
stored in a −80°C environment until DNA extraction. Ultimately, we collected a total of 42 samples from 14 children with ASDs at hospitalization and discharge and 14 healthy
controls. Specimens were divided into three groups: Patient or Hospitalized (labeled R, n=14), Traditional Chinese Medicine Affected or Discharged (labeled C, n=14), and Normal or
Healthy control (labeled Z, n=14).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>DNA extraction PCR amplification</title>
<p>We extracted DNA from fecal samples with a DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit and followed the protocol recommended by QIAGEN. After genomic DNA extraction was completed, agarose gel
electrophoresis (1.0%, w/v) was applied to confirm the efficiency of genomic DNA extraction. We amplified the V3–V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, and then specific primers
with a barcode were synthesized according to the specified sequencing area. To ensure the veracity and reliability of the subsequent analysis, two conditions needed to be met
during the PCR amplification: 1) use of low cyclic amplification whenever possible and 2) use of an same number of cycles for amplification of each sample. The V3–V4 region of the
16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified using two universal bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon PCR primers, 338 F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3′) and 806 R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′), by
PCR (95°C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Bioinformatic analysis</title>
<p>Raw paired-end FASTQ files were demultiplexed in QIIME 2 (version 2018.4). Quality control was conducted using DADA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], such as trimming
of low-quality regions of sequences, filtering any phiX reads, and removing chimeric sequences. Our 16S rRNA sequences were trimmed at 290 bp for forward read sequences and 225 bp
for reverse read sequences, respectively, based on the Phred score of 33. Four samples with total frequencies of less than 20,000 were excluded from further analysis to avoid
potential bias. Representative sequences were aligned with the MAFFT program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>] and used for constructing a phylogenetic tree in FastTree
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Diversity metrics were calculated with a sampling depth of 22,560 using the core-metrics-phylogenetic plugin within QIIME 2. The
Naive Bayes method was performed to train the SILVA database (version 132) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>], and then taxonomy was assigned to all representative
sequences.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Multiple indices of alpha diversity (Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity [Faith’s PD], Shannon index, observed OTUs, and evenness index) were estimated via Kruskal-Wallis tests, and
corresponding curves were plotted on the R platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). To investigate
differences in community membership, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was shown using three-dimensional principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) in QIIME 2. Differential abundances of gut
microbiota at the phylum and genus levels were detected by a nonparametric negative binomial Wald test in the DESeq2 package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. A heatmap
for significant OTUs was performed with the gplots package in the R platform.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec>
<title>Subject characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 42 fecal samples were collected from the subjects with autism (n=28) and healthy controls (n=14), whose mean ages (± SD) were 3.49 (± 1.2) and 4.56 (± 1.15) years,
respectively. No organic lesions were found by imaging and electroencephalographic examinations. Parents or guardians were asked to complete the CARS to ensure the diagnosis of ASD

<sec>
<title>Sequencing data of fecal samples</title>
<p>Initially, we obtained a total of 2,927,889 demultiplexed sequences after processing, with an average of 68,090 counts per sample. Chimera sequences and poor-quality sequences
(quality score &lt;20) were removed, and we were left with average frequencies of 26,576 sequences per sample and 2,287 sequences per feature to estimate community richness and
diversity. We excluded singletons and classified all sequences into 1,856 features at a 97% similarity level, which represented 17 phyla and 265 genera. We took a random sampling
of the sequences and then constructed a rarefaction curve by using the number of extracted sequences and the number of OTUs they represented. As the curve flattened out at
approximately 4,000 counts, our sequencing of 67,434 counts was deep enough to reflect the microbial information in the samples. Similar to the rarefaction curve, the
Shannon-Wiener curve was applied to reflect the bacterial diversity at different sequencing depths.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Autism-associated changes in community diversity and richness</title>
<p>We employed QIIME 2 to compute several alpha and beta diversity metrics to detect community diversity and richness. The metrics computed by default were used in our research.
First, the Shannon diversity index showed that the healthy control group had the highest value among the three groups, while the TCMT group had a relatively lower value,
Furthermore, the curve of the patient group almost coincided with that of the TCMT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, the curves demonstrated that
the relationship between the observed OTUs and sequencing depth showed the opposite result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1C, 1D</xref>). The TCMT group had a relatively
lower number of observed OTUs than the healthy control group and the patient group, and the curves of the observed OTUs of the other two groups almost coincided, which indicates
that treatment with <italic>Buyang Huanwu Tang</italic> is effective in some way and can transform the structure of the microbiome in the human GI tract. As a qualitative measure
of community richness that incorporates phylogenetic relationships, we employed Faith’s PD between the various features. Based on the Simpson index and Shannon-Wiener index, we
also applied Pielou’s Evenness as a measure of community evenness using a box plot. Similar to the results for the observed OTUs, the results of applying Pielou’s Evenness showed
that the TCMT group had the lowest evenness among the three groups, and the qualitative value of the healthy control group was slightly higher than that of the patient group, which
indicated that the healthy control group had a higher community evenness than the patient group and the TCMT group. In sum, although the analysis was not statistically significant,
it showed a tendency for ASD to affect the composition of the gut microbiome and cause dysbiosis of the microbiome in the GI tract, while TCMT was shown to potentially increase
community evenness.</p>
<p>In addition, PCoA based on the Jaccard distance, Bray-Curtis distance, unweighted UniFrac distance, and weighted UniFrac distance was performed to identify whether any differences
in the organismal structure of the gut microbiome exist. All three groups showed a cloud of overlapping clustering in both unweighted UniFrac distance and weighted UniFrac
distance, although most of the samples could cluster together (p&gt;0.05). However, the healthy controls and patient group showed nonoverlapping clustering in both Jaccard distance
and Bray-Curtis distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>3D principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot. PCoA plot of the gut microbiota based on the Jaccard and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Blue, red, and yellow dots represent
Healthy Control, Hospitalized, and Discharged specimens, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmfh-39-109-g002"></graphic></fig>). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) also identified significant differences in PCoA plots between the healthy control group and the patient group
(p&lt;0.05), indicating that ASDs can show differences in the organismal structure of the gut microbiome. Interestingly, PERMANOVA identified no significant differences in
Bray-Curtis distance and Jaccard distance between the healthy control group and the TCMT group. This pairwise PERMANOVA result suggested that TCMT can normalize the organismal
structure of the gut microbiome.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Autism-associated changes in the gut microbiome at the phylum level</title>
<p>To explore the taxonomic composition of the samples, we assigned a pretrained Naive Bayes classifier to the sequences. This classifier was trained on the Greengenes 13_8 99% OTUs,
with the sequences trimmed to include only 250 bases from the region of the 16S that was sequenced in this analysis. Ultimately, 8 phyla were classified, and <italic>Firmicutes,
Actinobacteria</italic>, and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> were the three dominant phyla, as reported in many previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. In addition, the phylum <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> was also relatively abundant in autistic children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3A</xref><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>A. Proteobacteria differing between the Hospitalized, Discharged, and Healthy Control groups. B. Phylum-level bacteria differing between the Hospitalized, Discharged, and

Blue, red, and yellow dots represent Healthy Control, Hospitalized, and Discharged specimens, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmfh-39-109-g003"></graphic></fig>). These four phyla comprised an average of 99.3% of the total classifiable sequences across samples. Since this experiment consisted of three groups in total and the
abundance data were not normally distributed, the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to make comparisons of mean abundances between groups. The phylum <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>
was found to be more abundant in the patient group than in the healthy control group and the TCMT group, and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.028, FDR Q=0.022). In
addition, the TCMT group had a relatively lower abundance than the patient group but a relatively higher abundance than the healthy control group. The mean abundance of the phylum
Bacteroidetes was also determined, and interestingly, that of the TCMT group was the highest. Compared with the healthy control group, the TCMT group had a significantly higher
abundance (p=0.048); the patient group also had a higher abundance than the healthy control group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05). The phylum
<italic>Firmicutes</italic> had the highest abundance, but the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was no significant difference in the relative abundance of the phylum
<italic>Firmicutes</italic> in any of the three groups.</p>

<title>Autism-associated changes in gut microflora at the genus level</title>
<p>Among 125 genera identified by the pretrained Naive Bayes classifier, the genera <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Blautia</italic>, and
<italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> were the top 4 most abundant genera in all three groups. These 4 genera comprised 51.59%, 48.57%, and 46.35% of the total sequences of the TCMT
group, patient group, and healthy control group, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Statistically significant differences were found for a total of
18 genera. Eight genera were decreased in the patient group compared with those in the other two groups, including <italic>Blautia</italic>, <italic>Fusicatenibacter</italic>,
<italic>Coprococcus</italic> 1, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> FCS020 group, <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> UCG-002, <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> UCG-014,
<italic>Holdemanella</italic>, and <italic>Erysipelotrichacea</italic>e UCG-003 (p&lt;0.05). The abundance data showed that the relative abundances of these phyla in the TCMT
group were higher than those in the patient group but still lower than those in the healthy control group, with 5 genera showing increases, including
<italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, CAG-352, <italic>Candidatus soleaferrea,</italic> and <italic>Flavonifractor</italic> (p&lt;0.05).
Interestingly, the genus <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic> was the fourth most abundant genus in the patient group, representing 7.89% of the total sequences, and was much more
abundant in the patient group than in the TCMT group and healthy control group (p=0.034). In particular, there was high expression of the genus
<italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic> in one individual, with the genus comprising 56.14% of the total sequences and its high expression revealing a very low community diversity
and richness. In addition, the differences in the remaining 6 phyla between the groups were irregular. In contrast to what has been reported, <italic>Veillonella</italic> was more
abundant in the patient group than in the healthy control group, while the relative abundance of <italic>Veillonella</italic> was decreased in the patient group compared with that
in the TCMT group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. In addition, 3 genera, <italic>Gordonibacter</italic>, Family XIII AD3011 group, and <italic>Marvinbryantia</italic>
F, showed significant decreases in the patient group compared with the healthy control group, while the relative abundances in the TCMT group were still lower than those in the
patient group. <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> showed a tendency to increase in the TCMT group, but the difference for this genus did not reach statistical significance
(p&gt;0.05). To show the diversity of bacteria in different individuals more intuitively, we generated a heat map and dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig.
4</xref><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Heat map profile and dendrogram. Heat map showing positive (red) and negative (blue) associations between each sample (bottom, x-axis) and the relative abundances of
bacterial genera (right, y-axis)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmfh-39-109-g004"></graphic></fig>). There were obvious and impressively strong association between the gut microbiota and the subject grouping. Ten genera, including <italic>Blautia, Fusicatenibacter,
Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> UCG-003, <italic>Coprococcus</italic> 1, <italic>Marvinbryantia</italic>, and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> FCS020, were enriched in neurotypical
children, while <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, <italic>Veillonella</italic>, and <italic>Flavonifractor</italic> were exclusively present in children with ASD.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In TCM theory, people are divided into nine types of body constitution, among which ASDs are associated with <italic>Qi</italic>_Stagnation, which can lead to “<italic>Yu</italic>”
syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. As a result of long-term emotional disorder, <italic>Qi</italic>_stagnation forms through personality instability, melancholy,
sensitivity, and suspiciousness as the main body state. Among these characteristics, loss of appetite and GI problems are common with this constitution, which shows features that are
similar to the typical symptoms of autism. These symptoms not only aggravate the symptoms of autism itself but also lead to other behavioral problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. ASDs can be categorized as the “<italic>Yu</italic>” differentiation grouping of TCM. More precisely, stagnation of liver <italic>Qi</italic>
(<italic>Ganqiyujie</italic>) is the main cause of anorexia and GI problems. The clinical manifestations of autistic children are mainly the prominent manifestation of the “liver”
losing its regulation of emotion. Therefore, we used the TCM <italic>BuYang HuanWu Tang</italic> to disperse stagnated liver <italic>Qi</italic> to relieve <italic>Qi</italic>
stagnation, and the symptoms of the children with ASDs were all improved after treatment, as assessed by the CARS. The main activities of the astragalus membranaceus in the
<italic>BuYang HuanWu Tang</italic> decoction are saponins, polysaccharides, and flavonoids. Studies have shown that after oral administration of astragalus membranaceus, its
active ingredient, calycosin-7-o-b-d-glucoside (C7G), interacts with intestinal flora and acts as a regulator of intestinal microflora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the regulation of normal gut physiology and immunity. Recently, the signaling between the gut and brain, referred to as the
“microbiota–gut–brain axis”, has become the focus of research on health and disease. Although there may be some differences in gut microbiome structure between individuals and
populations in different regions, there seems to be some balance that is good for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. There is accumulated evidence that dysbiosis in
the composition of the gut microbiota can be detected in various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible to
screen for specific bacteria that are associated with autism development to search for a new target for autism treatment and diagnosis. In the present study, we found that the
symptoms of children with autism improved to different degrees after TCMT. We subsequently performed a comparative bioinformatics analysis, and several major differences in bacterial
commensals were identified.</p>
<p>Alpha and beta diversity analyses showed that the children with ASD tended to have lower bacterial diversity and richness. This fact has been proven by many previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, the phylum <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> was found to be statistically significantly more abundant in autistic individuals.
Although <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> is the largest phylum of bacteria, it comprises only a small proportion of the bacteria in the GI tracts of healthy individuals. The presence
of an increased relative abundance of the phylum <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> is often followed by dysbiosis in the gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. A
total of 18 genera were detected that showed statistically significant differences. In particular, <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic> was found to be significantly more abundant
in children with ASD, and the propagation of this genus can lead to GI problems. An earlier study examined constipated autistic individuals and characterized them as having a high
relative abundance of taxa belonging to the <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic> genus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Among the genera detected with significant
differences, some match the genera in previous studies. A mouse model of autism showed a reduction in the relative abundances of <italic>Blautia</italic> and
<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, which are associated with multiple functions of the GI tract as well as bile acid and tryptophan metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. Although a decrease in <italic>Blautia</italic> was found in our study, the changes in <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> were not statistically significant. There was a
slight decrease in the relative abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> between the patient group and healthy control group, and the value of the TCMT group was higher than
that in the patient group, with improvement of symptoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplemental Table S2</xref>). Kang <italic>et al.</italic> found a
significantly lower abundance of <italic>Coprococcus</italic> in children with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. However, not all of the present results are consistent
with those of previous studies. The patient group showed a relatively lower abundance of the <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> FCS020 group than the other two groups, while a previous
study reported a higher abundance in autistic children with significant changes in fecal and urine metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. A recent study reported
that <italic>Veillonella</italic> was significantly decreased in children with ASD compared with typically developing children; our study also detected a difference in the relative
abundance of <italic>Veillonella</italic> in autistic children, but the results were reversed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. As previously mentioned, the change in
<italic>Veillonella</italic> in our study is not as typical. Finally, the TCMT group showed an interesting result in the comparisons with the other two groups. While the relative
abundances of particular genera in the healthy control group were higher than those in the patient group, the relative abundances in the TCMT group were also higher than those in the
patient group but still lower than those in the healthy control group, and vice versa. The number of patients enrolled in this study was insufficient, and this resulted in the
observation period being too short to determine efficacy; considering this and the diversity of the intestinal flora, it is difficult to replicate the results. Therefore, these
limitations may be responsible for the inconsistency between our results and those of other studies. However, overall, the results of our study, for the most part, showed that the
relative abundances of genera in the TCMT group had a tendency to approximate those in the healthy control group, which indicates that our TCMT is effective and can normalize the
structure of the microbial community to a certain extent.</p>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>In conclusion, our study detected the dysbiosis of gut microbiota in children with ASD compared with that in healthy controls and conducted comparisons between before and after the
TCMT. The phylum Proteobacteria and a total of 18 genera exhibited statistically significant differences, including <italic>Blautia</italic>, <italic>Fusicatenibacter</italic>,
<italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic>, and <italic>Klebsiella</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic> was found to be significantly more abundant in children
with ASD. In general, the majority of the results of this study matched those of previous similar studies, and there were also some new findings that should prompt further
theoretical and empirical investigations and experimental studies in this field.</p>
