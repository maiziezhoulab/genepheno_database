<abstract>
<p>Repetitive prenatal exposure to identical or similar doses of harmful agents results in highly variable and unpredictable negative effects on fetal brain development ranging in severity from high to little or none. However, the molecular and cellular basis of this variability is not well understood. This study reports that exposure of mouse and human embryonic brain tissues to equal doses of harmful chemicals, such as ethanol, activates the primary stress response transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) in a highly variable and stochastic manner. While Hsf1 is essential for protecting the embryonic brain from environmental stress, excessive activation impairs critical developmental events such as neuronal migration. Our results suggest that mosaic activation of Hsf1 within the embryonic brain in response to prenatal environmental stress exposure may contribute to the resulting generation of phenotypic variations observed in complex congenital brain disorders.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="web-summary">
<p>Prenatal exposure to environmental stressors is known to impair cortical development. Here the authors show that upon exposure to stressors, the activation of Hsf1-Hsp signalling is highly variable among cells in the embryonic cortex of mice, and either too much or too little activation can result in defects in cortical development.</p>

<body>
<p>Environmental stressors are critical factors impacting the proper development of the nervous system. The cerebral cortex, the intricate outer layer of the cerebrum whose formation relies on a complex series of coordinated developmental events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, is particularly vulnerable to disturbances in the prenatal environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Clinical and epidemiological studies have identified a variety of such stressors including heavy metals and alcohol to enhance the risks of neuropsychiatric diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
<p>Exposure to environmental stressors results in immediate alterations in the molecular landscape of afflicted cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The reduced expression of many genes affect brain development deleteriously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, while the upregulation of others are involved in pathological processes such as cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. To mitigate these outcomes, cells launch protective signalling events simultaneously that attempt to counter these effects. One such mechanism is the Hsf1-Heat shock protein (Hsp) signalling pathway, a well-known stress-induced chaperone pathway that serves as a universally conserved cytoprotective mechanism against multiple forms of cellular stress across several organisms ranging from bacteria to humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Hsf1 is activated by heat stress or other stimuli through sequential protein modification events including phosphorylation, sumoylation, trimerization, and nuclear translocation. Activation then triggers the transcription of Hsps and other downstream target genes.</p>
<p>Our recent study has revealed that Hsf1–Hsp signalling is commonly activated on prenatal exposure to various distinct types of environmental stressors including ethanol (EtOH), methyl mercury (MeHg), and maternal seizures, and is required for reducing the risk of cortical malformations such as leptomeningeal heterotopias, thereby reducing susceptibilities to epilepsy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In addition, the intercellular variability in transcriptional stress responses due to environmental stressors, including that of Hsf1–Hsp signalling, is augmented in pathological conditions such as aging and neuropsychiatric diseases in higher-order organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Interestingly, unicellular microbial populations rely on this non-genetic cell-to-cell gene expression variability for the survival of a clonal population in response to abrupt environmental changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. However, the roles of mosaic cellular responses in brain pathogenesis in vertebrates are still unclear.</p>
<p>This study identifies the probabilistic activation of Hsf1–Hsp signalling on exposure to environmental stressors and the distinct phenotypic consequences resulting from differential activation levels in cortical development. These results suggest that heterogeneous events of abnormal development may occur probabilistically, accounting for individually distinct patterns of focal cortical malformations in the cortex exposed to similar levels of environmental challenges.</p>

<title>Probabilistic HSF1 activation in human neural progenitors</title>
<p>To test whether the HSF1 activation levels of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) in response to environmental stress are determined in a random manner or correlated with their geographical location in the dish, we have taken advantage of the single molecule fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (smFISH) method for visually analysing mRNA expression levels of <italic>HSP70</italic>, a major downstream transcriptional target of HSF1 in each single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Given that <italic>HSP70</italic> mRNA is very stable (with a half-life of more than 8 h) under stress exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, smFISH analysis after a 3 h exposure provides an overall picture of the average transcriptional activity of HSF1 during the stress exposure in each hNPC. For this analysis, we used three types of environmental stress: EtOH, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and MeHg, all of which induce oxidative stress at certain concentrations. The highest concentration for each agent was set to a subthreshold level, which is half of the concentration that induces massive (more than 20% of the total number of cells) cell death.</p>
<p>After 3 h of stress exposure, we observed that the number of <italic>HSP70</italic> mRNA particles in each cell varied among the hNPCs regardless of the type of environmental stressors (PBS control did not induce <italic>HSP70</italic> expression; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig.1</xref>). This effect was dosage dependent, as the variability was higher when exposed to environmental stressors at increased concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). The levels of activation appeared to be random as they differed across hNPCs in close proximity regardless of their location within the culture dish (peripheral, central and so on), hence sharing the same microenvironment. The cell-to-cell variability was similarly observed for hNPC lines derived from differently induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). The variability was maintained during a long period of exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a–c</xref>), supporting the notion that this effect may have significant consequences on brain development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. No significant effects were observed in the variability of the expression of the housekeeping gene <italic>GAPDH</italic> by environmental stressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b-d</xref>).</p>
<p>We next confirmed that the probability of HSF1 activation was independent of the cell's location in the dish through statistical simulations. For each dish, the spatial patterning of <italic>HSP70</italic> expression was shuffled to generate a set of randomized patterns. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for every pair within the data set after random permutation of the experimental data, and the average of the correlation coefficients derived from a thousand of the permutations was plotted. The resulting data for each environmental stressor shows a normal distribution, and the average coefficient of the simulated data set shows no significant difference compared with that of the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e–g</xref>). Consistent with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, the correlation between the <italic>HSP70</italic> mRNA expression level and the cell cycling status was not evident (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). These results suggest that the Hsf1–Hsp70 signalling is mainly activated at different magnitudes in a probabilistic fashion among hNPCs <italic>in vitro.</italic></p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Heterogeneous Hsf1 activation in mouse embryonic cortex</title>
<p>We next examined the Hsf1 activation pattern <italic>in vivo</italic> by analysing the developing mouse cerebral cortex. For this analysis, we made a reporter plasmid that includes a red fluorescent protein (RFP:DsRed2) encoding gene under the control of the <italic>Hsp70</italic> promoter (pHSE–RFP [HSE: Heat Shock Element], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). This <italic>Hsp70</italic> promoter contains two Hsf1 binding sites, driving RFP (DsRed2) expression upon Hsf1 activation. Initially, we used <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (IUE)-mediated transfer of the reporter constructs into cortical neural precursor cells (NPCs) generating excitatory neurons. pHSE–RFP was co-electroporated at embryonic day (E) 14 into the cortex with pCAG–GFP, which labels all the electroporated cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. This procedure was followed by daily intraperitoneal injections of EtOH as a representative stressor (or control PBS) which were started 6 h post-electroporation. The HSE–RFP reporter expression was rarely detected in the embryos from PBS-injected dams 1 day after the last injection at E16 (&lt;0.01% of total electroporated cells express RFP), whereas RFP was expressed in most of the embryos from EtOH-injected dams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). In embryos from EtOH-exposed dams, 23.6±1.6% (s.e.m.) of the total electroporated (GFP<sup>+</sup>) NPCs and descendent neurons expressed the HSE–RFP reporter in sporadic patterns, showing no indications for specificity in cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a–h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). No induction of the HSE–RFP reporter in <italic>Hsf1</italic> knockout (KO) mutant embryos exposed to EtOH was observed (<italic>n</italic>=3/3 embryos), confirming that reporter induction was caused solely by Hsf1 activation. The morphology and positioning of the reporter-positive cells appeared to be normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i–l</xref>). However, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the HSE–RFP reporter-positive cell population contained significantly fewer dying cells compared with the reporter-negative cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2m–q</xref>), consistent with the protective roles of activated Hsf1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>As an alternative approach, we generated HSE–RFP reporter transgenic mouse lines harboring the same reporter construct and obtained three founder lines. Using the same alcohol exposure regimen as we used for IUE experiments, we compared reporter sensitivities in these mice to that of electroporated mice. HSE–RFP reporter-expressing cells were FACS-sorted from EtOH-exposed cortices at E14 and E16, and the Hsf1 activity was determined based on the <italic>Hsp70</italic> mRNA expression levels by real-time quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (qRT–PCR). The data revealed that the cells detected by the reporter in transgenic founder lines had higher levels of <italic>Hsp70</italic> expression on average than those detected in the electroporated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). No significant differences were detected between the founder lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Given that the electroporation-based reporter assay shows higher sensitivity in general<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, this indicates that the transgenic reporter detects only cells in which Hsf1–Hsp signalling is activated at high levels.</p>
<p>In contrast to the electroporation-based reporter analysis, reporter expression is observed in only a subset of embryos in each litter of the transgenic reporter mice. As shown in the representative images, the reporter expression is also restricted in limited cortical regions, the pattern of which varies among embryos with no apparent regional preferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b–d</xref>). The reporter expression is not correlated to the position of the embryo in the uterus or in the location of the EtOH injection within the dam. Gavage administration of EtOH induced similar heterogeneous reporter expression patterns. Since RFP (DsRed2) protein is stable and detectable for more than 4 days following induction (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>), the heterogeneous reporter expression is not due to capturing oscillatory activities of HSF1 transcription. FACS analysis revealed that the reporter-expressing cells consist of both Tuj1<sup>+</sup> immature neurons and Nestin<sup>+</sup> NPCs, but few NeuN<sup>+</sup> mature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>
<p>As the genomic insertion site of the transgene may compromise optimal observation of heterogeneous gene expression, we defined the genomic loci of transgene integration by paired-end whole genome sequencing of HSE–RFP transgenic mice. Of the two insertion sites identified, one is at the intergenic region on Chromosome 10, where a read pair is aligned to HSE and an intrinsic genomic region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). The second is on Chromosome 5, where two read pairs are aligned to either HSE or the DsRed2 sequence on one side, and to intrinsic sequences within a 3 kb genomic region on the other side (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). The sequences of these read pairs revealed that the transgene is inserted within an intron of the <italic>Tctn2</italic> gene, but in the opposite direction of its transcription. These results indicate that the observed heterogeneous transgene expression is independent of the influence of its transgene locus.</p>
<p>Heterogeneous activation of Hsf1–Hsp signalling in cortical cells was also confirmed by sporadic distribution of cells labelled with another molecular indicator, nuclear translocation of the HSF1, in both mouse and human embryonic cortices exposed to EtOH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Similar heterogeneous reporter expression patterns across embryos, as well as among cells within the brain and other tissues in each embryo, have been observed by prenatal exposure to other environmental factors including sodium arsenite, Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced maternal seizure, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p>
<p>Altogether, these results demonstrate cellular mosaicism after Hsf1–Hsp signal activation in the embryonic cerebral cortex. Consistent with the results obtained using <italic>Hsf1</italic> knockout mice exposed to environmental stressors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, our results also suggest that cells with low levels of activation face a higher risk of cell death under exposure to EtOH.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Excess Hsf1 activation impairs migration of cortical neurons</title>
<p>We observed the regions containing HSE–RFP reporter-expressing cells was often associated with delayed migration of immature neurons (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). To formally test this possibility, Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse labelling (a BrdU injection 30 min before the second injection of EtOH at E15 and observation at E18) was performed. The disturbed cell migration was observed in the domains with a significant number of reporter<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g–j</xref>). Similar migration defects of cortical neurons associated with the HSE–RFP expression have been observed by prenatal exposure to the drug suramin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. This suggests that the cells with high levels of Hsf1–Hsp signalling activation induced by EtOH and other environmental stressors undergo delayed migration. This appears independent of cell death, which does not differ between HSE–RFP reporter<sup>+</sup> and reporter<sup>-</sup> cells from the reporter transgenic embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine whether the high-level activation of Hsf1–Hsp signalling causally affects the migration of cortical neurons, an expression construct of the constitutively active form of HSF1 (caHSF1) or pCAGIG control plasmid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> was introduced into the cortex of wild-type mice by IUE at E14, and GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were dissociated 24 h post-electroporation. Quantification of <italic>Hsp70</italic> mRNA particles in individual cells using smFISH revealed that the activation level of Hsf1–Hsp signalling by caHSF1 was comparable to the top 5% levels induced by EtOH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, the expression of caHSF1 recapitulated the physiologically relevant level of HSF1 activation that occurred in a small population of cells in the events of challenged exposure. In the control electroporation, GFP<sup>+</sup> electroporated cells were located around layers II-IV at postnatal day (P) 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In all cases of caHSF1 introduction, however, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells formed clusters beneath the gray matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The full-length wild-type and the loss-of-function type R71A mutant, both of which lack the potency to sufficiently activate Hsf1–Hsp signalling, did not exhibit significant effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). EtOH exposure following caHSF1 electroporation did not have any obvious additional effects on heterotopia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). BrdU pulse labelling at E15, 1 day after IUE, and immunostaining for molecular markers such as NeuN (for mature neurons) and Cutl1 (upper layer neurons) at P14 indicated that caHSF1 expression did not affect neuronal differentiation/maturation and subtype specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a–l</xref>). The heterotopia began to develop as early as embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6m,n</xref>). Tuj1 labelling at E18 and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) at E16 showed that neither neuronal differentiation nor cell death appeared to be affected in the electroporated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f,g</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Disruptions of the ventricular surface, similar to those observed by <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to EtOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3b,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5h</xref>), were frequently found at the caHSF1-electroporated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e,h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis one day after electroporation of caHSF1 revealed that an impairment of adherens junctions in the GFP<sup>+</sup> NPCs aligned on the ventricular surface was involved in these disruptions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5i</xref>). Immunohistochemistry for Nestin also showed abnormalities in the radial morphology of caHSF1-expressing NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5h</xref>). These results suggest that the disrupted radial glial scaffold and the ventricular lining due to excess activation of HSF1 in NPCs might contribute to the impaired neuronal migration non-cell autonomously, as implied by the migration defects of non-electroporated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b–h</xref>) or reporter-negative cells in the EtOH-exposed cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>).</p>
<p>To formally define the relative contribution of the cell-autonomous effect of excess activation of HSF1 to the impaired neuronal migration, we expressed caHSF1 exclusively in migrating immature neurons using the CALSL/Tα1-Cre system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The results showed that excess HSF1 activation in migrating immature neurons was sufficient to impair the radial migration in a cell-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5j</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of <italic>Hsp70</italic>, a canonical downstream target of HSF1, did not disrupt the migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>), suggesting that the impaired neuronal migration was mediated by non-canonical downstream targets of Hsf1.</p>

<title>Excess Hsf1 activation induces permanent cell dispositioning</title>
<p>To better mimic the temporal HSF1 activation by environmental challenge exposures in the cases of human patients, we limited the expression of caHSF1 in a specific time window using the 4-OHT (active metabolite of tamoxifen)-inducible Cre/LoxP system. E14 cortices were electroporated with plasmids containing the constructs CAG-promoter-loxP-FLAGcaHSF1-loxp-GFP (CALHLG), pCAG-ER<sup>T2</sup>-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> (CAG-CreERT2), and pCAG-RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Expressing caHSF1 until after birth (to P0 or P3) caused the formation of large heterotopias compared with the vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e–i</xref>). Although very low levels of caHSF1 expression with a 4-OHT administration immediately after after caHSF1 introduction (6 h after IUE at E14) did not form heterotopias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,h,i</xref>), expression of caHSF1 until E15 or E16 was sufficient to lead to incomplete neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d,h,i</xref>). No migration defects by electroporation of pCALNL-GFP with CAG-CreERT2 and pCAG-RFP followed by 4-OHT injection were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7j</xref>). These results show that even a short period of HSF1 overactivation during prenatal development causes critical neuronal migration deficiency and confirms that the severity of deficiency critically depends on the duration of HSF1 overactivation. This is in line with the risk of the cortical maldevelopment which is proportional to levels/duration of exposure in general.</p>

<title>Reduction of Hsf1 reverses impaired cortical cell migration</title>
<p>To assess whether Hsf1 overactivation is not only sufficient but also required for the migration deficits, we next tested whether the reduction of Hsf1 activity could mitigate the migration defects elicited by EtOH. Since EtOH-induced Hsf1 overactivation and migration deficits occur sporadically in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), it is impossible to predict such domains to reduce Hsf1 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. We therefore performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> migration assay with cortical NPCs dissociated from E13 mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). To examine the cell autonomous effects of <italic>Hsf1</italic> knockdown, NPCs electroporated with <italic>Hsf1</italic> short hairpin RNA (shRNA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (or control shRNA) and non-electroporated NPCs were cultured together to generate neurospheres. Once the diameter of the neurospheres reached 50–100 μm, the cells were placed on coated plates to migrate out from the neurosphere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>) for 3 or 6 h in the condition with either EtOH or PBS. The number of Nestin<sup>+</sup> NPCs did not differ between those exposed to PBS or EtOH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b,c</xref>). However, the EtOH exposed group displayed a failure of migration out of the neurosphere in a significant number of NPCs electroporated with the control shRNA, which was not observed in the PBS controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c–f</xref>). smFISH analysis showed that the level of Hsf1 activation assessed by the number of <italic>Hsp70</italic> mRNA particles in each NPC and the distance of migration from the center of the neurosphere were negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). The rate of cell death and cell cycling did not differ between NPCs that migrated out of neurospheres and those that remained within neurospheres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8d,e</xref>). Introduction of <italic>Hsf1</italic> shRNA caused a sharp contrast, as the percentage of the NPCs that had migrated longer distances was increased significantly in cultures with EtOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c–f</xref>). <italic>Hsf1</italic> shRNA-mediated amelioration of migration defects was lost by overexpression of human HSF1 that is not targeted by the mouse <italic>Hsf1</italic> shRNA, confirming the specificity of the effect of <italic>Hsf1</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). These results indicate that excess activation of Hsf1 is directly responsible for EtOH-induced migration deficits.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This present study demonstrates that the level of activation of Hsf1–Hsp signalling on prenatal exposure to environmental stress is highly variable among cortical NPCs and immature neurons. We recently demonstrated that insufficient Hsf1–Hsp signalling activation on exposure to environmental challenges causes a higher incidence of leptomeningeal heterotopia, as well as defects in neuronal production and survival in the cerebral cortex, all of which are associated with increased risk of seizures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. This present study shows that excessive activation of Hsf1–Hsp signalling also leads to different abnormalities in cortical development such as neuronal migration defects and periventricular heterotopia. These findings suggest that the heterogeneous focal cortical malformations caused by discordant activation of the Hsf1–Hsp signalling in response to prenatal environmental stress may be an underlying mechanism in human clinical cases associated with phenotypic variations in which various types of focal cortical malformations exist in different cortical regions in each brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8g</xref>). Similar to <italic>de novo</italic> somatic mutations during the early stage of brain development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, small epigenetic mosaicism during the early developmental stage is likely to significantly impact later brain development, resulting in mosaic disorganization reported in the brains with psychiatric disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous studies demonstrated in microbes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, the present study suggests probabilistic activation of Hsf1–Hsp signalling in the NPCs of the mammalian brain. The results of the whole genome sequencing of the reporter transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) suggest reporter expression to occur ubiquitously throughout the body. Indeed, we observed broad expression in many tissues/organs including the eye, heart, liver and skin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. However, the expression patterns across various tissues and organs vary between animals. Potential factors for these differences include differential circulation/accumulation of EtOH between tissues/organs, differential activation of Hsf1–Hsp signalling between tissue/organ-specific cell types, and stochastic response of cells across tissue/organs. The results of our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrate the stochastic response of Hsf1–Hsp signalling to EtOH or other exposure among homogeneous cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1-2</xref>). Therefore, we believe that these various patterns of Hsf1–Hsp activation in tissue/organs strongly depend on, though may not be entirely due to, the stochastic response within the same cell populations. Reporter expression turnover, for example, may be an additional potential factor for the cell-to-cell difference. Given the unmet need for proper targeted therapies following acute exposure to environmental stressors during pregnancy, understanding the mechanisms of the stochastic activation and potential buffering mechanisms of such stochasticity is a critical next step. Mechanisms similar to TATA-box-involved transcriptional controls for evolutionary adaptation in microbes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> may be involved in the generation of stochasticity among cells. Differential cell fates of NPCs (neuronal versus glial, inhibitory versus excitatory neurons and so on) are additional factors that may affect cell-to-cell variability. A buffering mechanism of unequal transcriptions at the post-transcription level has recently been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p>
<p>We have shown that stochastic activation of Hsf1–Hsp signalling is induced <italic>in vitro</italic> by EtOH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MeHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> by prenatal exposure to EtOH using our reporter mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Hsf1–Hsp activation also occurs in the brain in a stochastic manner after prenatal exposure to several other stressors including MeHg, suramin, maternal seizures and sodium arsenite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In addition, prenatal exposure to suramin, similar to EtOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), is known to cause neuronal migration defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Therefore, these stressors are likely to share specific mechanisms presented in this study to ultimately affect cortical development. One potential mediator may be oxidative stress; many environmental factors including EtOH causes oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, and oxidation of HSF1 has been suggested to enhance HSF1 DNA binding activity to induce Hsf1–Hsp signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p>
<p>Several questions remain to be answered, including is whether Hsf1–Hsp signalling and other stress responsive signalling pathways are functionally integrated; whether their activations are concomitantly regulated, or if they take part in overlapping or compensatory roles; and how excessive Hsf1–Hsp activation delays the migration of cortical cells. We did not observe the delay of neuronal migration in either the <italic>Hsf1</italic> KO cortices even when under EtOH exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The overexpression of <italic>Hsp70</italic> did not affect the migration of cortical cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>), suggesting that the impaired neuronal migration may be mediated by non-canonical downstream targets of Hsf1. One possibility mechanism may be through controlling the transcription of microtubule-associated molecules such as <italic>Dcx</italic>, <italic>Dclk</italic>, <italic>p35</italic> and <italic>Ndel1</italic> via interaction with Hsf2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Of note, the cortical neurons that have stalled due to the lack of <italic>Dcx</italic> re-migrate by replenishment of the gene after birth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> while the reduction of Hsf1 activity after birth is not sufficient to reboot this migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). This suggests that genes other than microtubule-associated genes may critically mediate the migrational disruptions resulting from high-level Hsf1 activation. Other potential downstream target genes may be the genes controlling adherens junction formation which are disturbed by excess activation of Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<p>Serial sections of tissues were made using a standard procedure in our laboratory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>, and processed for the digital camera system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. Briefly, post-fixed tissue after immunohistochemistry with GFP antibody was embedded in Durcupan on microscope slides and coverslipped. Selected immunoreactive cells were traced with Neurolucida and photographed with an Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss). Selected areas were re-embedded into Durcupan blocks and cut by a Reichert ultramicrotome into 70 nm thick sections. These sections were then stained and imaged in a JEOL 1010 electron microscope equipped with Multiscan 792 digital camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA).</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> migration assay</title>
<p>E13 mouse cortices were dissected, and the NPCs were dissociated for neurosphere suspension culture. The NPCs were cultured at 1.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells ml<sup>−1</sup> in NPC medium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> in the presence of 20 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> EGF (Peprotech) and 20 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> FGF-2 (Peprotech) for 7 days. The culture was expanded by passaging three times. For electroporation, 8 μg of control shRNA or <italic>Hsf1</italic> shRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, 4 μg of <italic>Hsf1</italic> shRNA and full-length human HSF1 and 2 μg of pMAX-GFP (Amaxa) were used for 2–4 × 10<sup>6</sup> NPCs dissociated from the neurospheres. After electroporation, the NPCs were cultured with non-electroporated NPCs for 3 days to form neurospheres. The formed neurospheres with a diameter of 50-100 μm were then manually placed onto coated glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation), and cultured either with 400 mM EtOH or PBS for 3 or 6 h. After fixation, migrated NPCs were counted. The cells were also immunolabelled with anti-Nestin (1:50, DSHB), anti-Ki67 (1:10, Clone B56, BD Biosciences, 550609), and anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, #9654) antibodies.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Data were subjected to statistical analyses with SPSS (IBM), Prism 6 (GraphPad), and SigmaPlot 12 (Systat Software). Results were expressed as mean±s.e.m. unless otherwise indicated. All statistical analyses and calculation of <italic>P</italic> values were performed using either two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test for pairwise comparisons, 1-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests for multiple group comparisons, or Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test for the equality of probability distributions between two samples. Grouped analyses were completed without repeated measures. Non-normally distributed data were analysed by the corresponding nonparametric tests. Sample size was described in the legend of each figure. The variance was similar between groups being statistically compared. The sample size was at least three in most cases, and it allows us to achieve at least 80% standard power to detect the difference with 95% confidence. The sample size was not predetermined by statistical method. No data points were excluded from the analysis. We used blinded outcome assessment for our animal studies. All data collection and analyses were performed by experimenters blind to the experimental conditions (genotypes, treatments etc.). A <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. For statistical testing of probabilisticity, an experimental data set of predetermined 18 cell positions from each dish of hNPCs exposed to three types of environmental stress (12 dishes per type) was shuffled to generate a permutated set, and the average of Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCC) within the set was calculated using MATLAB. This process was repeated one thousand times to generate a distribution of the average PCC for the permutated sets, which was then compared with the average PCC within the experimental data set by employing one-sample <italic>Z</italic>-test<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>.</p>

(<bold>c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>) Quantification of <italic>HSP70</italic> and <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA puncta in hNPCs (AG09429 and GM03440) exposed to the indicated reagents. In the box plot, the line within the box indicates the median; the upper and lower edges of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. Error bars indicate the 10th and 90th percentiles and each dot indicates cells within the top/bottom 10th percentiles. The variability of <italic>HSP70</italic> mRNA particles was significantly increased in response to all these reagents compared to that with PBS exposure (*<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001 by Levene's test.

<p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>) pHSE- (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>c</bold>) or pmutHSE- (<bold>a</bold>) RFP was electroporated with pCAG–GFP into the mouse (C57NL/6J) lateral cortex at E14, followed by daily EtOH (<bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>) or PBS (control, c) administration to the dam until E16. The reporter expression (red) was observed in NPCs and neurons by electroporation of p HSE–RFP followed by EtOH administration (<bold>b</bold>). Electroporation of pmut HSE–RFP plasmid that contains point mutations in HSF1 binding sites in the promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) resulted in reporter expression in less than 0.1% of total electroporated (GFP<sup>+</sup>) cells in the cortex exposed to EtOH (<italic>n</italic>=22). Similarly, electroporation of p HSE–RFP in <italic>Hsf1</italic> KO mice resulted in no reporter induction by EtOH exposure (<italic>n</italic>=3/3).

CAG-promoter-loxP-FLAGcaHSF1-loxp-GFP (CALHLG) with CAG-RFP and CAG-CreERT2 was electroporated at E14. 4-OHT was administered at the indicated time points, and all samples were fixed at P14. 4-OHT administration at any time point consistently resulted in excision of the FLAGcaHSF1 unit (indicated by GFP expression) in over 95% of RFP<sup>+</sup> electroporated cells. FLAG immunohistochemistry confirmed complete sequestration of FLAG-tagged caHSF1 by 2 days after 4-OHT injection. (<bold>b</bold>–<bold>i</bold>) Distribution of the electroporated cells was observed at P14 after administration of 4-OHT or vehicle only (control) at different time points (<bold>b</bold>–<bold>g</bold>), and quantitatively analysed (<bold>h</bold>,<bold>i</bold>). Scale bar, 0.5 mm. Panel <bold>i</bold> shows pairwise comparisons of cumulative radial distributions using Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test. Each <italic>P</italic> value is shown in a color according to the scale at the bottom.

Excessive activation of HSF1 in a subpopulation of cortical cells, as detected in the reporter transgenic mouse (left), disrupts their normal developmental processes such as migration (green cells in middle panel). Moderate activation of the signalling that is detectable by <italic>IUE</italic>-based method, but not in the transgenic mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), serves to protect the cells from the environmental stressors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, left), and allows the cells develop normally (yellow cells in middle). Meanwhile, another subpopulation of cells may not have enough HSF1 activation to protect them from damage elicited by environmental challenges, thereby resulting in focal accumulation of dead cells or NPCs with impaired proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, the cells indicated by X in middle panel). These heterogeneous events of abnormal development occur probabilistically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), accounting for individually distinct pattern of focal cortical malformations in the cortex exposed to similar levels of environmental challenges (right panel).</p>
