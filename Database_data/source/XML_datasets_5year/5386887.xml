<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental disorder that manifests in social deficits, communication difficulties, stereotyped behaviors, and cognitive delays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Around 120 genes have been linked to ASD, often encoding proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and synapse function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Of these, at least 15 distinct mutations in the coding regions of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8 (<italic>CHD8</italic>), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, were identified in ASD subjects from exome sequencing of trio families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Most of these mutations are predicted to be loss-of-function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Subjects with <italic>CHD8</italic> mutations often display increased head circumference, cognitive deficits, as well as social interaction and communication difficulties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Little is known about the biological function of CHD8. It was initially identified as a binding partner and negative regulator of β-catenin signaling and was shown to be enriched in the promoters of transcriptionally active genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Homozygous deletion of <italic>Chd8</italic> in mice results in early embryonic lethality resulting from massive apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, there was no induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in <italic>Chd8</italic> null mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. CHD8 was also shown to be necessary for E2F1-dependent cell cycle gene activation during the G1/S transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Down-regulation of CHD8 in cultured cells resulted in impaired cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In contrast, an increase in the number of mitotic cells and head size were observed following suppression of the <italic>chd8</italic> ortholog in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Whereas the genetic and molecular underpinnings of ASD are heterogeneous, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that disrupted embryonic cortical development could be one of numerous defects underlying the etiology of ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Cortical development is a spatially and temporally regulated process that is defined by an early expansion of proliferative neural progenitor cells (NPCs) that reside in the ventricular zone (VZ) of cortical epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. At the onset of neurogenesis, NPCs undergo neurogenic divisions to produce pyramidal neurons that migrate radially to the cortical surface to generate the six layers of the neocortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Diverse signaling pathways govern the intricate balance between continued proliferation and cell cycle exit/differentiation. Of these, the role of canonical-Wnt signaling in cortical neural progenitor proliferation has been described extensively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. For instance, induction of Wnt signaling via overexpression of stabilized β-catenin increases neural progenitor proliferation by negatively regulating cell cycle exit/differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In addition to signaling mechanisms, epigenetic mechanisms also play a crucial role in the spatial and temporal control of developmental genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. For instance, polycomb group (PcG) proteins are important for maintaining genes necessary for differentiation in a temporally repressed, but poised state, which allows for their activation in response to the appropriate differentiation cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Here, we examine the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of Chd8 disruption on embryonic mammalian brain development. We show that <italic>in utero</italic> knockdown of Chd8 results in reduced cortical neural progenitor proliferation and altered neurogenesis. Transcriptional profiling of cortical neural progenitors via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) following Chd8 knockdown showed that down-regulated genes were enriched for cell cycle control and chromatin remodeling pathways. Up-regulated genes were highly enriched for repressive H3K27me3 chromatin, potentially due to reduced PRC2 complex activity. In contrast to previous <italic>in vitro</italic> findings in non-neuronal proliferating cells, our results indicate that Chd8 is a positive regulator of Wnt signaling in cells of neural lineage both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Finally, knockdown of Chd8 in developing cerebral cortex resulted in behavioral deficits in adult mice, which can be rescued upon overexpression of β-catenin. Together, these observations provide new insights into the roles of Chd8 in brain development, and how mutations in <italic>CHD8</italic> may contribute to ASD.</p>

<title>Chd8 is Highly Expressed in the Developing Brain</title>
<p id="P6">To understand whether <italic>CHD8</italic> has a role in cerebral cortical development, we first examined the temporal expression pattern of Chd8 in the developing mouse cortex. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis demonstrated that <italic>Chd8</italic> is highly expressed in the embryonic day 12 (E12) cortex, and that its expression decreases with the progression of corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). Furthermore, an assessment of <italic>CHD8</italic> expression in the developing human dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex (DFC, MFC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> revealed that <italic>CHD8</italic> is highly expressed in both DFC and MFC during early fetal development. <italic>CHD8</italic> expression peaks in early mid-fetal period in DFC and early fetal period in MFC. The temporal expression pattern of <italic>CHD8</italic> in the developing human DFC and MFC was very similar to that of mouse <italic>Chd8</italic>, with reduction in expression throughout early development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b,c</xref>). Finally, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiment revealed that <italic>Chd8</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in the developing cortex, and that in agreement with the results from our qPCR data above, <italic>Chd8</italic> expression in E12 cortex was higher than in E16 cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a,d</xref>). These initial studies suggest that <italic>Chd8</italic> could play an important role in cortical neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation.</p>

<title>Chd8 is Required for Cortical Neural Progenitor Proliferation</title>
<p id="P7">To determine the functions of Chd8 in the developing mouse cortex and because the ASD-associated <italic>CHD8</italic> mutations are predicted to lead to the loss of protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, we used two distinct shRNAs (sh1 and sh2) to knockdown <italic>Chd8</italic>. Transfection of N2a cells with these shRNAs led to robust reduction of endogenous <italic>Chd8</italic> expression, as well as reduced expression of <italic>Ccne2</italic>, a previously identified target of Chd8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2a,b</xref>). Next we performed <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation to knockdown <italic>Chd8</italic> in cortical progenitors at E13, and analyzed brains at E16. Either scrambled shRNA (Control) or Chd8 shRNAs expression constructs were used, in combination with a GFP expression construct to label electroporated cells. We first examined the distribution of GFP-positive (GFP<sup>+</sup>) cells in the embryonic mouse cerebral wall. A significant reduction in the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in the ventricular zone/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) of <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown animals compared to controls, along with a comparable increase in the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cell in the cortical plate (CP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). To examine if the loss of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from the VZ/SVZ was due to reduced neural progenitor proliferation, we pulse-labeled with BrdU 24 hours prior to analysis. The brains were immunolabeled with antibodies against BrdU, the proliferative marker Ki67, and GFP. <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNAs caused a significant decrease in BrdU incorporation in the GFP<sup>+</sup> cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,c</xref>). The reduction in cell proliferation was accompanied by increased cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,d</xref>). We further used phosphorylated histone-H3-S10 (pHH3) to label mitotically active cells and observed a significant decrease in mitotic activity in <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e,f</xref>). This was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the percentage of cells positive for neuronal marker Tuj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e,g</xref>). In addition to this, we observed that <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown caused a reduction in Sox2<sup>+</sup> neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3a,b</xref>), but that apoptosis was unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3a,c</xref>). These results, together with the increased number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the cortical plate and the reduced number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells, indicated that <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown resulted in a premature depletion of the neural progenitor pool in the developing mouse cortex.</p>
<p id="P8">We next electroporated an shRNA-resistant human <italic>CHD8</italic> (hCHD8) overexpression construct in conjunction with the control and <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2c</xref>). First, we found that overexpression of h<italic>CHD8</italic> together with the control shRNA caused increased BrdU incorporation and mitotic activity, as well as reduced cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Co-expression of h<italic>CHD8</italic> with mouse <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNAs was able to restore levels of BrdU incorporation, mitotic activity and cell cycle exit, as well as normalize the distribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells and the percentage of Tuj1<sup>+</sup> cells to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These experiments indicated that neural progenitor pool depletion and increased Tuj1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the embryonic brain following that <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown could result in a reduction in the total number of neurons produced in postnatal brain.</p>

<title>Chd8 is Important for the Expression of Cell Cycle Genes</title>
<p id="P9">To gain a deeper insight into how Chd8 regulates neural progenitor proliferation, we examined the transcriptome of neural progenitors following <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown. We performed <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation, targeting NPCs at E13, and using either control or <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNAs together with a GFP expression construct. The GFP<sup>+</sup> cell population was then isolated through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FAC-sorting) 48 hours following the <italic>in utero</italic> transfection. This approach ensured that our analysis included only transfected cell populations with the same birthdate. Following total RNA collection, we performed next-generation sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between control and <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> and Supplementary Dataset S1).</p>
<p id="P10">Our analysis revealed a total of 3762 genes in the Chd8 sh1 and 5245 genes in the <italic>Chd8</italic> sh2 knockdown samples that were differentially expressed compared with control samples (p-value &lt; 0.05 &amp; Fold Change &gt; 1.2; Dataset S2 and S3; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). To identify biological functions perturbed by <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown, we subjected the DEGs to gene ontology analysis of biological processes which showed that genes down-regulated by <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown are involved in regulation of cell cycle, chromosome organization, RNA processing, and cytoskeleton organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>, Supplementary Dataset S4 and S5). Up-regulated genes in <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown samples were enriched for processes relating to neuronal development such as neuron/cell differentiation, cell migration, and defense response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>, Supplementary Dataset S6 and S7). Supporting the analysis of biological processes, an analysis of the biological pathways enriched in the down-regulated genes revealed pathways relating to cell cycle, DNA replication and Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>, and Supplementary Dataset S8 and S9). Furthermore, mammalian (mouse) phenotype analysis of down-regulated genes were enriched for categories such as prenatal lethality, abnormal embryo/brain size, and abnormal brain development. Together these analyses suggest that Chd8 has an essential role in regulating prenatal genes necessary for proper embryonic development. We then validated a subset of downregulated (<italic>Akap8</italic>, <italic>Cdc7</italic>, <italic>Tacc3</italic>, <italic>Timeless</italic>, <italic>Notch2</italic>, <italic>Kif20b</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Tial1</italic>) and upregulated (<italic>Camk1d</italic>, <italic>Pak6</italic>, <italic>Fgf8</italic> and <italic>Jakmip1</italic>) genes via qPCR, and correlated these changes in expression with RNAseq data which showed significant Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Our results are consistent with previous studies that have assessed the transcriptional consequences of Chd8 suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. For instance, Sugathan <italic>et al</italic>. showed that, in hNPCs, CHD8 regulates genes highly expressed in developing brain and important for neurodevelopmental pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, other studies have shown that genes dysregulated following <italic>CHD8</italic> knockdown transcriptionally regulate cell cycle progression and neuronal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Furthermore, gene ontology of biological functions for chromatin organization and regulation of transcription were enriched in all dysregulated gene datasets. Overall, these results suggest that Chd8 has a dual role in regulating gene expression: 1) it promotes the expression of genes necessary for prenatal development and important for cell cycle progression, and 2) represses the expression of genes important for neuronal differentiation and maturation in embryonic cortical NPCs.</p>
<p id="P12">In addition to these results, we compared DEGs following <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown to SFARI AutDB gene database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and found that a substantial proportion of DEGs following <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown (sh1; 183 and sh2; 215) were SFARI ASD risk genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6a,b</xref> and Supplementary Dataset S10). These findings in the developing mouse brain suggest that Chd8 is an apical factor in the regulation of ASD risk genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Chd8 Is a Transcriptional Activator of Genes Necessary for Early Cortical Development</title>
<p id="P13">To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Chd8 controls gene expression during embryonic brain development, we generated a chromatin states map for the E12 mouse brain based on published chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data for seven chromatin marks (ENCODE, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.encodeprojects.org">www.encodeprojects.org</ext-link>). Genomic regions were classified into different chromatin states defined by combinations of these histone marks, including promoters, enhancers, transcribed, bivalent, repressed and low signal regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We then mapped CHD8 peaks from hNPCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, hNSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and human midfetal DFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> ChIP-seq datasets and Chd8 peaks from E17.5 mouse cortex ChIP-seq dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> to our chromatin states map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Both human and mouse Chd8 binding peaks were highly enriched for chromatin states associated with active promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>), suggesting that Chd8 binds to the promoters of actively transcribed genes. We then examined the overlap between CHD8 ChIP-seq peaks in hNSCs with differentially expressed genes in both of our <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown datasets, and found that 58.4% (367/628) of the differentially expressed genes following <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown contained CHD8 ChIP-seq peaks in their promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). A significant majority of these 367 differentially expressed genes (291; 79.5%) were down-regulated following <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown. These results suggest that Chd8 could function as a transcriptional activator in mouse cortical progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, we found that genes down-regulated by <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown are normally enriched for H3K27ac, a chromatin mark associated with active gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that Chd8 functions primarily as a transcriptional activator in neural progenitors. Cotney <italic>et al</italic>. previously published similar findings wherein active histone marks were enriched at transcription starting sites of CHD8 target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P14">In contrast to the scenario with down-regulated genes, we observe that up-regulated genes following <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown are normally enriched for H3K27me3, a chromatin mark associated with repressed gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). The levels of H3K27me3 are regulated through the activities of the PRC2 complex. Interestingly, our RNA-seq data revealed that the expression of two main components of the PRC2 complex, <italic>Ezh2</italic> and <italic>Suz12</italic>, were significantly attenuated upon <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown. The effects of <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown on these genes were further verified by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>). Additionally, infection of cultured mNPCs with <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA also caused a significant reduction in Ezh2 protein levels, which is the functional enzymatic component of the PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). Furthermore, published CHD8 ChIP-seq data sets show that CHD8 binds to the promoters EZH2 and SUZ12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These results suggest that <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown could up-regulate genes directly targeted by PRC2 complex. In fact, from analysis of publicly available CHD8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> , Ezh2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and Suz12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> ChIP-seq datasets, we find that among the fraction of up-regulated genes that lack <italic>CHD8</italic> binding within their promoters, a significant proportion (approximately 25%) are normally bound by Ezh2/Suz12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref>). These results suggest that the down-regulation PRC2 complex components could constitute an additional important mechanism by which Chd8 regulates gene expression.</p>
<p id="P15">Overall, our data provides key mechanistic insights into the dual function of Chd8 as a promoter of cell cycle progression, and a repressor of neural genes – Chd8 binds the promoters of cell cycle genes and serves as a transcriptional activator. At the same time, it also promotes PRC2 expression that allows for the repression of neural genes during this developmental period.</p>

<p id="P16">While <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown caused the down-regulation of a number of genes related to cell cycle progression, gene ontology of biological pathways analysis indicated that genes encoding for the Wnt signaling pathway were enriched among the genes down-regulated in <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). These include several of the primary transducers and effectors of the Wnt signaling pathway, such as <italic>Fzd1</italic>, <italic>Fzd2</italic>, <italic>Dvl2</italic>, <italic>Dvl3</italic> and <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> (Supplementary Dataset S2 and S3). Transcriptional dysregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by CHD8 in NSCs has also been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. To validate the findings from RNA-seq experiments, we processed FAC-sorted cells for qPCR analysis and found that Chd8 knockdown resulted in reduced expression of several Wnt signaling genes as well as a Wnt target gene (<italic>Ccnd1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). To understand whether Chd8 directly targets these genes, we performed Chd8 ChIP-qPCR experiments using mouse embryonic cortical tissue (E12), and found that Chd8 binds to the promoter regions of <italic>Fzd1</italic>, <italic>Dvl3</italic> and <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8b</xref>). Consistent with these results, analysis of publicly available human and mouse Chd8 ChIP-seq datasets revealed the enrichment of Chd8 at the promoters of <italic>FZD1/Fzd1, FZD2/Fzd2</italic>, <italic>DVL2/Dvl2</italic>, <italic>DVL3/Dvl3 and CTNNB1/Ctnnb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Together, these findings suggest that Chd8 is required for maintaining Wnt signaling in embryonic mouse cortical neural progenitors.</p>
<p id="P17">To further test this hypothesis, we used a luciferase reporter assay to measure Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity. First, we <italic>in utero</italic> transfected mouse embryonic NPCs with the luciferase construct along with either control or <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA. Cerebral cortical tissues were harvested to measure luciferase reporter activity 72 hours later. We found that, following knockdown of <italic>Chd8</italic>, TCF/LEF-reporter activity was markedly reduced compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of h<italic>CHD8</italic> resulted in a significant increase in TCF/LEF-reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Furthermore, co-expression of <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA along with h<italic>CHD8</italic> cDNA restored the Wnt signaling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Similarly, in N2a cells, both <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNAs markedly reduced Wnt signaling activity, and this effect can be normalized by co-expressing h<italic>CHD8</italic> cDNA alongside <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Contrary to our findings, previously published reports identified Chd8 as a negative regulator of canonical-Wnt/β-catenin signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that these earlier studies were conducted in non-neuronal cells, suggesting that Chd8 could play cell-type specific roles in regulating Wnt signaling. We therefore examined Wnt signaling in a non-neuronal cell line to determine if the regulation of Wnt signaling by Chd8 is cell type-specific. We conducted the TCF/LEF luciferase assay using human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells as used in Nishiyama <italic>et al</italic> (2011)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. We observed a significant up-regulation in Wnt signaling activity following <italic>CHD8</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>), consistent with previous reports using non-neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, <italic>CHD8</italic> knockdown did not affect the expression of Wnt signaling genes in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, we also examined the consequences of Chd8 loss-of-function on TCF/LEF luciferase activity in both mouse and human cultured NPCs. We found that knockdown of <italic>Chd8</italic> caused reduced Wnt signaling activity in both mouse and human NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e,f</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the influence of Chd8 on Wnt signaling is cell type-specific, and that Chd8 is a positive regulator of Wnt signaling in cells of neural progenitors.</p>

<title>Increased β-catenin expression can counteract Chd8-knockdown-associated phenotypes</title>
<p id="P19">Our findings suggest that Chd8 could stimulate Wnt signaling activity in proliferating neural cell lines, in part through transcriptional regulation of multiple Wnt pathway components. β-catenin is the critical downstream component of the Wnt signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Upon activation of canonical-Wnt signaling, β-catenin is stabilized in the cytoplasm and subsequently enters the nucleus, where it binds to TCF/LEF family transcription factors to activate expression of Wnt target genes such as Ccnd1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To determine if Chd8 regulates cortical progenitor proliferation via Wnt signaling, we expressed a degradation-resistant β-catenin mutant construct (S37A) alongside <italic>Chd8</italic> sh2. Expression of stabilized β-catenin rescued TCF/LEF luciferase activity following <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown in embryonic mouse brain (E13-E16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>) and in N2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">We next evaluated if increased Wnt signaling activity could also rescue reduced progenitor proliferation downstream of <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown. We performed <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E13 with control or <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA and co-expressed either control empty vector or stabilized β-catenin constructs. The pregnant dams were injected with BrdU 48 hours later at E15, and the embryos were harvested at E16. As shown earlier, we observed a significant shift of GFP<sup>+</sup> cell from the VZ/SVZ to the CP in <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c,d</xref>). The altered distribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells was normalized upon stabilized β-catenin co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c,d</xref>). Furthermore, stabilized β-catenin also rescued the levels of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c,e</xref>), cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c,f</xref>), increased Tuj1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5g,i</xref>), and normalized mitotic index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5g,h</xref>) phenotypes that occurred in response to <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown.</p>
<p id="P21">Finally, we assessed whether the induction Wnt signaling could also ameliorate the transcriptional dysregulation caused by <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown. To this end, we performed <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E13 using control or <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA expression constructs and co-expressed either control empty vector or stabilized β-catenin constructs, respectively. Following FAC sorting of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells at E15, the samples were subjected to RNA-seq as described above. Consistent with the effects of stabilized β-catenin on neurogenesis and Wnt luciferase activity, the expression of many dysregulated genes was normalized upon β-catenin stabilization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10a</xref> and Supplementary Dataset S11). This is consistent with the findings that LEF1 consensus motif (CTTTGT) is the most significantly enriched transcription factor binding motif among genes down-regulated in response to <italic>Chd8</italic> sh2 knockdown (Supplementary Dataset S5). Additionally, the expression of both <italic>Ezh2</italic> and <italic>Suz12</italic> was restored to control levels following the expression of stabilized β-catenin (Dataset S11 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure Supplementary Figure 10b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">Together, these data underscore the role of Chd8 in maintaining Wnt signaling in embryonic cortical progenitors and indicate that impaired Wnt signaling following Chd8 knockdown underlies abnormal cortical progenitor proliferation, neuronal differentiation defects and transcriptional dysregulation of genes important for proper cortical development.</p>

<title>Reduced Chd8 Expression in Upper Layer Cortical Neurons in the Developing Brain Results in Behavioral Abnormalities in Adult Mice</title>
<p id="P23">To evaluate the possible outcome of reduced Chd8 function during cortical development in adult animals, we performed bilateral <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E15, which targets neurons destined to populate cortical layers 2/3, with either control or <italic>Chd8</italic> sh2 along with membrane bound GFP or cytoplasmic-GFP. Bilateral targeting of upper layer cortical neurons was examined in these animals following behavioral testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11a,b</xref>). No significant difference in basic locomotor activity was observed between the groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11d–h</xref>). Similarly, contextual fear conditioning test revealed no differences in learning behavior between the two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11i</xref>). We then examined the conflict between exploration and risk avoidance using the light/dark box test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA group exhibited significant reductions in entries to and amount of time spent in the light chamber compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a,b</xref>), suggesting increased aversion following Chd8 loss-of-function. We further employed the elevated plus maze<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA mice entered and spent significantly less time in the open arms of the maze compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c,d</xref>), further supporting the notion that reduced <italic>Chd8</italic> expression in late cortical progenitor cells resulted in altered anxiety-dependent exploratory drive in adult mice.</p>
<p id="P24">One of the most commonly observed behavioral deficits in ASD and other psychiatric patients is abnormal social interaction. We used the three-chamber social arena assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> to examine the sociability of control and Chd8 knockdown mice. In this assay mice are allowed to explore the empty arena during an initial habituation period, which is followed by a period where a novel mouse (Stranger) is held inside a wired cage in one of the lateral chambers and an identical cage with a novel inanimate object (Empty) is placed in the opposing lateral chamber.. During the habituation period, both control and <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA mice explored the two lateral chambers equally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 12a</xref>). When the novel mouse was introduced, as expected the control mice displayed a preference for the lateral chamber with the novel mouse, whereas the <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA group did not show a preference for either chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6e</xref>). Furthermore, whereas control mice spent significantly more time in close interaction with the cage containing the novel mouse (within 5 cm), <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown mice did not show any preference for either cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6f</xref>). We did not observe any deficits in exploratory behavior as both groups spent similar amount of total time interacting with both the wired cages, suggesting that social interaction deficits in <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA group cannot be attributed to lack of exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 12b</xref>). These data suggest that knockdown of Chd8 in neural progenitors destined for upper layer cortical neurons manifests in reduced anxiety-dependent exploratory drive and abnormal social interaction behavior in adult mice.</p>
<p id="P25">Given that β-catenin overexpression could rescue the defects in Wnt signaling activity and cortical progenitor proliferation downstream of Chd8 loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), we asked whether increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling could also rescue the behavioral abnormalities associated with <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown. To test this hypothesis, we performed <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E15 and expressed stabilized β-catenin alongside <italic>Chd8</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure F11c</xref>). Co-expression of stabilized β-catenin rescued the number of entries to light chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>), amount of time spent in light chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>), number of entries to open arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>) and time spent in open arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>). Furthermore, rescue group spent significantly more time in the chamber with novel social mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6e</xref>), and spent more time in close interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6f</xref>). These results suggest that impaired Wnt/β-catenin signaling could underlie the behavioral deficits associated with Chd8 loss-of-function.</p>
<p id="P26">To determine whether knockdown of <italic>Chd8</italic> expression in the developing cortex affects long-term neuronal abnormalities in the adult brain, we examined the number, localization, dendritic complexity and spine density of neurons. For these studies, the <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation was performed using shRNA constructs co-electroporated with either membrane bound-GFP or cytoplasmic-GFP. We observed a significant reduction in the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 13a,b</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown also resulted in mislocalization of GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 13a,c</xref>). An assessment of dendritic arborization of layer 2/3 neurons using Sholl analysis revealed markedly reduced dendritic branching in <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown samples compared to control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6g,h</xref>). Additionally, measurement of total spine density on the secondary branches of apical dendrites showed significant reduction following Chd8 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 13d,e</xref>). Finally, increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling was sufficient to restore the complexity of dendritic arborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6g,h</xref>). Reduced dendritic spine density in <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown neurons were significantly increased following induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, however, it did not reach the control levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 13d,e</xref>). These results are consistent with previous findings showing that induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling increases dendritic complexity and spine density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In sum, our observations suggest that Chd8 plays a crucial role in establishing proper cortical circuitry, and that the disruption of neuronal morphology and neuronal connectivity due to Chd8 loss-of-function could contribute to the observed behavioral abnormalities in adult mice.</p>

<title>Chd8 is essential for cortical progenitor proliferation and differentiation</title>
<p id="P27">Our results indicate that the chromatin remodeler, Chd8, plays a crucial role in mammalian cortical development by promoting the proliferation of neural progenitors in two distinct ways. On the one hand, Chd8 directly binds to the promoters of cell cycle genes, and facilitates their expression, while on the other Chd8 also regulates neurogenic divisions by targeting the PRC2 complex. Previous studies have shown that the absence of Ezh2 drives neural progenitors in the developing cortex towards neurogenic division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Together, these activities ensure the generation of appropriate numbers of neurons during cortical development.</p>
<p id="P28">An overwhelming body of literature on the role of CHD8 and other CHD proteins supports our findings. Depletion of <italic>Chd8</italic> resulted in reduced cell proliferation in mammalian cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Chd8 is closely related to Chd6/7/9. Chd7, an interacting partner of Chd8, has been shown to be necessary for proliferation of inner ear neuroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and NSCs in the olfactory epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> in mice, as well as cellular proliferation in multiple tissues of zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Deletion of ChdC in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, an ortholog of the mammalian Class III CHD group which contains Chd5–9, impaired cell growth due to reduced expression of cell cycle genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Interestingly, knockdown of <italic>CHD8</italic> in zebrafish caused an increase in the number of newborn neurons and resulted in macrocephaly, although there was a reduction in the number of enteric neurons in the GI tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The reason for these differences is presently unclear. A more detailed and direct analysis of neural progenitor proliferation in zebrafish should clarify this matter. Our results suggest that embryonic Chd8 knockdown would results in reduced number of neurons in the adult brain. However, because our experiments are limited to analysis of NPCs, we cannot elucidate the role of Chd8 in development of other cell types such as astrocytes. It is possible that dysregulation of Chd8 in other cells could alter the size or number of these cells, contributing to macrocephaly phenotype observed among ASD patients with CHD8 mutations.</p>

<title>Chd8 positively regulates Wnt signaling in neural progenitor cells</title>
<p id="P29">Canonical-Wnt signaling plays important roles in brain development through the regulation of cell cycle progression and dendritic morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Importantly, defects in Wnt signaling have been strongly implicated in the development of ASD. Mutations in several pathway components have been identified in ASD patients, and convergent pathway analyses indicate that many apparently unrelated ASD mutations also impinge on the Wnt signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Earlier work on the function of Chd8 demonstrated that it negatively regulates Wnt signaling. Unexpectedly however, we found that multiple components of canonical-Wnt signaling were down-regulated upon loss of Chd8 in neural progenitors. Our efforts to resolve these differences have led to the discovery that Chd8 regulates Wnt signaling in a cell-type specific manner – whereas CHD8 loss-of-function increases Wnt signaling in non-neuronal cells, its loss attenuates Wnt signaling in neural progenitors. Cell type-specific regulation by Chd8 is not unprecedented. Drosophila ortholog of Chd8, Kismet, regulates <italic>hedgehog (hh)</italic> expression in the wing imaginal disc in a context when expression of the repressor, Ci-75, is low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. However, Kismet is not necessary for the regulation of <italic>hh</italic> expression when Ci-75 expression is high, suggesting a context-dependent function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. A similar context-dependent mechanism could account for differences in regulation of Wnt signaling by Chd8. Overall, our observations suggest that whereas Chd8 promotes cell proliferation in both neural and non-neural cells, it selectively promotes Wnt signaling in neural progenitors.</p>

<title>Sustained expression of Chd8 in the developing cortex is necessary for normal adult behavior</title>
<p id="P30">Abnormal social interaction, anxiety and intellectual disability are some of the behavioral deficits observed among ASD patients carrying <italic>CHD8</italic> mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that restricted Chd8 loss-of-function in developing mouse brain also produces behavioral deficits such as abnormal social interaction. Interestingly, normal adult behavior and proper cortical development were restored upon overexpression of stabilized β-catenin, indicating that behavioral abnormalities likely stem from abnormal cortical development. We did not observe any deficits in learning and memory; however, <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown was confined to specific layers of the developing cortex. It is possible that Chd8 loss-of-function in other regions of the developing brain may affect additional behaviors. Future studies on the effects of whole brain Chd8 loss-of-function on adult behavior would be of importance. Thus, it remains to be determined whether the mechanisms described here apply to germline loss-of-function mutations observed in ASD subjects.</p>
<p id="P31">In sum, our observations suggest that in the developing mouse brain Chd8 maintains neural progenitor proliferation through regulation of cell cycle genes. Furthermore, our results raise the possibility that some of the ASD associated behavioral abnormalities in patients carrying <italic>CHD8</italic> mutations may be caused by impaired development of cerebral cortical regions. Though Chd8 may be regulating neural progenitor proliferation through different ways, induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is sufficient to mitigate cortical development and adult behavioral deficits caused by <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown.</p>

<title>Brain Sections</title>
<p id="P40">Following dissection, embryonic cortical brains were drop-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and then transferred to 30% sucrose/PBS solution at 4°C. Brains were embedded in O.C.T. compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and sliced into 14 µm sections using cryostat. Cryosections were rehydrated with 1X PBS and blocked for 1 – 2 hours with blocking solution (1X PBS + 10% Donkey Normal Serum + 0.3% Triton-X). Following blocking, the cryosections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Incubation with secondary antibodies were performed for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, cryosections were mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen).</p>

<title>Genome-Wide RNA-sequencing and Bioinformatic Analyses</title>
<p id="P42">Following total RNA isolation from FAC sorted GFP-positive cells using Rneasy Plus Kit (Qiagen), RNA was quality controlled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Next, poly-A purified samples were converted to cDNA using the Clontech Low Input Library Prep Kit (Cat#: 634947) by MIT BioMicro Center. High-throughput sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at the MIT BioMicro Center. The raw FASTQ data files of 40-bp or 75-bp pair-end reads were collected for downstream analysis. Sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse genome assembly (mm9) using TopHat2 (version 2.0.12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>) with inner distance between mate pairs=200, segment length=20, no coverage search to speed up the process, and default for other parameters. Differential expression analysis was performed using Cuffdiff module of Cufflinks (version 2.1.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>) with default parameters, and FPKM values were normalized by the geometric method that Cuffdiff recommends.

Duplicate reads were removed using Samtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Mouse genome segmentation based on combinatorial histone marks was trained using ChromHMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> with the default parameters. In brief, sequencing reads were counted in non-overlapping 200-bp bins across the whole gnome; each bin was binarized with either 1 for enriched or 0 for non-enriched based on a Poisson <italic>P</italic>-value (threshold 1×10<sup>−4</sup>) that compares ChIP-Seq signals against whole-cell extract signals. Models with different numbers of states (from 10 to 14) were tested, and a model with 13 states was chosen. Annotation of those chromatin states was based on known classification of histone marks and relative enrichment of genic and non-genic regions of reference genes. Mouse Chd8, Ezh2, and Suz12 ChIP-Seq peak files were directly downloaded or called using raw data files downloaded from GEO database (GSE57369<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, GSE31655<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, GSE27148<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, mm9 assembly) for chromatin state enrichment analysis.

<title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</title>
<p id="P47">Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Magnetic Beads, 9005, Cell Signaling Technology) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, tissue from 6 mouse cortices (embryonic day 12) were pooled for each experiment. Cortical cell samples were finely minced and crosslinked with formaldehyde (1.5% final concentration) for 20 min at room temperature, chilled on ice with 10X glycine and washed once with ice cold PBS. Samples were passed through 30G needle to homogenize and create single cell suspension. Cells were resuspended in 1X Buffer A containing 0.1 mM DTT and incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by incubation in 1X Buffer B containing 0.1 mM DTT. Micrococcal Nuclease was added to mix and incubated for 20 min at 37°C vortexing every 3 min. The reaction was stopped with 50 mM EDTA (final concentration). Centrifuged pellet was resuspended in 1× ChIP buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Resuspended nuclei were sonicated using a bioruptor (medium power, 30 seconds on/30 seconds off – 10 cycles). Sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 5 µg antibodies against Chd8 (A301-224A, Bethyl Laboratories) and IgG overnight at 4°C. Next day, ChIP grade protein G magnetic beads were added and incubated for 2 hours at 4°C. Crosslinked protein-DNA complexes were eluted from the beads using 1X ChIP elution buffer, and incubated 65°C for 30 min, followed by reversion of crosslinking with NaCl and Proteinase K (65°C for 2 hours).

All behavioral experiments were performed during the light cycle. Investigator was blinded to the group allocation during both the experiment and assessing the outcome. Ear-tag identification numbers were used until outcome analysis were finalized. Mice that were tested on multiple behavioral paradigms were given a minimum of 1 week resting period between experiments. 3 animals for control condition and 4 animals for Chd8 shRNA condition were excluded from the study due to unsuccessful bilateral targeting of cortex (i.e. GFP+ cell only in one hemisphere or no transfection), and randomization of experimental groups was not required.</p>
