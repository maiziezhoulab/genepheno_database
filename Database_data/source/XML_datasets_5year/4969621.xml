<abstract>
<p>Gene abnormalities in <italic>RBFOX1,</italic> encoding an mRNA-splicing factor, have been shown to cause autism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Since pathophysiological significance of the dominant nuclear isoform in neurons, <italic>RBFOX1</italic>-isoform1 (iso1), remains to be elucidated, we performed comprehensive analyses of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 during mouse corticogenesis. Knockdown of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation caused abnormal neuronal positioning during corticogenesis, which was attributed to impaired migration. The defects were found to occur during radial migration and terminal translocation, perhaps due to impaired nucleokinesis. Axon extension and dendritic arborization were also suppressed <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient cortical neurons. In addition, electrophysiology experiments revealed significant defects in the membrane and synaptic properties of the deficient neurons. Aberrant morphology was further confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses; <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-konckdown in hippocampal neurons resulted in the reduction of primary axon length, total length of dendrites, spine density and mature spine number. Taken together, this study shows that <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 plays an important role in neuronal migration and synapse network formation during corticogenesis. Defects in these critical processes may induce structural and functional defects in cortical neurons, and consequently contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders with <italic>RBFOX1</italic> abnormalities.</p>

<body>
<p><italic>RBFOX1</italic>, also known as Ataxin-2-binding protein 1 (A2BP1) or FOX1, was first identified as an interacting partner for ATAXIN-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, and is expressed in neuronal tissues as well as muscle and heart<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. By binding to the (U)GCAUG element in mRNA precursors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <italic>RBFOX1</italic> has been reported to play a pivotal role in alternative splicing of genes critical for neuronal development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence strongly suggests a role of <italic>RBFOX1</italic> in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and genome-wide linkage studies (GWAS) have demonstrated that <italic>RBFOX1</italic> is associated with autism ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and chromosome region 16p13, where <italic>RBFOX1</italic> is located, was identified as the location of ASD-implicated genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In addition, <italic>RBFOX1</italic> target transcripts predicted by bioinformatic methods significantly overlap with genes implicated in ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Furthermore, using a sophisticated system biology approach (weighed gene co-expression network analysis), <italic>RBFOX1</italic> was found to serve as a “hub” in ASD-gene transcriptome networks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Notably, reduced expression of <italic>RBFOX1</italic> in a subset of ASD patient brains was shown to correlate with altered splicing of its predicted target exons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and massive splicing changes were detected in 48 ASD-susceptibility genes in ASD patient brains where downregulation of <italic>RBFOX1</italic> was supposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
<p>ASD-implicated genes are generally associated with other neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, and none of them are specific for ASD. The same is true of <italic>RBFOX1</italic>. For instance, gene abnormalities in <italic>RBFOX1</italic> have also been associated with intellectual disability (ID) with epilepsy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Therefore, common pathophysiological mechanism(s) mediated by <italic>RBFOX1</italic> abnormalities may underlie the clinical outcome of the aforementioned disorders, although unidentified modifiers might contribute to their clinical complexity. To better understand the pathophysiological basis of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, elucidating the physiological function(s) of <italic>RBFOX1</italic> in the cortical development is essential. While we have recently analyzed the pathophysiological relevance of the minor neuronal cytoplasmic isoform, <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-isoform5 (A2BP1-A030), which was referred to as <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, the pathophysiological significance of the dominant neuronal nuclear isoform, <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-isoform1 (A2BP1-A016; <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1), remains to be clarified. Thus, we here carried out comprehensive analyses of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 to elucidate its role in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title><italic>In utero</italic> electroporation</title>
<p>Pregnant ICR mice were purchased from SLC Japan (Shizuoka, Japan). <italic>In utero</italic> electroporation was performed essentially as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Briefly, 1 μl of nucleotide solution containing expression plasmids and/or pSuper-RNAi plasmid (1 μg each) were introduced with pCAG-EGFP or pCAG-RFP (red fluorescent protein) into the lateral ventricles of embryos, followed by electroporation using CUY21 electroporator (NEPA Gene, Chiba, Japan) with 50 ms of 35 V electronic pulse for 5 times with 450 ms intervals. At least 3 brains were used for each experiment.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>5-ethynil-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation experiments</title>
<p>Embryos were electroporated <italic>in utero</italic> with pCAG-H2B-EGFP vector together with pSuper-H1.shLuc (control) or pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1#1 at E14. Forty h after electroporation, pregnant mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of EdU at 25 mg/kg body weight. One h after injection, brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and frozen sections were obtained. GFP and EdU were detected with anti-GFP and Alexa Fluor555 azide (Life Technologies Japan), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s protocols.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Time-lapse imaging</title>
<p>After <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation, organotypic coronal slices (250 μm thick) from the interventricular foramen were prepared with a microtome, placed on an insert membrane (pore size, 0.4 μm; Millipore, Bedford, MA), mounted in agarose gel and cultured. The dishes were then mounted in an incubator chamber (5% CO2 and 40%O2, at 37 °C) fitted onto an FV1000 confocal laser microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the primary somatosensory cortex was examined as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Approximately 8–15 optical Z sections were acquired automatically every 8 to 15 min for 24 h, and about 10 focal planes (~50 μm-thickness) were merged to visualize the entire shape of the cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Quantitative analysis of axon growth</title>
<p>For estimation of axon growth, RFP signal intensity of the callosal axons was measured in a 170 × 150 μm rectangle on both the ipsilateral (before entering the corpus callosum (CC)) and contralateral (after leaving the CC) sides at the positions indicated. The ratio of the axonal RFP signals in the contralateral side to the corresponding ipsilateral side was calculated using Adobe Photoshop software.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Quantitative analysis of spine morphologies <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>Transfected neurons were visualized by immunostaining of GFP and chosen randomly. Images were obtained using an FV-1000 confocal microscope. We usually took 0.5 μm-z series stacks to generate image projections for quantitative analysis. To analyze spine morphology, 150–250 spines (from 16–21 neurons) were measured for each condition. For the analysis of spine density, spines were defined as 0.5–6 μm-length, with or without a head, and measured by counting the number of protrusions at 10 μm-length of primary dendrites. Spine density was first averaged per neuron and means from multiple individual neurons were calculated. Morphological assessments of spine density and shape were conducted blindly.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Slice preparation for electrophysiology</title>
<p>Mice were killed at postnatal days (P)4 or 7 by decapitation under deep isoflurane anaesthesia, and coronal slices were cut (300 μm-thickness) using a microslicer (PRO7, Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan) in ice-cold oxygenated cutting Krebs solution of the following composition (mM): choline chloride, 120; KCl, 2.5; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 26; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25; D-glucose, 15; ascorbic acid, 1.3; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 7. The slices were then transferred to a holding chamber containing standard Krebs solution of the following composition (mM): NaCl, 124; KCl, 3; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 26; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2; D-glucose, 10; pH 7.4 when bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>–5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were incubated in the holding chamber at room temperature (21–26 °C) for at least 1 hour before recording.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Whole-cell recording and data analysis</title>
<p>For recoding, a slice was transferred to the recording chamber, held submerged, and superfused with standard Krebs solution (bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>–5% CO<sub>2</sub>) at a rate of 3–4 ml/min. Neurons in layer II of the cortex were visualized with a 60× water immersion objective attached to an upright microscope (BX50WI, Olympus Optics, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescent pyramidal neurons were visualized using the appropriate fluorescence filter (U-MWIG3, Olympus). Images were captured with a cooled CCD camera (CCD-300 T-RC, Nippon roper, Tokyo, Japan) and displayed on a video monitor. Patch pipettes for whole-cell recording were made from standard-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (Clark Electromedical, Reading, UK). For the recording of spontaneous or evoked synaptic currents, patch pipettes were filled with a cesium chloride-based internal solution of the following composition (mM): CsCl, 140; NaCl, 9; Cs-EGTA, 1; Cs-HEPES, 10; Mg-ATP, 2. For the recording of membrane potentials, a K-gluconate-based internal solution of the following composition (mM) was used: K-gluconate, 120; NaCl, 6; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; K-EGTA, 0.2; K-HEPES, 10; Mg-ATP, 2; Na-GTP, 0.3. Whole-cell recordings were made from fluorescent pyramidal neurons using a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA). The cell capacitance and the series resistance were measured from the amplifier. The access resistance was monitored by measuring capacitative transients obtained in response to a hyperpolarizing voltage step (5 mV, 25 ms) from a holding potential of −65 mV. No correction was made for the liquid junction potentials (calculated to be 5.0 mV by pCLAMP7 software, Molecular Devices). Synaptic currents were evoked at a rate of 0.2 Hz (every 5 s) by extracellularly delivered voltage pulses (0.2–0.4 ms in duration) of suprathreshold intensity via a stimulating electrode filled with 1 M NaCl. The stimulating electrode was placed within 50–120 μm radius of the recorded neuron. The position of the stimulating electrode was varied until a stable response was evoked in the recorded neuron. Experiments were carried out at room temperature.</p>
<p>Data were stored on digital audio tapes using a DAT recorder (DC to 10 kHz; Sony, Tokyo, Japan). Evoked EPSCs were digitized off-line at 10 kHz (low-pass filtered at 2 kHz with an 8-pole Bessel filter) using pCLAMP9 software (Molecular Devices). The effects of drugs on the evoked IPSCs were assessed by averaging their amplitudes for 100 s (20 traces) after the effect had reached the steady state and comparing this value with the averaged amplitude of 20 traces just before the drug application. Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) or sIPSCs were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz using pCLAMP9 software and analyzed using N software (provided by Dr. S. F. Traynelis, Emory University).</p>

<title>Roles of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in neuronal positioning during corticogenesis</title>
<p>Since neuronal migration is essential for corticogenesis, we examined the role of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in the migration of newly generated cortical neurons by RNAi experiments. We first confirmed that pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1#1 efficiently knocked down exogenous mouse (m)<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in COS7 cells and endogenous <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in primary cultured mouse hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). It should be noted here that we could not prepare another RNAi vector specific for m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1, since <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 is identical to <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso5 except for the C-terminal 66 aa. We thus had to use pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1/2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, which targets a common sequence with <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso5, as the second RNAi vector. Notably, neither pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1#1 nor –iso1#2 silenced <italic>Rbfox1</italic> homologous proteins, mRbfox2 and mRbfox3, in COS7 cells, indicating the specificity of these RNAi vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
<p>pCAG-EGFP was coelectroporated with pSuper-H1.shLuc (control) or pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-RNAi vectors into progenitor and stem cells lining the ventricular zone (VZ) of embryonic day (E)14.5 mice brains by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation. When harvesting and analysis at P3, it was found that control neurons were located in the superficial layers (bin 1; layers II∼III) of the cortical plate (CP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <italic>Control</italic> panel, and B). In contrast, <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient neurons were abnormally distributed in the lower zone of the CP and intermediate zone (IZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <italic>iso1#1</italic> and <italic>#2</italic> panels, and B). Since cell morphology is closely associated with cell migration, we examined the shape of the deficient neurons with abnormal positioning in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>. The deficient neurons frequently had a long process extending toward the VZ although these cells maintained bipolar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 may regulate cortical neuron morphology. We confirmed the knockdown of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in cortical neurons with migration defects by performing immunohistochemical staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Analysis of cortical migration at a later time point (P7) again demonstrated a migration delay with many <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-deficient cells failing to reach their target destination (layers II–III) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>).</p>
<p>Rescue experiments were then performed to rule out off-target effects. To this end, we used m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1R that was resistant to pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1#1-mediated silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). When pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1#1 was coelectroporated with pCAG-Myc-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1R, positional defects were rescued at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>), indicating that the abnormal positioning observed was indeed caused by reduction of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 expression.</p>
<p>We next examined if Rbfox2 and Rbfox3 are implicated in the cortical neuron positioning since these proteins are highly homologous to <italic>Rbfox1</italic>. pSuper-mRbfox2 and –mRbfox3 efficiently knocked down mRbfox2 and mRbfox3, respectively, in COS7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). When endogenous Rbfox2 or Rbfox3 was silenced in stem and progenitor cells in VZ at E14.5, the neurons migrated normally to the superficial layer (bin 1; layers II~III) of CP as in the control experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). These experiments strongly suggest that Rbfox2 and Rbfox3 are not involved in the positioning of cortical neurons under our experimental conditions. On the other hand, Rbfox2 is crucial for cerebellar development and mature motor function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> while gene abnormalities of RBFOX3 contribute to the generalized idiopathic epilepsy syndromes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. It remains to be clarified if RBFOX3 and RBFOX2 are involved in the establishment of cortical architecture and neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD.</p>
<p>As it has previously been shown that the expression of Rbfox2 (but not Rbfox3) is increased in the brain of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-knockout mouse, we analyzed the expression of endogenous Rbfox2 in the <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. We found that the expression of endogenous Rbfox2 in cortical neurons was not affected by the acute knockdown of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d,e</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the abovementioned abnormal phenotypes were due to <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-silencing and not secondary effects due to changes in Rbfox2 levels.</p>

<title><italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 does not regulate neuronal progenitor proliferation</title>
<p>Previous study has shown that cell cycle defects can result in neuronal migration delay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We thus asked if the migration delay in this study was caused by cell cycle delay. To this end, we looked into the effect of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-silencing on the cell cycle of stem and progenitor cells in VZ/subventricular zone (SVZ). E14.5 cortices were coelectroporated with pCAG-H2B-EGFP together with pSuper-H1.shLuc (control) or pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1#1. To detect DNA replication, EdU incorporation was done as described in “Materials and Methods”. After coronal sections were visualized for GFP and EdU, the ratio of EdU/GFP double-positive cells among GFP-positive cells was determined (Control, 20.3 ± 2.08 (n = 3); iso1#1, 18.3 ± 0.577(n = 4)). Numbers of cells used for each calculation were more than 100. These results indicate that <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient cells entered S-phase to a similar extent when compared to control cells and that the rate of G1-progression was not statistically different between control and <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient cells. We therefore assume that knockdown of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 did not affect cell division/proliferation at VZ/SVZ. Since <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 was not involved in the cell cycle of VZ cells and not expressed in VZ/SVZ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, abnormal positioning of cortical neurons by <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-knockdown was most likely to be caused by migration defects.</p>

<title>Time-lapse imaging of migration of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient neurons in cortical slices</title>
<p>Newborn cortical neurons are primarily multipolar and exhibit slow and irregular movement in the lower IZ. After a certain period (~24 h), they transform into a bipolar shape with a leading process and an axon in the upper IZ, move into CP and exhibit radial migration toward pial surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. We performed detailed analyses of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in neuronal migration and morphology in IZ and CP by time-lapse imaging. To this end, VZ cells were coelectroporated with pCAG-EGFP together with the control vector or pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1#1 at E14.5. At the beginning of imaging (E16.5), control and <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient cells appeared to be multipolar while some cells were transforming into bipolar neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). However, when time-lapse imaging was continued, differences in radial migration were observed between control and the deficient cells. In the control experiments, GFP-positive neurons normally transformed from multipolar to bipolar in the upper IZ, smoothly migrated into CP and then moved toward the pial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary video 1</xref>). In contrast, the deficient cells frequently remained stranded in the upper IZ - lower CP after shape change into bipolar status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary video 2</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-silencing has no effects on multipolar-bipolar transition and abrogates the initiation of radial migration.</p>
<p>Although some deficient cells appeared to cross IZ in a smooth manner, they frequently showed abnormal migration in the CP. We monitored the migration and morphology of such cells. When compared to control neurons that exhibit normal locomotion toward the pial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary video 3</xref>), <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-deficient cells showed an unusual migration delay in CP; swelling formation and subsequent nucleokinesis (translocation of the nucleus into the leading process) were drastically delayed and cells displayed a characteristic “stepwise” migration phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>,e and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 4</xref>). The average migration velocity in the CP was reduced for such cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>). Collectively, <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 may regulate two steps of cortical neuron migration; smooth crossing of the IZ-CP border and subsequent radial migration in the CP. While migration defects might occur at the IZ-CP border when the RNAi effect is strong, delayed migration in the CP and defective terminal translocation (see below) might be observed when the RNAi effect is relatively weak. Since bioplar polarity was maintained in the deficient cells during radial migration (E17.5–18.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), we suppose that the upside-down shape observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref> was formed at later migration stage or after abnormal positioning.</p>

<title><italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 regulates nucleokinesis of migrating cortical neurons during corticogenesis</title>
<p>Radial migration is composed of leading process extension and nucleokinesis. Since the leading process appears to form normally in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient neurons during radial migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>), the defective “stepwise” migration observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref> may be due to defects in nucleokinesis. Nucleokinesis consists of 1) advancement of the centrosome, the site of microtubule emanation, into a proximal ‘swelling’ in the leading process, and 2) translocation of the nucleus, enveloped in a “cage”-like structure by centrosome-derived microtubules, towards the centrosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Since the relative position of the centrosome and the nucleus is critical for nucleokinesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, we asked if the coupling of the nucleus to the preceding centrosome is dependent on <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1. To this end, the distance between the nucleus and centrosome (N-C distance) in migrating neurons was measured with cortical slices. Consequently, N-C distance was significantly longer in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Further live-imaging analysis confirmed an abnormally elongated and prolonged N-C distance in the deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">6</xref>).</p>
<p>At the end of migration process, the mode changes from radial migration to terminal translocation just beneath the marginal zone (MZ). Terminal translocation is a crucial step for the completion of neuronal migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Since correct nucleokinesis is also essential for the terminal translocation, we looked into the effects of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-knockdown. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e,f</xref>, terminal translocation was not completed for <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient neurons; cells could not enter the outermost region of CP termed the primitive cortical zone (PCZ), although the tip of the process could attach to the MZ. Notably, RNAi-resistant m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1R rescued the knockdown phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e,f</xref>). We assume that the hampered terminal translocation was caused by mild <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-silencing conditions, where neurons migrated to the cortical surface but could not complete the whole migration process.</p>
<p>The above results indicate that nucleokinesis was hindered in the <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient cells. Since microtubule organization is crucial for nucleokinesis, disrupted microtubule dynamics is considered to be an underlying mechanism for the migration defects.</p>

<title><italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 regulates axon and dendrite development <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Since various neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD are thought to be “synapse” diseases, <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 should be involved in axon and dendrite network formation. We thus investigated whether <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficiency actually affects axon elongation and dendrite arborization during brain development. When <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 was silenced in VZ stem and progenitor cells at E14.5 and axons were visualized in the contralateral hemisphere at P3, axon density became lower after leaving the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). The phenotype was at least partially rescued by m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Although axons from the hemisphere containing the deficient cells reached efficiently the contralateral white matter at P7, such axons did not extend properly into the cortical layers on the contralateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). These results strongly suggest that <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 is involved in the axon elongation of cortical neurons.</p>
<p>We next examined the role of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in dendritic arbor formation. Introduction of pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1#1 at E14.5 into VZ cells resulted in highly abrogated dendritic arborization at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Branch point number and total length of dendrites were significantly decreased in the deficient neurons compared to those in matching wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e,f</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 participates in dendrite formation and maintenance. These abnormal phenotypes were rescued at least partially by m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e,f</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the functional loss of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 may impair synaptic connectivity through defects in axon and dendrite network formation.

<title>Involvement of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in spine morphology <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p><italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 was shown to be involved in axon-dendrite network formation. We thus further explored whether <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 participates in the formation of synaptic structures, since ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with synaptic dysfunction. To this end, we assessed dendritic spine morphology in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons following <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-knockdown. When neurons were transfected with GFP vector together with pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1#1 at 0 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (div) and cultured for 21 days, endogenous <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 was markedly silenced in the mature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). Under these conditions, spine density was significantly decreased in neurons transfected with pSuper-m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1#1 and the phenotype was rescued by m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b,c</xref>). We then analyzed spine morphogenesis in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient neurons by counting 4 established spine morphology groups (i.e., mushroom, stubby, thin filopodia-like and branched spines) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9d</xref>). The relative percentage of mushroom (mature) spines was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9e</xref>, <italic>left</italic> panel). Meanwhile, the relative percentage of immature spine (stubby and thin filopodia-like spines) was increased although this was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9e</xref>). The phenotype was again rescued by m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9e</xref>). The ratio of the branched spine was less than 2% in these assay conditions. It should be noted here that we used fixed cells in these experiments and the results are considered as snapshots at the respective time points because spine structures vary in a matter of hours.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological analyses</title>
<p>Since <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 was shown to regulate synaptic structure, this molecule seems to play a pivotal role in the synaptic function, of which dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. We thus examined the role of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in membrane property, spontaneous synaptic currents and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor function.</p>
<p>We first analyzed the effects of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 on membrane properties of cortical neurons. Whole-cell recordings were made from a total of 72 layer II pyramidal neurons with fluorescence from control (n = 32) and <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 knockdown mice (n = 40). Both groups consist of pups of P4 or P7. Cell capacitance of neurons in control mice was 15.8 ± 0.78 pF (n = 27). On the other hand, cell capacitance in the knockdown mice was 11.4 ± 0.41 pF (n = 33), which was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) smaller than that in control mice. Firing properties were investigated by applying hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses through the recording pipette in the current-clamp mode. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10a</xref>, in control mice, the depolarizing current pulses produced multiple action potentials. Meanwhile, multiple action potentials were not produced in the knockdown mice by the same current pulses as in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10a</xref>). Such a property resembles that observed in immature neurons in the striatum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.</p>
<p>We then examined the effects of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-knockdown on spontaneous synaptic currents of cortical neurons. Spontaneous synaptic currents were recorded from fluorescent layer II neurons in mice of P4. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of bicuculline (10 μM), strychnine (0.5 μM) to block GABA<sub>A</sub>- and glycine receptor-mediated current component, respectively. The frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs in control mice was 0.17 ± 0.004 Hz (n = 5) and 15.8 ± 2.44 pA (n = 5), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10b,c</xref>). In the knockdown mice, sEPSC frequency was 0.16 ± 0.005 Hz (n = 8), which was not significantly (P &gt; 0.05) different from that of control mice. On the other hand, the amplitude of sEPSCs of knockdown mice was 8.07 ± 1.31 pA (n = 8), which was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) smaller than that of control mice. Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were recorded in the presence of CNQX (5 μM), strychnine (0.5 μM) to block non-NMDA glutamate- and glycine receptor-mediated current component, respectively. The frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs in control mice was 0.36 ± 0.03 Hz (n = 9) and 11.6 ± 1.53 pA (n = 9), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10c</xref>). In the knockdown mice, both the frequency (0.21 ± 0.004 Hz, n = 4) and amplitude (5.86 ± 0.47 pA, n = 4) of sIPSCs were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) smaller than the corresponding values in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10c</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the effects of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-knockdown on NMDA/non-NMDA ratio of cortical neuron were analyzed with P7 mice. After making the whole-cell configuration, excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked by focal extracellular stimulation in the presence of bicuculline (10 μM) and strychnine (0.5 μM) to bock GABA<sub>A</sub>- and glycine receptor-mediated current components, respectively. Outward currents were evoked at the holding potential of +40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10d</xref>) at the stimulus frequency of 0.2 Hz (every 5 s). In control mice, bath application of D-AP5, an NMDA receptor blocker, at a concentration 25 μM, reduced the slow component of the outward currents. The remaining fast components were blocked by additional application of CNQX, an AMPA/kainite receptor blocker at a concentration of 5 μM, suggesting the remaining fast components are non-NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs. NMDA-receptor mediated synaptic current components were then obtained by electrically subtracting the average of 10 consecutive currents after application of D-AP5 from those before D-AP5 application<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. In control mice, the ratio of NMDA/non-NMDA components was 1.63 ± 0.55 (n = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10d</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). On the other hand, in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-knockdown mice, it was generally very hard to evoke excitatory synaptic currents, probably attributable to the immature development of dendrites in the knockdown mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10d</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Furthermore, the outward currents evoked at +40 mV were very small, and D-AP5 had only little effect on the evoked synaptic currents. Thus, obtained NMDA receptor mediated current components were virtually negligible. Such characteristics in the knockdown mice were consistently observed in all 6 neurons examined.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since high frequencies in alternative splicing are thought to contribute to the functional complexity of the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, abnormalities in genes encoding neuron-specific splicing factors may induce aberrations in alternative splicing profiles in neurons, leading to the neurodevelopmental disorders. While 5 isoforms of <italic>RBFOX1</italic> have been reported in human, 7 isoforms have been identified in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Recently, we analyzed the pathophysiological significance of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-isoform5 (A2BP1-A30)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In this study, we examined the role of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in the cortical lamination and synapse network formation. The primary stuctures of the 2 isoforms are different in their C-termini. The C-termnal region of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 is 66 aa in length, whereas this is replaced with a 43 aa sequence in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso5. The results of this study support the notion that disrupted <italic>RBFOX1</italic>-iso1 function accounts for the emergence of the clinical symptoms in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders caused by <italic>RBFOX1</italic> gene abnormalities.</p>
<p>Central nervous system-specific <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-knockout mice, in which both nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms are null, exhibited susceptibility to seizures and increase in neuronal excitability in the dentate gyrus but did not show gross morphological alteration in cerebral cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. It is notable that Rbfox2 expression was increased in the knockout mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> whereas its expression in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-knockdown neurons was comparable to that in control cells. Acute transfer of RNAi vector <italic>in utero</italic> may avoid the changes of Rbfox2 expression observed in the knockout mice. We assume that the apparently mild phenotype observed in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-knockout mice may be due to the compensatory effects by amplified Rbfox2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. It is our contention that acute knockdown by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation may circumvent the compensatory effects. For example, knockout mice for <italic>Sept4</italic> (Parkinson disease-related protein) and <italic>SIL1</italic>-deficient mice (a model for Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome) exhibited little architectural alteration in the cerebral cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> whereas acute knockdown of these genes induced defects in neuronal migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Alternatively, the phenotype of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient neurons in this study could be highlighted in surrounding normal neurons since the deficient cells are present among non-transfected normal neurons while the neurons in the knockout mice are completely surrounded with the same <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-null cells. Meanwhile, we found decrease in spine density in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient hippocampal neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>, which was consistent with the phenotype of the knockout mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Rbfox2 protein expression was reported to increase in acute <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-knockdown experiments with isolated hippocampal neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Collectively, experimental conditions such as the cell environment and culture conditions used to suppress <italic>Rbfox1</italic> expression may differently influence the Rbfox2 expression.</p>
<p>Electrophysiological analyses demonstrated significant changes in membrane and synaptic properties in knockdown mice when compared to the control. The membrane properties of the knockdown mice were similar to those of immature neurons in the developing or regenerated neurons in the striatum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Less frequency and smaller amplitude of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents could be attributable to the reduced development of dendrites observed in the morphological studies. The reduced NMDA/AMPA ratio of evoked excitatory synaptic currents in the knockdown mice, as well as the abnormality in neuronal migration and morphology, is in agreement with a previous study showing that NMDA receptors are involved in neuronal migration and morphological changes into a bipolar shape<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p>
<p>To elucidate the pathophysiological significance of <italic>RBFOX1</italic> in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, identification of <italic>RBFOX1</italic> target molecules will be essential. Since neuronal migration requires the orchestrated remodelling of the cytoskeleton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, it is reasonable that genes important for cytoskeleton reorganization are among <italic>RBFOX1</italic> target molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Based on the results obtained here, <italic>RBFOX1</italic> is most likely to regulate the radial migration and terminal translocation through the regulation of nucleokinesis, in which microtubules and the centrosome play central roles. In this context, a microtubule-binding protein, Doublecortin, is a candidate target for <italic>RBFOX1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Another target molecule candidate, FilaminA (an actin-binding protein), is also involved in cortical neuron migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that Doublecortin and/or FilaminA are downstream targets for <italic>Rbfox1</italic> and regulate cortical neuron migration as well as spine morphology. In addition, transcriptome analyses revealed neurologically relevant genes such as <italic>SLC1A3, DCLK1, GABRB3, GAD2, KCNQ2, SCN8A, SLC12A5, DBN1, NLGN3, NLGN4X, SV2B</italic> and <italic>SYN1</italic> as the spicing targets for <italic>Rbfox1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. These are known to be causal or candidate genes for various neurodevelopmental disorders such as ID, ASD and epilepsy. Further intensive analysis of the molecular machinery downstream of <italic>RBFOX1</italic>-mediated splicing should contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders where <italic>RBFOX1</italic> abnormalities are involved.</p>
<p>In this report, we focused on the pathophysiological relevance of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1. When the knockdown phenotypes were compared to those of cytosolic minor isoform, m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso5, inhibitory effects by m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-knockdown on the radial migration and axon elongation to the contralateral cortex were stronger under the same assay conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Also, while the number of stubby-shaped immature spines increased when m<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso5 was silenced in primary cultured hippocampal neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, filopodia-like immature spines in addition to stubby spines increased in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient cells. Overall, similar but not identical results were obtained in the knockdown phenotypes of the 2 isoforms. This similarity and difference in the phenotypes might be explained by distinct roles of nuclear and cytoplasmic <italic>Rbfox1</italic> isoforms in convergent signaling pathways during cortical development. Interestingly, a recent study revealed different molecular functions of nuclear and cytoplasmic <italic>Rbfox1</italic> isoforms. Matrin and colleagues clarified that nuclear <italic>Rbfox1</italic> is involved in splicing changes while cytoplasmic <italic>Rbfox1</italic> regulates the stability and translation of the target mRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. As mentioned earlier, many <italic>Rbfox1</italic> target candidates take part in cortical development and neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD. Although such candidate proteins are possible to be processed differently at different intracellular sites by <italic>Rbfox1</italic> isoforms, signaling pathways where these molecules are involved may converge to regulate corticogenesis in a coordinate manner.</p>
<p><italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficiency caused defects in neuronal cell morphology, migration, synapse network formation and synapse physiology during brain development. The obtained results elucidated essential roles of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in brain development, and support the hypothesis that functional defects of <italic>RBFOX1</italic>-iso1 may be related to the etiologies of neurodevelopmental disorders. As for an underlying mechanism in the migration defects, disrupted nucleokinesis caused by aberrant microtubule-centrosome interaction is considered to be a core event. While abnormal nucleokinesis causes hampered radial migration and terminal translocation, multipolar movement was apparently normal in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-deficient cells, perhaps due to the crucial role of actin cytoskeleton in this movement. Abnormal actin reorganization is supposed to be responsible for the aberrant spine morphology, and indeed various actin-related molecules are target candidates for <italic>Rbfox1</italic>. Although disrupted spine function is thought to play an important role in pathophysiology of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, underlying molecular mechanism(s) remains to be elucidated.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>With a sophisticated system biology analyses, <italic>RBFOX1</italic> was recently shown to serve as a “hub” in ASD-gene transcriptome networks, strongly suggesting its crucial role in the pathophysiology of ASD. Since <italic>RBFOX1</italic> gene abnormalities have also been found in other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders including ID, ADHD and schizophrenia, this gene product is supposed to have an essential role in neuronal function and corticogenesis.</p>
<p>To elucidate the pathophysiological relevance of <italic>RBFOX1</italic>, we here focused on the dominant neuronal isoform of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> (<italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1) localized in the nucleus and examined its role during mouse corticogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro.</italic> Knockdown of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 <italic>in vivo</italic> caused defects in the radial migration and terminal translocation of cortical neurons. <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 was also involved in the synapse network formation and/or maintenance through the regulation of axon growth and dendritic arborization <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, electrophysiology analyses revealed significant defects in membrane and synaptic properties in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient neurons, indicating that <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 is essential for synapse functions. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments revealed reduction of spine density and mature spine number in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1-deficient mouse hippocampal neurons. The abnormal phenotypes observed were similar but not the same as those in the deficient neurons of cytoplasmic minor isoform, <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso5.</p>
<p>In summary, we report an essential role of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 in cortical development. Impairment of <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-iso1 function may induce structural and functional defects of the cerebral cortex, and consequently contribute to the clinical symptoms of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders with <italic>RBFOX1</italic> gene abnormalities.</p>
