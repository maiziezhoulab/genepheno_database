<italic>FAM46C</italic> is one of the most frequently mutated genes in multiple myeloma. Here, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that <italic>FAM46C</italic> encodes an active non-canonical poly(A) polymerase which enhances mRNA stability and gene expression. Reintroduction of active <italic>FAM46C</italic> into multiple myeloma cell lines, but not its catalytically-inactive mutant, leads to broad polyadenylation and stabilization of mRNAs strongly enriched with those encoding endoplasmic reticulum-targeted proteins and induces cell death. Moreover, silencing of <italic>FAM46C</italic> in multiple myeloma cells expressing WT protein enhance cell proliferation. Finally, using a FAM46C-FLAG knock-in mouse strain, we show that the <italic>FAM46C</italic> protein is strongly induced during activation of primary splenocytes and that B lymphocytes isolated from newly generated <italic>FAM46C</italic> KO mice proliferate faster than those isolated from their WT littermates. Concluding, our data clearly indicate that <italic>FAM46C</italic> works as an onco-suppressor, with the specificity for B-lymphocyte lineage from which multiple myeloma originates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Mass sequencing of cancer genomes has revealed genomic landscapes of human cancers allowing for the identification of a large number of potential tumor suppressors and oncogenes. <italic>FAM46C</italic>, a gene whose physiological function was largely unknown, is one of the most frequently mutated genes in multiple myeloma (MM), following the well-known proto-oncogenes, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, and <italic>BRAF</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Deletions of <italic>FAM46C</italic> gene 1p12 locus (del(1p)) have been found in ~20% of MM cases and are associated with short progression-free survival and decreased overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Except of chromosomal aberrations, recurrent homozygotic or hemizygotic somatic point mutations have been identified in about 10% of MM cases, depending on studies based on whole-genome- or whole-exome sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. To date, more than 70 unique somatic mutations across whole <italic>FAM46C</italic> gene sequence have been identified, many of which are frameshift or nonsense mutations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://research.themmrf.org">https://research.themmrf.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Importantly, FAM46C mutations are specific to MM since no other cancer type with statistical significant enriched in FAM46C mutations has been described so far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The high frequency of mutation in the <italic>FAM46C</italic> gene allowed it to be classified as MM driver-gene, which may function as a tumor suppressor even though it does not contain mutational hotspots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. <italic>FAM46C</italic> mutations are also frequently found in stable human myeloma cell lines. In addition, <italic>FAM46C</italic> has been identified as a type I interferon-stimulated gene, overexpression of which slightly enhances replication of some viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">FAM46C belongs to a FAM46 metazoan-specific family of proteins, which has 4 members in humans that are very similar at the protein level with a degree of sequence identity of at least 56.9%. There is currently very little functional data on FAM46 proteins. Positional cloning in mouse revealed that mutations in <italic>FAM46C</italic> gene cause anemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The only publication about this phenomenon is the PhD thesis of Tian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The author performed initial biochemical characterization of FAM46C and concluded that it is a RNA-binding protein that stabilizes specific mRNAs in reticulocytes, including that of alfa-globin, which correlates with poly(A) tail shortening. Recent bioinformatic fold recognition searches classified FAM46C as a member of the novel nucleotidyltransferases (NTases) family; however, this study did not provide reliable predictions of molecular function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. NTases transfer nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) from nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to an acceptor hydroxyl group and are involved in many biological processes, including mRNA polyadenylation and editing, DNA repair and chromatin remodeling, intracellular signal transduction, and regulation of protein activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Here we performed the first comprehensive molecular characterization of <italic>FAM46C</italic>. We show that FAM46C is an active poly(A) polymerase that positively regulates expression of ER-targeted mRNAs. Furthermore, the presented data strongly indicate that FAM46C is a B-cell lineage-specific growth suppressor as silencing of <italic>FAM46C</italic> in MM cells that express the wild-type protein enhances cell division, whereas introduction of wild-type FAM46C into MM that express the protein with mutations leads to growth arrest; also, primary B cells isolated from <italic>FAM46C</italic> KO animals proliferate faster. Thus, we describe <italic>FAM46C</italic> as an onco-suppressor non-canonical poly(A) polymerase.</p>

<title>FAM46C encodes a poly(A) polymerase that enhances gene expression</title>
<p id="Par6">The FAM46 family of proteins exists only in animals. In vertebrates, all its members have the same architecture. They contain domains that are very distantly related to the catalytic and associated domains of poly(A) polymerases, and they lack any detectable RNA-binding domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The putative catalytic residues of FAM46C are preserved, indicating that this protein may indeed be an active poly(A) or poly(U) polymerase (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par7">In order to confirm predicted molecular activity, we purified recombinant FAM46C and its mutant version, in which acidic residues of the putative catalytic center, expected to coordinate divalent cations, were replaced by alanines (D90A and D92A; <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>mut</sup>). This was followed by an in vitro polyadenylation assay using a A<sub>15</sub> oligoribonucleotide RNA as a substrate. Wild type, but not catalytic mutant, protein was able to extend the RNA substrate in vitro in the presence of ATP and divalent metal ions (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>), indicating that FAM46C is a poly(A) polymerase. However, due to the relatively low activity of recombinant FAM46C (likely related to its intrinsic low solubility and aggregation), we validated the result using recombinant FAM46D, which was more soluble; the sequences of the two proteins are highly similar (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). FAM46D displayed poly(A) polymerase activity and was able to extend A<sub>15</sub> oligoribonucleotide substrate; its activity was significantly higher compared to that of FAM46C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>FAM46C interacts with RNA and is an active RNA poly(A) polymerase in vitro and in vivo. <bold>a</bold> Recombinant FAM46C<sup>WT</sup> (lanes 8–13), but not its catalytic mutant FAM46C<sup>mut</sup> (lanes 2–7), displays poly(A) polymerase activity in vitro. Reaction products (using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled (A)<sub>15</sub> as substrate) were separated in denaturing PAGE gels and visualized by autoradiography. <bold>b</bold> SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant FAM46C<sup>WT</sup> and its catalytic mutant FAM46C<sup>mut</sup>. <bold>c</bold> FAM46D<sup>WT</sup> is an active poly(A) polymerase in vitro and requires Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions for its activity. Purified protein was incubated with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled (A)<sub>15</sub> primer in the presence of ATP and divalent cations as follows: Mg<sup>2+</sup> (lanes 4–6), both Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup> (lanes 7–9), or Mn<sup>2+</sup> (lanes 10–12). Control reactions were carried out without the protein (lanes 1–3). <bold>d</bold> FAM46C interacts with RNA in human cells. Autoradiography of UV cross-linked <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNAs co-purified with FAM46C<sup>WT</sup>GFP from HEK293 cells stably expressing the fusion protein (lanes 3–4) and from control empty cells (lanes 1–2). Immunoprecipitated RNA-protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, stained with Ponceau S, and subsequently autoradiographed. The <italic>right</italic> panel shows the Ponceau S stained blot merged with autoradiogram</p></caption><graphic id="d29e607" xlink:href="41467_2017_578_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p id="Par8">In order to determine the molecular function of FAM46C, we evaluated whether this protein could interact with RNA at the cellular level. Stable HEK293 cells expressing FAM46C<sup>WT</sup>-GFP were UV cross-linked and the tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibodies. Co-purified RNA was visualized by <sup>32</sup>P-labeling of RNA-protein covalent crosslinks. Strong enrichment of RNA was observed in cross-linked, FAM46C-positive samples compared to control cells and non-crosslinked samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>), demonstrating that FAM46C binds to RNA and may act as an RNA poly(A) polymerase in human cells.</p>
<p id="Par9">Non-canonical poly(A) polymerases may enhance overall gene expression by extending the poly(A) tails of dormant messenger RNAs (like GLD2) in the cytoplasm or trigger rapid exosome-mediated RNA decay by oligoadenylation of target RNA in the nucleus (as in the case of TRF4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In order to examine intracellular localization of the FAM46C protein, HEK293T, RPMI826 (MM), H929 (MM), SKMM1 (MM), HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia) and Raji (B-cell lymphoma) cell lines were transduced with constructs encoding the <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>WT</sup>-GFP fusion gene. Confocal microscopy revealed simultaneous nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of FAM46C in all tested cell lines, as expected for non-canonical poly(A) polymerases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>), demonstrating the possibility of both RNA stabilizing and destabilizing functions.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>FAM46C shows both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. HEK293T, RPMI826 (MM), H929 (MM), SKMM1 (MM), HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia) and Raji (B-cell lymphoma) cell lines were transduced with constructs encoding the <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>WT</sup>–GFP fusion gene. Non-transduced cells were used as a control. Fluorescence images for GFP and Hoechst nucleic acid stain, as well as merged images, are shown. <italic>Scales bars</italic> (10 µm) are shown for each set of images</p></caption><graphic id="d29e652" xlink:href="41467_2017_578_Fig2_HTML"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p id="Par10">To further analyze FAM46C function in cells, we performed an RNA-tethering assay. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a construct expressing <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (RL) containing five boxB sites in its 3′-UTR, Firefly luciferase (FL) control reporter and <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>WT</sup> harboring the N-terminal λN boxB-binding domain and HA-tag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. After 24 h, the levels of reporter protein were analyzed, which revealed that tethering a wild-type <italic>FAM46C</italic> enhances expression of RL more than 7-fold <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a, d</xref>
<bold>)</bold>. Several additional controls were applied to prove that the catalytic activity of FAM46C was indeed responsible for the enhanced expression of RL reporter: (1) tethering of the catalytic FAM46C mutant had little effect on RL reporter expression <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a, d</xref>
<bold>)</bold>; (2) a RL reporter with a cyclic phosphate at the 3′-end generated by a hammerhead ribozyme, which cannot be polyadenylated, was insensitive to FAM46C tethering <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b, d</xref>
<bold>)</bold>; (3) expression of <italic>FAM46C</italic> without the λN domains did not enhanced expression of the reporter <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c, d</xref>
<bold>)</bold>. At the RNA level, northern blot analysis revealed that enhanced expression of RL upon FAM46C<sup>WT</sup> tethering correlated with increased steady state levels and slower migration of its mRNA <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e, f</xref>
<bold>)</bold>. This was not observed for the RL reporter with a cyclic phosphate at the 3′ <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e, f</xref>
<bold>)</bold>. Quantifications of control FL reporter mRNA revealed no effect of FAM46C on its expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3g</xref>). Furthermore, northern blot analysis of poly(A) enriched-RNA fractions revealed significant increases in steady-state levels and slower migration of RL mRNA in samples where FAM46C<sup>WT</sup> was tethered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h</xref>). Next, we confirmed that the observed RL mRNA lengthening is indeed caused by polyadenylation of mRNA 3′-end using an RNase H cleavage assay with oligo(dT)<sub>25</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3i</xref>). In addition, RNA from cells after FAM46C was tethered to RL mRNA was fractionated based on the lengths of poly(A) tails using oligo dT sepharose resin. Northern blot analysis revealed that more RL mRNA molecules were present in fractions with longer poly(A) tails, confirming that it is polyadenylated by FAM46C (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2a</xref>). The same effect was observed for FAM46D indicating that they have similar properties (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>FAM46C tethering leads to polyadenylation and enhanced expression of a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (RL) reporter.

<p id="Par11">In order to determine whether the observed increase in reporter expression was due to mRNA stability, we evaluated the half-life of RL mRNA.

Northern blot, followed by densitometry quantifications analyses of steady state levels of RL mRNA obtained from appropriate time points, revealed significant increases in the mRNA half-life of the molecules polyadenylated by FAM46C compared to control cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2c, d</xref>). Therefore, it was concluded that FAM46C is an active poly(A) polymerase which, when tethered, stabilizes mRNA and enhances gene expression.</p>

<title>FAM46C is an MM cell growth suppressor</title>
<p id="Par12">To study <italic>FAM46C</italic> in the context of MM pathogenesis, we took advantage of the established MM cell lines, some of which harbor early frameshift mutations in <italic>FAM46C</italic>: SKMM1 (Homozygous p.I173fsX36) and H929 (hemizygous p.L93fsX15) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). In order to reintroduce wild-type <italic>FAM46C</italic> into these cell lines, we designed a lentiviral vector allowing for the expression of C-terminally GFP-tagged protein under the control of the spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) promoter, which is active in hematopoietic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Initially, we evaluated transduction efficiency and protein expression levels using control HEK293T cells, which were transduced with lentiviruses carrying <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>WT</sup>-GFP, <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>mut</sup>-GFP, or GFP as control, using different multiplicities of infection (MOIs; from 1 to 4). In all cases, stable cell lines were obtained with &gt;95% efficiency as verified by flow cytometry for GFP-expressing living cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3a</xref>). No significant growth phenotypes were observed in HEK293T cells. A cytometric analysis of the cell cycle revealed higher number of cells in the G0/G1 phase; however, this observation could be a side effect associated with lentiviral particles, as it was not correlated with the activity of the FAM46C protein.</p>
<p id="Par13">Next, we transduced SKMM1, H929 (both mutated in the endogenous <italic>FAM46C</italic> locus), and RPMI8226 (with wild-type <italic>FAM46C</italic> sequence) with lentiviruses carrying <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>WT</sup>-GFP, <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>mut</sup>-GFP, and GFP constructs at MOIs from 1 to 4. Cytometric analysis of cell cultures was used to monitor the effect of FAM46C expression up to 11 days post transduction. Three days after transgene delivery, most of the tested cell lines expressing <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>WT</sup> had reduced growth rate and increased number of dead cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>); this effect was positively correlated with high FAM46C<sup>WT</sup> virus titer levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">4b</xref>). Interestingly, in SKMM1 cells, the cytostatic effect of <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>WT</sup> expression was observed later in comparison to H929 or RPMI8226 cells and was best visible from the ninth day after transduction. Cytostatic effect was also observed for constructs with other tags at the N and C termini of FAM46C protein (FLAG-FAM46C<sup>WT</sup>, FAM46C<sup>WT</sup>-FLAG, GFP-FAM46C<sup>WT</sup>, and NHA-FAM46C<sup>WT</sup>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">4</xref>). We also tested other MM cell lines (MM1.S, MM1.R) and observed the same effects. Importantly, in contrast to <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>WT</sup>-GFP, expression of <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>mut</sup>-GFP or GFP only, did not cause cell death and stable MM cell lines were established (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>). This observation indicate that cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of <italic>FAM46C</italic> overexpression depend on its enzymatic activity. Moreover, overexpression of GFP-tagged nucleotidyltransferases such as canonical (PAPOLA) or non-canonical poly(A) polymerases (POLS or GLD2) in SKMM1 cell lines did not cause strong cytostatic effects (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">5</xref>), since the toxicity was visible only at early time points post transduction and stable cell lines were derived. This suggests a unique influence of <italic>FAM46C</italic> on MM cell viability.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>FAM46C control survival and proliferation of multiple myeloma cells. <bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold> Expression of <italic>FAM46C</italic>

<p id="Par14">Finally, in order to determine if <italic>FAM46C</italic> toxicity is restricted to MM cells, other hematological cell lines, including HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia) and Raji (B-cell lymphoma), were transduced with lentiviruses carrying <italic>FAM46C</italic>
<sup>WT</sup>-GFP, <italic>FAM46C</italic>

Unlike in MM cells, expression of <italic>FAM46C</italic> had no effect on HL60 or Raji cell growth and viability, and these lines were established after cell sorting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). It was concluded that <italic>FAM46C</italic> expression specifically induces cell death of MM cells, however, we cannot exclude that reduced toxicity of FAM46C for HL60 and Raji cell is not related to lower expression levels of the transgene.</p>
<p id="Par15">Furthermore, in order to verify if FAM46C may positively regulate gene expression in MM cells we have conducted tethering assays performed similarly to the one described for HEK293 cells but implemented for SKMM1 and H929 cells. As expected, tethering of FAM46C<sup>WT</sup> but not FAM46C<sup>mut</sup> in MM cell lines enhanced the expression of the reporter mRNA (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par16">Mutations in <italic>FAM46C</italic> are found only in a fraction of MM cases. In order to check whether the effect of <italic>FAM46C</italic> on cell survival and proliferation is general to MM cells, we silenced <italic>FAM46C</italic> expression in RPMI8226, a MM cell line expressing wild-type <italic>FAM46C</italic>. To this end, we derived stable cell lines transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing three different shRNA targeting <italic>FAM46C</italic>. Although the level of silencing was moderate (~ 50%, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>), basically all shRNAs led to an moderately increased proliferation rate of RPMI8226 cell line as measured using CFSE cell tracer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). Such an effect was not observed in the SKMM1 MM cell line harboring <italic>FAM46C</italic> mutations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>).

<title>FAM46C KO enhances B lymphocyte proliferation rate</title>
<p id="Par17">The analysis of MM cell lines revealed that FAM46C expression affects their growth and survival. Our intensive trials to raise or purchase specific antibodies that recognized FAM46C failed and so we were unable to verify endogenous FAM46C levels in MM cells. Thus, to study the expression of FAM46C in the B-cell lineage, from which MM originates, we have generated a FAM46C-FLAG knock-in mouse using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology. The animals did not display any detectable phenotypes. We have used western blot analysis of IL4 and LPS activated splenocytes and found that FAM46C expression was very strongly enhanced upon activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Furthermore, cell fractionation experiments revealed that it is localized mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>), which is generally in agreement with our localization studies based on confocal imaging. Such result suggests that FAM46C may act as a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase in the B lymphocyte lineage.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>FAM46C is induced in activated B lymphocytes and localizes mainly in the cytosol. <bold>a</bold> Splenocytes from <italic>FAM46C</italic>

<p id="Par18">In order to study the potential role for FAM46C in B lymphocytes and more generally in hematopoiesis, we have generated <italic>FAM46C</italic> mutant animals, which harbor a 17 bp deletion and a 301 bp insertion using the CRISPR.

Although, detailed analysis of <italic>FAM46C</italic> KO phenotypes are outside of the scope of this study, the mice did not display any major developmental phenotypes.

<p id="Par22">In order to identify FAM46C substrates, we aimed to determine differences in the enrichment of mRNA species in the highly polyadenylated fractions in cells transduced with wild-type <italic>FAM46C</italic> compared to cells transduced with the catalytically inactive mutant.

<sup>WT</sup> cells using relative levels observed in <italic>FAM46</italic>C<sup>mut</sup> cells.

The correlation between the polyadenylation and mRNA levels was also visible for H929 MM cells.

<p id="Par28">PABPC1 and BCCIPβ proteins were selected for functional evaluation as potential FAM46C interactors. First, it was determined whether these proteins had any impact on mRNA after tethering to an RL reporter construct. Similarly to previous experiments, cells were transiently transfected with pRL-5BoxB, pNHA-BCCIPβ, and pNHA-PABPC1 plasmids and, after 24 h, RL mRNA and protein levels were analyzed. BCCIPβ did not affect mRNA; however, PABPC1 tethering led to increased RL mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9a–c</xref>). Next, we examined FAM46C poly(A) polymerase activity in cells with reduced BCCIP and PABPC1 levels after siRNA treatment. HEK293 cells were treated with siRNA against <italic>BCCIP</italic> or <italic>PABPC1</italic> mRNAs and, after 3 days, reseeded and co-transfected with pRL-5BoxB, pNHA-FAM46C, and pNHA-FAM46C<sup>mut</sup>. BCCIPβ and PABPC1 protein levels after siRNA treatment were determined by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">9d</xref>). After 24 h, steady state levels of reporter mRNA and protein were analyzed (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">9e</xref>). In all cases, FAM46C tethering led to increases in steady state RL mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">9e</xref>). In conclusion, FAM46C does not form stable macromolecular assemblies and interacting proteins have no direct effect on its poly(A) polymerase activity.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par29">Template-independent elongation of the 3′-end of mRNA by nucleotidyltransferases, known as poly(A) polymerases, plays a crucial role in RNA processing that affects mRNA stability and translational efficiency. Here we provide strong in vitro and in culture evidence demonstrating that the <italic>FAM46C</italic> gene encodes a novel poly(A) polymerase that acts as an B-cell lineage growth suppressor. Reintroduction of <italic>FAM46C</italic> into MM cell lines with dysfunctional endogenous gene leads to cell death while its silencing in cells expressing WT proteins enhances proliferation rate. Furthermore, activated primary B lymphocytes isolated from <italic>FAM46C</italic> KO animals divide faster than the wild type, suggesting that FAM46C acts more generally in the B lymphocyte lineage. Hematologic phenotypes of <italic>FAM46C</italic> KO animals, in which red blood cell and platelet counts are increased further suggests that this enzyme controls proliferation of other blood cells or common progenitor. To summarize, we are strongly confident that MM cells must benefit from mutations in FAM46C, however we cannot exclude that FAM46C suppresses the growth of other cell types than ones derived from the B-cell linage. Recent studies from the Xin Lab suggest that FAM46C can also be involved in regulation of proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par30">Our data based on SKMM1 and H929 cell lines strongly indicate that <italic>FAM46C</italic> has a relatively broad spectrum of substrates with significant enrichment towards ER/Golgi-targeted proteins, which may explain the toxicity to MM cells since ER and Golgi apparatus homeostasis is essential for survival. Although we did not determine the specificity of the FAM46C protein for particular substrates, we found that the toxicity of <italic>FAM46C</italic> to MM cells is unique, since overexpression of other poly(A) polymerases, such as GLD2 and canonical PAP, was not harmful to MM cells. Similarly to the overexpression of the wild-type form of <italic>FAM46C</italic> in HL60, there was no significant effect on the survival of Raji and 293 T cell lines. These results suggest that the toxicity of <italic>FAM46C</italic> to MM cell lines is related to the expression of ER/Golgi-targeted proteins, which may result in ER overload and induction of an unfolded protein stress response in these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, how exactly the numerous genetic differences between cancer cell lines makes them sensitive to <italic>FAM46C</italic> expression remains to be established.</p>
<p id="Par31">Importantly, this work provides the first experimental evidence directly linking RNA 3′ end polyadenylation process with cell proliferation, notably in the B-cell lineage implying the possible role of FAM46C mutations as driver mutations in MM. Interestingly, a well-established regulator of polyadenylation in gametogenesis, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB), is also implicated in senescence and was suggested to be a tumor suppressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, the enzyme responsible for CPEB-dependent polyadenylation in somatic cells remains unknown, as knock-out of the poly(A) polymerase GLD2, which cooperates with CPEB in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, has no visible phenotype in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par32">PABPC1 and BCCIP proteins are novel FAM46C interactors that had not been reported in high throughput screens. The cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling protein PABPC1 is a <italic>FAM46C</italic> interactor and is directly related to its physiological function, since it binds to nascent poly(A) tracts, affecting initiation of protein translation and both RNA processing and stability; however, the additional factors determining <italic>FAM46C</italic> substrate specificity require further investigation. Furthermore, FAM46C displays very weak distributive activity in vitro, while it seems to be more active in vivo, thus additional factors responsible for its optimal activity probably remain to be identified.</p>
<p id="Par33">Our identification of FAM46 proteins as active poly(A) polymerases suggests that the human genome encodes at least 11 putative ncPAPs and PUPs (4 FAM46 family members and 7 other previously annotated genes; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). FAM46C, as well as all other members in this family, may positively regulate gene expression in various human tissues and organs, since they are differentially expressed during development and several tissues express multiple FAM46 proteins at the same time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Further research is necessary in order to determine the physiological roles of this novel family of poly(A) polymerases. Data obtained thus far strongly suggest that gene expression regulation by cytoplasmic polyadenylation may play a role in various other cellular processes.

<title>RNA-seq libraries</title>
<p id="Par49">1 µg of total RNA was treated with Turbo-DNase (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, rRNA was removed from samples using a Ribo-Zero Kit (Epicentre), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and samples were spiked-in with external RNA (ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix; Life Technologies). For libraries prepared from poly(A)+ fractions, the ribo-depletion step was omitted. Finally, RNA libraries were prepared using a TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) or a KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Kapa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

<title>Transduction of target cells</title>
<p id="Par50">For lentivirus production, 2.6 × 10<sup>6</sup> HEK-293T cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes 24 h prior to transfection in 10 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin solution (Sigma). The lentiviruses encoding the gene of interest (GOI) were introduced to the packaging cells by calcium phosphate co-transfection with 8.6 µg of a GOI-containing vector HIV-SFFV and components of 2nd generation of packaging vectors, namely, 8.6 µg of psPAX2 packaging vector and 5.5 µg of pMD2.G envelope vector. The plasmids were resuspended in 450 µl of 300 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and added dropwise to 450 μl of 2 × concentrated HEPES-buffered saline (280 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM KCl and 12 mM D-glucose pH 7.2) by vortexing. The precipitate was immediately added to the cell culture medium with gentle swirling. The medium was replaced with 6 ml of fresh DMEM 16 h post transduction.</p>
<p id="Par51">Virus-containing supernatants were collected 24 h later, centrifuged for 3 min at 300 × <italic>g</italic>, and filtered through 0.45 μm low-protein-binding filters (Millipore) Then, the supernatants were concentrated 10 × by centrifugation (3000 × <italic>g</italic>, 16 h, 4 °C). The titer of viral particles was estimated using a Lenti-X p24 Rapid Titer Kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Multiplication of infection (MOI) was calculated by dividing the vector titer for the number of cells transduced. Efficiency of transduction was determined by flow cytometry for GFP-expressing cells using an Accuri C6 benchtop cytometer (BD Biosciences). Additional staining with 2.5 µg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS was performed to distinguish dead cells. If needed, to select GOI-expressing cells, sorting for GFP-positive cells using the Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences) was performed.</p>

<title>RNA-seq data analysis</title>
<p id="Par52">Ribo-depleted total RNA isolated from mutant and wild type H929 cell line quadruplicates were used to prepare strand-specific libraries (dUTP RNA); Ribo-depleted total RNA isolated from mutant and wild type SKMM1 cell line triplicates were also used to prepare non-strand-specific TRUseq RNA libraries. These libraries were subsequently sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform to the average number of 18.5 million reads per sample in 100-nt pair-end mode. Poly(A) tail length fractionation libraries were sequenced to an average depth of in 75-nt pair-end fashion.</p>

Briefly, precipitated proteins were dissolved in 100 μl of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, reduced in 100 mM DTT for 30 min at 57 °C, alkylated in 55 mM iodoacetamide for 40 min at RT in the dark, and digested overnight with 10 ng/ml trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C. Finally, trifluoroacetic acid was added at a final concentration of 0.1%. MS analysis was performed by LC-MS in the Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry (IBB PAS, Warsaw) using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated by a 180-min linear gradient of 95% solution A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 35% solution B (acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid). The measurement of each sample was preceded by three washing runs to avoid cross-contamination; the final MS washing run was searched for the presence of cross-contamination between samples. If the protein of interest was identified in the washing run and in the next measured sample at the same or smaller intensity, then the sample was regard as contaminated and these samples were excluded from final graphs. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent MS-MS2 mode and data were acquired in the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> range of 300–2000. Data were analyzed with the Max-Quant (Version 1.5.3.12) platform. The reference human proteome database from UniProt was used. We also searched our data for protein isoforms (for example BCCIP alfa/beta) to determine which were present. Label-Free-Quantification (LFQ) intensity values were calculated using the MaxLFQ algorithm to estimate quantities of identified proteins and identified proteins were analyzed as follows. Protein abundance was defined as the LFQ value calculated by MaxQuant software for a protein (sum of intensities of identified peptides of a given protein) divided by its molecular weight. Specificity was defined as the ratio of the protein LFQ intensity measured in the bait purification to background level (i.e., protein LFQ intensity in the negative control purification with the background level was arbitrarily set to 1 for proteins not detected in the negative control). High values of both protein abundance and specificity indicated proteins that were enriched in the purification and thus suggested interactions. Common protein contaminations were removed from graphs. All MS analyses were performed at the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, IBB PAS.</p>
