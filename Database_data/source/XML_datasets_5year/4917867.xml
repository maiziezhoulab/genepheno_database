<abstract>
<p>Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a rare disorder of cholesterol synthesis. Affected individuals exhibit growth failure, intellectual disability and a broad spectrum of developmental malformations. Among them, renal agenesis or hypoplasia, decreased innervation of the gut, and ptosis are consistent with impaired Ret signaling. Ret is a receptor tyrosine kinase that achieves full activity when recruited to lipid rafts. Mice mutant for <italic>Ret</italic> are born with no kidneys and enteric neurons, and display sympathetic nervous system defects causing ptosis. Since cholesterol is a critical component of lipid rafts, here we tested the hypothesis of whether the cause of the above malformations found in SLOS is defective Ret signaling owing to improper lipid raft composition or function. No defects consistent with decreased Ret signaling were found in newborn <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, or in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice lacking one copy of <italic>Ret</italic>. Although kidneys from <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed a mild branching defect <italic>in vitro</italic>, GDNF was able to support survival and downstream signaling of sympathetic neurons. Consistently, GFRα1 correctly partitioned to lipid rafts in brain tissue. Finally, replacement experiments demonstrated that 7-DHC efficiently supports Ret signaling <italic>in vitro</italic>. Taken together, our findings do not support a role of Ret signaling in the pathogenesis of SLOS.</p>

<body>
<p>Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome (SLOS; OMIM 270400, ORPHA818) is an autosomal recessive, multiple congenital malformation syndrome, with an incidence of approximately 01/50,000 live births. SLOS presents with a very heterogeneous phenotype, causing perinatal death in its most severe forms. In general, children affected by SLOS show growth retardation, developmental delay and intellectual disability. Craniofacial defects include microcephaly, micrognathia, and ptosis (dropping of the eyelid). Individuals affected by SLOS often display postaxial polydactyly of the hands or feet, and syndactyly of the 2nd and 3rd toes. Internal malformations include renal hypoplasia, ambiguous genitalia in male, pyloric stenosis, colonic aganglionosis (Hirschsprung disease), holoprosencephaly and cardiac malformations. SLOS patients are hyperactive, display self-injurious behavior, and demonstrate autistic characteristics [reviewed in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>SLOS is caused by inherited mutations of the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase gene (<italic>DHCR7</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. <italic>DHCR7</italic> gene product catalyzes the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis, namely conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) into cholesterol. As a consequence, <italic>DHCR7</italic> deficiency impairs cholesterol production, resulting in elevated 7-DHC levels and typically decreased cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is a major structural component of plasma membranes, is the precursor of steroid hormones, bile acids and constitutes a critical component of plasma membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts. Moreover, cholesterol is necessary for proper function of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and 7-DHC is the precursor of vitamin D. Given the multiple and important functions of cholesterol, it is not surprising that the molecular mechanisms by which such altered cholesterol/7-DHC ratio cause the variety of developmental abnormalities observed in SLOS patients are only partially understood.</p>
<p>The GDNF family ligands (GFLs) constitute a group of neurotrophic factors (GDNF, NRTN, PSPN, ARTN) that regulate several aspects of the developing nervous and genito-urinary systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. GFLs signal through a common tyrosine kinase receptor (Ret), and one of the four co-receptors known as GFRα, which bind directly to GFLs providing ligand specificity. GFRα co-receptors are attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol anchor, which targets them to lipid rafts. Stimulation by GFLs prompts recruitment of Ret to lipid rafts, where the GFL-GFRα-Ret ternary complex interacts with Src family kinases to elicit maximal biological responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Interestingly, stimulation of Ret by soluble GFRα1 also drives Ret to lipid rafts where it interacts with FRS2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Moreover, partitioning of Ret to lipid rafts not only promotes association with key signaling intermediates, but prevents its proteasomal-mediated degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Finally, a very recent report shows that knockin mice expressing a GFRα1 mutant localized outside lipid rafts phenocopy several aspects of Ret knockout mice, confirming the importance of GDNF-driven translocation of Ret to lipid rafts for its proper function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, Ret signaling is necessary for the proper development of the autonomic nervous system and the genito-urinary system. Mice bearing a variety of <italic>Ret</italic> mutations (as well as mutations in certain GFLs or their co-receptors) show different degrees of colonic aganglionosis, thus mimicking Hirschsprung disease in humans. On the other hand Ret signaling is crucial to kidney development, and mice bearing mutations in <italic>Ret</italic> or its co-receptor <italic>GFRα1</italic> develop several kidney defects ranging from complete agenesis to different degrees of kidney hypoplasia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Finally, mice lacking either <italic>ARTN</italic> or <italic>GFRα3</italic> develop ptosis owing to failure of sympathetic neurons form the cervical superior ganglion to innervate the tarsus muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p>
<p>Given the overlapping spectra of congenital abnormalities found both in SLOS patients and <italic>Ret</italic> mutant mice and the necessity of intact lipid rafts for optimal Ret function, in the present work we aimed to elucidate whether abnormal Ret signaling plays a role in the pathogenesis of SLOS. Analysis of the genito-urinary and enteric nervous systems of <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> or <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>; Ret</italic><sup>+<italic>/EGFP</italic></sup> mice revealed no abnormalities consistent with compromised Ret signaling. Although kidneys from mutant mice branched at a slower pace than those from wild type littermates when explanted in the absence of exogenous cholesterol, sympathetic neurons from mutant mice showed normal responses to GDNF under the same conditions. Moreover, critical components of Ret signaling including GFRα1 or Src family kinases from knockout mice partitioned to the lipid raft fraction in flotation gradients, suggesting that 7-DHC allows formation of lipid rafts that efficiently support Ret signaling. In support with this notion, removal of cholesterol followed by replenishment with 7-DHC efficiently supported GDNF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt in MG87 fibroblasts cultured in the absence of cholesterol. Collectively, the data indicate that aberrant Ret signaling is unlikely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of SLOS.</p>

<title>Urinary and enteric nervous systems are largely normal in newborn <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout mice</title>
<p>Although no major defects in kidney and digestive system were described in <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout mice, we sought to investigate whether subtle abnormalities reflecting compromised Ret signaling could be identified in these mice. Macroscopic examination of the genito-urinary system of newborn mutant mice revealed no overt malformations consistent with aberrant Ret signaling such as kidney aplasia or hypoplasia, cystic or supernumerary kidneys, or ureter abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>, left panel). Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that mutant kidneys had normal architecture, with well-organized cortex and medulla, a prominent nephrogenic zone, and no cystic dilations or signs of hydronephrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>, left panel). The number of glomeruli was also similar between <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout mice and their wild type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>), consistent with proper branching of the ureteric bud. We next wanted to check the status of enteric nervous system. Immunostaining of colon from newborn mice with PGP9.5, which labels enteric neuronal precursors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> showed no signs of colonic aganglionosis, the hallmark of Hirschsprung disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, left panel). Enteric plexus density was assessed throughout the entire gut by means of acetylcholinesterase staining, which labels cholinergic enteric neurons, revealing no differences between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, right panel).</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Removal of one <italic>Ret</italic> allele does not cause renal or enteric abnormalities in <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout mice</title>
<p>The above results were not surprising in light of the relatively mild phenotype of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> null mutants when compared to SLOS patients. Besides cleft palate and immature lungs, <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout mice show no overt developmental abnormalities reminiscent of the human disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. It is usually assumed that such discrepancies are due to differences in transplacental cholesterol transport between species, being it obligated in rodents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> but not humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Thus, maternal cholesterol transfer to embryos, possibly via Abca1 cholesterol transporter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, would compensate cholesterol deficiency in murine but not human embryos. To determine whether reduction in <italic>Ret</italic> gene dosage could unveil suboptimal Ret signaling in the context of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> deficiency, we crossed <italic>Dhcr7</italic> mutant mice to heterozygous <italic>Ret</italic> knockin mice expressing one copy of <italic>EGFP</italic> from the <italic>Ret</italic> locus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, thus allowing easy tracking of Ret-expressing cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, removal of one copy of <italic>Ret</italic> did not affect ureteric bud branching or enteric plexus density (n ≥ 3 for each genotype), thus reinforcing the idea that no major abnormalities related to abnormal Ret signaling are found in <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout mice. Taken together, the above observations are not consistent with abnormal Ret function in the developing urinary and nervous systems of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout mice.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Ureteric bud branching of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> mutant metanephroi is reduced <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To examine Ret signaling avoiding the confounding effect of maternal cholesterol transfer, we decided to place embryonic metanephroi from <italic>Dhcr7</italic> mutant embryos in culture, in the absence of any exogenous source of cholesterol. As stated in the introduction, ureteric bud branching is critically dependent on GDNF-Ret signaling, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and in explant culture. We explanted metanephroi from E12.5 wild type and null embryos in defined medium containing retinoic acid, and counted ureteric bud tips after two and five days <italic>in vitro</italic>. We pooled data from wild type and <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout mice irrespectively of the <italic>Ret</italic> allele expressed as no differences on ureteric bud branching were found between <italic>Ret</italic><sup>+<italic>/EGFP</italic></sup> and <italic>Ret</italic><sup>+<italic>/</italic>+</sup> embryos within a given <italic>Dhcr7</italic> genotype (data not shown). We then stained <italic>Ret</italic><sup>+<italic>/</italic>+</sup> metanephric explants with an antibody against CalbindinD-28k, a marker of the ureteric bud<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, or directly photographed <italic>Ret</italic><sup>+<italic>/EGFP</italic></sup> metanephroi under a fluorescence microscope. We used both techiniques at both 2 days <italic>in vitro</italic> and 5 days <italic>in vitro</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>, small but significant differences between wild type and <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout metanephroi were found after two days in culture, which increased with time in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Thus, ureteric bud branching is reduced in <italic>Dhcr7</italic> null embryonic kidneys when cultured in defined medium and are therefore devoid of exogenous cholesterol.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Ret signaling is not affected by deletion of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> in sympathetic neurons</title>
<p>Even though signaling by the GDNF-GFRα1-Ret axis is the major player in ureteric bud branching, the above observations do not directly prove suboptimal Ret signaling in this system. To directly assess biological responses downstream of Ret, we chose sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion as a model system. The importance of lipid rafts in Ret signaling has been extensively characterized in sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion (SCG)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. We first used immunoblots to phosphorylated ERK as a readout of Ret signaling in sympathetic neurons cultured for five days in the presence of lipid-depleted serum, and stimulated with GDNF in the presence soluble GFRα1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, no major differences on GDNF-mediated ERK phosphorylation were found between wild type and mutant neurons. We next assessed survival of sympathetic neurons in the presence of increasing concentrations of GDNF and a fixed concentration of sGFRα1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>, no differences between genotypes were observed at any of the concentrations assayed. Neurite outgrowth of SCG explants in response to GDNF was also similar between wild type and <italic>Dhcr7</italic> null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Thus, at least for sympathetic neurons, mutation of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> does not appear to have any consequence on GDNF-induced Ret signaling.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>GFRα1 partitions to lipid rafts in brains from <italic>Dhcr7</italic> null mice</title>
<p>As stated in the introduction, GFRα1, which is located to lipid rafts by virtue of its glycosylphosphatydilinositol anchor, recruits Ret to these membrane domains upon ligand stimulation. We next investigated whether lack of effect of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> mutation on Ret bioactivity in neurons was due to normal partition of GFRα1 to lipid rafts. To this end, we generated flotation gradients from neonatal brain extracts of both control and <italic>Dhcr7</italic> null mice. Importantly, cholesterol does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus the contribution of maternal cholesterol to central nervous system drops from E10-11 onwards, being 90% of neonatal brain cholesterol of embryonic origin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Therefore, 7-DHC but not cholesterol is the major sterol in brains from <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, GFRα1 was mainly found in the high-buoyant, lipid raft fractions, in both wild type and <italic>Dhcr7</italic> mull mice. Partition of other critical components of Ret signaling such as Src family kinases was also similar in wild type and <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Distribution of lipid raft (GM1 ganglioside, caveolin-1 and flotillin-1) and non-raft (transferrin receptor) markers indicated correct fractionation of the samples. Thus, loss of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> does not affect distribution of critical components of Ret signaling to lipid rafts in brain, suggesting that 7-DHC can efficiently support Ret signaling. To directly test this hypothesis, we conducted cholesterol depletion followed by 7-DHC replenishment experiments. We first confirmed that depletion of membrane cholesterol by means of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) affected signaling downstream of Ret in the mouse fibroblast cell line MG87 stably expressing Ret and GFRα1, a widely used model to study Ret signaling. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>, GDNF-mediated phosphorylation of both ERKs and Akt were affected by increasing concentrations of MβCD to different extents, being the PI3-K/Akt pathway more sensitive to cholesterol depletion. Since MβCD was toxic at high concentrations even for short exposure times, we used the lowest effective concentration of this compound (4 mM) and focused on p-Akt phosphorylation for replenishment experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>, replenishment of cellular membranes with 7-DHC supported GDNF-mediated Akt phosphorylation to levels comparable to those obtained in parallel cultures not subjected to depletion/replenishment treatments, or to cells replenished with cholesterol. Interestingly, replenishment with 7-DHC in the presence of BM15766, a novel Dhcr7 inhibitor, did not substantially changed Akt phosphorylation, indicating that conversion of 7-DHC to cholesterol was not responsible for rescuing the pathway. To assess the efficacy of these stripping/replenishment experiments, we measured both 7-DHC and cholesterol in cell extracts by means of liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS/MS), as described in methods. MβCD depleted approximately half of the cellular cholesterol, which was efficiently replenished by MβCD:Cholesterol. Importantly, MβCD:7-DHC complexes did not increase cholesterol above levels found in cells treated with MβCD alone, indicating that 7-DHC was not being converted to cholesterol in cells exposed to MβCD:7-DHC. Finally, we only detected 7DHC in cells treated with MβCD:7-DHC complexes but not in the rest of conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B,C</xref>). Taken together, these experiments indicate that 7-DHC efficiently supports Ret signaling.</p>

<sec disp-level="1">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present work we examined the hypothesis of whether suboptimal Ret signaling could explain some of the developmental abnormalities found in SLOS patients. Such hypothesis was formulated based on the overlapping phenotypes of SLOS patients and <italic>Ret</italic> mutant mice, and the observation that lipid rafts are critical for proper Ret signaling.</p>
<p>Even though the genetic defect causing SLOS is well-established, the molecular mechanisms leading to the plethora of developmental malformations found in SLOS patients are only partially understood. Besides being a fundamental component of plasma membranes, cholesterol serves as precursor for a number of important biomolecules such as bile acids, steroid hormones and signaling molecules. Such multiplicity of functions makes it unlikely that a single molecular mechanism underlies the pathogenesis of SLOS. Moreover, not only cholesterol deficiency but the toxic effects of 7-DHC (or its derived oxysterols) buildup may account for some of the complications found in SLOS patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. A number of observations suggest that membrane structural and functional properties may be affected in SLOS patients. 7-DHC has been shown to induce changes in the physico-chemical properties of both artificial and cellular membranes, including fluidity, electric potential, and curvature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. These changes likely account for functional alterations of membrane proteins such as the NMDA and serotonin receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Of particular interest are the abnormalities found in lipid rafts, as cholesterol is one important component of these membrane microdomains. Thus, 7-DHC has been shown to induce changes in both the lipid and protein composition of rafts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Likewise, changes in lipid raft stability may account for impaired degranulation responses of mastocytes in response to IgE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, or for alterations in caveolae and the potassium channel BK<sub>Ca</sub> in skin fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Despite these observations, our data show that GFRα1 (and Src-family kinases) equally partition to lipid raft fractions in brain extracts from both wild type and Dhcr7 null mice, suggesting that at least in central neurons Ret would be correctly recruited to lipid rafts upon GDNF stimulation. It is important to stress that brain cholesterol is synthesized by the embryo from E11.5 onwards, and therefore maternal cholesterol is likely to be residual in brains from newborn <italic>Dhcr7</italic> null mice. Even though GFRα1-mediated recruitment is not the only mechanism by which Ret moves to lipid rafts upon ligand stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, recent <italic>in vivo</italic> data show that it constitutes the major mechanism involved in such translocation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
<p>We have found that embryonic kidney explants from knockout mice branch at a slightly slower pace than their wild type counterparts. Even though GDNF-Ret signaling is the master regulator of kidney branching, we do not know whether these defects are caused by impaired Ret signaling in mutant kidneys. In light of our results with sympathetic neurons we find such possibility unlikely, although we cannot exclude the possibility that sensitivity of Ret signaling to 7-DHC varies depending on the cellular context. Thus, mice expressing a ‘non-raft’ version of <italic>GFRα1</italic> (<italic>GFRα1</italic><sup><italic>TM/TM</italic></sup> mice) show defects on urogenital, enteric and motor but not sympathetic nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However, the renal phenotype of <italic>GFRα1</italic><sup><italic>TM/TM</italic></sup> mice is a fully penetrant, complete kidney agenesis, whereas we observe a modest branching defect that at the most suggests that 7-DHC partially supports Ret signaling in the ureteric bud. Alternatively, other signaling molecules that play a secondary role in kidney branching might be affected by lack of cholesterol/increased levels of 7-DHC. Thus, signaling by FGF10 is able to induce kidney morphogenesis in animals lacking <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Sprouty1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Similarly, perturbation of Shh signaling causes kidney defects in mice ranging from kidney hypoplasia to kidney agenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Interestingly, altered SHH signaling is consistent with some SLOS features such as holoprosencephaly and polydactyly, and previous cell culture work demonstrates diminished responses to Shh in cholesterol-depleted cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. However, the effect of Dhcr7 on the activity of the Shh pathway is controversial. Studies in Xenopus show that Dhcr7 negatively regulates the pathway by inhibiting Smo, in a reductase-independent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. In contrast, Bijlsma and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> show that secretion of pro-vitamin D3 (whose precursor is 7-DHC) inhibits Smo activity, suggesting that Dhcr7 should activate the pathway by keeping the levels of 7-DHC low. In contrast, a more recent work provides compelling genetic and pharmacological evidence that reduced cholesterol rather than increased 7-DHC or oxysterol levels block Shh pathway by impairing Smo activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. All these observations point to a complex regulation of the Shh pathway by sterols beyond their role as covalent modifications of the Shh molecule. Another intriguing mechanism by which 7-DHC might regulate kidney morphogenesis is through modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Thus, a very recent report establishes that elevated 7-DHC but not diminished cholesterol levels are responsible for aberrant neuronal differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells derived from SLOS patients, via inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Interestingly, genetic inactivation of β-catenin in the ureteric bud in mice leads to kidney agenesis/dysgenesis owing to reduced ureteric bud branching<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results show that 7-DHC has the ability to support Ret signaling in several model systems, indicating that impaired Ret function is unlikely to contribute to the pathogenesis of SLOS.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Neurons from the sympathetic superior cervical ganglion of newborn <italic>Dhcr7</italic> mice cultured as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref> with minor modifications. Briefly, ganglia were enzymatically digested, dissociated and plated on rat tail collagen-coated dishes in medium containing 50 ng/ml NGF (Alomone labs, Jerusalem, Israel) and 10% lipid-depleted fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 5–7 days. For survival experiments cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of GDNF plus 100 ng/ml Fc-GFRα1 (R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Neuronal survival was assessed by counting neurons of designated fields before and after treatments at the indicated time points. For immunoblots cells were treated in complete medium as above, deprived of NGF overnight, and stimulated for 10 minutes with 50 ng/ml GDNF plus 100 ng/ml Fc-GFRα1. For SCG explants, whole superior cervical ganglion from newborn Dhcr7 mice were dissected and plated in collagen matrices in the presence of NGF and charcoal stripped serum (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Twenty four hours later, each well was washed three times with PBS and switched to medium supplemented with GDNF (50 ng/ml) and charcoal stripped serum for five days.

<title>Manipulation of membrane cholesterol</title>
<p>Membrane cholesterol was depleted by adding 4 mM MβCD (Sigma) dissolved in serum-free medium to cells for 30 min at 37 °C. For replenishment experiments, cholesterol depletion with 4mM MβCD was followed by a 30 min incubation with 4 mM MβCD alone, or complexed with 0.4 mM 7-DHC or 0.4 mM cholesterol in serum free medium. 7-DHC was complexed to MβCD following the method of Christian and collaborators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Briefly, 7-DHC was dissolved in chloroform:methanol 1:1 (v:v) to a concentration of 50 mg/ml. An aliquot of this solution was added to a glass tube and evaporated. Then the appropriate volume of MβCD dissolved in serum-free medium was added, sonicated and mixed overnight at 37 °C. Solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μM filter before use. Cholesterol: MβCD complexes were purchased from Sigma and adjusted to 1:10 molar ratio with MβCD. When indicated, BM15766 (Sigma) was included at a final concentration of 5 μM.

For LC-Q-TOF-based lipid molecular species analyses, lipid extracts were subjected to liquid chromatography-mass-spectrometry using a HPLC 1290 series coupled to ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS 6520 (Agilent Technologies, Barcelona, Spain). Two microliters of lipid extract were injected onto an XBridge BEH C18 shield column (100 mmL × 2.1 mm ID × 1.7 μm; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) kept at 80 °C. The mobile phases, delivered at 0.5 ml/min, consisted of ammonium formate (20 mM at pH 5) (A) and methanol (B). The gradient started at 50% B and reached 70% B in 14 min and was followed by a slow gradient of 70–90% B over 50 min and an isocratic separation at 90% B for 15 min. The mobile phase B subsequently reached 100% over 5 min and was maintained for an additional 5 min<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>.

<p>For targeted search of cholesterol, 7-DHC and 13C-cholesterol (internal standard) MassHunter Qualitative Analysis Software (Agilent Technologies, Barcelona, Spain) was used. Specifically, “Find by formula” algorithm was applied to select the main ion for each compound. These ions ((M + H) + (−H2O) = 367.3360 for 7-DHC, (M + H) + (−H2O) = 369.3519 for cholesterol and (M + H) + (−H2O) = 370.3519 for 13C cholesterol) were used for metabolite quantification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.</p>

<title>7-DHC supports Ret signaling.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) MG87 cells were treated or not with MβCD for 30 min to deplete cholesterol (stripping), followed by 30 min replenishment step with MβCD alone, loaded with 7-DHC or with cholesterol, or with 7-DHC in the presence of the Dhcr7 inhibitor BM15766. Cells were then stimulated with GDNF for 10 minutes. Total lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with the indicated antibodies. (<bold>B</bold>) Representative extracted ion chromatograms and MS spectrum for 7-DHC and Cholesterol in samples from cells replenished with MβCD:7-DHC complexes. Chromatograms shown retention times of the compounds and the MS peak used for quantification. The ions selected for quantification was m/z (M + H) + (−H2O): 367.3360 for 7-DHC and m/z (M + H) + (−H2O): 369.3519 for cholesterol. (<bold>C</bold>) Relative abundances of 7-DHC and cholesterol measured by means of LC-QTOF-MS in two independent experiments. Numbers indicate the ratio of the indicated metabolite (7-DHC or cholesterol) with respect to an internal standard (<sup>13</sup>C-cholesterol). N.d.: not detected.</p>
