<abstract>
<p>Difficulties in social communication are part of the phenotypic overlap between autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia. Both conditions follow, however, distinct developmental patterns. Symptoms of ASD typically occur during early childhood, whereas most symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia do not appear before early adulthood. We investigated whether overlap in common genetic influences between these clinical conditions and impairments in social communication depends on the developmental stage of the assessed trait. Social communication difficulties were measured in typically-developing youth (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, <italic>N</italic>⩽5553, longitudinal assessments at 8, 11, 14 and 17 years) using the Social Communication Disorder Checklist. Data on clinical ASD (PGC-ASD: 5305 cases, 5305 pseudo-controls; iPSYCH-ASD: 7783 cases, 11 359 controls) and schizophrenia (PGC-SCZ2: 34 241 cases, 45 604 controls, 1235 trios) were either obtained through the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) or the Danish iPSYCH project. Overlap in genetic influences between ASD and social communication difficulties during development decreased with age, both in the PGC-ASD and the iPSYCH-ASD sample. Genetic overlap between schizophrenia and social communication difficulties, by contrast, persisted across age, as observed within two independent PGC-SCZ2 subsamples, and showed an increase in magnitude for traits assessed during later adolescence. ASD- and schizophrenia-related polygenic effects were unrelated to each other and changes in trait-disorder links reflect the heterogeneity of genetic factors influencing social communication difficulties during childhood versus later adolescence. Thus, both clinical ASD and schizophrenia share some genetic influences with impairments in social communication, but reveal distinct developmental profiles in their genetic links, consistent with the onset of clinical symptoms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The phenotypic overlap between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia is complex and dates back to Kanner in 1943.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Individuals affected by either condition display deficits in the ability to initiate and maintain reciprocal interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> This includes impairments in social cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> but also poor social competence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> affecting verbal and nonverbal communication skills. Recent cross-disorder genetic analyses highlighted the continuity of psychiatric phenotypes beyond current diagnostic boundaries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> The nature of shared genetic influences between childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD, and adult-onset psychiatric illnesses, like schizophrenia, however, remains less well understood.</p>
<p>ASD represent a group of neurodevelopmental conditions with a typical age of onset before the age of 3 years affecting ~1 to 2% of children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Core features include deficits in social interaction and communication, as well as highly restricted interests and/or stereotyped repetitive behaviours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> By contrast, schizophrenia is an adult-onset psychiatric illness with a typical first-time diagnosis between 16 and 30 years. The disorder has a lifetime prevalence of ~1%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> and is characterised by hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech or behaviour, apathy and lack of emotional reactivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Both ASD and schizophrenia are highly heritable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> and recent studies have linked different types of genetic variation including common variants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> as well as rare inherited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> and <italic>de novo</italic> variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> to risk of illness in both conditions. Contemporary research strongly supports a genetic overlap between ASD and schizophrenia for rare copy number variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> and rare <italic>de novo</italic> mutation events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> with converging evidence for gene sets involved in synaptic function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> The role of shared common genetic risk between ASD and schizophrenia, however, is less clear. Common genetic influences account for 25 to 33%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> of total liability to schizophrenia and up to 49% of total liability to ASD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Despite this, the common genetic overlap between ASD and schizophrenia is small compared with the overlap between psychiatric adult-onset only disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The framework of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), including social communication difficulties, now actively facilitates the study of functional dimensions spanning the full range of human behaviour from normal to abnormal and across development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Common disorders, due to their polygenic architecture, can be understood as quantitative traits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> For ASD, following the findings of earlier twin studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> there is now molecular evidence for shared common genetic influences with social communication difficulties during childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> The genetic continuity of social interaction and communication deficits in schizophrenia has not yet been observed though it can be hypothesised that such common genetic links exist given the impairments in social cognition within first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Impaired abilities in social communication in affected children are heritable (twin<italic>-h</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.74)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> and a large part of these genetic influences can be captured through common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; SNP-<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>⩽0.45).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Beside some stable genetic influences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> genetic factors underlying social interaction impairments and social communication difficulties vary during development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> especially for common variation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Thus, we hypothesise that also the genetic overlap between social communication difficulties and clinically recognised disorder may change during childhood and adolescence.</p>
<p>The primary aim of this study is to examine the nature of common polygenic influences in ASD and schizophrenia through their genetic overlap with phenotypic symptoms in the general population that are shared between both conditions, but differ according to developmental stage. We predict that if social communication difficulties are part of a common shared aetiology between ASD and schizophrenia, trait-disorder relationships for both conditions should follow similar patterns. Dissimilar patterns due to independent genetic influences would be expected for a non-shared genetic aetiology. Here, we report developmental profiles in common genetic overlap for both ASD and schizophrenia with respect to longitudinal measures of social communication difficulties within the general population. Analyses are based on the largest publicly available genome-wide data for ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> and schizophrenia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> in addition to a large Danish ASD sample from the iPSYCH project and a deeply-phenotyped UK birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup></p>

<title>Population-based social communication difficulties</title>
<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were carried out in ALSPAC participants, a UK population-based longitudinal pregnancy-ascertained birth cohort (estimated birth date: 1991–1992).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Ethical approval was obtained from the ALSPAC Law-and-Ethics Committee (IRB00003312) and the Local Research-Ethics Committees, written informed consent was obtained from a parent or individual with parental responsibility and assent was obtained from child participants.</p>
<p>ALSPAC children were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad-chip and imputation was performed on 8237 children and 477,482 SNP genotypes using a 1000 Genomes reference (PhaseI_v3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1000genomes.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.1000genomes.org/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>Quantitative social communication problems in ALSPAC children were assessed with the 12-item Social Communication Disorder Checklist (SCDC; score-range: 0 to 24).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> The SCDC is a brief screening instrument of social reciprocity and verbal/nonverbal communication (for example, ‘Not aware of other people’s feelings’), with high reliability and good validity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> which has been extensively investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Higher SCDC scores reflect more social communication deficits and are positively skewed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Mother-reported scores for children and adolescents were repeatedly measured at 8, 11, 14 and 17 years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and are inter-correlated (Spearman's <italic>ρ</italic>: 0.39 to 0.57, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Information on phenotypic and genotypic data was available for 4175 to 5553 children (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>SCDC scores were residualised for sex, age and the two most significant ancestry-informative principal components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> and then rank-transformed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Transformed scores showed similar correlation patterns as untransformed scores (Pearson' <italic>r</italic>: 0.38 to 0.61, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Genome-wide single marker summary statistics were generated by regressing rank-transformed residuals on allele dosages using SNPTEST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> (without genomic control-based correction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup>).</p>

<sec>
<title>Clinical ASD</title>
<p>The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) has completed a genome-wide scan of 5305 ASD cases and their parents (PGC-ASD), all of European ancestry (2015 freeze; summary results at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/</ext-link>). An ASD diagnosis was confirmed using research standard diagnoses and expert clinical consensus diagnoses. 94.1% of all ASD cases had also a diagnosis of autism from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> and/or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Genome-wide data were imputed to a 1000 Genomes reference (PhaseI_v3) and genetic association studied using a case and pseudo-control design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> This design is robust to population stratification as pseudo-controls are based on un-transmitted parental alleles, and thus cases and pseudo-controls are ancestrally matched. To replicate findings, we analysed ASD GWAS summary results in the Danish iPSYCH project (iPSYCH-ASD: 7783 ASD cases, 11 359 controls) using samples from the Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank hosted by Statens Serum Institute (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).

<p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> was applied to estimate the cumulative effect of common SNPs on either variation in developmental SCDC scores or risk to disorder (SNP-<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>), using GWAS statistics and exploiting LD patterns in the genome. LD score correlation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> analysis was carried out to estimate genetic correlations (r<sub>g</sub>) between SCDC scores and clinical conditions, or among clinical conditions, that is, the extent to which two phenotypes share common genetic factors, based on GWAS statistics.

Using a range of <italic>P</italic>-value thresholds (0.001&lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>T</sub>⩽ 1), PGS for ASD (based on PGC-ASD), schizophrenia (based on PGC-SCZ2) and schizophrenia subsamples (based on PGC-SCZ1 and PGC-SCZ2i) were generated in ALSPAC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) using imputed genotypes (1000 Genomes, PhaseI_v3, INFO&gt;0.8). For this, common autosomal signals observed in clinical samples (with MAF&gt;0.01 in ALSPAC) were clumped (LD-r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.25, ±500 kb) consistent with current guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> using PLINK,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> excluding duplicate SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).

<p>Mixed Poisson regression (R:lme4 library) was utilised to test the trend in common genetic overlap longitudinally using untransformed SCDC scores.

<title>SNP-heritabilities for social communication difficulties and psychiatric disorder</title>
<p>Genome-wide analyses of population-based SCDC scores at 8, 11, 14 and 17 years provided little evidence for bias in GWAS statistics due to population stratification. The estimated LDSC-<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> intercepts were consistent with one, ranging from 0.988 (s.e.=0.0067) to 1.009 (s.e.=0.0070; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In subsequent analyses LDSC-<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> intercepts were thus constrained to one, including LDSC correlation analyses.</p>
<p>Cumulative influences of SNPs on variation in SCDC scores were strongest at the age of 8, 11 and 17 years with LDSC-<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> estimates of 0.19 (s.e.=0.06), 0.17 (s.e.=0.07) and 0.30 (s.e.=0.11), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The estimates were lower, however, at 14 years (LDSC-<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.08 (s.e.=0.06)). These LDSC-based findings mirrored closely GCTA-<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> estimates using GREML (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), although latter might potentially be biased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> SCDC scores shared furthermore genetic factors across development (GREML r<sub>g</sub>=0.38 (s.e.=0.16) to 0.95 (s.e.=0.34), <italic>P</italic><sub>min</sub>=2 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), as previously reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> with lower correlations across wider age gaps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Genetic correlations between social communication difficulties and psychiatric disorder</title>
<p>As part of a two-stage analysis design (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), we used constrained LD score correlation to study the genetic overlap between psychiatric disorder and social communication problems during development. Genetic correlations between rank-transformed social communication difficulties and clinical ASD decreased in point estimates with progressing age of the trait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). For PGC-ASD, the genetic link with SCDC scores was strongest at 8 years (r<sub>g</sub>=0.34 (s.e.=0.15), <italic>P</italic>=0.027)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> and attenuated by 17 years (r<sub>g</sub>=0.01 (s.e.=0.12), <italic>P</italic>=0.94). This pattern was replicated in iPSYCH-ASD (r<sub>g</sub>=0.35 (s.e.=0.13), <italic>P</italic>=0.008 and r<sub>g</sub>=0.02 (s.e.=0.10), <italic>P</italic>=0.81, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). In contrast, common genetic links between schizophrenia and social communication difficulties during childhood and adolescence persisted and increased in point estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Within PGC-SCZ1, genetic overlap with SCDC scores started to emerge at 8 years (r<sub>g</sub>=0.20 (s.e.=0.08), <italic>P</italic>=0.01) and was strongest at 17 years (r<sub>g</sub>=0.24 (s.e.=0.08), <italic>P</italic>=0.004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The genetic link during later adolescence was replicated in PGC-SCZ2i (age 17: r<sub>g</sub>=0.15 (s.e.=0.06), <italic>P</italic>=0.011, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and also observed in the combined PGC-SCZ2 sample (PGC-SCZ1+PGC-SCZ2i: r<sub>g</sub>=0.18 (s.e.=0.06), <italic>P</italic>=0.003, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). These findings were not affected by the presence of a small proportion of individuals of Asian origin (PGC-SCZ2-Eur: r<sub>g</sub>=0.18 (s.e.=0.06), <italic>P</italic>=0.004, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Importantly, other PGC adult-onset disorders, such as MDD and BIP, showed no correlations with SCDC scores (Age 17: MDD-r<sub>g</sub>=−0.05 (s.e.=0.11), <italic>P</italic>=0.65 and BIP-r<sub>g</sub>=0.04 (s.e.=0.08), <italic>P</italic>=0.62, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) suggesting that findings are specific to schizophrenia. Note that LD-score correlations between schizophrenia and ASD (r<sub>g</sub>=0.20 (s.e.=0.05), <italic>P</italic>=0.00011) were modest, compared with considerably stronger links between schizophrenia and other adult-onset disorders (for example, BIP-r<sub>g</sub>=0.76 (s.e.=0.04), <italic>P</italic>=6.5 × 10<sup>−70</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>For comparison, we also analysed trait-disorder overlap using LD score correlation without constraining intercepts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).

<title>Polygenic scores for risk-increasing alleles predicting social communication difficulties</title>
<p>To provide an absolute measure of shared genetic influences between traits and clinically recognised conditions, we assessed the phenotypic variance in rank-transformed social communication difficulties due to risk-increasing alleles using polygenic scoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Alleles more common in ASD cases than in pseudo-controls were only associated with variation in SCDC scores at 8 years (PGC-ASD: adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>max</sub>=0.13%, <italic>P</italic><sub>min</sub>=0.0042, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). In contrast, alleles more often present in schizophrenia cases than controls explained predominantly variation in social communication difficulties at 17 years, based on risk alleles in both PGC-SCZ subsamples (PGC-SCZ1: adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>max</sub>=0.26%, <italic>P</italic><sub>min</sub>=0.00058; PGC-SCZ2i: adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>max</sub>=0.19%, <italic>P</italic><sub>min</sub>=0.0028; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>) and the combined PGC-SCZ2 sample (adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>max</sub>=0.43%, <italic>P</italic><sub>min</sub>=0.000012, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Excluding ALSPAC children with a clinical ASD diagnosis had little influence on the reported changes in genetic effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Importantly, adjustment of ASD-PGS and schizophrenia-PGS for each other did not affect the nature of these findings, suggesting the independence of ASD- and schizophrenia-related polygenic influences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess developmental trends in common genetic trait-disorder overlap, we modelled the effect of ASD-PGS and schizophrenia-PGS on untransformed SCDC scores longitudinally. Applying a mixed Poisson model, we found evidence for age-specific changes in genetic effects for both ASD-PGS and schizophrenia-PGS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). For example, at <italic>P</italic><sub>T</sub>&lt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), a threshold shown to predict schizophrenia case-ness in independent samples,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> the effect of ASD-PGS decreased with progressing age of the trait (ASD-PGS × SCDC-age: Beta=−0.0031 (s.e.=0.0014), <italic>P</italic>=0.019, 95%-bootstrapped confidence interval: −0.0057 to −0.00035), while the effect of schizophrenia-PGS increased (schizophrenia-PGS x SCDC-age: Beta=0.0029 (s.e.=0.0014), <italic>P</italic>=0.030, 95%-bootstrapped confidence-interval: 0.00047 to 0.0054). Consistent with the findings for rank-transformed scores, ASD-related polygenic influences on SCDC score counts were strongest during childhood (age 8: Beta=0.047 (s.e.=0.017), <italic>P</italic>=0.0056; age 17: Beta=0.019 (s.e.=0.018), <italic>P</italic>=0.29), while schizophrenia-related polygenic effects were more pronounced during later adolescence (age 8: Beta=0.046 (s.e.=0.017), <italic>P</italic>=0.0080; age 17: Beta=0.072 (s.e.=0.018), <italic>P</italic>=0.000056).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provided evidence for shared common genetic overlap between social communication difficulties and both ASD and schizophrenia, but does not imply a shared genetic susceptibility between these clinical conditions. Instead, we identified distinct patterns in genetic trait-disorder relationships, largely consistent with the onset of clinical symptoms. Genetic links were driven by independent polygenetic influences and showed opposite trends in magnitude with progressing age of the population-based trait, as supported by longitudinal analyses.</p>
<p>Genetic overlap with ASD was strongest for social communication difficulties during middle childhood (r<sub>g</sub>~33%), in line with recent cross-sectional studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> while those with schizophrenia was strongest for social communication difficulties during later adolescence (r<sub>g</sub>~18%). Complementary estimates were provided by polygenic scoring analyses. Up to 0.13% phenotypic variation in social communication difficulties could be explained by ASD risk-increasing alleles during childhood and up to 0.43% phenotypic variation by schizophrenia risk-increasing alleles during later adolescence, independently of each other. The genetic overlap with social communication difficulties during later adolescence was not observed for other adult-onset disorders, such as BIP, despite their strong genetic links with psychosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> making unspecific age-related influences unlikely. Thus, our findings suggest that social communication impairments are part of the genetically influenced phenotypic spectrum of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Changes in genetic overlap over time need to be viewed within the context of cohort-specific sampling properties and clinical sample power. For instance, it is possible that the genetic overlap between schizophrenia and social communication difficulties has been underestimated, as SCDC-missingness, and more generally study non-participation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> has been related to common genetic risk for schizophrenia. In contrast, there was little evidence for a link between SCDC missingness and common ASD risk. In addition, mother-report of social communication difficulties may have contributed to enhanced variance sharing among population-based traits, and thus underestimated the true variation in child genetic effects. Finally, the studied clinical discovery sets differed in their inherent power. For example, the power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> of ASD-PGS (PGC-ASD ~5000 trios) was only 0.58 compared with 0.99 for schizophrenia-PGS (PGC-SCZ2, <italic>N</italic>~80 000), assuming a liability-scale SNP-<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.23 for ASD and 0.25 for schizophrenia, a disease prevalence of 0.01, a type-I-error rate of 0.05 and a population-based target sample of 5000 individuals. Under attrition, such as a decrease of ~1000 ALSPAC participants during later adolescence, the power of ASD-PGS would further drop (to 0.49), while the power of schizophrenia-PGS remains largely unaffected (0.99). Longitudinal analyses, adjusting for differences in population-based sample numbers across time through bootstrapping, suggested, however, that the observed developmental changes in polygenic risk effects are robust, even in the presence of sample dropout.</p>
<p>Our results have direct relevance for the definition of RDoC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> within a developmental context. The lack of support for shared polygenic effects between ASD and schizophrenia, with respect to social communication impairments, is in agreement with recent studies. Molecular analyses of PGC samples reported modest correlations between ASD and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> (r<sub>g</sub>~0.20), confirmed within this study, and twin research suggested little genetic overlap between autistic traits and psychotic experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> The absence of shared aetiological factors strengthens furthermore positions suggesting that the exact nature of social deficits implicated within ASD and schizophrenia differs from each other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> Here we show that common genetic variation underlying complex disorders can be dissected through temporal changes in the genetic architecture of behavioural symptoms that are shared between disorders. Thus, a developmental analysis of genetic relationships between population-based and clinical samples can be informative with regard to the dimensional nature of psychiatric illness without discarding the aetiology of different disorders, a concern often raised with respect to RDoC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The identification of distinct patterns in common genetic overlap between social communication difficulties and psychiatric illness is consistent with the presence of multiple distinct genetic influences contributing to variation in social communication behaviour during development. While genetic factors underlying SCDC scores across ~3-year intervals are stable and shared by at least 80%, only ~50% of common genetic influences are shared across 10 years intervals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> This may suggest developmental (but not rapid) changes in the phenotype capture by the SCDC with progressing age. For example, it is possible that the behavioural phenotypes influencing SCDC scores at age 8 or 11 years are, in terms of average composition, different from those influencing the scale at age 17. Social communication abilities comprise many components, such as social interaction, social cognition, pragmatic and language processing skills (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.asha.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.asha.org/</ext-link>), some of which will vary during child and adolescent development, including changes in the social-cognitive understanding of friendship and peer interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> One might envisage that these phenotypic changes reflect distinct genetic factors driving different stages of postnatal brain development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> In addition, social communication difficulties have been linked to behavioural problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> Note that the SCDC has a high sensitivity but a lower specificity in discriminating ASD from the non-ASD patients in the presence of other clinical disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Thus, the SCDC is likely to capture multiple behavioural and cognitive dimensions related to social communication problems during the course of child and adolescent development, spanning around 10 years, which give rise to distinct patterns in trait-disorder overlap. This poses questions on the nature of genetic influences affecting variation in social communication impairments across development that will require exploration with longitudinal genome-wide approaches and biological network analyses.</p>

<p>Proportion of variance in SCDC scores explained by polygenic scores for (<bold>a</bold>) clinical ASD and (<bold>b</bold>) clinical schizophrenia. Polygenic scores were constructed in ALSPAC based on the largest publicly available samples for ASD (PGC-ASD) and schizophrenia (PGC-SCZ2) as a training set, and then Z-standardised. The proportion of explained phenotypic variance in rank-transformed SCDC scores (adjusted regression <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) is displayed cross-sectionally at 8, 11, 14 and 17 years and given with respect to ASD-PGS (<bold>a</bold>) and schizophrenia-PGS (<bold>b</bold>). Nine different <italic>P</italic>-value thresholds <italic>P</italic><sub>T</sub> for selecting risk alleles (PGS bins) in clinical samples are displayed.

<caption>
<p>Developmental changes in genetic effects of polygenic scores for (<bold>a</bold>) clinical ASD and (<bold>b</bold>) clinical schizophrenia on SCDC scores. Polygenic scores (PGS) were constructed in ALSPAC based on the largest publicly available samples for ASD (PGC-ASD) and schizophrenia (PGC-SCZ2) as a training set, and then Z-standardised. A <italic>P</italic>-value threshold of <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> &lt;0.05 for selecting risk alleles in clinical samples is displayed. Using a mixed Poisson regression framework, longitudinal measures of untransformed SCDC score counts were regressed on ASD-PGS and schizophrenia-PGS simultaneously allowing for changes in genetic effects over time. Repeatedly assessed SCDC score counts in ALSPAC were available at 8, 11, 14 and 17 years of age with individual ages ranging between 7 to 18 years. Genetic effects for ASD-PGS (<bold>a</bold>) and their 95% confidence intervals (shaded) as well as schizophrenia-PGS (<bold>b</bold>) and their 95% confidence intervals (shaded) were estimated across development, and show the increase in SCDC log counts per standard deviation in PGS score. A dotted line indicates the <italic>P</italic>-value of the genetic effect.
