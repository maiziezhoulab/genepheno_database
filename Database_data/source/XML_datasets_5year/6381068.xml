<abstract>
<p>Perinatal brain injury (PBI) leads to neurological disabilities throughout life, from motor deficits, cognitive limitations to severe cerebral palsy. Yet, perinatal brain damage has limited therapeutic outcomes. Besides, the immature brain of premature children is at increased risk of hypoxic/ischemic (HI) injury, with males being more susceptible to it and less responsive to protective/therapeutical interventions. Here, we model in male and female C57BL/6 mice, the impact of neonatal HI and the protective effects of neonatal handling (NH), an early life tactile and proprioceptive sensory stimulation. From postnatal day 1 (PND1, modeling pre-term) to PND21 randomized litters received either NH or left undisturbed. HI brain damage occurred by permanent left carotid occlusion followed by hypoxia at PND7 (modeling full-term) in half of the animals. The behavioral and functional screening of the pups at weaning (PND23) and their long-term outcomes (adulthood, PND70) were evaluated in a longitudinal study, as follows: somatic development (weight), sensorimotor functions (reflexes, rods and hanger tests), exploration [activity (ACT) and open-field (OF) test], emotional and anxiety-like behaviors [corner, open-field and dark-light box (DLB) tests], learning and memory [T-maze (TM) and Morris Water-Maze (MWM)]. HI induced similar brain damage in both sexes but affected motor development, sensorimotor functions, induced hyperactivity at weaning, and anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive deficits at adulthood, in a sex- and age-dependent manner. Thus, during ontogeny, HI affected equilibrium especially in females and prehensility in males, but only reflexes at adulthood. Hyperactivity of HI males was normalized at adulthood. HI increased neophobia and other anxiety-like behaviors in males but emotionality in females. Both sexes showed worse short/long-term learning, but memory was more affected in males. Striking neuroprotective effects of NH were found, with significantly lower injury scores, mostly in HI males. At the functional level, NH reversed the impaired reflex responses and improved memory performances in hippocampal-dependent spatial-learning tasks, especially in males. Finally, neuropathological correlates referred to atrophy, neuronal densities and cellularity in the affected areas [hippocampal-CA, caudate/putamen, thalamus, neocortex and corpus callosum (CC)] point out distinct neuronal substrates underlying the sex- and age- functional impacts of these risk/protection interventions on sensorimotor, behavioral and cognitive outcomes from ontogeny to adulthood.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Perinatal brain injury (PBI) due to hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is such a devastating early insult that it is considered to be a major contributor to perinatal morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of neonatal HI encephalopathy (HIE) due to an oxygen and glucose deprivation during birth is 1.5–3 and up to 6 per 1,000 livebirths in developed and developing countries, respectively (Kurinczuk et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>). The perinatal brain is highly susceptible to damage due to the prevailing development processes. The most vulnerable regions to injury are the ones with greatest metabolic demands (sensorimotor cortex and basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum and brainstem; Thorngren-Jerneck et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">2001</xref>). Consequently, PBI can lead to long-term neurologic disability in both children and adults, including cognitive limitations, learning difficulties, attention or motor deficits (van Handel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">2007</xref>) and even cerebral palsy, and seizures (Platt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">2007</xref>). Despite the improvements in neonatal care, brain damage in term newborn infants still remains a clinical problem, with research constrained by obvious ethical limitations. Most importantly, the immature brain of premature children is at increased risk of hypoxic ischemic injury (Vannucci and Hagberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">2004</xref>) with males born prematurely being reported as most susceptible to it and with worse developmental and adult outcomes (Elsmén et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2004</xref>; Peacock et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">2012</xref>; Månsson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>It is considered that the experimental model of HI-induced neonatal injury initially described by Vannucci and Vannucci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">1997</xref>) for the rat (Rice et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">1981</xref>), and also adapted to the mouse in several laboratories (Sheldon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">1998</xref>; Hagberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>; Northington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2006</xref>) is a useful translational technique to better understand the effects of HI injury in human brain. Moreover, this technique at postnatal day (PND) 7–10 is equivalent to a term human infant (Semple et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">2013</xref>; Mallard and Vexler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2015</xref>). Although many experimental studies, mostly in rats, report morphological, biophysical and biochemical changes following HI brain insult (Towfighi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">1991</xref>; Huang and Castillo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2008</xref>; Shrivastava et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2012</xref>), there is a scarcity of data to understand the consequential behavioral changes. However, some reports do suggest that injured animals exhibited sensorimotor deficits (i.e., Jansen and Low, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">1996</xref>; Bona et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">1997</xref>) and suffered certain learning disabilities (i.e., Young et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">1986</xref>; Balduini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2000</xref>; Ikeda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>; McAuliffe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2006</xref>). Sex differences regarding the final outcome after an adult stroke or after neonatal HI had been documented (Bona et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1998</xref>; Hagberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2004</xref>; Hurn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2005</xref>; Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">2014</xref>; Netto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2017</xref>). These differences are justified by the presence of sex-specific hormones that may influence the consequences of early HI brain injury (Hill and Fitch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2012</xref>) but also to socio-economic and neonatal variables (Månsson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2015</xref>). In spite of these sex differences, most studies involving HI still demonstrate usage of male and female animals indistinctly (i.e., Chou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2001</xref>; Ten et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">2003</xref>; Lubics et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2005</xref>; Spandou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">2005</xref>; Ikeda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>; Pazos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, developmental psychobiology and neuroscience have pointed out ontogeny as a singular window of brain vulnerability but also plasticity, where early-life paradigms involving exposure to distinct stimuli during the 1st weeks of life are shown to be critical for short- and long-lasting modeling of the brain structure and function (Levine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">1957</xref>; Levine and Broadhurst, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">1963</xref>; Levine et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">1967</xref>). In rodents, early postnatal stimulation [neonatal handling (NH) in its most frequent form] consisting of brief maternal separation with/without tactile stimulation, prompts profound and long-lasting effects of anxiety and stress responses, novelty-seeking, learning and memory through different epigenetic neurobiological mechanisms (revised by Fernández-Teruel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2002</xref>). More importantly, compelling effects of this intervention also include the rescue of perinatal brain insults due to stress, malnutrition or alcohol exposure (revised by Raineki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">2014</xref>). In the case of brain injury induced by HI, prevention of hippocampal damage (Rodrigues et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">2004</xref>) and improvement of learning (Chou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2001</xref>) were elicited in rats by maternal separation and tactile stimulation starting at PND8. Beneficial effects of tactile sensory stimulation have been attributed to the fact that neural pathways from skin to the CNS mature before other sensory systems (Montagu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">1953</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of the current research work was to do a longitudinal study of the behavioral and functional impact of HI brain injury in male and female mice, at weaning and at adulthood. We also aimed to assess the effects of NH used as a protective sensory intervention. For this purpose, we evaluated the short- and long-term effects of a neonatal HI insult in the behavioral profile of gold-standard C57BL/6 mice strain at PND7, an age modeling full-term babies. At the same time, a group of animals was used to assess the potential preventive effects of NH administered during the ontogenic development of the pups, from PND1 to weaning (PND21), mimicking an intervention started in pre-term babies and lasting all through their childhood. For the behavioral and functional screening of the pups at weaning (PND23) and their long-term outcomes (adulthood, PND70) we used a series of tests to evaluate four dimensional areas: somatic development and sensorimotor integration, exploratory behavior, emotionality and anxiety-like behaviors, and cognition. Finally brain pathology was measured by means of brain injury score to evaluate the neurologic impact of the risk/protection events in different neuroanatomical regions at 90 days of age (PND90). This will allow us to find the functional correlates.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2-1">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Sixty-six C57BL/6 mice were bred and maintained in macrolon cages (35 cm × 35 cm × 25 cm) under standard laboratory conditions (food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>, 22°C ± 2°C, 50%–70% relative humidity, 12 h light:dark cycle, lights on at 08:00 h).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-2">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>A longitudinal study with factorial design HI × NH × S was made to evaluate the functional impact of HI, the effects of NH in sham and HI animals, and the factors sex and age. Age factor was studied to evaluate the long-term effects, from weaning at PND23 to adulthood (PND70), of the risk/protective interventions studied. The total 66 mice came from 12 L with an average of 5.50 + 0.45 pups. Litters were randomly distributed by treatments and gender in 8 different experimental groups (<italic>n</italic> = 7–11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Two animals (1 male/sham, 1 female/hypoxia) died from PND23 to PND90, and were therefore excluded of the statistical analysis.</p>

<sec id="s2-3">
<title>Hypoxia/Ischemia</title>
<p>HI brain damage occurred at PND7 by permanent left carotid occlusion and exposure to hypoxia as previously described (Sheldon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">2001</xref>). Briefly, a midline ventral skin incision was made under isoflurane anesthesia (4.5% v/v for induction and 2.5% v/v for maintenance, and 0.6 L/min of O<sub>2</sub>); the left carotid artery was exposed and sutured with a 8/0 silk surgical suture. After surgery, pups were returned to their dam for at least 1.5 h to recover. Later, litters were placed for 55 min in a hypoxic chamber containing 8% of oxygen balanced with nitrogen, with controlled humidity and temperature maintained at 37°C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-4">
<title>Handling</title>
<p>NH was administered from PNDs 1 to 21 (Fernández-Teruel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">1991</xref>). The first daily session, administered in the morning (9:30 a.m.), consisted of first removing the mother from the litter, and then weighing the pups and placing them gently and individually in plastic cages (35 cm × 15 cm × 25 cm) lined with soft article towel. After 4 min in this situation, each pup was individually (and gently) handled and stroked thrice with the thumb on the dorsal surface (rostro-caudal direction) for 3–4 s and returned to the same cage for the remaining 4 min. At the end of the 8-min period, each pup was gently handled for another 3–4 s, stroked again and then returned to its home cage. When all the pups from 1 L were back in their home cage, the mother was returned to it. The same procedure (without weighing the animals) was conducted in the afternoon (2nd time; approximately at 4:30 p.m.). NH finished at PND 21. Weaning was done at PND 21, after finishing the last NH session. Non-handled groups were left undisturbed, except for regular cage cleaning once a week, until weaning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-5">
<title>Behavioral and Functional Assessments</title>
<p>Animals were assessed in a longitudinal design, at weaning (PND23) and adulthood (PND70 or 70-days-old) as summarized in the time line shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. A three-stage protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) for behavioral and functional phenotype assessment (Giménez-Llort et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2002</xref>) evaluated the somatic development (primary screening), sensorimotor functions and motor activity (secondary screening) as well as non-cognitive and cognitive functions (tertiary screening). The tests used were as follows: somatic development (weight), sensorimotor functions [visual and hind limb reflexes, rod test and hanger test, cylinder test (CYT)], locomotor [activity (ACT) and open-field (OF) test] as well as non-cognitive and cognitive functions-emotional and anxiety-like behaviors [corner, OF and dark-light box tests (DLB)]; learning and memory (TM test and MWM). All the apparatus were thoroughly cleaned, with 5% ethanol, and dried between trials/animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-6">
<title>Body Weight (BW)</title>
<p>Body Weight (BW) was monitored at weaning (PND23), adulthood (PND70) and at the end point (PND90).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-7">
<title>Sensorimotor Functions (SMT)</title>
<p>The physical condition of the mice was evaluated by their BW and performance in sensorimotor tasks. Visual reflex and hind limbs extension reflex were measured three times by holding the animal by its tail and slowly lowering it toward a black surface. Complete extension of the forelimbs towards the surface (visual reflex) or the extension of hind limbs were considered a positive response. Motor coordination and equilibrium were assessed twice (20-s trials) in two consecutive rod tasks of increasing difficulty. The distance covered and the latency to fall off a 1.3 cm wide wooden wire rod and a 1 cm diameter metal wire rod (both, 1 m long) were recorded. The hanger test was used to measure prehensility or grasping and motor coordination by the distance covered and the number of elements of support and the latency to fall. The animal was allowed to cling with its forepaws from the middle of a horizontal wire (2 mm diameter, 40 cm length, divided into eight 5 cm segments) for two trials of 5 s. A third trial of 60 s was used to complement these measures with that of muscle strength or resistance. All the apparatus were suspended 40 cm above a padded table.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-8">
<title>Cylinder Test (CYT)</title>
<p>The CYT was used to assess forelimb asymmetry (Schallert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">2000</xref>). Animals were individually placed in a Plexiglas transparent cylinder (10 cm diameter, 12 cm height). Each animal was video-recorded for 5 min. Initial forepaw (left/right/both) placement of each weight-bearing full rear was recorded. The asymmetry score that reflected the preference of the unimpaired (left) limb was calculated according to the following formula:[(number of left contacts + <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> both contacts)/number of (left + right + both contacts)]×100; where 50% indicates an animal that explores symmetrically with both limbs, higher scores (&gt;50%) indicate a greater reliance on the ipsilateral limb, and lower scores (&lt;50%) indicate a greater reliance on the contralateral limb. We also measured the number and the total amount of grooming time, the latency of “hoppy” or “pop-corn behavior” described by Wahlsten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">1974</xref>) as vigorous jumping shown in pups, and the number of full rears performed in the 5 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-9">
<title>Spontaneous Motor Activity Test (ACT)</title>
<p>The mice were individually tested in a multicage activity meter system (four home cages −35 cm × 35 cm × 25 cm—simultaneously, Sensor Unit PANLAB 0603, Panlab, S.L., Barcelona, Spain) set to measure horizontal and vertical spontaneous motor activity during 30 min. Animals were individually tested in a standard (but novel and clean) home cage containing a small amount of clean sawdust on the floor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-10">
<title>Corner Test (CT) and Open Field Test (OF)</title>
<p>Neophobia was assessed in the corner test (CT) for 30 s. Animals were individually placed in the center of a clean standard home cage, filled with wood save bedding. Latency of the first rearing, number of corners visited and of vertical displacements (rearings) were recorded. Immediately after, exploratory and anxiety-like behaviors were measured during 5 min in a white open-field (homemade, wooden, 55 × 55 × 25 cm) under 20 lux light conditions. Mice were individually placed in the center of the arena. Horizontal (crossings, 10 × 10 cm) and vertical (rearings) activities were recorded for each minute of the test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-11">
<title>Dark–Light Box Test (DLB)</title>
<p>Anxiety and risk assessment were measured for 5 min after introducing the animals into the dark compartment of the DLB (Panlab, S.L., Barcelona, Spain). The apparatus consisted of two compartments (black, 27 cm × 18 cm × 27 cm, white, 27 cm × 27 cm × 27 cm illuminated by a red 20 W bulb) connected by an opening (7 cm × 7 cm). The experimental room was kept in darkness (without illumination). Mice were introduced into the black compartment and observed for 5 min. Total number of entries (all four paws), and time spent in the white-illuminated compartment were recorded. Latency to enter, time spent and number of entries into the lit compartment, the number of stretch attendances and self-groomings were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-12">
<title>T-Maze Test (TM)</title>
<p>Exploratory activity, anxiety, working and short-term memory were assessed in an enclosed TM (woodwork; short arm: 40 × 15 × 30; goal arms: 30 × 15 × 30 cm), three trials 15 min apart, in a day. Each trial involved one forced and one free choice. Mice were placed inside the short arm of the maze and the latency to reach the intersection and the time elapsed until mice completed 20 s in the forced arm were recorded. Fifteen seconds later, mice were allowed to explore the maze in a free choice trial where both arms were accessible. The arm chosen was recorded and considered an error if it was not different of that in the forced choice.</p>

<title>Morris Water Maze (MWM)</title>
<p>Animals were tested for spatial learning and memory in three paradigms in the MWM test consisting of 1 day of cue learning and 4 days of place learning for spatial reference memory, followed by one probe trial. Mice were trained to locate a hidden platform (7 cm diameter, 1 cm below the water surface) in a circular pool for mice (Intex Recreation Corp., Long Beach, CA, USA; 91 cm diameter, 40 cm height, 25°C opaque water), located in a completely black painted 6 m<sup>2</sup> test room. Mice failing to find the platform were placed on it for 10 s, the same period as the successful animals. The protocol (Giménez-Llort et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2007</xref>) was used as follows: 1 day of cue learning, 4 days of place learning followed by a probe trial.</p>
<sec id="s2-13-1">
<title>Cue Learning With a Visible Platform</title>
<p>On the first day, the animals were tested for the cue learning of a visual platform consisting of four trials in 1 day. In each trial, the mouse was gently released (facing the wall) from one randomly selected starting point (E or W) and allowed to swim until it escaped onto the platform, elevated 1 cm above the water level in the <italic>N</italic> position and indicated by a visible striped flag (5.3 × 8.3 × 15 cm). Extra maze cues were absent in the black painted walls of the room.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-13-2">
<title>Place Learning With a Hidden Platform</title>
<p>On the following day, the place learning task consisted of three trial sessions per day for 4 days with trials spaced 30 min apart. The mouse was gently released (facing the wall) from one randomly selected starting point (E or W, as these are equidistant from the target) and allowed to swim until escaped onto the hidden platform, which was now located in the middle of the S quadrant. Mice that failed to find the platform within 60 s were placed on it for 10 s, the same period as was allowed for the successful animals. White geometric figures, one hung on each wall of the room, were used as external visual clues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-13-3">
<title>Removal</title>
<p>Two hours after the last trial of the place learning task, the platform was removed from the maze and the mice performed a probe trial of 60 s to evaluate their spatial memory for the platform position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-13-4">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Behavior was evaluated by both direct observation and analysis of videotape-recorded images. Variables of time (escape latency, quadrant preference), distance covered, and swimming speed were analyzed in all the trials of the tasks. The escape latency was readily measured with a stopwatch by an observer who was unaware of the experimental group, and was confirmed during the subsequent video-tracking analysis. A video camera placed above the water maze recorded the animal’s behavior and thereafter an automated system (Smart, Panlab S.L., Barcelona, Spain) enabled computerized measurement of the distance traveled by the animal during the trials. The swimming speed (cm/s) of the mice during each trial was calculated. In the probe trial, the time spent in each of the four quadrants, the distance traveled along them, and the number of crossings over the removed platform position (annulus crossings) were also measured retrospectively by means of the automated video-tracking analysis.</p>

<title>Neuropathological Analysis</title>
<p>Brain damage was analyzed by histological analysis at PND90 (Shrivastava et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2012</xref>). Mice were i.p. anesthetized (ketamine and xylazine 80/10 mg/Kg) and perfused using 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). Subsequently, brains were postfixed for 4 h in the same fixative, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, frozen with dry CO<sub>2</sub>, and finally stored at −80°C until use. Brains were serially cut in a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S) in 30 μm thick sections and stored in −20°C mounted on Flex IHC slides (Dako). To determine the injury score, slides were processed for Nissl staining. One series of parallel sections from each animal (6–10 mice/survival time) was air dried at room temperature for an hour, rinsed and incubated with Nissl solution (0.1% toluidine blue in walpole buffer 0.2 M and pH 4.5) at room temperature for 3 min and washed with distilled water. Sections were dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with DPX.</p>

<p>HI and NH effects and HI × NH interaction were found in the neuropathological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). No sex effects were detected at the level of brain injury induced, as shown by the injury scores and histological appearance (only males shown). HI animals presented high injury scores as compared to null values in the two control groups, sham and handled.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present work addresses the short and long-term behavioral and functional impact of neonatal HI brain injury in a term (PND7) mice model using a longitudinal approach and taking into consideration sexual dimorphism. It also provides evidence of a remarkable neuropathological protection elicited by NH. This tactile and proprioceptive sensory stimulation was administered to mice from PND1, a temporal frame modeling premature children, when the human immature brain is at increased risk of HI injury, mostly in males. NH not only ameliorated the behavioral outcomes and functional capacities but also showed differences in a sex- age- and task-selective manner. Several levels of study were considered from behavior to neuropathology, including key areas of clinical interest such as BW, sensorimotor function, physical/motor activity, emotionality, cognitive function and finally brain pathology in different neuroanatomical regions. The evaluation of these risk/protective events studied at weaning and adulthood indicates that benefits observed in the developmental outcome also result in long-term sustained effects, which contributes to their translational interest. Besides, the results indicate that even with similar HI-induced brain injury scores, interaction effects with sex are important to be taken into consideration when assessing the outcome of preventive and/or therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>In contrast to most studies describing detailed neuropathological changes in the rat model, here we provide the neuropathological tissue damage at 90 days, and the neuroanatomical distribution in both male and female C57BL/6 mice strains. In agreement with a devastating early PBI insult, the histopathological analysis of HI brains provided evidence of the severity of the experimentally induced brain injury, and the histopathological protection conferred by NH intervention. PBI is considered as one of the major contributors to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Here, the mean index of postnatal mouse mortality due to surgery or hypoxia was 19.31%, with 18.46% for males and 20.00% for females, showing no statistical differences between sexes.</p>
<p>High variability in size and severity of the infarct between animals is a significant drawback of the HI experimental model (Vannucci and Vannucci, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">2005</xref>; Millar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">2017</xref>). It seems that sex, severity, time of injury or even the brain lateralization of the lesion can significantly affect the outcome of Rice-Vannuci model (Lubics et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2005</xref>; Sanches et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">2013b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">2015</xref>). In this regard, it is noticeable that, in the present work, the HI-procedure induced homogeneous total injury scores and neuroanatomical distribution in both sexes. Most importantly, this allowed us to highlight the capacity of NH to reduce the injury score in most of the areas, albeit not all of them reached statistical significance.</p>
<p>In contrast to other early life interventions studied in the literature, we unveil for the first time a relevant sex-dependent improvement of NH on HI, with HI + NH males being more responsive than females. This is important to note since sex differences have been considered in recent years. It has been reported that male infants are more vulnerable to perinatal insult than female infants, and they also suffer more long-term cognitive deficits. Males showed increased risk of development disorders, including speech and language, autism, learning disabilities and cerebral palsy compared to females (Donders and Hoffman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2002</xref>; Rutter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">2003</xref>; Marlow et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2005</xref>; Tioseco et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">2006</xref>; Hill and Fitch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2012</xref>). Some authors also refer that being “male” has been identified as a universal risk factor for the incidence of neonatal stroke as well as developmental delays (Elsmén et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2004</xref>; Peacock et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">2012</xref>; Månsson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2015</xref>). Moreover, after pediatric traumatic brain injury, girls demonstrate a significantly better outcome in tests of learning and memory (Donders and Hoffman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2002</xref>; Hurn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2005</xref>). In our present work, HI males showed a worse performance in the memory test as compared to HI females and the improvement induced by NH in HI males was supported by better levels of hippocampal preservation.</p>
<p>Behavioral and functional phenotype assessment was performed using a three-stage protocol (Giménez-Llort et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2002</xref>). The somatic development was evaluated as primary screening, and BW was used for that. Feeding dysfunction and nutritional problems has been associated with poor growth and health status in children with cerebral palsy and neurological impairment (i.e., Reilly et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">1996</xref>; Sullivan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">2000</xref>; Fung et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2002</xref>). Experimentally, the few number of studies addressing this issue has shown lower daily weights in HI rats (Andiné et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1990</xref>; Balduini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2001</xref>; Lubics et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2005</xref>; Girard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2012</xref>). Here we found differences in growth rate of HI mice that worsened with age and were long-lasting. The results also indicate that in males sex BW was more sensitive to the impact of HI than in females, who exhibited lower weight later in adulthood. This was in agreement with the sex-dependent vulnerability that we found in the behavioral outcome.</p>
<p>The secondary screening evaluated the sensorimotor functions and motor activity. Strength, motor coordination and several reflex responses (righting, geotaxis, gait and cliff aversion) were reported as impaired after HI insult in rats and mice (Ten et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">2003</xref>; Fan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2005</xref>; Lubics et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2005</xref>; Karalis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2011</xref>). Here, other sensorimotor tasks such as the visual and extension reflexes, prehensility or grasping, equilibrium and coordination were found also impaired by HI. Again, for the first time, we show the relevance of “sex and age” factorial interaction as well as the comparative degree of functional severity. Spontaneous functional recovery in motor coordination and righting, geotaxis and gait reflexes were found in some of those previous works (Lubics et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2005</xref>; Karalis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2011</xref>). In our case, in spite of the high maturation of motor systems in adults, these tasks were more demanding for them, due to increased body size vs. the rods widths. This could explain that functional motor recovery was only seen for HI-induced hyperactivity in males. Thus, HI-males spontaneously returned to the normal values shown by sham animals, but deficient reflexes were still evident at 70 days of age.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this persistence of sensorimotor impairments until adulthood makes the beneficial effects induced by NH more remarkable, mostly in the reflex responses. This early life tactile and proprioceptive sensory stimulation reversed not only the impairment in reflexes but also exerted beneficial effects on coordination and equilibrium. Senses of touch, balance and proprioception are the first of the seven sensory systems developed during ontogeny. Thus, in the present work, the improvement of the vestibular system can be considered a notorious effect of NH, as compared to sensory outputs achieved in other studies (Paolucci et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2015</xref>). It is likely that the handling protocol, that involves the animals being held by the experimenter and the pups individually resting in the cage, may constitute a scenario where the vestibular system is challenged, trained and reinforced. In fact, early tactile and vestibular stimulations were postulated as crucial for motor behavior development (i.e., Labarba et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">1974</xref>; Clark et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1977</xref>) with the maturation rate of inhibitory systems (Oakley and Plotkin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">1975</xref>) as a hypothesis to explain hyperexcitability stages, such as the pop-corn behavior shown by mice (Wahlsten, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">1974</xref>) and as also observed here, in terms of emotional behaviors, which can be modulated by sensorimotor training (Caston and Lateurte, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1997</xref>). In agreement with the pyramid of learning postulated by Taylor and Trott, 1991 (as cited in Williams and Shellenberger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">1994</xref>), an improvement in the sensory integration dysfunction induced by HI, mostly in males, should also facilitate the improvement in learning capacities, as shown by our results. In the histological analysis, the injury score of the underlying neuroanatomical areas was reduced, but further experiments with detailed evaluation of these areas will provide clues about this sensory integration hypothesis.</p>
<p>Regarding the motor development, although some authors have described no impairment in the CYT (Sanches et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">2013a</xref>), most of them reported that HI causes a preference to use the unimpaired forepaw (Grow et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2003</xref>; Chang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2005</xref>; Jones et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2008</xref>; Kim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2008</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2010</xref>; van Velthoven et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">2010</xref>; van der Kooij et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">2010</xref>; Pazos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2012</xref>), as was also shown in the present work. In agreement with literature (Fan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2013</xref>), no differences between male and female were observed. The poorer motor skills in children with neonatal encephalopathy compared to control could be related with the size of the CC (Van Kooij et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">2008</xref>). This is important to note, since in the present work the CC is the area that shows, in both sexes, a statistical significant reduction of injury score in mice receiving NH.</p>
<p>The tertiary screening assessed locomotor activity and non-cognitive functions. It is well established that hippocampal areas are highly vulnerable to HI, and that hippocampal injury leads to hyperactivity (Shen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">1991</xref>). Most of the studies report that HI mice present hyperactivity in spontaneous ACTs or in the OF test (Balduini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2001</xref>; Ten et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">2004</xref>; McAuliffe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2006</xref>; Arteni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2010</xref>; Schlager et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">2011</xref>; Rojas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">2013</xref>). Lubics et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2005</xref>) also detected that although HI were more active; when locomotion requires a higher level of coordination, mice can be hypoactive. Short test duration (Chou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2001</xref>) and assessment in the light period (Antier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1998</xref>) can also elicit reduced activity in HI rodents, probably because under these conditions they reflect an anxiogenic response. Thus, in the present work we show that the expression of neophobia and anxiety-like behaviors depend on the anxiogenic conditions of the test. In mild anxiogenic conditions the animals were found hyperactive, exhibiting a hyperexcitability stage, while with higher illumination they showed reduced exploratory activity. This was consistent with the behavioral responses shown in the other tests (the DLB and the performance in the long arm of the TM) and is also in agreement with other works (Girard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2012</xref>; Carletti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2012</xref>; Sanches et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">2013a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">b</xref>; Soares et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Academic performance and intellectual abilities are important aspects in children with neonatal encephalopathy (Robertson and Finer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">1993</xref>; Moster et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">2002</xref>; van Handel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">2007</xref>). At a translational level, cognitive impairment has been reported many times, especially in the MWM. Learning impairments (Young et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">1986</xref>; Ikeda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>; Ten et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">2003</xref>; de Paula et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2009</xref>; Arteni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2010</xref>) related to a longer time to escape in ischemic group (Balduini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2001</xref>; Chou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2001</xref>; Ten et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">2004</xref>; Ikeda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>; Huang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2009</xref>) and memory dysfunction in the probe trial (Ten et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">2004</xref>; Huang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2009</xref>). Like us, no impairments in swimming ability or speed have been observed in injured animals (Ikeda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>; Arteni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2003</xref>). Arteni et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2010</xref>) described lateralized and sex-dependent behavioral and morphological effects of unilateral neonatal cerebral HI in the rat. In other works (Ikeda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2001</xref>; Arteni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2003</xref>) only animals that suffered a right HI injury performed worse in the working memory tasks. This lateralized effect could explain why, in our case, working memory is not affected in HI animals.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports regarding sex differences in the functional recovery following HI in neonatal handled animals. Nesting environment (Mason et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2018</xref>), rehabilitative training (Tsuji et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">2010</xref>) or early-life interventions based on environmental rearing conditions (Pereira et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">2008</xref>; Fan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2011</xref>; Rojas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">2015</xref>; Nie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2016</xref>; Schuch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">2016</xref>) that share mechanisms of action with NH (Fernández-Teruel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2002</xref>), also show sex-specific neuroprotection patterns. In these works, the sex differences analyzed in the recovery of HI after environmental enrichment or rehabilitative training in rats, described partial recovery in working memory in adolescent rats (Pereira et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">2008</xref>) and improved swimming time and length in females but not in males after rehabilitative training (Tsuji et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">2010</xref>). Thus, it is remarkable to note that the above mentioned studies showed sex-specific neuroprotection patterns, but with female sex as the most resilient, while males seemed to be less responsive to the interventions. On the other hand, different protocols for maternal separation lead to distinct behavioral outputs, from behavioral protection without morphological changes (Chou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2001</xref>) or reduction of hippocampal CA volume (Lehmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2002</xref>) to worsening of the effects of neonatal HI (Tata et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">2015</xref>). In other experimental models of aging, neurological and psychiatric diseases, NH has also demonstrated positive effects in behavior, such as a reduction of anxiety-like behavior or an improvement in learning and memory (Levine and Otis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">1958</xref>; Alasmi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1997</xref>; Gschanes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1998</xref>; Raineki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">2014</xref>). Also, we have previously shown that NH has long-term effects on reducing the impact of N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) excitotoxicity, reducing the incidence of seizures, their number and severity in rats psychogenetically selected for high- and low-avoidance (Fernández-Teruel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2002</xref>). Furthermore, we have proved that the behavioral outcome in brain damage related to Alzheimer’s disease can be modulated by NH, in both males and females at adulthood (Cañete et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2015</xref>) and even at very advanced stages of disease in 17-month-old triple-transgenic mice (Torres-Lista and Giménez-Llort, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Many studies reported morphological, biophysical and biochemical changes following HI brain insult, especially in ipsilateral cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus, after arterial occlusion (Towfighi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">1991</xref>; Huang and Castillo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2008</xref> ; and our own precedent work Shrivastava et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2012</xref>), but there is scarcity of data to understand the consequential behavioral changes. Similarly, although morphological neuroprotective action in the hippocampus was reported after tactile stimulation (Rodrigues et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">2004</xref>), no behavioral outcomes were evaluated. Therefore, in the present study, we also aimed to estimate the translation of the injury score on function for both risk (HI) and protection (NH) interventions. We looked for meaningful correlations related to behavioral variables, showing the functional impact of damage due to brain injury and its protection by NH. On the one hand, the analysis of neuropathological correlates shows that the level of damage induced/restored, measured in terms of atrophy, neuronal densities or cellularity in the affected areas, can be functionally correlated with behavioral variables. On the other hand, the behavioral correlates referred to changes in the five main behavioral domains of the pyramid of learning (i.e., physical/motor, sensory, behavioral, emotional and cognitive). The analysis identified the hippocampus as the most affected area, which could explain why it was difficult to completely reverse all the cognitive deficits in females. Caudate/putamen, thalamus and CC showed the highest percentages of prevention that may underline the better behavioral outcome in tasks dependent on these areas.</p>
<p>Concerning the translation of the experimental NH administered to mice from PND1, it could model an early tactile and proprioceptive sensory stimulation implemented on preterm infants. Since the functional sensory response of preterm children is immature (Fitzgerald, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2005</xref>), the clinical benefits may apply more specifically to older preterm infants (&gt;30 weeks gestational age) or HI infants post hypothermia treatment. The neuroprotective effect of early-life stimulation could also be important during the pregnancy or prenatal period, as considered by Netto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2018</xref>) and Durán-Carabali et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2017</xref>). At the clinical level, the standard of care in cases of moderate to severe HIE is therapeutic hypothermia which has been demonstrated to increase long-term survival without disability (Tagin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">2012</xref>). Despite the efficiency of hypothermia, it is not enough to prevent all injury or neurological symptoms. Brain damage in term newborn infants therefore remains a clinical problem due to there being limited therapeutic outcomes and since research is constrained by obvious ethical limitations. The therapeutical approaches investigating how to prevent or minimize the consequences of the HI insult have reported efficacy of handling depending on the severity of the damage (Chou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2001</xref>). In our study, we demonstrate for the first time that, under similar injury conditions, males are the sex with better responsiveness to this early life intervention, mostly at the neuropathological level, as shown by the injury scores and the different number of areas protected. To a lesser extent, this protective effect on the neuropathological consequences of HI insult also has a functional impact on the behavioral output. This was shown by the better performances in some tasks and the neuropathological correlates that point out distinct neuronal substrates underlying the sex- and age- related functional impacts of these risk/protection interventions on sensorimotor, behavioral and cognitive outcomes from ontogeny to adulthood.</p>
<p>In conclusion, HI brain damage affected motor development and sensorimotor functions, and induced hyperactivity at weaning; anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive deficits during the adulthood in a sex- and age-selective manner. At the functional level, handling reversed the impaired reflex responses and allowed improvement in memory performances in the hippocampal-dependent spatial learning test (MWM), in males. At an individual level, remarkable neurological protection elicited by NH correlated with improved functional capacities. Strong correlations were found between the sensorimotor, behavioral and cognitive outcomes and the injury scores based on atrophy, neuronal densities and cellularity in the different affected areas (hippocampus, caudate/putamen, thalamus, neocortex and CC). These neuropathological correlates point at distinct neuronal substrates underlying the functional capacity to meet task-dependent performance demands and neuroanatomical targets for recovery. Overall, the present results provide evidence on a therapeutical potential of early life interventions based on tactile and proprioceptive sensory stimulation in the newborns with brain injury. It supports those in the literature who defend the benefits of perinatal rearing conditions as being important to be considered as adjuvant to the current treatments. Moreover, it shows a sex-specificity that benefits male sex, who were more at risk and reported to be less responsible to most interventions.</p>
