<abstract>
<p>Microtubule severing enzymes implement a diverse range of tissue-specific molecular functions throughout development and into adulthood. Although microtubule severing is fundamental to many dynamic neural processes, little is known regarding the role of the family member Katanin p60 subunit A-like 1, KATNAL1, in central nervous system (CNS) function. Recent studies reporting that microdeletions incorporating the <italic>KATNAL1</italic> locus in humans result in intellectual disability and microcephaly suggest that KATNAL1 may play a prominent role in the CNS; however, such associations lack the functional data required to highlight potential mechanisms which link the gene to disease symptoms. Here we identify and characterise a mouse line carrying a loss of function allele in <italic>Katnal1</italic>. We show that mutants express behavioural deficits including in circadian rhythms, sleep, anxiety and learning/memory. Furthermore, in the brains of <italic>Katnal1</italic> mutant mice we reveal numerous morphological abnormalities and defects in neuronal migration and morphology. Furthermore we demonstrate defects in the motile cilia of the ventricular ependymal cells of mutants, suggesting a role for <italic>Katnal1</italic> in the development of ciliary function. We believe the data we present here are the first to associate KATNAL1 with such phenotypes, demonstrating that the protein plays keys roles in a number of processes integral to the development of neuronal function and behaviour.</p>

<sec>
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microtubule severing enzymes are a family of AAA-ATPase proteins that participate in fundamental cellular processes such as mitosis, ciliary biogenesis and growth cone motility. In neurons this family is known to control such processes as axonal elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> and synaptic development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> In addition, mutations in microtubule severing enzyme genes <italic>SPG4</italic>, <italic>KATNB1</italic> and <italic>KATNAL2</italic> are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, cerebral malformations and autism, respectively,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> and mutations in <italic>Fign</italic> cause a range of phenotypes in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Currently the microtubule severing enzyme KATNAL1 is poorly characterised and it is not yet understood how the enzyme functions in the nervous system. Recent evidence from genetic characterisation of human patients suggests that haploinsufficiency of <italic>KATNAL1</italic> is linked with a number of symptoms including intellectual disability (ID) and craniofacial dysmorphologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> It is also notable that a very rare <italic>KATNAL1</italic> mutation has been associated with schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/~spurcell/genebook/genebook.cgi?user=guest&amp;cmd=verb-gene&amp;tbox=KATNAL1" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/~spurcell/genebook/genebook.cgi?user=guest&amp;cmd=verb-gene&amp;tbox=KATNAL1</ext-link>) and that Peters syndrome and autism have both been associated with the chromosomal region containing the <italic>KATNAL1</italic> locus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Although such association studies strongly suggest that <italic>KATNAL1</italic> plays a fundamental role in the central nervous system (CNS), additional studies using cellular or animals models are required to understand how the gene may be causative for disease. Here we present the first study describing neural and behavioural deficits associated with a loss of function allele of <italic>Katnal1</italic> in the mouse. This mutant mouse line was independently identified in two parallel phenotyping screens, which demonstrated that mutant mice showed both male sterility and circadian phenotypes. Subsequent behavioural investigations demonstrated that this mutation is associated with anxiety and memory deficits. Underlying these behavioural phenotypes, we identified histopathological abnormalities in the brains of <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mutants, including disordered cellular layers in the hippocampus and cortex and substantially larger ventricles. Further investigations demonstrated that <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice show neuronal migration and ciliary function deficits suggesting KATNAL1 plays an essential role in these processes. These findings are the first to our knowledge to conclusively show that mutations in <italic>Katnal1</italic> lead to behavioural and neuronal disturbances and provide insight regarding the clinical associations that have been linked to the gene.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec>
<title>Identification and cloning of the <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup>
<italic>1H</italic>
</sup> mutation</title>
<p>To identify novel gene mutations affecting circadian behaviour we undertook a circadian running wheel screen of pedigrees of <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea mutagenised mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> In one pedigree 17.65% of animals showed a short circadian period in constant darkness (&lt;23 h observed in 12 out of 68 animals screened). An outcross using an affected female produced no affected animals (33 animals screened). In subsequent intercross screens 15.5% of animals were affected (53 out of 342 animals screened), suggesting that the pedigree carries a mutation causing a recessive circadian phenotype which is 60% penetrant. We found no gender bias in affected animals (proportion of affected animals: male=47.2% female=52.8%).</p>
<p>Concurrently a male sterility phenotype was identified within the same pedigree.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Genome-wide SNP linkage analysis mapped the circadian and sterility phenotypes to the same region on chromosome 5 and subsequent sequencing identified the causative mutation as a T to G single point mutation within exon seven of the Katnal1 gene. For full details of mapping and identification of the mutation see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>. This mutant allele was designated <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H</italic></sup>, and results in a leucine to valine substitution at residue 286 of the protein. <italic>In vitro</italic> functional analysis demonstrated that the mutation is a recessive loss-of-function allele.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> 3D modelling of the protein suggests that this loss of function is due to hydrophobic changes in the AAA domain of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Genotyping confirmed that the mutation was homozygous in affected circadian animals and wild type or heterozygous in unaffected animals, confirming that <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H</italic></sup> was causative for the circadian phenotype.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Circadian and sleep anomalies in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup>
<italic>1H/1H</italic>
</sup> mice</title>
<p>More extensive circadian phenotyping conducted on <italic>Katnal1</italic> homozygotes (<italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup>) and wild-type littermates (<italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>) confirmed that <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice had a shorter free-running circadian period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a–c</xref>) and furthermore revealed that <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals were more active in the light phase of the light/dark cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), showed increased anticipation of light to dark transitions and greater shift in activity onset when released from light/dark cycles to constant darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Data and cohort details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. Bioluminescence recordings performed using PER2::LUCIFERASE reporter mice carrying the <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H</italic></sup> mutation revealed that these circadian changes were not due to changes to the core molecular clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (the site of the master circadian clock in the brain; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Circadian disruptions are often associated with deficits in sleep homeostasis. Therefore to complement our circadian studies we conducted wireless electroencephalography recordings over a baseline period of 24 h and following a 6 h period of sleep deprivation. A detailed summary of electroencephalography analysis is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. Compared to wild-type littermates, the non-REM delta power of <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice was higher in the dark phase of baseline sleep (mixed ANOVA, interaction factors ‘genotype X time, F(1,88)=8.91, <italic>P</italic>=0.0175) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) and in both the light and dark phases of recovery sleep (mixed ANOVA, interaction factors ‘genotype X time’, F(1,136)=11.93, <italic>P</italic>=0.0086; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). All other sleep parameters were unaffected in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title><italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice display a spectrum of behavioural deficits</title>
<p>Human patients carrying a heterozygous deletion incorporating the <italic>Katnal1</italic> locus show a number of cognitive deficits including ID and a delay in language acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> We therefore investigated whether these deficits were modelled in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice by subjecting animal cohorts to a battery of behavioural tests. Data and cohort details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>.</p>
<p>Both working memory and spatial memory were significantly poorer in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice, as evidenced by reduced spontaneous alternations in a T-maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and in the Morris water maze where mutants take longer to find the platform in acquisition trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), show poorer improvements in the latency to find the platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and spend less time in the target quadrant than wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Anxiety and locomotor activity was assessed by monitoring activity in an open field arena. Here <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals spent a higher proportion of time in the centre of the arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) and travelled over longer distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>) compared to wild-types. To differentiate between activity and anxiety changes in the open field arena we analysed activity in both the anxiogenic centre and the anxiolytic periphery of the arena. This analysis demonstrated that <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals showed increased activity in both regions of the open field (distance travelled in centre of open field: wild type=164±12 m, <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup>=243±20 m, <italic>P</italic>=0.02; distance travelled in periphery of open field: wild type=4.3±0.2 m, <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup>=6±0.3 m, <italic>P</italic>=0.004). Conversely when mouse activity was recorded in the home cage, we found no difference between genotypes (distance travelled over 24 h: wild type=399±77 m, <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup>=418±41 m, <italic>P</italic>=0.833) suggesting that the former activity differences were due to the novel environment of the open field rather than generalised hyperactivity in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals. Finally, in certain conditions (such as maternal separation) mice emit ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs). To test whether <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals vocalised differently to wild types, we separated pups at postnatal days 7–8 (the age at which mice show peak of USV emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup>) and recorded their USVs. In these tests, compared to wild types, <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> pups produced fewer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) and shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>) vocalisations, containing fewer phrases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>).</p>

<title>Gross brain morphological abnormalities in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup>
<italic>1H/1H</italic>
</sup> mice</title>
<p>Since we observed a number of behavioural phenotypes in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice, we performed histological analysis to ascertain whether differences in brain histology underlied these behaviours. Data and cohort details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>.</p>
<p>Analysis of hematoxylin and eosin stained brain sections revealed that, compared to wildtype littermates, <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals had less tightly packed pyramidal cell layers in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref>) and a narrower cortical layer 1 and wider cortical layer 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c–e</xref>). To confirm these cortical layer differences, immunofluorescence was performed using the cortical layer markers calbindin (layers 2/3 and 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3f and g</xref>), CUX1 (layers 2/3 and 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3i and j</xref>), FOXP2 (layer 6a) and CTGF (layer 6b) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3l and m</xref>). Quantification of fluorescence intensity demonstrated that in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> cortex both calbindin and CUX1 labelling was more intense closer to the cortical surface, which is consistent with the reduction in the size of layer 1 (two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), interaction factors ‘genotype X distance of fluorescence from cortical surface’, calbindin: F(75,988)=16.8, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0005; CUX1: F(93,372=2.17, <italic>P</italic>=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3h and k</xref>). Similar quantification revealed that FOXP2 labelling extended further from layer 6b (as labelled by CTGF) in the <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> cortex, which is consistent with an increase in the size of layer 6 (two-way ANOVA, interaction factors ‘genotype X distance of fluorescence from CTGF labelling:’ F(93,372)=1.32, <italic>P</italic>=0.038; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3n</xref>). Finally, three dimensional models of the ventricular system were constructed from brain micro-computed tomography scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3o and p</xref>). Volumetric analysis revealed that <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice had substantially larger ventricles than wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3q</xref>).</p>

<title>Neuronal migration and morphology defects in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup>
<italic>1H/1H</italic>
</sup> brains</title>
<p>The histological phenotypes of <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mouse brains described above are suggestive of neuronal migration defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> We therefore investigated whether <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice showed abnormal neuronal migration using BrdU labelling of E13 and E15 embryos and quantified labelled cells in the cortex of P9 pups (described in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). At both ages <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals had greater numbers of labelled neurons in bins close to the cortical surface (two-way ANOVA, interaction factors ‘genotype X bin’: E13 brains; F(9,80)=2.361, <italic>P</italic>=0.02. E15 brains; F(9,70)=2.412, <italic>P</italic>=0.019; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a–f</xref>). These results demonstrate a defect in neuronal migration during development, with the final location of <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> neurons positioned closer to the cortical surface compared to wild type. To confirm these results we used a Boyden chamber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> and performed <italic>in vitro</italic> neuronal migration analysis in E13.5 primary cortical neuronal cultures. Here we found that a greater proportion of <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> cortical neurons migrated to the base of the cell culture insert compared to wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Since in both BrdU labelling and the Boyden assay neurons from <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals migrated further than those of wild-type littermates, these results suggest that <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> cortical neurons show defects in the termination of cortical neuronal migration.</p>
<p>Given its role in cytoskeletal organisation, we also hypothesised that neuronal morphology is modulated by <italic>Katnal1</italic>. Analysis of golgi stained neurons from layers 2–3 of the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4g and i</xref>) demonstrated that, compared to wild-type littermates, <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> neurons had larger soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>), and shorter and thinner axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4l and m</xref>) (data and cohort details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Furthermore, analysis at higher magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4h and j</xref>), demonstrated that the number of synaptic spines on <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> neurons was significantly reduced compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4n</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Katnal1</italic><sup>
<italic>1H/1H</italic>
</sup> associated with defects in motile cilia</title>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that mutations in some microtubule severing enzymes can cause defects in cilia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Since such ciliary defects could underlie the phenotypes described above we studied the motile cilia of the ependymal lining of the lateral ventricle in sections of postnatal day 2 mouse brains from both <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> (<italic>n</italic>=4) and wild-type animals (<italic>n</italic>=3). We found that the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals was significantly attenuated compared to wild-type (CBF: wildtype=22.39±0.94 Hz, <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup>=14.25±0.92 Hz, <italic>P</italic>=0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Movies S1</xref>). This reduction in CBF in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals was also associated with an increased proportion of cilia with an abnormal beat pattern (ciliary dyskinesia) (proportion of dyskinetic cilia: wild type=17%, <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup>=75%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Movies S1</xref>). Visual inspection of the cilia identified a number of ciliary abnormalities such as a swollen ciliary tip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Movie S3</xref>) or extremely long cilia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Movie S4</xref>) scattered throughout the field of cilia in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> ventricles. These abnormalities were observed in approximately 25% of <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> brain slices. The abnormal cilia always showed a dyskinetic beat pattern and lower beat frequency. To further investigate ciliary morphology we performed scanning electron microscopy upon the ependymal lining of the lateral ventricles of both <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> (<italic>n</italic>=3) and wild-type animals (<italic>n</italic>=3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5c and d</xref>). Cilia measurements showed no significant differences in average cilia length between genotypes (average cilia length: wild type=6.22±0.86 μm, <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup>=6.54±0.94 Hz, <italic>P</italic>=0.303). However in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> samples we noted the presence of both long and short cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5e and f</xref>; defined as two standard deviations longer or shorter than the average cilia length) that were not present in wild-type samples. In addition, inspection of <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> cilia identified ciliary abnormalities including bifurcated cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>), abnormal kinks and bends in the cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>) and swellings along the length of the cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy of ependymal cilia found that vesicular aggregates were present within the ciliary swellings described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>). Although these abnormalities were present in only a small proportion (&lt;1%) of <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> cilia, they were notably absent from wild-type cilia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Microtubule severing enzymes play diverse roles in the nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> However, at present the microtubule severing enzyme <italic>Katnal1</italic> is poorly defined in the context of CNS development and function. Here we present a detailed phenotypic analysis of <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H</italic></sup> and show that the mutation is associated with changes in circadian rhythms, sleep and behaviour. Furthermore we demonstrate that defects in brain histopathology, neuronal migration and neuronal morphology underlie these phenotypes. Finally we also demonstrate that <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H</italic></sup> causes a range of defects in the motile cilia of ventricular ependymal cells. The data we present here are the first to associate KATNAL1 with such dysfunctions with important implications for clinical association studies.</p>
<p>The <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H</italic></sup> mutation was initially identified with a circadian deficit including a short free-running period and advanced activity onset. However subsequent <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments using SCN slices of animals carrying the PER2::LUC reporter gene demonstrated no defects in SCN cellular rhythms, suggesting that the core circadian clock was unperturbed by the mutation. Phenotypes in circadian running wheel rhythms that are not associated with changes to the core clock mechanism have also been reported in mouse models of schizophrenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Here it has been suggested that the wheel running changes observed are the result in defects in output pathways from the SCN circadian clock. Similarly, in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice we hypothesise that the defects we demonstrate in neuronal anatomy and neuronal morphology may disrupt output signals from the SCN. Alternatively given that various neuropeptides such as oxytocin are secreted in a circadian manner from ependymal cells lining the third ventricle of the brain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> altered ventricular morphology and ciliary function in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice may disrupt the circulation of factors secreted by the ciliated ventricular ependymal cells and contribute to the disruption of the behavioural rhythms observed.</p>
<p>The behavioural consequences of microtubule severing enzyme dysfunction in mouse models have been poorly characterised. Currently the phenotypes described are limited to motor dysfunction in mice lacking the <italic>Spg4</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> and head shaking and circling in the <italic>Fign</italic> mutant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> In contrast, here we demonstrate that loss of function of Katnal1 is associated with a range of behavioural phenotypes, including changes in circadian activity, poor learning and memory, hyperactivity in a novel environment (the open field) and deficits in USVs. Notably the learning and memory, anxiety and vocalisation phenotypes reprise the clinical symptoms of ID, increased anxiety in novel situations and delays in language acquisition reported in human patients who carry microdeletions incorporating haploinsufficiency of <italic>KATNAL1</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> While it is also worth noting that mutant mice spend more time the centre of the open field than wild types (implying that <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals show reduced anxiety), we suggest that this result is confounded by the hyperactivity in novel environments phenotype we also describe in mutant mice. This observation is backed up by the fact that mutant animals showed increased activity in all regions of the open field rather than just the anxiolytic periphery. Here we also highlight defects in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice such as compromised neuronal migration and morphology which may underpin such phenotypes. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the homologue of <italic>Katnal1</italic> (<italic>kat-60L1</italic>) has been demonstrated to play a critical role in neuronal morphology during development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> however the data that we present here is the first to demonstrate a similar phenotype in mammals and furthermore suggests how subtle perturbations to KATNAL1 function may contribute to specific neural and behavioural conditions. For example, defects in neuronal migration, synaptic spines and neuronal morphology such as those we have demonstrated here, have been suggested to underpin ID in conditions such as lissencephaly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Down’s syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> and Rett syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> While we are not suggesting that <italic>Katnal1</italic> is causative for these conditions, similarities in symptoms and neuronal phenotypes between these conditions and those linked to <italic>Katnal1</italic> dysfunction should be appreciated. Furthermore a rare mutation in <italic>KATNAL1</italic> has been associated with schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/~spurcell/genebook/genebook.cgi?user=guest&amp;cmd=verb-gene&amp;tbox=KATNAL1" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/~spurcell/genebook/genebook.cgi?user=guest&amp;cmd=verb-gene&amp;tbox=KATNAL1</ext-link>) and KATNAL1 has been shown to interact with the schizophrenia associated gene DISC1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> In line with these observations we note that increases in ventricular volume and reductions in synaptic spines have been reported in schizophrenic patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> and our data demonstrates the same phenotypes in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice. Thus the range of phenotypes associated with defects in the function of <italic>Katnal1</italic> strongly suggests that the gene should be considered in the pathology of disorders such as ID and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>We do note one key genetic difference between the human patients and <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals. While the human patients were all heterozygous for the <italic>Katnal1</italic> deletion, we found no phenotype in heterozygous mutant mice (data not shown) suggesting that while haploinsufficiency is causative for phenotypes in humans, mice require complete loss of KATNAL1 function to show similar effects. A similar discrepancy between humans and mice has also been noted for the intellectual disability candidate gene <italic>CTNNB1.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> While heterozygous loss of function mutations in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> are causative for intellectual disability in humans, conditional knock outs for <italic>CTNNB1</italic> have no reported behavioural or craniofacial phenotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> These differences demonstrate that while mouse models of intellectual disability are of great use in our understanding of the causative mechanisms which underlie the condition, there are still genetic and neurodevelopmental differences between species which also must be taken into account. We also note that while the <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H</italic></sup> mutation shows a loss of catalytic function in both HEK293 cells and Sertoli cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> this loss of function has not been verified in neuronal cells. However, given that our data demonstrates that the <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H</italic></sup> mutation lies in an essential catalytic domain and that we show neuronal phenotypes in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice, we would expect to see the same loss of catalytic function in neurons.</p>
<p>The data we present here also demonstrate defects in motile cilia in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice. Ciliary disruptions in humans (ciliopathies) include Bardet-Biedl and Joubert syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> While there is currently limited data available regarding the behavioural phenotypes of mouse models of ciliopathies, we note that ciliary dysfunction in mice has been linked with learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> and vocalisation phenotypes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> both of which were disturbed in the <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice described here. It is also notable that the neuronal migration and enlarged ventricle phenotypes that we describe in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice recapitulate features associated with known ciliopathy gene mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Furthermore in Bardet-Biedl syndrome mouse models ciliary defects such as reduced CBF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> and structural defects such as abnormal lengthening and swellings along their length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> have been described, that are similar to those we describe in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice. There is strong evidence that ciliopathy associated genes play a number of roles in neuronal development by affecting processes such as progenitor proliferation or maintenance of the radial glia scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> However it is also clear that defects in microtubule organisation also affect synaptic structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> At present it is difficult to disentangle the relative contributions of defects in microtubule severing and ciliary abnormalities to the overall phenotypes we observe in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice. Further investigations are required to clarify the impacts of these two processes. However it is notable that while defects in cilia structure may contribute to the phenotypes we describe in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice, they are far less prominent in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice than in other mouse ciliopathy models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> suggesting that the ciliary component of KATNAL1 dysfunction may be mild compared to other ciliopathies. Similarly while hydrocephalus has been suggested to be a component of some ciliopathy mouse models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup>
<italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> mice showed only increased ventricle size rather than an increased incidence of hydrocephalus, further suggesting the ciliary defects in these animals are mild compared to other ciliopathies.</p>
<p>In summary the data presented here clearly demonstrate that KATNAL1 plays an important role in a variety of neuronal processes including neuronal migration, neuronal morphology and ependymal ciliary function. The downstream effect of these defects leads in turn to a number of behavioural changes including in learning and memory, reaction to anxiogenic situations and circadian rhythms. These data therefore highlight how perturbations in KATNAL1 may play a role in neuronal dysfunction and demonstrates that the enzyme is a novel candidate in the study of behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

(<bold>c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>): Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the ependymal motile cilia in the lateral ventricles of wiltype (<bold>c</bold>) and <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> (<bold>d</bold>) animals. (<bold>e</bold>–<bold>i</bold>): Structural ciliary abnormalities found in <italic>Katnal1</italic><sup><italic>1H/1H</italic></sup> animals include abnormally long cilia (<bold>e</bold>) abnormally short cilia (<bold>f</bold>) bifurcated cilia (<bold>g</bold>) kinks in the cilia (<bold>h</bold>) and swellings along the length of the cilia (<bold>i</bold>). Transmission Electron Micrographs show vesicular aggregates within ciliary swellings (<bold>j</bold>). Arrows in (<bold>e</bold>–<bold>i</bold>) indicate ciliary abnormalities. Scale bars: <bold>c–i</bold>=5 μ<sc>m</sc>; <bold><italic>j</italic></bold>, 500 nm (***<italic>P</italic>⩽0.001). CBF, ciliary beat frequency.</p>
