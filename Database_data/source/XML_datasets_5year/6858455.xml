<p id="Par1">Protein hydroxylation affects protein stability, activity, and interactome, therefore contributing to various diseases including cancers. However, the transiency of the hydroxylation reaction hinders the identification of hydroxylase substrates. By developing an enzyme-substrate trapping strategy coupled with TAP-TAG or orthogonal GST- purification followed by mass spectrometry, we identify adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) as an EglN2 hydroxylase substrate in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). ADSL expression is higher in TNBC than other breast cancer subtypes or normal breast tissues. ADSL knockout impairs TNBC cell proliferation and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. An integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis reveals that ADSL activates the oncogenic cMYC pathway by regulating cMYC protein level via a mechanism requiring ADSL proline 24 hydroxylation. Hydroxylation-proficient ADSL, by affecting adenosine levels, represses the expression of the long non-coding RNA <italic>MIR22HG</italic>, thus upregulating cMYC protein level. Our findings highlight the role of ADSL hydroxylation in controlling cMYC and TNBC tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the breast cancer subtype characterized by the absence of expression of the estrogen and progesterone receptors, as well as amplification of HER2. Therapies commonly used in other breast cancer subtypes are therefore not suitable for TNBC, and treatment options are largely limited to conventional genotoxic chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Most of TNBC patients present residual disease after chemotherapy, with high rates of metastatic recurrence and very poor long-term prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Consequently, the identification of molecular targets and the development of new therapeutic avenues remain critically important.</p>
<p id="Par4">We previously showed the hydroxylase EglN2 positively contributing to TNBC in vitro and in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, the underlying mechanism was unknown. Here, we show that EglN2 hydroxylase activity is important for mediating the phenotype of EglN2 in TNBC, and EglN2 knockdown does not promote any increase in the protein level of HIF-1α, its known substrate. These observations led to the hypothesis that EglN2 oncogenic behavior in TNBC is mediated by its hydroxylation of another substrate. Detecting hydroxylation substrates is challenging due to the transiency of the reaction: upon hydroxylation, the substrate is quickly released by the hydroxylase. To overcome this issue, we use an optimized substrate-trapping strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, which fixes the enzyme-substrate complex in an inactive state, thus increasing the amount of the substrate bound to the hydroxylase. To avoid the possibility that the predominant substrate HIF-1α, along with its binding partners, may overshadow the other EglN2 substrates, we use HIF-1α-depleted cells. Our screening combines the optimized substrate-trapping strategy with a TAP-TAG purification followed by mass spectrometry. In parallel, we develop an orthogonal approach by combining this enzyme-substrate-trapping strategy to GST-EglN2 pull-down followed by mass spectrometry. Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) is the only substrate identified by both approaches, giving us confidence on ADSL being a bona fide EglN2 substrate. The ADSL relationship with EglN2, as well as its role in TNBC, is then investigated.</p>

<title>Substrate-trapping strategy shows ADSL as an EglN2 substrate</title>
<p id="Par5">Prolyl hydroxylation is a transient reaction characterized by the binding of the EglN prolyl hydroxylase to its cofactors, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and α-ketoglutarate, its substrate and oxygen. Once the hydroxylation reaction takes place, the enzyme and substrate immediately dissociate, which makes the detection of the prolyl hydroxylase substrates by regular pull-down and mass spectrometry very challenging. Previous research showed that by treating cells with dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG), a competitive antagonist of α-ketoglutarate and hydroxylase inhibitor, the potential hydroxylase substrates may be trapped within the reaction complex and, therefore, more easily detectable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, the modest number of binding proteins pulled down from mass spectrometry suggests that there may be other ways to enrich for the prolyl hydroxylase substrates. The addition of oxygen triggers prolyl hydroxylation of the substrates, which dissociate from the prolyl hydroxylase. We reasoned that limited oxygen concentration might help trap the enzyme-substrate interaction. Interestingly, we did not find that hypoxia treatment alone traps EglN2 interaction with its known substrate HIF-1α in two ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cell lines, T47D and MCF7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). However, we found that the combinatorial treatment Hypoxia + DMOG produced a robust binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). This was not solely due to the upregulation of HIF-1α under this condition. In fact, under the same condition, catalytically dead EglN2 (H358A) could not bind with HIF-1α (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Moreover, despite accumulating comparable amounts of HIF-1α, hypoxia or hypoxia + the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not induce any distinctive EglN2-HIF-1α binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). To further validate our EglN2-subtrate interaction enrichment strategy, we performed a similar experiment in the Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231. Again, hypoxia + DMOG treatment gave rise to a strong binding between the WT (but not the H358A mutant) EglN2 prolyl hydroxylase and its substrate HIF-1α (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Substrate-trapping strategy identifies ADSL as an EglN2 substrate in TNBC. <bold>a</bold> Immunoblots (IB) of whole-cell extracts (WCE) and immunoprecipitations (IP) of lysates from T47D cells infected with lentivirus encoding either wild-type (WT) or catalytically dead mutant (H358A) FLAG- and HA-tagged EglN2, and treated as indicated overnight. <bold>b</bold> IB of WCE and IP of lysates from MDA-MB-231 cells infected with lentivirus encoding either EglN2-WT or -H358A, and treated as indicated overnight. <bold>c</bold> Schematic representation of the hydroxylase (here EglN2) substrate screen. <bold>d</bold> IB of input (1% of the protein amount used for the pull-down) and GST pull-down of lysates from MDA-MB-231 cells treated as indicated overnight. <bold>e</bold> IB of WCE and IP of lysates from MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with indicated plasmids and treated as indicated overnight. <bold>f</bold> Endogenous EglN2 and ADSL IP in MDA-MB-231 treated with DMOG. <bold>g</bold>, <bold>h</bold>, <bold>i</bold> IB of input and GST pull-down of in vitro-translated ADSL (<bold>g</bold>, <bold>i</bold>) and recombinant EglN2 (<bold>h</bold>).

<p id="Par6">In a previous study, we demonstrated that EglN2 prolyl hydroxylase contributes to TNBC tumor progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Consistently, we show here that EglN2 knockdown by shRNA (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>) decreases TNBC tumor cell invasion, the phenotype being rescued by WT, but not the catalytically dead mutant, EglN2 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. EglN2 depletion does not lead to HIF-1α stabilization (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1d</xref>), suggesting that there may be other EglN2 substrates contributing to its effect in TNBC. To further enrich for the non-HIF substrates that may be overshadowed by the presence of HIF-1α, we depleted HIF-1α in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Then, we performed our optimized trapping strategy treating these HIF-1α-depleted cells, previously transduced with FLAG-HA-WT EglN2, with either normoxia or hypoxia + DMOG, followed by TAP-TAG purification with FLAG and HA affinity gels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). In parallel, we performed the pull-down experiments using GST-control or -EglN2 beads (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). The mass spectrometry analysis that followed both approaches highlighted a handful of proteins showing a stronger binding with EglN2 in hypoxia + DMOG compared with normoxia (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Particularly, adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) was retrieved from both mass spectrometry experiments as the only common EglN2 interaction protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>, Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), encouraging us to pursue the validation of it as a potential EglN2 substrate.</p>
<p id="Par7">To confirm ADSL interaction with EglN2, we performed a GST-Ctrl or -EglN2 pull-down in MDA-MB-231 cells: ADSL could be precipitated by GST-EglN2 in the substrate-trapping condition (hypoxia + DMOG) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). We then immunoprecipitated EglN2-WT or -H358A in MDA-MB-231 cells. The binding of wild-type EglN2 with ADSL was much stronger than that of the catalytically inactive H358A mutant, suggesting that not only is ADSL an interactor, but also a substrate, of EglN2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). We verified that their interaction is physiological by reciprocal immunoprecipitations of endogenous EglN2 or ADSL: endogenous ADSL or EglN2 was retrieved, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>). To examine whether the binding between EglN2 and ADSL is direct, we used two complementary in vitro approaches. We pulled down in vitro translated ADSL with GST-EglN2, and found an interaction between these two proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>). Conversely, we performed GST-ADSL pull-down with FLAG-EglN2 recombinant protein purified from insect cells and observed a direct interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that EglN2 and ADSL interact without requiring additional partners. To determine whether the other members of the EglN family, EglN1 and 3, may also bind with ADSL, we repeated the GST pull-down experiments: EglN2 is the primary prolyl hydroxylase binding ADSL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1i</xref>). Importantly, we assessed whether ADSL is one of the key mediators of EglN2 depletion phenotype in TNBC by overexpressing ADSL in EglN2-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1e</xref>). ADSL overexpression, even if moderate, was able to partially restore MDA-MB-231 2-D colony formation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1f</xref>), suggesting that the oncogenic role of EglN2 in TNBC may be at least partially mediated by ADSL.</p>

<title>ADSL is essential for TNBC cell growth and invasiveness</title>
<p id="Par8">ADSL is a key enzyme involved in purine metabolism that catalyzes two non-sequential reactions in the purine biosynthetic pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The first reaction converts succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) to aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and the second adenylosuccinate (SAMP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Both reactions also produce fumarate, which is a metabolite involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and an epigenetic modifier promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, the role of ADSL in cancer, especially TNBC, remains elusive. To study ADSL expression in breast cancer patients, we examined ADSL mRNA level in different subtypes of breast cancer across different datasets: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, UNC337<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and METABRIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. ADSL displayed the highest expression in TNBC compared with the other subtypes of breast cancer, i.e., Her2<sup>+</sup>, luminal (A and B), and normal-like (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Importantly, ADSL expression in TNBC was higher than in the normal breast tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). We also assayed ADSL protein levels in TNBC compared with normal breast tissues derived from nine patients. Despite the variation between different normal and tumor samples, likely reflecting patient tissue heterogeneity, ADSL was upregulated in tumors compared with their adjacent normal tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). By performing Kaplan-Meier curves, COX Proportional Hazard Model and Concordance Index in TCGA, UNC337, and METABRIC, no correlation was found between ADSL mRNA level and TNBC patient survival (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). In this regard, we would like to underline that the prognosis data are neither necessary nor sufficient to predict whether the target gene is a good therapeutic target in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>ADSL plays an essential role in TNBC. <bold>a</bold> ADSL mRNA expression across different subtypes of breast cancer in three different datasets (TCGA stands for The Cancer Genome Atlas).

<p id="Par9">In order to examine the potential role of ADSL in TNBC, we implemented CRISPR-Cas9 to deplete ADSL expression in the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and MDA-MB-468. ADSL knockout by using two independent sgRNAs impaired breast cancer cell proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). We depleted ADSL in the normal breast epithelial cell lines MCF-10A and HMLE cells: the growth defect observed was not as dramatic as that in TNBC cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). ADSL depletion also affected TNBC anchorage-independent growth in cells, as shown by decreased soft-agar colony formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). Consistently, ADSL knockout cells displayed an impaired invasiveness (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). In accordance with ADSL sgRNA data, ADSL downregulation via two independent shRNAs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>) led to decreased soft-agar growth (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref>) and invasiveness (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). To confirm that the effect of ADSL sgRNAs on TNBC phenotype was on-target, we generated an MDA-MB-231 cell line expressing the doxycycline (dox)-inducible 3xFLAG-tagged ADSL (with CRISPR-Cas9 NGG recognition sequence silently mutated) to a level comparable to the endogenous ADSL. We then transduced this cell line with the lentivirus expressing the ADSL sgRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). In the absence of doxycycline, ADSL knockout led to decreased soft-agar growth and invasion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g, h</xref>). In the presence of doxycycline, the exogenous ADSL rescued the defective phenotype elicited by ADSL depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g, h</xref>). We used two other TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468, and found that ADSL depletion in these cells also led to decreased soft-agar growth (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2e</xref>) and cell invasion (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2f</xref>). Similar to what we observed for MDA-MB-231, when the exogenous ADSL was re-introduced into these cells (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>g and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">i</xref>), the 3-D cell growth defect and decreased cell invasion were rescued (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>h and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">j</xref>). Cumulatively, our data suggest that ADSL contributes to TNBC cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and cell invasion.</p>
<p id="Par10">To examine the role of ADSL in vivo, we orthotopically injected MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with either control- or ADSL sgRNA-expressing lentivirus into the mammary fat pad of NOD SCID Gamma (NSG) mice. These cells were labeled with luciferase to monitor tumor growth in vivo by using weekly bioluminescence as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that the bioluminescence intensity at week 1 was comparable between control and ADSL sgRNA, indicating comparable tumor cell implantation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). Overtime, differently from control cells, ADSL-depleted tumor cells failed to grow (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a, b</xref>), which was reflected by the decreased tumor size and weight at necropsy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). To further determine whether ADSL may be important for TNBC metastasis, we injected these cells into NSG mice through the tail vein. Consistent with the phenotype observed with primary tumor growth, ADSL depletion diminished tumor cell colonization in the lung (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d–f</xref>), even though the starting amount of injected cells was comparable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). We observed a similar phenotype using another independent sgRNA targeting ADSL (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>a and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">b</xref>). Moreover, the mammary fat pad orthotopic injection of another triple negative cell line (MDA-MB-468) also displayed a growth defect in the tumors generated by ADSL-depleted cells (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>c and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">d</xref>).

<title>ADSL is hydroxylated by EglN2 on Proline 24</title>
<p id="Par11">To identify the specific ADSL proline residues hydroxylated by EglN2, we performed in vitro hydroxylation of GST-ADSL with recombinant EglN2: EglN2 promoted GST-ADSL prolyl hydroxylation on Proline 24 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>). Conversely, we transfected cells with HA-tagged-ADSL followed by MG132 or MG132 + DMOG treatment. DMOG treatment decreased the ADSL hydroxylation on Proline 24 (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). We performed pan-hydroxyproline IP after EglN2 overexpression in 293T cells. The ADSL blot that followed confirmed that endogenous ADSL is hydroxylated in cells by EglN2, and this hydroxylation is impaired by the hydroxylase inhibitor DMOG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). To further confirm proline 24 crucial role for ADSL hydroxylation, we mutated it to alanine (P24A). Then, we overexpressed EglN2 and either WT or P24A mutant ADSL in 293T cells, followed by pan-hydroxyproline IP. The hydroxylation signal detected for WT ADSL was lost for P24A mutant, phenocopying the effect of DMOG treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>). We also performed an in vitro hydroxylation reaction of eluted GST-ADSL (WT and P24A) in the presence or absence of recombinant EglN2, followed by IP with pan-hydroxyproline antibody. Consistently, we observed an increase in the hydroxylation signal of WT, but not P24A, ADSL in the presence of recombinant EglN2 (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that ADSL Proline 24 is the major site hydroxylated by EglN2.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>ADSL is hydroxylated by EglN2 on Proline 24. <bold>a</bold> In vitro hydroxylation of GST-ADSL in the presence or absence of recombinant EglN2.

<p id="Par12">We showed that EglN2 can hydroxylate ADSL on proline 24 in vitro and in cells. However, questions remained about the physiological relevance of ADSL hydroxylation. ADSL protein stability was not affected by this posttranslational modification, since ADSL protein levels did not change upon Hypoxia + DMOG treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4c</xref>) or EglN2 depletion (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4d</xref>). To address the question of the potential relevance of ADSL hydroxylation, we re-introduced either WT, P24A or the catalytically impaired ADSL mutant R426H<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> in ADSL knockout cells. WT ADSL could rescue the ADSL-depleted cell proliferation. Conversely, despite an expression comparable to the WT or endogenous ADSL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>), both P24A and R426H failed to fully rescue the phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref>), suggesting that ADSL proline 24 residue may affect ADSL activity, which would be important for the ADSL depletion phenotype in TNBC cells. To confirm this hypothesis, we measured ADSL activity using both substrates, SAMP and SAICAR. As expected, R426H showed a reduced activity compared with WT ADSL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>). Importantly, P24A mutant activity was significantly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>). We assessed WT and P24A ADSL activity by an orthogonal approach, by tracking the labeling of AMP, product of ADSL-catalyzed reaction, from [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose. The isotope incorporation into AMP was restored to a level comparable to the control in ADSL-depleted cells expressing WT, but not P24A, ADSL (Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4e</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that ADSL hydroxylation on proline 24 is important for maintaining ADSL enzymatic activity.</p>

<title>ADSL regulates cMYC protein level through adenosine levels</title>
<p id="Par13">ADSL is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism. To examine the potential molecular mechanism by which ADSL contributes to TNBC tumorigenesis, we generated a profile of roughly 300 metabolites involved in several pathways, including nucleotide metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and the pentose-phosphate pathway. The levels of fumarate and AMP, products of ADSL enzymatic reactions, were significantly decreased upon ADSL depletion by two independent sgRNAs (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>a, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">b</xref>), validating the quality of our metabolomics mass spectrometry. We observed that the ADSL knockout effect was not limited to purine metabolism: other metabolic pathways were affected, including glutamate metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and pyrimidine metabolism (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5c</xref>). We also observed a drastic downregulation of both the mRNA and protein level of pyrimidine enzymes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5d</xref>). In order to understand the metabolic changes we observed, we performed ADSL gene expression profiling by RNA-seq followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Interestingly, the oncogene cMYC signaling was among the pathways most affected by ADSL depletion in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b, c</xref>), together with the E2F and TNFα signaling via NF-kB pathways (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5e</xref>). We also checked the activation status of the mTORC pathway by analyzing mTORC substrate 4EBP1 phosphorylation: we found it greatly impaired (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5f</xref>), in accordance with previous reports linking purine metabolism with the activity of this important energy/nutrient/redox sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>ADSL controls cMYC protein level by regulating adenosine levels. <bold>a</bold> Overview of the metabolic pathways affected by ADSL depletion. <bold>b</bold> Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of cMYC target genes between control and ADSL knockout MDA-MB-231 cells. <bold>c</bold> Heatmap of cMYC target gene expression upon ADSL depletion. <bold>d</bold> IB of lysates from paired TNBC patient-derived non-tumor (n) and tumor (t) breast tissues. <bold>e</bold> IB of lysates from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells, transduced with indicated lentivirus. <bold>f</bold> IB of lysates from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells overexpressing doxycycline (dox)-inducible ADSL, transduced with indicated lentivirus and treated as indicated. <bold>g</bold> IB of lysates from MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing dox-inducible WT or P24A ADSL, transduced with indicated lentivirus. <bold>h</bold> Representative images of 2-D proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells, transduced and treated as indicated. <bold>i</bold> IB of lysates from MDA-MB-231 cells, transduced with indicated lentivirus and treated as indicated.

<p id="Par14">Since cMYC has been reported to affect cell growth and proliferation by driving multiple metabolic pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glutamate and nucleotide metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, we speculated that ADSL might control cMYC expression in TNBC cells, which would explain, at least partially, the metabolic changes observed upon ADSL depletion. We first assayed the expression of cMYC in normal and TNBC tissues from eleven patients, observing that in most cases, similarly to ADSL, cMYC was upregulated in TNBC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). We also interrogated two datasets of TNBC patients, TCGA and METABRIC, about the correlation between <italic>ADSL</italic> and cMYC target gene expression. In accordance with our hypothesis, most cMYC target genes were positively correlated with ADSL expression (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). We then depleted MDA-MB-231 and -436 TNBC cell lines with two independent ADSL sgRNAs and found a concomitant downregulation of cMYC upon ADSL depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). This regulation was posttranscriptional, since no difference was detected on cMYC mRNA level (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5g</xref>). Importantly, the regulation of ADSL sgRNA on cMYC was on-target since the CRISPR-Cas9 resistant version of WT ADSL could efficiently rescue the cMYC downregulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>). To examine the effect of P24A mutation on cMYC regulation, we restored P24A ADSL in the ADSL knockout cell line. We did not observe the rescue of cMYC expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>), suggesting that ADSL proline hydroxylation is critical for ADSL regulation of cMYC and breast cancer cell proliferation.</p>
<p id="Par15">We then further investigated how the enzymatic activity of ADSL is responsible for the ADSL phenotype. We supplemented ADSL-depleted cells with the products of ADSL-catalyzed reactions, i.e., adenosine (50 µM), fumarate (20 µM), or AICAR (1 and 25 µM). Only adenosine was able to rescue TNBC cell proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>). Fumarate was previously reported to promote the expression of vimentin, an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition marker, in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Consistently, fumarate rescued the vimentin downregulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5i</xref>), but failed to rescue the growth defect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>) caused by ADSL depletion in MDA-MB-231. The phenotype was also not rescued by AICAR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>). We excluded the possibility that AICAR did not function by detecting the AICAR-induced phosphorylation of AMPK, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5i</xref>). To verify that the rescue of ADSL depletion phenotype was specific to adenosine, we supplemented ADSL knockout cells with the other nucleosides. In fact, ADSL-depleted cells also showed decreased dCTP, dTTP and dGTP (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5h</xref>). Thymidine (T), uridine (U), cytidine (C), guanosine (G), inosine (I), and the purine derivative hypoxanthine (H), all failed to restore cell growth (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5i</xref>). Instead, the nucleobase adenine (Ade), similarly to adenosine (Ado), was able to rescue the ADSL depletion phenotype (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5i</xref>). Consistently, we found that adenosine and adenine, but not fumarate and AICAR, rescued cMYC downregulation upon ADSL knockout in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5i</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5j</xref>). Of note, adenosine could also rescue the expression of pyrimidine enzymes in a dose-dependent fashion (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5k</xref>). Importantly, it seems that adenine and, by extension, adenosine do not need to be metabolized into AMP in order to rescue ADSL depletion phenotype: the downregulation of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5l</xref>), in fact, was not able to prevent it (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5m</xref>). Our results suggest that ADSL proline 24 hydroxylation is important for regulating ADSL activity, which controls adenosine (and adenine) levels that regulate cMYC protein level, and leads to downstream metabolic changes and breast cancer cell proliferation.</p>

<title>ADSL inhibits cMYC negative regulator <italic>MIR22HG</italic> expression</title>
<p id="Par16">The fact that cMYC mRNA levels were unaffected by ADSL depletion suggested that ADSL somehow affected cMYC translation or protein stability. The treatment of ADSL-depleted cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 induced an increase of cMYC protein level in all the samples, including the control (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>). This suggested that this proteasome-mediated mechanism is not specific to ADSL. Since a growing body of evidence points toward non-coding RNAs as strong posttranscriptional gene regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, we searched for them in the RNA-seq-derived list of genes most significantly affected by ADSL depletion. Curiously, at the very top of the list was the long non-coding RNA <italic>MIR22HG</italic>, upregulated upon ADSL knockout (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>, Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). We confirmed by qRT-PCR that ADSL negatively regulates <italic>MIR22HG</italic> in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>) and MDA-MB-436 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). Interrogating two different datasets of TNBC patients, TCGA and METABRIC, a negative correlation between <italic>ADSL</italic> and <italic>MIR22HG</italic> expression was found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6b</xref>). To investigate whether <italic>MIR22HG</italic> affects cMYC protein level, we overexpressed <italic>MIR22HG</italic> in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>), and observed a decrease in cMYC protein level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>). Conversely, the downregulation of <italic>MIR22HG</italic> via three independent siRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6g</xref>) led to increased cMYC levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6h</xref>). In line with these data, we found a negative correlation between the mRNA expression of <italic>MIR22HG</italic> and that of several cMYC target genes in TNBC patients across two different datasets (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). We investigated whether <italic>MIR22HG</italic> is a key element for ADSL depletion phenotype, by creating a MDA-MB-231 cell line overexpressing <italic>MIR22HG</italic> in the presence of doxycycline. Similar to ADSL knockout, <italic>MIR22HG</italic> overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6i</xref>) impaired MDA-MB-231 cell 2-D (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6j</xref>) and 3-D colony formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6k</xref>), suggesting that <italic>MIR22HG</italic> is responsible, at least partially, for the cell growth defect observed in the absence of ADSL. Interrogating the link between ADSL and <italic>MIR22HG</italic> expression, we found that when re-introduced in ADSL-depleted cells, WT ADSL could restore <italic>MIR22HG</italic> expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6l</xref>). On the contrary, P24A mutant could not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6m</xref>). Moreover, EglN2 depletion via two independent sgRNAs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6c</xref>) induced a significant increase of <italic>MIR22HG</italic> expression (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6d</xref>) and, consistently, a decrease of cMYC protein level (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6c</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that ADSL-mediated regulation of <italic>MIR22HG</italic> expression requires ADSL hydroxylation by EglN2. We then wondered whether <italic>MIR22HG</italic> regulation, similar to cMYC, was also dependent on adenosine and adenine levels. Indeed, <italic>MIR22HG</italic> levels were restored to levels comparable to control in ADSL-depleted cells upon adenosine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6n</xref>) or adenine (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6e</xref>) treatment. Of note, neither adenosine nor adenine was able to alter <italic>MIR22HG</italic> levels in control cells, raising the hypothesis of a threshold, rather than a dose-dependent, mechanism for adenosine (and adenine) in regulating this long non-coding RNA. Our findings suggest that EglN2-mediated hydroxylation on ADSL proline 24 is important for modulating ADSL activity, which controls adenosine (and adenine) levels. Adenosine and adenine repress the long non-coding RNA <italic>MIR22HG</italic> expression, therefore upregulating cMYC protein level and inducing downstream metabolic changes and breast cancer cell growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6o</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>ADSL controls cMYC negative regulator <italic>MIR22HG</italic> expression. <bold>a</bold> Scatterplot of differential-expression results: −log10 FDR-adjusted <italic>P</italic>-values from comparisons of each gRNA versus control using DESeq2 are plotted for all genes regardless of significance. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par17">By developing an optimized enzyme-substrate-trapping strategy coupled with TAP-TAG purification and mass spectrometry, here we identify adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) as a substrate of the hydroxylase EglN2 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Similar to EglN2 depletion, ADSL knockout impairs TNBC cell growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo. ADSL depletion, by affecting adenosine and adenine levels, leads to an increased expression of the long non-coding RNA <italic>MIR22HG</italic>. In turn, <italic>MIR22HG</italic> negatively regulates the oncogene cMYC protein level. When re-introduced in ADSL knockout cells, wild-type ADSL, but not the mutant missing the hydroxylation site (P24A), can rescue <italic>MIR22HG</italic> level, thus promoting oncogene cMYC expression and breast cancer cell growth.</p>
<p id="Par18">The discovery of the mechanism of oxygen sensing has shed light on the importance of a previously understudied posttranslational modification: protein hydroxylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Since then, great efforts have been made to investigate whether hydroxylases have substrates beyond HIF-α contributing to the physiological response to hypoxia. The main technical challenge is the transient nature of the hydroxylation reaction. Strategies capable of preventing the dissociation of the hydroxylase-substrate complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> have allowed the discovery of several substrates, including the kinase Akt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, the phosphatase PP2A subunit B55α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, the transcription factor FOXO3a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, the kinases DYRK1A/B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, the tumor suppressor p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, the erythropoietin receptor EPOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and the kinase MAPK6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Hydroxylation has been shown to have additional consequences than affecting protein stability, such as altering protein-protein interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and protein activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and its dysregulation contributes to pathological outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is becoming clear that hydroxylation regulates cellular signaling to a much wider extent than initially thought, and uncovering its action may help understand pathological features and identify new potential therapeutic targets. Here we provide a strategy to identify hydroxylase substrates: the optimized substrate-trapping strategy, combining DMOG with hypoxia in HIF-1α-depleted cells, is followed by a TAP-TAG purification or, in parallel, a GST pull-down of the hydroxylase (here EglN2), and mass spectrometry. We chose to perform TAP-TAG purification to reduce the false positives: after two sequential affinity purifications, the chance of retrieving contaminants dramatically decreases. The proteins retrieved are further tested as potential substrates by comparing their interaction with the WT and catalytically dead (here EglN2-H358A) hydroxylase; if true substrates, they should display a stronger binding to the WT hydroxylase. This strategy has enabled us to identify ADSL as an EglN2 substrate.</p>
<p id="Par19">ADSL has been studied in the context of ADSL deficiency, disorder characterized by a purine metabolism defect leading to several symptoms, including psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, and autistic features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Even though ADSL activity has been previously reported to be dysregulated in breast cancer tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, tubular and tubulo-villous adenoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and gliomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, the mechanism underlying the potential role of ADSL in these malignancies has not been elucidated. Only recently a study provided a potential molecular mechanism for ADSL in endometrial cancer oncogenesis, by increasing killer cell lectin-like receptor C3 expression through fumarate production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, ADSL role in breast cancer, particularly TNBC, was completely unknown. Here we show that ADSL expression is significantly upregulated in TNBC patients compared with the other breast cancer subtypes and normal breast tissues. ADSL is essential for TNBC growth and invasiveness, as its depletion greatly impairs both. Importantly, we show that the ADSL depletion phenotype is much less dramatic in normal breast epithelial cell lines, suggesting that a therapeutic window for a treatment targeting ADSL may be available. In a recently published study on “Project Drive”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, a genome-wide shRNA screening identified ADSL as essential for cancer cell proliferation in 40 different cell lines, of which almost 25% were breast cancer cell lines. In comparison, the well-known oncogene PIK3CA was found critical in 29 cell lines, further strengthening the importance of studying ADSL in cancer.</p>
<p id="Par20">As already observed for other hydroxylase substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, ADSL hydroxylation does not affect protein stability. Instead, ADSL hydroxylation by EglN2 modulates ADSL activity. However, it remains unclear how ADSL proline 24 hydroxylation affects ADSL activity, which awaits further investigation. The hydroxylation may modify ADSL folding, enhancing its activity. Alternatively, it may alter the occurrence of other posttranslational modifications ultimately affecting ADSL activity, similar to EglN1-hydroxylated Akt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and FIH-hydroxylated RIPK4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, to the best of our knowledge, no posttranslational modifications of ADSL, apart from its hydroxylation shown here, are known so far. Another possibility is that hydroxylation may influence interactions between ADSL and other proteins affecting its activity. To address this question, in our future research we will examine the ADSL interactome in the presence or absence of prolyl hydroxylation.</p>
<p id="Par21">Previous studies have highlighted the positive regulation of ADSL expression by cMYC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, the possibility of a feedback regulation has never been explored until now. We provide evidence that ADSL regulates cMYC expression. ADSL depletion leads to decreased cMYC protein levels and several cMYC target genes, which may explain, at least partially, the profound metabolic changes and overall phenotype observed upon ADSL knockout. Consistently, we show a positive correlation between <italic>ADSL</italic> and cMYC target genes expression in TNBC patients across two different datasets. A recent study showed that the cMYC mRNA 3′UTR is stabilized by adenosine, but could not provide any evidence for microRNA involvement in cMYC translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Here we find that the long non-coding RNA <italic>MIR22HG</italic> is overexpressed upon ADSL knockout, and its overexpression recapitulates, at least partially, ADSL depletion phenotype, in accordance with other reports that identified it as a tumor suppressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We demonstrate that <italic>MIR22HG</italic> expression is regulated by ADSL through adenosine and adenine, without the need to be metabolized into AMP. The identification of the molecular mechanism linking adenosine and adenine to the modulation of <italic>MIR22HG</italic> expression will be the object of our future research. We show that <italic>MIR22HG</italic> negatively regulates cMYC protein level and provide evidence of a negative correlation between <italic>MIR22HG</italic> and cMYC target gene expression in TNBC patients in two different datasets. Consistently, a previous study showed that in breast cancer cell lines cMYC-binding protein MYCBP, a positive regulator of cMYC, is directly targeted by miR-22, leading to the downregulation of several E-box-containing cMYC target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. However, the fact that no change in cMYC protein level was observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> suggests that there may be an additional regulatory mechanism, likely directly ascribed to <italic>MIR22HG</italic>. It is worth noting that <italic>MIR22HG</italic> regulation of cMYC activity appears to be tissue-specific. In fact, in several lung cancer cell lines, <italic>MIR22HG</italic> downregulation causes a decrease in cMYC protein level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, the regulation of MYCBP expression by the mature sequence miR-22-3p was not observed in hepatocellular carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, the exact mechanism by which <italic>MIR22HG</italic> modulates cMYC expression in TNBC has not been investigated here, and remains to be determined.</p>
<p id="Par22">In conclusion, this study identifies the EglN2-hydroxylated ADSL as an important driver of TNBC proliferation and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. ADSL negatively controls the long non-coding RNA <italic>MIR22HG</italic> through a mechanism involving adenosine and adenine. <italic>MIR22HG</italic>, in turn, negatively regulates the oncogene cMYC expression. Therefore, the EglN2-ADSL-cMYC axis may be a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.</p>

<title>Orthotopic tumor growth</title>
<p id="Par55">Six-week old female NOD SCID Gamma mice (NSG, Jackson lab) were used for xenograft studies. Approximately 6 × 10<sup>5</sup> viable MDA-MB-231 cancer cells expressing luciferase or 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> viable MDA-MB-468 were resuspended in 40 μl matrigel (Corning, 354234) and injected orthotopically and bilaterally into the mammary fat pad of each mouse. For bioluminescent detection and quantification of cancer cells, mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection of luciferin (150 mg/kg) in sterile Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline. Fifteen minutes later, mice were placed in a light-tight chamber equipped with a charge-coupled device IVIS imaging camera (Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Photons were collected for a period of 1–60 s, and images were obtained and quantified using LIVING IMAGE 2.60.1 software (Xenogen). The total photons from the ADSL sgRNA tumor region of interest (ROI) were normalized to the photons of the first imaging for each mouse. Results were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Mice were sacrificed 6 weeks (for MDA-MB-231) or 11 weeks (for MDA-MB-468) after the first imaging. The rough mass of tumors was presented as mean ± SEM. All animal experiments were in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and received ethical approval by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

The dry pellets were reconstituted into 30 µL sample solvent (water:methanol:acetonitrile, 2:1:1, v/v) and 3 µl were further analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Ultimate 3000 UHPLC (Dionex) was coupled to Q Exactive Plus-Mass spectrometer (QE-MS, Thermo Scientific) for metabolite profiling. A hydrophilic interaction chromatography method (HILIC) employing an Xbridge amide column (100 × 2.1 mm i.d., 3.5 µm; Waters) was used for polar metabolite separation. Detailed LC method was described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> except that mobile phase A was replaced with water containing 5 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6.8). The QE-MS was equipped with a HESI probe with related parameters set as below: heater temperature, 120 °C; sheath gas, 30; auxiliary gas, 10; sweep gas, 3; spray voltage, 3.0 kV for the positive mode and 2.5 kV for the negative mode; capillary temperature, 320 °C; S-lens, 55; A scan range (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) of 70–900 was used in positive mode from 1.31 to 12.5 min.
