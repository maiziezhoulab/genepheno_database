<title>NOTE</title>
<p id="P5">Introductory Paragraph</p>
<p id="P6">It is estimated that 350 million individuals worldwide suffer from rare diseases, which are predominantly caused by mutation in a single gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The current molecular diagnostic rate is estimated at 50% with whole exome sequencing (WES) among the most successful approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. For patients in whom WES is uninformative, RNA-seq has shown diagnostic utility in specific tissues and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This includes muscle biopsies from patients with undiagnosed rare muscle disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and cultured fibroblasts from patients with mitochondrial disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, in many cases, biopsies are not performed for clinical care, and tissues are difficult to access. We sought to assess the utility of RNA-seq from blood as a diagnostic tool for rare diseases of different pathophysiologies. We generated whole blood RNA-seq from 94 cases with undiagnosed rare diseases spanning 16 diverse disease categories. We developed a robust approach to compare cases to large sets of RNA-seq controls (N=1,594 external and N=49 family-based controls) and demonstrated the impacts of expression, splicing, gene and variant filtering strategies on disease gene identification. Across our cohort, we observed that RNA-seq yields a 7.5% diagnostic rate and an extra 16.7% with improved candidate gene resolution.</p>
<p id="P7">We obtained RNA sequencing data from samples from 143 individuals, 94 affected by rare diseases and 49 unaffected family members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and whole exome or genome sequencing for 112 of them. In total, whole exome sequencing did not to identify the causal variant in 88.8% of patients. Patients represented 80 different diseases and were broadly classified into 16 distinct disease categories, with neurology, musculoskeletal, hematology and ophthalmology as the most frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We integrated these data with RNA-seq data from healthy individuals from the Depression Genes and Network (DGN) cohort (N=909)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) project (N=65)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and the Genotype-Tissue Expression consortium (GTEx version 7) (N=620) cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). By comparison to large healthy cohorts, we demonstrate how extreme gene expression and splicing events can aid in identifying candidate genes and variants.</p>
<p id="P8">We first evaluated the extent that whole blood RNA-seq captured gene expression of known rare disease genes in each major disease category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). When broadly considering disease genes from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, we observed 70.6% were expressed in blood and 50% of corresponding gene splicing junctions were covered with at least 5 reads in 20% of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">B</xref>). Notably, for a panel of genes known to be involved in neurological disorders (N=284), we observed that 76% were expressed. Using scores from ExAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we further observed that genes expressed across multiple tissues were more depleted in missense or loss-of-function (LoF) mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>(two-sided Wilcoxon test, p-value ≤2×10<sup>−16</sup>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). This suggests that mutations that have more severe consequences occur more often in genes for which expression is not restricted to one tissue. Indeed, we observed that 66% of LoF-intolerant genes (probability of being intolerant to LoF mutations (pLI ≥ 0.9) are expressed in blood samples (average transcripts per million, TPM ≥1)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Outlier (or aberrant) expression of a gene in a sample when comparing to all tested samples has previously been shown to help identify large-effect rare variants and rare disease genes in blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. We assessed the differences between outlier genes in cases versus controls after correcting the data for batch effects (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). We observed an enrichment of case under-expression outliers in genes more sensitive to LoF mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, red). This observation corroborates previous evidence that new LoF mutations are more likely to lower expression level through nonsense mediated decay (NMD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. As we increased the number of controls, the enrichment became stronger, demonstrating the impact of large control datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">We observed an average of 343 outliers per sample (|Z-score| ≥ 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We tested different variant and gene-level filters that could aid in further narrowing down the lists of candidate genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We filtered for genes that were LoF intolerant (Filter 1; pLI ≥0.9), likely to have a regulatory variant impacting gene expression (Filter 2: RIVER score ≥ 0.85<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>); showed allele-specific expression (ASE) (Filter 3); linked to the phenotype (Filter 4: Human Phenotype Ontology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (HPO) match), with a rare variant with MAF ≥ 0.01% within 10kb upstream of the gene (Filter 5); and with a rare variant that was likely deleterious (Filter 7; CADD score ≥10). Other filters were combinations of these sets. We observed that when restricting to under-expression outlier genes with HPO matches and a deleterious rare variant nearby, we were able to reduce the candidate genes list to less than 1% of the initial set of outliers with 80% of cases having at least one candidate gene (Filter 11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5A</xref>). Overall, we are able to reduce the number of expression outliers to less than 10 on average for all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Outlier splicing is also an important contributor to Mendelian disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. To evaluate splicing events across rare disease samples, we corrected junction data for batch effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>) and obtained Z-scores in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). On average, we detected 540 splicing outlier genes for each sample at |Z-score| ≥ 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). We observed that the number of splicing outliers was in influenced by the number of junction in each gene, was higher in cases and, like expression outliers, was enriched in genes sensitive to LoF mutation (data not shown). From both exome and genome data alone, we observed that the number of rare variants impacting splicing was large but could be significantly reduced when combined with outlier splicing information from RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). From our pool of candidate genes with splicing outliers, we looked at the proportion remaining after different filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We observed that limiting to genes relevant to the phenotype (Filter 2) and with a deleterious rare variant within 20 bp of the splicing junction (Filter 5), we were able to narrow down to only 0.14% of potential candidate genes (Filter 7). Overall, 32% of cases had at least one gene matching these criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5B</xref>). Furthermore, genes selected after filtering carried more deleterious rare variants than unfiltered outliers suggesting an enrichment of disease-genes with compound heterozygous mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Overall, the filtering steps are reducing candidates to less than 10 per case on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">RNA-seq provides the ability to measure allele-specific expression. ASE can inform the presence of a large-effect heterozygous regulatory, splicing or nonsense variant, or epi-mutation aiding the identification of candidate rare disease genes and variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Out of all possible heterozygous sites (~10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> per sample for exome and genome, respectively), 10<sup>4</sup> variants had sufficient coverage for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7A</xref>). Independent of sequencing technology, we observed 10<sup>3</sup> sites displaying allelic imbalance with an allelic ratio ≤ 0.35 or ≥ 0.65. To highlight ASE events that might be disease-related, we focused on the subset of genes outlier ASE sites within case individuals when compared to all other rare disease individuals and GTEx samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7A</xref>). We found an average of 94 ASE outliers per individual. We observed that the top 20 ASE outlier genes are enriched for overlap with HPO-associated genes per case, regardless of the filters applied to the extreme ASE genes and background genes (ie pLI ≥ 0.9, Rare variant nearby, Rare variant with CADD score ≥ 10 nearby; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7B</xref>). We also tested whether ASE would allow us to identify deleterious variants that were over-represented as this may be a marker for compound events or haploinsufficiency. Here, we focused on rare deleterious variants where the alternative allele is more abundant than the reference allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7C</xref>). In total, 111 rare variants show allelic imbalance biased toward the deleterious alternative allele (96 splice and 15 stop-gain). Among those, one variant is in <italic>EFHD2</italic>, a gene coding for Ca<sup>2+</sup> adapter protein involved in B-cell apoptosis, NF-kB mediated in inflammatory response, and immune cell activation and motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The carrier of this event was diagnosed with idiopathic cardiomyopathy, where accompanying symptoms (elevated in inflammatory markers, Raynaud’s disease, and alopecia) are indicative of auto-immune issues.</p>
<p id="P13">By integrating expression, splicing and ASE signals, we were able to identify and validate the causal gene in 6/80 independent cases (7.5%, 4 expression outliers, 2 splicing outliers), identify candidate genes potentially linked to the disease phenotype (gene matching HPO terms for the symptoms of the proband) in 5/30 cases with candidate gene information (16.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We did not find highly relevant candidate genes for 69 cases (86%). Notably, candidates were identified for 5 neurological cases where blood is not assumed to be a representative tissue. Furthermore, we observed that for cases where a candidate gene set was provided based on previous literature, we had a higher percentage of overlaps with an RNA-based filtered gene set than a DNA-based filtered gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Three cases exemplify the use of RNA-seq in causal gene identification. In a first case, two brothers ages 4 and 5 years, each presented at 6 months with delayed motor milestones and hypotonia, which evolved to include spasticity, an ataxic gait, and progressive loss of motor skills. Genome sequencing identified biallelic heterozygous pathogenic variants in the <italic>MECR</italic> gene present in both siblings: c.830+2dupT and c.−39G&gt;C. Pathogenic variants in <italic>MECR</italic> are associated with mitochondrial enoyl CoA reductase protein-associated neurodegeneration (MEPAN), a rare disorder characterized by childhood-onset movement disorder, signal hyperintensity in the basal ganglia, optic atrophy, and relatively preserved cognition. To date only seven individuals with MEPAN have been reported in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. While the c.830+2dupT variant has been described previously, the c.−39G&gt;C variant is novel. After applying our pipeline on expression outliers, we found <italic>MECR</italic> as a candidate in both siblings in a list of 11 and 15 genes respectively (with respectively 1 and 0 candidates left after the splicing pipeline, True Positive Rate (TPR) between 6.7 and 8.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">B</xref>). Without expression information, there was 245 and 302 genes (including <italic>MECR</italic>) and (with 111 and 161 additional after the splicing based pipeline) linked to the phenotype with a rare deleterious variant within 10kb (TPR between 0.28 and 0.21%).</p>
<p id="P15">In a second case, a 12-year-old Hispanic female presented with developmental regression after typical development until age 18 months, manifesting with loss of milestones including head control, and speech. Tremors developed at 21 months; and seizures at 22 months. She also suffered from occasional myoclonus. She has a 5-year-old brother with onset at 13 months of ataxia, autism, developmental delay, recurrent febrile seizures, and absent speech. Without expression data, we were able to filter the number of candidate genes from 1,034 genes to 96 genes (with an additional 105 candidate genes from the expression based side of the pipeline, TPR 0.49%), when looking only at genes associated with the phenotypes (from HPO terms [24]) and containing rare variants within 20bp of annotated junctions with a CADD score ≥ 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The causal gene is missing from the most stringent filter because there is no rare deleterious variants within 20bp of known junctions. Adding splicing outlier information from RNA-seq data left us with one gene (in addition to 7 filtered expression outliers, TPR 12.5%); <italic>KCTD7</italic>, containing a non-annotated junction in the affected sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, left panel). A synonymous mutation was found responsible for the creation of a new splicing junction in this gene (p.V152V, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). RT-PCR from RNA extracted from fibroblasts from exons 2–4 regions of the gene confirmed a difference in fragment size in the probands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, Source Data). In addition, this variant exhibited monoallelic expression towards the reference allele as a consequence of the premature splicing event.</p>
<p id="P16">In a third case, we reprocessed a solved case for which we had found an exon-skipping event in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In this case, the patient presented with a sporadic form of spinal muscular atrophy. After filtering for splicing outliers (|Z-score| ≥ 2) and selecting only genes relevant to the symptoms (HPO), only one gene was left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10A</xref>), <italic>ASAH1</italic>, for which we subsequently identified with Sanger sequencing a splice-loss mutation leading to the creation of a new transcript, skipping exon 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10B</xref>). While many of our cases had genetic data, this case demonstrated that use of RNA-seq alone can aid in disease gene identification.</p>
<p id="P17">In summary, the use of whole blood RNA-seq in combination with variants and phenotype relevant gene filters was able to identify the causal gene and variant(s) in 7.5% of cases or to further highlight candidate genes linked to phenotype in 16.7% of cases (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">methods</xref>). We recommend using our most stringent set of filters from splicing and expression outliers. As with exome sequencing, we expect this to be a baseline rate that will grow through ongoing case reanalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Similar to the utility of large databases of control exomes for Mendelian disease diagnoses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, we demonstrated the utility of large control RNA-seq data to identify aberrant expression, splicing and ASE events in candidate rare disease genes. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of performing RNA-Seq on peripheral blood, which is a readily available specimen type in clinical practice. Throughout our study, a trade-off needed to be found between strictly filtering the data and losing candidates of interest. It is worth noting that this combination of information is not expected to lead to the causal gene successfully in the following situations: first, if the causal gene is not expressed in the analyzed tissue; second, if the effects of the causal variant do not affect the expression of the gene; and third, if the filters are too strict. Therefore, expert evaluation remains required when prioritizing candidate genes using RNA-seq data. We can expect that combining information from multiple “omics” sources will only further improve diagnosis of unsolved rare disease cases in the future.</p>

As features in this model we used ExAC gene constraint metrics for LoF, missense and synonymous mutations [16]. For each gene in the dataset that had ExAC gene constraint metrics (n genes = 10,605), we calculated a binomial outcome variable corresponding to the proportion of case expression outliers found in each gene: Yi ~ B(ni; pi), where ni is the number of outlier samples in genei at a given percentile tested (the number of ‘trials’), and pi is the proportion of case outlier samples (which can be thought of as the probability of ‘success’ (or all outliers being case outliers) for genei).

The trained model (with learned parameters) is subsequently applied on UDN data to predict effects of rare variants. The model uses rare variants and the genomic annotations at those variants as predictors, uses RNA status (for this case is outlier status based on total gene expression levels) as the target/response variable. Rare variants here are defined as those with a minor allele frequency (MAF)&lt;0.01 in 1000 Genomes Project phase III all populations combined.

In total, 34,060 junctions in 6,261 protein coding genes across all samples fulfilled those criteria. We performed the analysis on all PIVUS samples (n=65) and rare disease samples (n=143).</p>

<title>Splicing data normalization and analysis</title>
<p id="P41">We used the union of PIVUS samples (n=65) and healthy family members (n=49) as a control set together with all the cases samples (n=94). To remove possible noise, and to allow missing values imputation, we removed junctions for which there was no more than 30 samples with data in the junction group. We analyzed coverage ratios for a total of 25,612 junctions.</p>
<p id="P42">Missing values in junction coverage ratios were imputed using missMDA R package. PCA analysis was then performed using prcomp R package. We regressed out principal components (PCs) accounting for 95% of the variation in our imputed dataset (176 PCs). We then put back original missing values in the dataset and derived Z-scores used in the outlier analysis. We looked at the correlation pattern between the 10 first PCs and known covariates from our dataset. In brief, PC1 was mainly separating the source of the data (UDN, CGS, CHEO or PIVUS). PC2 was highlighting differences between the first batch and the other batches. Overall, we observed some level of correlation between all known covariates and the PCs that were regressed out from the data.</p>
<p id="P43">We tested the impact of our filters on the median number of rare variants with CADD score ≥10 with a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test on all samples with splicing outliers and genetic information (n=74).</p>

<title>Allele specific expression</title>
<p id="P44">ASEReadCounter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> version 3.8–0-ge9d806836 from Genome Anaysis Tool Kit (GATK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> was run on single nucleotide variants from VCFs provided by the UDN, CHEO and CGS and corresponding RNA-seq data, using all samples for which we had genetic information (n=112). Only sites with a minimum read depth of 10, mapping quality of 10 and base quality of 2 were integrated in the analysis. For a gene to be considered with ASE, we required that at least 5 samples had heterozygous sites in the gene, that the heterozygous site was covered by at least 20 reads for the individual and to be considered imbalanced for allelic ratios ≥ 0.65 or ≤ 0.35. We eliminated total mono-allelic expression from the analysis (ie allelic ratio = 0 or 1).</p>
<p id="P45">To detect ASE outliers we restricted our analysis to sites and genes common to our samples and GTEx dataset including 11,224 genes and 87,739 sites, subject to the same site filters above. After this step, 108 individuals were left. We scaled the reference ratios for all sites within a gene across samples to obtain Z-scores per site. To summarize GTEx data per individual, we considered the maximum ratio (|0.5 - reference ratio|) across all tissues for which the individual had data at that site. Then, for each case, we selected the top N genes by |Z-score| as ASE outliers. We assessed the overlap of this set of genes with the genes associated with that individual case’s listed HPO terms, as well as the parent and child terms. To determine whether the overlap of ASE outliers with HPO-associated genes is significant, we selected 20 genes at random for each individual and assessed the overlap with the same HPO-associated genes. This was repeated 100 times. We then layered in additional filters, and took the top N most extreme ASE genes with a pLI &gt; 0.9 or with a nearby rare variant with that individual, and finally, a nearby deleterious (CADD ≥ 10) rare variant. In each instance, we matched the background for that filter, thereby comparing the overlap for extreme ASE + pLI &gt; 0.9 with HPO-associated genes to the overlap seen in a random background of genes, also with pLI &gt; 0.9, and the same with the rare variant criteria.</p>

<title>Phenotypic data</title>
<p id="P46">For each case we have RNA-seq data (n=94), we also obtained HPO terms corresponding to the symptoms of the affected individual. We extended this list of HPO terms to terms that were hierarchically one level lower (child terms), one level higher (parent terms) or alternative terms for the same phenotype. To do so, we used the Human Phenotypic Ontology (HPO, downloaded 10-23-18)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/downloads.html">http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/downloads.html</ext-link>). To link HPO terms to genes, we used the genes to phenotype and phenotype annotation files provided by the Human Phenotypic Ontology.</p>

<p id="P47">We labeled “solved” cases for which we found candidates from RNA-seq data for which the causal mutation was found and validated. In order to evaluate the number of cases for which we have strong candidates, we took a subset of 30 cases from the same institutions for which we obtained a list of candidate genes from curators. If any of those candidates were in the final set of filtered genes, they were labelled as “strong candidate”. Cases for which no strong candidate genes were found after analyzing RNA-seq data are labeled “no candidate”.</p>

<title>Expression outliers in rare disease samples.</title>
<p id="P55"><bold>a</bold>: Enrichment for case or control outlier genes in intolerance to LoF (red), missense (blue) and synonymous (yellow) mutations at different percentiles of gene expression. Represented here as the log odds ratio with 95% Wald confidence intervals using 931 samples. P-values were calculated based on the z -statistic. No adjustment for multiple testing. <bold>b</bold> Impact of Z-score thresholds on number of outliers. Differences between under and over expression outliers were tested using a two-sided Wilcoxon rang sum test. No adjustment for multiple testing. Vertical dashed lines indicate mean Z-score for n=1 and n=5 percentiles across all genes used in analysis (N = 14,988). For <bold>a</bold> and <bold>b:</bold> significance level: **** p-value≤1×10<sup>−4</sup>; *** p-value≤1×10<sup>−3</sup>; ** p-value≤1×10<sup>−2</sup>; * p-value≤5×10<sup>−2</sup>. <bold>c</bold>: Proportion of under-expression outlier genes remaining after filters (n=75 cases with genetic information). Adding genetic information (rare variant within 10kb upstream of the gene body) allows to filter down to 50% of the original set of outliers. Keeping only genes for which HPO information of the affected individual match helps narrow down to less than 10% of candidates. For <bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold>: Boxplots represent median value, with lower and upper hinges corresponding to the 25th and 75th percentiles, and lower and upper whiskers extend from the hinge to the smallest and largest value at most 1.5 * inter-quartile range of the hinge respectively. <bold>d</bold>: Number of candidate genes at each filter for all cases with genetic information (n=75). Average number of candidate genes and s.d are represented in black for each filter.</p>

<title>Splicing outlier detection.</title>
<p id="P56"><bold>a</bold>: Splicing outlier definition. Gene model is in green, rectangles represent 3 exons. In this model, we show junction information for one donor (D) and two acceptors(A1 and A2). For each sample for this gene we have coverage information for the two existing splicing junctions (D-A1 and D-A2). We defined the proportion of one splice junction as the number of reads overlapping this junction divided by the total number of reads spanning all junctions from a common donor (or acceptor). <bold>b</bold>: Number of genes with at least one splicing outlier at different Z-score thresholds (n=208 samples from PIVUS and rare disease cohorts). <bold>c</bold>: Number of rare variants in each sample, in total, nearby junction and associated with a splicing outlier (n=111 samples with genetic information). Rare variants were defined as variants with MAF≤0.1%. <bold>d</bold>: Impact of different filters on splicing outlier discoveries (n=75 cases with genetic information). <bold>e</bold>: We observed a significant increase (two-sided Wilcoxon test, p-value 9.8×10<sup>−5</sup>) in the median number of rare variants with CADD score≥10 in the gene when filtering outliers with a rare variant within 20 bp of the junction and relevant to the disease phenotype (HPO match) (n=109 samples with splicing outliers and genetic data). <bold>f</bold>: Number of candidate genes at each filter for all cases with genetic information (n=75). Mean value and s.d. are represented in black for each filter. For <bold>b</bold> and <bold>d</bold> and <bold>e</bold>: Boxplots represent median value, with lower and upper hinges corresponding to the 25th and 75th percentiles, and lower and upper whiskers extend from the hinge to the smallest and largest value at most 1.5 * inter-quartile range of the hinge respectively.</p>

<title>Identification of disease gene through splicing outlier detection.</title>
<p id="P57"><bold>a</bold>: Splicing outliers in the KCTD7 case. Number of candidate genes obtained throughout different filters using genetic data, splicing outlier data, and phenotypic data. Shape indicates if the causal gene is in the list. After filtering for splicing outliers with a deleterious rare splice variant within 20 bp of a splice junction and limiting the search to genes for which there is a link to phenotype (HPO match), 1 candidate gene was left, <italic>KCTD7</italic>. <bold>b</bold>: Sashimi plot of the case and 3 controls of the splicing gain region in <italic>KCTD7</italic>. For the case only (red track), we observed a new splicing junction ahead of the annotated one in exon 3. <bold>c</bold>: cDNA gel from fibroblast cDNA of exons 2–4 of <italic>KCTD7</italic> for the proband, her affected sibling and three unaffected controls (no independent replicate). Both for the case and her affected brother we observed 2 fragments of different size, corresponding to the alternative splice products induced by the splice-gain mutation. In control samples, only one fragment is observed, corresponding to the original transcript.</p>
