<abstract>
<p>Doublecortin (DCX) mutations cause abnormal development of the DCX protein that normally
aids in neuronal migration during fetal development. These mutations lead to
lissencephaly, or the appearance of a “smooth brain,” which is varying levels of
pachygyria or agyria in severe cases. Many genetic variants of the mutation have been
identified, and an even greater range of phenotypic presentations have been described in
the literature. The X-linked lissencephaly (DCX) mutation leads to an X-linked
gender-dependent condition that causes subcortical heterotopia in females and
lissencephaly in males. The authors report the case of a 13-year-old male who presented to
our clinic for new-onset seizure disorder. He had a past medical history of developmental
delay and features of autism spectrum disorder which was diagnosed at age 5 years at an
outside clinic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain at age 5 years showed pachygyria of
the frontal and temporal lobes. After extensive genetic testing over the course of over a
decade, the patient was found to have a de novo mutation in the DCX gene diagnosed via
whole-exome sequencing. Specifically, he was found to have a mosaic mutation of the DCX
gene as a c.30-31 deletion. His previous MRI findings were consistent with a diagnosis of
X-linked sporadic lissencephaly sequence and included mainly a diffuse bilateral
pachygyria (isolated lissencephaly sequence X chromosome). Thickening of the cortex and
pachygyria or agyria are classic findings of lissencephaly, but do not help specify any
mutation in the gene, of which there are over 70 possibilities. Our patient is unique in
that most individuals with DCX mutation have infantile seizures, severe intellectual
disability, orthopedic complications, and postnatal microcephaly, which our patient does
not have.</p>

<p>The case involves the delay in diagnoses of lissencephaly etiology in a patient with
doublecortin (DCX) mutation. This delay was due to changing availability and utilization of
genetic testing. The authors also seek to highlight the ability for an individual with a
severely abnormal neurological physiology to be successful in society depending on genetic
mosaicism lending residual function and parental involvement in individual success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2329048X19836589">1</xref></sup> Genetic variants resulting in lissencephaly are varied in both their specific karyotype
location and their phenotypic presentations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2329048X19836589">2</xref></sup> The dominant mechanisms by which cortical lamination is disrupted can be due to a
failure of neuronal migration, a failure of neuronal path finding, or an imbalance in DNA
replication in utero.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2329048X19836589">3</xref></sup> The 2 main classifications of lissencephaly are therefore defined as either type 1,
which is a failure to differentiate the cortex into all of the appropriate 6 layers (instead
resulting in 4 layers), or type 2, which is a complete failure to layer the cortex at all. The
latter is referred to as a “cobblestone” phenotype, while the former is known as “classical” lissencephaly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2329048X19836589">4</xref></sup> The DCX gene codes for the DCX protein that binds microtubules during neural
development. Mutations in the gene cause the neuronal migration disorders subcortical band
heterotopia in females and classic lissencephaly in males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2329048X19836589">2</xref></sup> Although lissencephaly can be diagnosed in utero, patients who presented before the
popularization of in utero testing and genetic diagnosis will often go undiagnosed until
presenting to clinic with behavioral or developmental abnormalities. Although the clinical
manifestations of lissencephaly normally present in individuals during early development, the
diagnosis of a DCX mutation specifically causing the lissencephaly can be delayed for years or
even decades. Here, the authors present a case of a patient who was initially diagnosed with
lissencephaly after presenting to clinic with behavior and developmental abnormalities, but
whose specific genetic mutation causing the disorder was not diagnosed until over a decade
later. The final diagnosis was made in the setting of new-onset seizure and an evolving
clinical approach to genetic testing based on accumulated test results throughout the
patient’s clinical history.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 13-year-old male presented to outside clinic with autistic features including lack of
social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and sound hypersensitivity. Patient reached most
of his appropriate early developmental milestones, walked at 8 months and said his first
words at 14 months. The patient was reported to have an age-appropriate vocabulary with what
his mother said was nearly 20 words by the time he was 18 months, but he could not use words
to name items correctly. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was completed and
showed decreased topographic development of the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. In
addition to diffuse pachygyria, there was involvement of the cerebellar vermis in repeat MRI
imaging in both 2010 and 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2329048X19836589">Figures
1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2329048X19836589">2</xref>).</p>

<p>Although these findings were consistent with the patient’s eventual diagnosis of DCX mutation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2329048X19836589">5</xref></sup> they were not reflective of the full set of typical MRI findings in patients with the
DCX mutation in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2329048X19836589">Figure 3</xref>).
The MRI done when the patient was 7-years old suggested a partial lissencephaly of unknown
genetic origin.</p>

<p>This is consistent with the patient’s proposed genetic etiology being de novo, since family
members had no significant developmental or neurological history to suggest possible sources
of the patient’s disorder. Because of mild facial dysmorphisms including large low-set ears
and widely spaced eyes, the patient was tested for Fragile-X at the time which was negative.
Karyotype was also performed at the age of 5 years but yielded no positive findings. No
further genetic workup was done at the time. The patient was then able to live a relatively
normal adolescent life, attending public school despite having mild Intellectual disability
disorder. His mother requested speech and behavioral therapy 7 times a week for him to
improve his skills in social interaction. At the age of 13 years, he had his first
generalized tonic–clonic seizure in the setting of gastroenteritis. A repeat MRI again
demonstrated lissencephaly and a 23-hour electroencephalography revealed frontal predominant
intermittent slowing, consistent with his structural brain abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2329048X19836589">6</xref></sup> At the age of 13 years, the patient was started on Keppra with excellent seizure
control from 2010 to 2015. Comparative Genomic Hybridization Assay performed at age 13 years
was negative as well. At this point in adolescence, there was an increase in seizure
frequency due to noncompliance and bouts of illness, and patient was brought to clinic once
again for further management of his seizures. At the age of 19 years, methylation studies
for Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome were found to be normal. He then had
whole-exome sequencing which resulted in the discovery of a mutation in the DCX gene on
chromosome Xq22-23, specifically a c.30-31 deletion.</p>

<p>This involvement in newly regenerating neural function suggests a role in adult neural
migration as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2329048X19836589">9</xref></sup> Patients with mutant DCX genes vary in their presentation based on the location of the<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2329048X19836589">10</xref></sup> mutation on the affected chromosome as well as the gender of the patient, and somatic
versus germ line origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2329048X19836589">11</xref></sup> Our patient had a de novo mutation of the isolated lissencephaly sequence X
chromosome, which has its own specific subset of findings on MRI that typically includes
involvement of the cerebellar vermis and corpus callosum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2329048X19836589">12</xref></sup> In patients with DCX mutation, treatment is symptomatic and supportive rather than
curative. However, this does not mean that genetic etiology of each patient’s specific DCX
mutation is irrelevant in clinical care. Expected complications of lissencephaly differ
somewhat by etiology. For patients with DCX mutation mosaicism, complications such as
seizure and orthopedic abnormality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2329048X19836589">13</xref></sup> can be expected in early childhood and adolescence. In our patient’s case, prognosis
was more guarded in the early stages after his diagnosis of lissencephaly, likely at least
in part because outcomes are dependent on many factors. The degree of lissencephaly largely
determines outcomes, as completely “smooth-brained” patients often die before the age of 10
years, and many others never reach a developmental stage of greater than 6 months of age.
Our patient likely had a DCX mutation that was mosaic in nature, and there was likely some
level of functional DCX protein available to the developing neural network during fetal
stages. Patients such as ours with a partial lissencephaly can reach varied levels of social
functionality. Our patient who is now 23-years old functions at approximately a 9-year-old
level. Because behavioral intervention in patients with intellectual disability is more
effective with earlier onset of therapy, it is significant to note onset of therapy when
parental involvement in this case resulted in early aggressive speech and behavioral therapy
for the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2329048X19836589">14</xref></sup> It also led to a push for our patient to be involved in public school classes with
abled students. Integrative education programs such as these have been shown to improve
students’ social outcomes in the long term.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2329048X19836589">1</xref></sup> Because of a combination of the mildness of our patient’s lissencephaly and these
early interventions, he has graduated high school, is able to maintain employment, and is a
functioning member of society despite his medical diagnosis. The authors compare this
patient profile, for example, to a different mutation on chromosome 17, which also causes
congenital lissencephaly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2329048X19836589">15</xref></sup> This condition is coined Miller-Dieker syndrome, named after 2 separate physicians
who identified the disorder in the 1960s. Instead of having orthopedic complications, these
patients have associated cyanotic congenital heart malformations and kidney abnormalities,
as well as early onset of visual impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2329048X19836589">15</xref></sup> In such patients, the genetic etiology of their gene mutation gives medical
direction. In a patient in whom you expect to have complications of the heart and kidney,
medications normally contraindicated in patients with heart or kidney disease should be
viewed as suboptimal. Screening for these malformations would also be pertinent in the
patient’s routine follow-up care. Although treatment at this point is symptomatic, patients
with lissencephaly deserve a thorough genetic workup to identify the etiology of their own
“smooth-brain” syndrome. Not only can it allow better guidance to patient families about
what to expect regarding prognosis but knowing associated symptomology can help physicians
anticipate and screen for complications more likely in specific patients. Pioneering
research into gene replacement in utero is still in the animal model stages for DCX mutation
therapy. However, if these treatments, which at the animal level, seem to have some level of
success were to come to fruition, they will only be helpful if the mutation itself is
diagnosed incredibly early in development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2329048X19836589">16</xref></sup> Our patient had an extensive genetic workup throughout the course of his clinical
care and was able to receive support from his family and community in order to have the
positive outcome he did.</p>
