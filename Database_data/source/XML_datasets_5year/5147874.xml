<abstract>
<p>The effects of early life stress <italic>in utero</italic> or in neonates has long-term consequences on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis function and neurodevelopment. These effects extend into adulthood and may underpin a variety of mental illnesses and be related to various developmental and cognitive changes. We examined the potential role of neonatal HPA axis activation on adult psychopathology and dopamine sensitivity in the mature rat using neonatal exposure to the synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonist and stress hormone, dexamethasone. We utilized a comprehensive battery of assessments for behaviour, brain function and gene expression to determine if elevated early life HPA activation is associated with adult-onset neuropsychiatric traits. Dexamethasone exposure increased startle reactivity under all conditions tested, but decreased sensitivity of sensorimotor gating to dopaminergic disruption–contrasting with what is observed in several neuropsychiatric diseases. Under certain conditions there also appeared to be mild long-term changes in stress and anxiety-related behaviours with neonatal dexamethasone exposure. Electrophysiology revealed that there were no consistent neuropsychiatric abnormalities in auditory processing or resting state brain function with dexamethasone exposure. However, neonatal dexamethasone altered auditory cortex glucocorticoid activation, and auditory cortex synchronization. Our results indicate that neonatal HPA axis activation by dexamethasone alters several aspects of adult brain function and behaviour and may induce long-term changes in emotional stress-reactivity. However, neonatal dexamethasone exposure is not specifically related to any particular neuropsychiatric disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The HPA axis prepares the body to respond to acute anticipatory and reactive stressors including pain, injury, social challenges, and unfamiliar contexts. Activation of distinct neuroanatomical pathways in the HPA axis by stress ultimately results in the release of a variety of hormones including glucocorticoids from the adrenal glands into the bloodstream (predominantly cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents). These hormones cross the blood brain barrier and bind to mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in many brain regions. Although there are protective mechanisms to prevent excessive HPA axis activation in early life, such as placental barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref001">1</xref>] and mother-infant interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref002">2</xref>]; sustained stressors and pharmacological treatments may overcome protection mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref003">3</xref>] resulting in changes in stress reactivity and behaviour as adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref005">5</xref>]. The effects of excessive HPA axis activation from early life stress <italic>in utero</italic> or as neonates has consequences extending into adulthood, which are hypothesised to underpin a variety of mental illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref004">4</xref>] and neurocognitive deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref006">6</xref>]. In addition activation of components of the HPA axis, such as perinatal GR activation with dexamethasone, have commonly been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref008">8</xref>]. Therefore the use of glucocorticoids in early life, such as commonly done in preterm infants, and excessive glucocorticoid levels during maternal stress have likely impacts on adult development.</p>
<p>Many neuropsychiatric illnesses are characterised by specific changes in brain function that may be indicative the early life stress or HPA axis over activation. Many patients with neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression demonstrate HPA axis dysfunction as adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref010">10</xref>] and show changes in GR expression in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref011">11</xref>]. Furthermore neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety, have risk factors implicating adverse early life environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref013">13</xref>] including maternal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref015">15</xref>], maternal psychological stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref016">16</xref>], various obstetric complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref017">17</xref>] and maternal famine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref019">19</xref>]. Therefore it appears plausible that early life activation of the HPA axis through GR agonism may lead to changes in developmental programming, resulting in changes in brain development, behaviour, and neuropsychiatric phenotypes.</p>
<p>Excessive early life HPA activation leads to key changes in brain structure and behaviours. For example, separation and repeated maternal stress results in changes in adrenal gland size reflecting chronic changes in HPA axis function in offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref021">21</xref>]. This translates into model specific changes in offspring for maternal separation, alteration in the important neuropsychiatric phenotype of sensorimotor gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref020">20</xref>]; and for maternal stress, poorer spatial memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref021">21</xref>]. However these approaches are limited by the inability to dissect specific developmental responses to activation of distinct components of the HPA axis.</p>
<p>The specific effects GR activation in the HPA axis can be probed using the synthetic GR agonist dexamethasone. Maternal exposure to dexamethasone in rats not only produces changes in offspring GR expression, but also impairs aspects of cognition including memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref023">23</xref>]. However maternal treatment with dexamethasone confounds the effects on the mother and the pup–vehicle-treated pups show behavioural deficits when cross-fostered dams treated with dexamethasone during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref022">22</xref>]. The confounding effects of maternal dexamethasone exposure may be overcome by directly exposing pups to dexamethasone. Neonatal dexamethasone exposure in rat pups produces long-term changes in HPA-axis responses, brain structure, and motor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref025">25</xref>]. Regardless of the route of HPA axis activation, it appears that perinatal HPA axis activation leads to long-term changes in stress sensitivity, brain structure, and behaviour. However, it has not been established if the developmental programming effects GR activation produce specific neuropsychiatric phenotypes.</p>
<p>We address the potential contribution of early life GR activation on the development neuropsychiatric phenotypes using neonatal dexamethasone exposure in rats. The presence of neuropsychiatric phenotypes was assessed a battery of well-established tests in patients and animal models of psychiatric disease including: sensory processing and gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref027">27</xref>], amphetamine sensitivity and dopamine receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref030">30</xref>], brain activity (electroencephalography (EEG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref031">31</xref>]), and auditory evoked potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref035">35</xref>], novelty seeking and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref037">37</xref>], and genes implicated in neuropsychiatric illness, brain plasticity, and glucocorticoid function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref039">39</xref>]. We found several changes in brain function and behaviour, however these did not appear specific to a particular neuropsychiatric phenotype, indicating that GR activation in early life may not be sufficient by itself to elicit a psychiatric phenotype.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>This study received approval by the University of Western Australia Animal Ethics Committee (Approval ID: RA/03100/1179), and conducted according to Australian and international guidelines. All animals were housed in standard housing, with <italic>ad libitum</italic> supply of standard rat chow and water, with a 12:12 Light:Dark Cycle. Six pregnant Sprague-Dawley dams arrived in animal housing approximately mid-gestation from local supplier and housed within a few hours of departure from the Animal Resource Centre (Murdoch, Western Australia). Parturition day was considered as postnatal day 0 (PND 0). Because of well-established gender and oestrous cycle effects in behavioural studies only male pups were used in this study. Female pups were culled prior to PND 3 using cervical transection. On PND 5 the remaining male pups were assigned to the vehicle control group (CON, N = 21) or to the dexamethasone treatment group (DEX, N = 21) keeping equal numbers for each group within each litter when possible. The dexamethasone solution was 1.5 mg/ml dexamethasone 21-phosphate disodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, concentration expressed as that of base) dissolved in 0.9% saline. The groups were weighed and injected with either vehicle (0.9% saline) or dexamethasone solution (1.5 mg/kg i.p.) days PND5 to PND10, inclusive. The blood brain barrier is incomplete at this age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref040">40</xref>], making it possible for dexamethasone to act in the brain. This age encompasses the rat HPA axis hyporesponsive period of PND 4–14 when glucocorticoid levels are normally kept very low through mother-pup interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref041">41</xref>]. Dexamethasone concentration is based upon previous studies showing long-term mild changes behaviour, brain size and HPA axis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref044">44</xref>] and on dose-responses that produce alteration in PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref045">45</xref>]. Direct pup exposure was chosen due to the potentially confounding effects of dexamethasone on maternal care in maternal exposure models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref022">22</xref>]. Injections were performed between 14:00 and 16:00 each day. A handling-only control group was not included: previous studies using similar injection regimes have found no behavioural, body weight, or brain growth differences between vehicle-injected and handled controls in adult rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref046">46</xref>]. The pups were monitored and weighed daily until PND14 and then weekly thereafter. On PND24 the pups were weaned and housed in pairs, with one DEX and one CON treated animal when possible. Regular monitoring revealed all animals were healthy and showed no signs of suffering throughout the study.</p>

<title>Prepulse Inhibition of the Startle Reflex</title>
<p>Briefly, during weeks 13–14 each rat underwent a series of measurements of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex consisting of a habituation day, amphetamine challenge (AMPH) and vehicle challenge (VEH) days. The challenges of AMPH (dexamphetamine, 2 mg/kg dissolved 2 mg/ml in 0.9% saline) or VEH (0.9% saline, 1 ml/kg) were administered 10 min prior to commencement of the experiment.</p>
<p>Each experiment was separated by one day with the amphetamine and vehicle challenge days counterbalanced, and only the amphetamine and vehicle challenge days were included in analysis. The PPI protocol used a variety of stimulus intensities with and without a prepulse to generate stimulus intensity response magnitude curves (SIRM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref048">48</xref>]. The protocol also included trials at the beginning and end of each day testing session to assess habituation of PPI and the startle response (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167220.s001">S1 File</xref> for full details).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Exploratory behaviour</title>
<p>During postnatal week 16 all animals were assessed for exploratory behaviour and novel object recognition. At least 15 min prior to the exploratory behaviour assessments, rats were habituated to the test room which was moderately illuminated. The apparatus was a 2 m long enclosed Perspex tunnel (approx. 15 cm x 15 cm square) divided into a light (transparent perspex) half and a dark (black perspex) half. Each rat was placed at the farthest end of the dark half of the tunnel shut at both ends with sliding Perspex doors. Over the course of 10 min the number of times the rat crossed between the light and dark zones, latency to first cross, and the total amount of time the rat spent in the dark was recorded. A cross was considered to have occurred when all four paws moved into a different zone. The data were divided into two 5 min blocks (first 5 min, last 5 min).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Open-field exploration</title>
<p>The day after exploratory behaviour assessment each animal was placed in an open-field chamber (L x W x H, 19.5 x 31.5 x 12 cm) marked with a 6 x 6 grid, for 5 min and recorded with a video camera with the experimenter outside the room.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Novel Object Recognition</title>
<p>The days following open-field exploration rats were individually habituated to an open field box for 3 days (l x w x h, 18.5 x 18.5 x18 cm). During the training session, two identical objects were placed in the top right and left corners of the open field and the rat was allowed to explore for 5 min. They were returned to their home cage for 1 h, and then again placed in the open field containing one duplicate of the original objects and one novel object for 5 min. The time spent interacting with the novel object compared with the familiar object during the retention test was used as a measure of recognition memory. The testing box and objects was cleaned between trials using 70% ethanol to mitigate odour cues. The types and locations of the objects were counterbalanced.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Between 17 and 19 weeks postnatal, rats received a comprehensive test battery of electrophysiological assessments using EEG and auditory evoked potentials for measures that are often abnormal in neuropsychiatric disease including in schizophrenia. Briefly the animals were anaesthetised with 60 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium with additional doses as needed of 30 mg/kg i.p as monitored by foot-withdrawal reflex, eye-blink reflex and breathing. The rat’s head was secured in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting Co.) and small silver ball electrodes (0.75 mm diameter) were placed on the brain surface through small burr holes in the frontal sinus (common reference), above the left and right auditory cortex (active electrodes, 4.5 mm posterior, 3.5 mm lateral to bregma) and a common indifferent was placed above the cerebellum (common ground). Electrodes used insulated silver wire. ECG was monitored using needle electrodes placed on each forepaw. Each electrode pair was passed through a DAM-50 differential amplifier and acquired using a 4-channel PowerLab system (AD Instruments), see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0167220.t002">Table 2</xref> for filter settings related to each evoked potential measure. Testing occurred in a heated sound attenuated room and upon a heating pad. Following electrode placement ear bars were removed the head resting on the bite bar. The stimuli were presented binaurally through a centrally placed open field speaker. Auditory stimuli and digital triggers were generated by custom written software (AEP Generator version 1.0, NJ Yates) using LabView 2011 (National Instruments) and presented by an external USB soundcard sampled at 96 kHz (Creative USB X-Fi). Data were presented and acquired online using LabChart 7 (AD Instruments). Offline analysis was performed using MATLAB 2012a (MathWorks Inc.) and LabChart 7.</p>

<p>The experimental protocols are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0167220.t002">Table 2</xref> and full description of the experiment methodology is found in supplementary data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167220.s002">S2 File</xref>). Briefly, auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) have previously been described as abnormal in human patients with schizophrenia. The AEPs assessed were auditory brainstem responses (ABR) to establish hearing sensitivity, middle latency auditory evoked potentials (MAEP) to assess auditory habituation, P50 response to assess sensory gating, auditory steady state response (ASSR) to assess brain synchrony and phase locking (additional information and example recordings in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167220.s002">S2 File</xref>). Ten minutes of ECG and EEG were also recorded to assess measures of heart rate variability and waveform complexity which are abnormal in schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref031">31</xref>] (additional information in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167220.s002">S2 File</xref>). We excluded any rat that showed ABR thresholds above 43 dB SPL (CON N = 1, DEX N = 4) due to potential confounds of surgical trauma and limitations in speaker output levels. The electrophysiology recording session was approximately 2 hours per animal.</p>
<p>At the end of the electrophysiology protocol, the burr holes over the auditory cortices were extended laterally, anteriorly and posteriorly to expose the temporal lobes. Core biopsies of the temporal lobes in the auditory cortex region were taken. These were immediately placed in ice-cold RNAse-free 0.3 ml eppendorf tubes and into a -80°C freezer for later analysis. Immediately prior to tissue collection animals were euthanized with intraperitoneally injection of Lethabarb (160mg/kg, concentration 325 mg/ml sodium pentobarbitone, Virbac animal health).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Gene expression in the auditory cortex</title>
<p>Briefly, total RNA was extracted from the frozen samples of auditory cortex and quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the expression of 5 genes of interest implicated in mental illness: the dopamine receptor 1 (DRD1) and dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2); the GABA cell marker Gamma Amino Decarboxylase 1 (GAD1); NMDA receptor subunit GRIN2B; and a marker of glucocorticoid activity TSC22. These genes were normalised using the geometric mean of 3 references genes: TBP, HPRT, and GAPDH. The auditory cortex was chosen in order to potentially relate changes in auditory evoked potentials with gene expression, is sensitive to dopaminergic-mediated plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref049">49</xref>]. Full details of the sample preparation and protocol is presented in supplementary material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167220.s003">S3 File</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Electrophysiology data were originally stored in LabChart (AD Instruments, version 7.3.7) then exported to MATLAB (Mathworks, version 2012a) for processing. Data and statistical analyses were performed using R studio (version 0.97.551) and R (version 3.0.1), with packages ez (version 4.1–1) and plyr (version 1.8), GraphPad Prism (version 5.04, GraphPad Software Inc.) and Microsoft Excel 2007. Non-parametric tests were Wilcoxon ranked sum. Parametric tests were mixed model 2-way ANOVAs and ANCOVAs using the ezANOVA function in R. Statistical post-hoc tests were Holm-Bonferroni corrected t-tests with significance levels at α = 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Because only the effects or interactions related to dexamethasone treatment were of interest, differences observed due to recording side in electrophysiology experiments are only reported if other main effects or interactions are present, otherwise only results from the left ACx are shown. Brief statistical reporting is provided in the text, however full analysis can be found in supplementary data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167220.s001">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167220.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167220.s003">S3</xref> Files).</p>

<title>General Observations and Physiology</title>
<p>Between 12 and 20 pups were born per litter (6 to 12 males). Prior to dexamethasone injections there were no pre-existing differences in pup weight, but following injections DEX animals showed persistent lower weights. In addition, the dexamethasone pups showed eye opening at least 1 day earlier than the vehicle control group (days, DEX = 11.67 ± 0.33, CON = 13.5 ± 0.34, t = 5.966, df = 5, p &lt; 0.01). Differences in fur growth were also apparent within the pre-weaning stage, DEX animals showing patchy and course hair growth whilst the fur of VEH animals was fine and smooth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Behavioural Phenotype</title>
<p>When placed in the light-dark tunnel the DEX group showed a significantly shorter latency to first cross to the light zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167220.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, Wilcoxon ranked sum test, W = 139.5, p &lt; 0.05). However all other measures from the light-dark tunnel were not significantly different from the VEH group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167220.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, Time in dark; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167220.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, Crosses). The light zone in this test is usually considered to be anxiogenic, indicating that DEX animals show a low anxiety phenotype in this environment.</p>

</fig>
<p>When placed in an open field, dexamethasone treatment resulted in no differences between the groups for total sectors travelled, rearings, defecation, or time spent immobile (all p &gt; 0.10). However, the number of sectors traversed in the centre was greater in the DEX group than in the CON group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167220.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, p &lt; 0.05) as was the time spent in the Centre (p &lt; 0.01). The number of sectors traversed in the periphery was not different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167220.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, p &gt; 0.10). The number of transitions from periphery to centre was not significant (p = 0.055). This phenotype of increased centre activity is often considered to be indicative of a low anxiety animal.</p>
<p>There were no changes in novel object recognition between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167220.g001">Fig 1F</xref>: discrimination ratio, time looking at novel and habituated objects, and percentage of time interacting with either object, all p &gt; 0.10).

<sec id="sec015">
<title>Sensorimotor response and gating</title>
<p>The acoustic startle response was assessed in each animal with amphetamine or vehicle in a counterbalanced design to determine the effects of neonatal dexamethasone on sensorimotor integration and acoustic sensory processing. All startle response values are expressed as a percentage of maximum observed response in the control group. Within each treatment group and drug condition, there were no significant correlations between body weight and any startle parameter and therefore, the variable body weight was not included as a factor in further analysis.</p>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>Habituation of Startle Responses and PPI</title>
<p>During the course of an experiment it is normal for ASR and PPI values to change due a process of habituation, which itself provides information on sensorimotor processing mechanisms. Habituation was tested by comparing the ASR and PPI values from the beginning and the end of the experiment in response to maximum startle stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167220.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Analysis using a 2-way mixed design ANOVA showed that in both groups, there was habituation, and that AMPH increased startle response (both p &lt; 0.0001). Dexamethasone treatment increased overall startle (p &lt; 0.001) but did not interact with habituation or AMPH (p &gt; 0.10). Therefore dexamethasone injections did not affect habituation of startle or the effects of amphetamine on startle habituation.</p>

</fig>
<p>We also examined the habituation of PPI of the startle reflex magnitude. PPI was not affected by habituation (p &gt; 0.10), and there were no interactions between habituation and any other main effects (p &gt; 0.10). A lack of habituation effects on PPI allowed the use of ANOVAs on averaged PPI across habituation blocks. Using pooled PPI there was a significant main effect of dexamethasone (p &lt; 0.05), and an interaction between dexamethasone group and AMPH treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Holm-Bonferroni corrected t-tests of selected comparisons revealed that AMPH injections decreased PPI in the CON group, relative to both the CON+VEH and the DEX+AMPH groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167220.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This indicates that the dexamethasone group PPI is unchanged by AMPH administration whilst the CON group PPI is reduced by AMPH.

The dexamethasone group had a reduced log Hillslope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167220.g002">Fig 2H</xref>, p &lt; 0.05); which indicates a reduced maximum velocity in the dynamic phase of the SIRM curve and reduced sensorimotor coupling.

There were no differences in any measures of sensorimotor gating (all p &gt; 0.05). Unlike the results in the habituation blocks, there was a non-significant change for R<sub>MAX</sub> PPI of AMPH selectively disruption of PPI in controls (DEX group and AMPH interaction, p = 0.0947).

<p>Middle latency auditory evoked potentials showed responses with three main components (example traces in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167220.s002">S2 File</xref>). There was a consistent positive peak occurring approximately 10 ms post-stimulus (P1), followed by a large negative peak (N1) at approximately 20 ms. There was an additional broad peak occurring approximately between 40–60 ms (P2) and another broad peak ~70–90 ms (P2/2). The negative component between P2 and P2/2 was often ill defined, and thus was not included in analysis. All measurements are peak-peak values, with the exception of P2/2, which is measured from the N1 peak value.</p>
<p>Middle latency responses were used to assess possible differences in habituation to auditory stimuli with different interstimulus intervals (ISIs).

<title>Auditory Steady-State Response</title>
<p>Trains of click stimuli were presented at 20 or 40 Hz, with a train duration of 0.5 s. Three measures were derived from the resulted waveforms. (1) Evoked trial power (ETP) which is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) power of the averaged traces. (2) Mean trial power (MTP) is the averaged FFT for each trace, resulting in a measurement of frequency power that is independent of the phase of the signal. (3) Phase locking factor (PLF), which is a measure of phase alignment of the signals between trials, independent of power. Each of these measures used a moving Hanning tapered FFT window, divided by the average value in the pre-stimulus period, and 20*log<sub>10</sub> constant applied. This is the most sensitive method for normalising signals within each animal group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>The grand means for each of these measurements are represented as heat-maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167220.s002">S2 File</xref>). In order to quantify the differences, averages of the responses are made over several time frames. In this case, averages of the response in 100 ms intervals at the frequency of the ASSR stimulus are shown. Because there was an approximately linear decay in PLF and ETP with time, linear regression was applied to these measures to determine if there was a difference in the rate of habituation or desynchrony (slope of the fit), or overall magnitude of the response (intercept) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167220.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study evaluated the association of neonatal HPA axis activation during development with neuropsychiatric phenotypes in the adult using neonatal exposure to the synthetic glucocorticoid GR agonist, dexamethasone. We found no association between neonatal dexamethasone exposure and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, rather in some cases phenotypic traits were found that were opposite of those observed in mental illness such as decreased amphetamine sensitivity and increased startle reflex responses. Our results suggest that GR activation in early life is not sufficient by itself to elicit a specific and robust psychiatric phenotype, but may produce long-term behavioural outcomes related to attention, stress, and amphetamine/dopamine sensitivity.</p>
<sec id="sec028">
<title>Phenotypes Associated with Neonatal Dexamethasone</title>
<p>Whilst we did not find any specific neuropsychiatric phenotypes with neonatal dexamethasone exposure, it appears that it leads to developmental programming effects on attention and stress. Previous research confirms some of our findings of no link between prenatal dexamethasone exposure and neuropsychiatric phenotypes such as normal or increased sensory gating, and normal latent inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref052">52</xref>]. Sensory gating, is the ability to subconsciously contextually filter stimuli, and is modulated by amphetamine sensitivity, usually in the context of dopamine function. Sensory gating is abnormal in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, with reported changes in startle reflex response and/or prepulse inhibition (PPI) for: anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref053">53</xref>], autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref054">54</xref>], bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref055">55</xref>], post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref057">57</xref>], and in schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref027">27</xref>]. Sensory gating in our rats using PPI revealed that our glucocorticoid exposed group have normal basal sensory gating and exaggerated startle reactivity. Similar neonatal dexamethasone studies have also found exaggerated startle response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref025">25</xref>]. These results indicate that neonatal dexamethasone treatment may result in hyper-vigilance or stress response, especially in high stress environments. Our exaggerated startle and normal PPI may be similar to what is found with patients with PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref057">57</xref>], in children with parent history of anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref058">58</xref>], and in specific contexts adults with anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref053">53</xref>]. A relationship between exaggerated startle and hypervigilance is supported by evidence showing anxiolytic drugs may decrease startle reactivity without altering PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>Whilst baseline PPI was normal with neonatal dexamethasone, our study indicates that neonatal exposure to dexamethasone in our animals resulted in reduced amphetamine sensitivity. Elevated dopamine levels induced by treatments including dexamphetamine reduces PPI in healthy humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref047">47</xref>] and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref060">60</xref>], yet dexamethasone-treated animals show no reduction in PPI with amphetamine administration. Because the effects of amphetamine on PPI are dependent on dopamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref062">62</xref>], our results suggest that dexamethasone-treated animals have reduced dopamine sensitivity as adults, rather than increased amphetamine and/or dopamine sensitivity observed in schizophrenia, bipolar, and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref064">64</xref>].</p>

<title>Neonatal Glucocorticoids and Dopamine</title>
<p>Changes in glucocorticoids activity following neonatal dexamethasone exposure may explain changes in dopamine sensitivity. Elevated glucocorticoid activity in our study is suggested by increased <italic>TSC22</italic> levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref065">65</xref>] and there is a large body of evidence linking glucocorticoids with dopamine. Glucocorticoids decrease locomotor sensitivity to amphetamine injected into the nucleus accumbens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref066">66</xref>], pre-treatment with dexamethasone decreases hyperlocomotion response to cocaine and amphetamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref068">68</xref>], and multiple dose regimens of dexamethasone in adult mice decrease locomotor sensitivity to dopaminergic agonists including dexamphetamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref068">68</xref>]. Therefore an increased baseline glucocorticoid activity in dexamethasone treated rats in our study would explain the reduced PPI sensitivity to dexamphetamine.</p>
<p>Changes in dopamine sensitivity may be due to changes in the striatum programmed by neonatal dexamethasone. The striatum is a locus of dopaminergic disruption of PPI but not startle magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref069">69</xref>], and its volume is reduced in rats treated with high levels of dexamethasone as pups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref042">42</xref>]. Whilst our results are consistent with changes in striatum dopamine, it is important to note that markedly different effects of glucocorticoids on the dopaminergic system are observed depending on dose level, timing and sex of the animals making unequivocal comparisons between studies difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref070">70</xref>].</p>
<p>More broadly speaking, prenatal stressors have been associated with changes in dopaminergic nuclei structure, innervation and dopamine release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref072">72</xref>] as well as a reduction in dopamine D2 receptor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref073">73</xref>]. Similarly other prenatal stress models show changes in dopamine sensitivity and receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref074">74</xref>].These changes occur in areas commonly associated with mental health, but are not consistent with a specific psychiatric phenotype. Therefore glucocorticoid exposure, and perinatal stress more generally, may not produce neuropsychiatric phenotypes, but may alter development in regions of the brain and in systems associated with mental health such as striatal dopamine.</p>

<title>Neonatal Dexamethasone and Brain Activity</title>

Changes in the left auditory cortex auditory-steady-state response (ASSR) were present, which is consistent with reports indicating that prenatal stress affects lateralization of dopamine cerebral function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref080">80</xref>]. ASSR lateralisation is diminished in schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref081">81</xref>] yet our changes do not represent schizophrenia-like traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref082">82</xref>] or any other clear neuropsychiatric phenotype to our knowledge. Changes with cortical activity have been reported with perinatal dexamethasone. Tapered neonatal dexamethasone in rats alters cortical spreading depression velocity (an evoked propagating wave) in mature animals, but not cortical potentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref083">83</xref>]. Whilst maternal exposure to dexamethasone in fetal sheep produces changes in EEG power bands lasting at least several days <italic>in utero</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref084">84</xref>], however it is unknown if these changes extend into adulthood, or for more than a few days. Therefore, perinatal glucocorticoids may have effects on brain function, but they do not appear to enduring changes specific to neuropsychiatric traits in electrophysiology measures of brain function.</p>

<title>Neonatal dexamethasone produces a phenotype of altered stress reactivity</title>
<p>Although neonatal dexamethasone exposure failed to generate marked neuropsychiatric phenotypes, it produced several other long-term changes in other measures of behaviour which may be interpreted mild changes in stress reactivity. In addition to changes to startle reflex described above, the rats treated with dexamethasone showed reduced neophobia, (Light-Dark box and open field outcomes), but with no indications increased exploration. However, studies using moderate doses of neonatal dexamethasone on PND7 or tapered doses have found reduced open field activity at maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref085">85</xref>], often considered a sign of increased stress or anxiety. Other studies from mice given tapered dexamethasone show no changes in total locomotion, but contrary to our results shows reduced open field centre time, and reduced in light region of a light-dark box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref052">52</xref>]. Whilst different dexamethasone dosages and age at assessment may explain differences with our study, neonatally treated rats show no sign of anxiety in low stress environments regardless of dexamethasone treatment regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref085">85</xref>]. Additionally, the effects of neonatal dexamethasone are somewhat dependent on neonatal handling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref086">86</xref>]. As such, the order and timing of our experiments may have affected our outcome as multiple tests may have caused lowered stress by generalised habituation to testing and handling. This may explain why some of our most robust results occur in the startle reflex testing indicating elevated vigilance or stress, which were performed in a high-stress environment at the beginning of our testing protocol when experimental habituation would be low.</p>
<p>Whilst our study did not directly measure HPA activation, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neonatal GR activation and stress result in long-term changes of the stress response, and alterations in the response to dopaminergic agents. Persistent upregulation of <italic>TSC22 (GILZ)</italic> in adult rats treated neonatally with dexamethasone suggests elevation of glucocorticoid activity. In addition to its role in immune activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref087">87</xref>], <italic>TSC22</italic> is a sensitive marker of glucocorticoid activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref065">65</xref>]. Previous studies showed that neonatal dexamethasone exposure results in normal basal corticosterone, but blunted responses to novel contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref088">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref089">89</xref>] and elevated response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref046">46</xref>]. Studies using neonatal dexamethasone generally show normal cognitive function such as in maze tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref042">42</xref>], with differences only observable under stressful conditions such as active avoidance tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref090">90</xref>] which may explain the broadly normal responses in our study. The exception to low stress environments in our study was the PPI experiment, which is also where the most obvious differences occurred.</p>
<p>One minor weakness in our study is the lack of a non-injected control group, as the injection procedure in newborn animals can itself be considered a stressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref002">2</xref>]. However, previous studies using low-dose dexamethasone PND3-6 have demonstrated no differences between vehicle and handled controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref085">85</xref>]. In addition our study cannot rule out the possibility of neonatal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation leading to neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Neonatal exposure to corticosterone leading to MR activation can result in context-specific changes in behaviour and learning that are dissociable from GR effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref091">91</xref>]. While dexamethasone is a GR specific agonist, its administration leads to a decrease in corticosterone release, and therefore a reduction in MR activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref092">92</xref>]. The phenotype of neonatal rats treated with MR agonists and antagonists would provide useful insight into the role of developmental stress in neuropsychiatric illness.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Perinatal dexamethasone exposure is particularly relevant to clinical applications, it is commonly used and trialled in various dosage regimes to promote lung and other organ system development in preterm infants, with varied neurodevelopmental outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref093">93</xref>]. We have demonstrated that neonatal glucocorticoids may produce enduring changes in stress reactivity and in dopamine release. However, a “one-hit” neonatal glucocorticoid model of neuropsychiatric illness may be inadequate. It is likely that complex environmental and genetic interactions are important in the development of neuropsychiatric traits.</p>
<p>Whilst prolonged GR activation like that used in our study revealed no specific neuropsychiatric phenotypes, there are indications in the literature that prenatal stress can produce neuropsychiatric phenotypes, but only with unpredictable stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref012">12</xref>]. In addition genotype-specific effects may be occurring in the general population. For example, dopamine receptor DRD4 genotype interacts with prenatal stress to predict aggressive behaviour and cortisol levels in young adults, whilst prenatal stress alone is not a predictor of behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0167220.ref094">94</xref>].</p>
<p>The growing evidence for the developmental programming effects on neonatal dexamethasone and glucocorticoid exposure highlights the need for future research to consider how genetic and environmental factors interact with early life stress to determine neuropsychiatric risks and phenotypes.</p>
