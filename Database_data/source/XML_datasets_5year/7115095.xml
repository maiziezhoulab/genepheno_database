<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par1">Activation of microglia and astrocytes, a prominent hallmark of both aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has been suggested to contribute to aging and AD progression, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="Par2">We performed RNA-seq analyses on microglia and astrocytes freshly isolated from wild-type and APP-PS1 (AD) mouse brains at five time points to elucidate their age-related gene-expression profiles.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par3">Our results showed that from 4 months onward, a set of age-related genes in microglia and astrocytes exhibited consistent upregulation or downregulation (termed “age-up”/“age-down” genes) relative to their expression at the young-adult stage (2 months). And most age-up genes were more highly expressed in AD mice at the same time points. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that the age-up genes in microglia were associated with the inflammatory response, whereas these genes in astrocytes included widely recognized AD risk genes, genes associated with synaptic transmission or elimination, and peptidase-inhibitor genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par4">Overall, our RNA-seq data provide a valuable resource for future investigations into the roles of microglia and astrocytes in aging- and amyloid-β-induced AD pathologies.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par17">Aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) produce widespread effects on the central nervous system (CNS) that are characterized by cognitive decline, vulnerability to physical illnesses, elevated oxidative stress, and chronic brain inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These biological and pathological processes are also associated with diminished blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, which leads to the accumulation in the brain of blood-derived proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the infiltration of peripheral cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and multiple lines of evidence indicate that the innate-immune functions of microglia and astrocytes are involved in these processes.</p>
<p id="Par18">Microglia, the resident macrophages in the CNS, are originally derived from primitive myeloid progenitors that are seeded in the brain during fetal development and expand drastically after birth to account for 5–12% of all the cells in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the CNS, microglia play crucial roles in the maintenance of brain homeostasis by regulating synaptic plasticity, remodeling neuronal circuits, defending against infectious pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and promoting tip-cell fusion to participate in angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In aging and in mice with AD, microglial activation in the brain acts a double-edged sword: Although activated microglia facilitate the phagocytosis and clearance of infectious agents or amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits, constant exposure to proinflammatory cytokines exerts detrimental effects on the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As compared to microglia, astrocytes, which constitute another type of glial cells in the CNS, have been less studied in aging and AD pathogenesis. Historically, astrocytes have been considered as supportive cells that either provide nitrites or serve as physical scaffolds for neurons. The perivascular endfeet of astrocytes ensheath 98% of brain parenchymal capillaries and thus contribute to BBB integrity and maintain osmotic homeostasis and gliovascular signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Astrocytes have to date been documented to play essential roles in neurophysiology, such as in release of gliotransmitters (glucose, ATP, and glutamate), communication with neurons, and modulation of synaptic structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par19">Over the few past decades, considerable research effort has been devoted toward elucidating the functions of microglia and astrocytes in the brain under both physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, in previous studies, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of microglia and astrocytes has been performed in geriatric and young mice to identify the transcriptomic alterations that occur during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; however, in these studies, the sequencing samples were collected either at limited time points or over large time intervals, and thus the genes that were identified to be altered in aged mice could have been affected by unknown/unexpected insults that are not related to aging or specific diseases. Therefore, to clarify the effects of factors associated with late-age disorders of the CNS, we investigated aging-related genes in microglia and astrocytes isolated from the mouse brain at 5 time points. Here, we identify 2 age-related gene clusters whose expression increased with age as compared with the expression in mature-adult mice. Differential gene-expression analysis revealed that inflammatory-response genes constituted the most prominent class of consistently upregulated genes in microglia upon aging, whereas in astrocytes, synaptic-transmission/elimination- and peptidase-inhibitor-related genes were most markedly increased. Furthermore, most of the aging-related genes also showed notable differences in AD mice relative to their expression in wild-type (WT) mice. Our results thus provide a novel transcriptomic dataset for microglia and astrocytes throughout aging that could offer new insights into the body’s early intrinsic mechanisms involved in sensing CNS damage and protecting the brain against neurodegeneration.</p>

<sec id="Sec3">
<title>Mice</title>
<p id="Par20">APPswe/PS1ΔE9 double-transgenic mice, obtained from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China), were originated from B6.Cg-Tg (APPswe/PS1ΔE9) 85Dbo/Mmjax mice (JAX#034832) of the Jackson Laboratory. C57BL/6 J WT littermates were used as WT controls. Mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3/group) were bred under SPF conditions in IVC cages at 23 °C and 50–60% humidity and with circadian-rhythm illumination. Pups aged 21–28 days old were removed from their parental cages and genotyped using ear-biopsy samples; the DNA extracted from the biopsy samples was PCR-amplified using primers specific for APP and PS1 sequences. All procedures were approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of Shenzhen Peking University - The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Medical Center (SPHMC) (protocol number 2011-004). All mice used in the study were males. Efforts were made to minimize suffering and the number of animals used.</p>

<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Brain dissociation</title>
<p id="Par21">Microglia and astrocytes were isolated from WT and AD mice belonging to 5 age groups: 2-, 4-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month old (2–12 months). Mice were transcardially perfused under deep anesthesia with 1 × PBS, and then the brain was removed, dissected, and rinsed in HBSS. Next, after removing the meninges, the brain was cut into small pieces by using a sterile scalpel, and the samples were centrifuged at 300×<italic>g</italic> for 2 min at room temperature and the supernatant was aspirated carefully. Samples from a single brain were pooled as a single experimental group. Enzymatic cell dissociation was performed using an Adult Brain Dissociation Kit (130-107-677, Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tissue pieces (up to 500 mg of tissue per sample) were transferred into the C Tube containing 1950 μL of enzyme mix 1 (enzyme P and buffer Z), and then 30 μL of enzyme mix 2 (enzyme A and buffer Y) was added into the C Tube. The C Tube was tightly closed and attached upside down onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters (130-096-427, Miltenyi Biotec), and the appropriate gentleMACS program was run. After brief centrifugation to collect samples at the tube bottom, the samples were filtered through a 70-μm strainer (130-098-462, Miltenyi Biotec), washed with D-PBS, and then centrifuged again.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Percoll density gradient and myelin removal</title>
<p id="Par22">Singe cells were resuspended in 40% Percoll and centrifuged at 800×<italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 15 °C. After discarding the myelin-containing supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in cold MACS buffer (containing 1-volume dilution of PBS, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.5% BSA, pH 7.2), and then myelin-removal beads (Myelin Removal Beads II, 130-96-733, Miltenyi Biotec) were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol to prepare cells for staining with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) antibodies. Briefly, single-cell suspensions were incubated with the beads at 4 °C for 15 min, and then the cells were washed onto the LS column on the autoMACS Separator; the column was washed thrice with PB buffer, and the cells in the flow-through were used for antibody staining.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">
<title>FACS sorting of microglia and astrocytes</title>
<p id="Par23">After isolation, cell pellets were resuspended in FC receptor blocking solution (553141, BD Biosciences), incubated on ice for 10 min, and costained for 30 min on ice in the dark with PE-Cy7-labeled CD45 (103114, BioLegend), PE-labeled CD11b (101208, BioLegend), and APC-labeled ACSA2 (130-117-386, Miltenyi Biotec). The cells were then rinsed in PBS, centrifuged, resuspended in FACS buffer (1% FBS + 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES, 1:500 RNA inhibitor in PBS), and incubated in 7AAD (420403, BioLegend) for 10 min before sorting. Data were analyzed using the BD FACS Diva v8.0.1 software. Sorted cells were centrifuged at 400×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min and pellets were lysed in RLT-buffer (74004, Qiagen) for RNA extraction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec7">
<title>RNA extraction, quantification, and qualification</title>
<p id="Par24">RNA was isolated from flow-cytometry-sorted cell populations by using an RNeasy Micro Kit (74004, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, which included a step involving incubation with DNase. For whole-brain RNA purification, we generated 1 brain/pool samples. Purified RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific) and Agilent Technologies Bioanalyzer 2100 RNA Pico chips (5067-1513, Agilent Technologies), according to manufacturer instructions; the RNA integrity number (RIN) in all cases was &gt; 9.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec8">
<title>Preparation of smart-seq2 RNA-seq libraries and sequencing</title>
<p id="Par25">For RNA sample preparations, 10 ng of RNA per sample was used as the input material. Libraries were generated using a SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (634892, Takara Bio USA, Mountain View, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s recommendations, and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Briefly, first-strand cDNA synthesis from total RNA was primed using 3′ SMART-Seq CDS Primer II A, and SMART-Seq v4 Oligonucleotide was used for template switching at the 5′ end of the transcript. PCR Primer II A was used to amplify cDNA, for 8 cycles, from the SMART sequences introduced by 3′ SMART-Seq CDS Primer II A and the SMART-Seq v4 Oligonucleotide. LD-PCR-amplified cDNA was purified through immobilization on AMPure XP beads and then quantified using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. To prepare cDNA libraries suitable for Illumina sequencing, ~ 200 pg of the cDNA was used with a Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, Cat. Nos. FC-131-1024 and FC-131-1096, San Diego, CA, USA). Tagmented fragments were amplified for 12 cycles and dual indexes were added to each well to uniquely label each library. Concentrations were assessed using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KK4844, KAPA, Biosystems, USA), and samples were diluted to ~ 2 nm and pooled. Pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq platform and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec9">
<title>RNAscope and image quantification</title>
<p id="Par26">Mice were deeply anesthetized using pentobarbital, transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS until the irrigation fluid was completely clear, and then perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min. Brains were removed, fixed in 4% PFA in 4 °C refrigerator for 12 h, dehydrated using an ethanol dilution series, embedded in molds containing Tissue-Tek OCT, and frozen in dry ice. The OCT-embedded brain samples were cut into 16-μm coronary sections that were placed onto Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 12-550-15). RNAscope experiments were performed using a Manual Fluorescent Multiplex kit v2 (323100, ACDbio), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, slices were incubated with hydrogen peroxide and then target retrieval was performed in a boiling bath beaker. Next, protease digestion was performed for 20 min at room temperature by using Protease III for fixed frozen tissues, provided in the kit, after which probe hybridization was conducted for 2 h at 40 °C. A dual-probe set containing Mm-Itgam-c3 (311491) and Mm-Slc1a3-c3 (430781) served as the common probe in each set, and the companion probes were Mm-Cxcl10-c1 (408921) and Mm-Ptbp1-c1 (588721). Nuclei were visualized using 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).</p>
<p id="Par27">For each mouse, 3 images per region (technical replicates) were used for the quantification, and 100, 50, and 50 cells were counted in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, respectively. Images were captured as Z-stacks by using a 20 × objective (NA 0.8) and then maximum-intensity projections were obtained. Lipofuscin autofluorescence was imaged in the blank channel (488 nm) and subtracted from the red channel (594 nm) and far-red channel (647 nm) images. Microglia and astrocytes were identified as RNAscope puncta generated from the Itgam and Slc1a3 probes. Lastly, a blind counting was performed to analyze the number of double-positive cells and the target-probe dots per cell, with each data point representing the mean ± SD of 3 brain slices for each probe set. Then H-score was calculated as follows: H-score <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

<sec id="Sec10">
<title>Quantitative RT-PCR validation of selected genes</title>
<p id="Par28">Flow-cytometry-sorted microglia and astrocytes were used for RNA extraction (see preceding sections on FACS and RNA extraction). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in triplicate in 96-well plates by using a qPCR machine (LC480, Roche) and SYBR Green I Master mixture (4887352001, Roche) for detection of amplification products. The following thermocycling protocol was used: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min, and a final cycle at 25 °C for 15 s. Relative quantification of mRNA expression was performed using the comparative cycle method to obtain the following ratio: gene of interest/<italic>Gapdh</italic>. Relative quantification of gene-expression levels was performed using the 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method. All primers were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST; we designed primers to be ~ 200-bp long. All primers are listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>.</p>

<title>STEM (Short Time-series Expression Miner) analyses</title>
<p id="Par29">The Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) is a Java program for clustering, comparing, and visualizing short time series gene expression data from microarray experiments (~ 8 time points or fewer). STEM allows researchers to identify significant temporal expression profiles and the genes associated with these profiles and to compare the behavior of these genes across multiple conditions. The output gene expression value is normalized according to the first time point, usually by subtracting the gene expression value at the first time point, allowing different genes to be visualized at the same starting point. STEM is available for download for free to academic and non-profit users at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jernst/stem">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jernst/stem</ext-link>.</p>

In this step, clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing adapter sequences, poly-N-containing reads, and low-quality reads from the raw data. Concurrently, Q20, Q30, and GC content of the clean data were calculated. All the downstream analyses were based on the high-quality clean data.</p>

<title>Quantification of gene-expression level</title>
<p id="Par33">Feature Counts v1.5.0-p3 was used to determine the number of reads mapped to each gene, after which each gene’s FPKM (the expected number of fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per million base pairs sequenced) was calculated based on the length of the gene and the number of reads mapped to the gene. FPKM calculation concurrently considers the effect of sequencing depth and the gene length for the read counts, and is currently the most commonly used method for estimating gene-expression levels.</p>

<title>Purification of microglia and astrocytes and RNA-seq profiling</title>
<p id="Par36">To investigate whether microglial and astrocyte genes in mice are altered throughout aging, we performed RNA-seq at 5 time points encompassing the mature-adult stage (2 months), when developmental changes in gene expression have ceased, and the middle-age stage (4 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months), during which age-dependent pathology develops (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>a). Microglia were sorted based on CD45<sup>Low-to-Intermediate</sup>/CD11b expression and astrocytes were sorted based on ACSA2 expression after exclusion of doublets and Live/Dead analysis by using BDAriaIII. Single staining and isotype-control antibodies were included as controls (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref> A-B). The percentage of microglia and astrocytes at different time points was shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>. No significant difference was found for the percentage of the microglia and astrocytes overtime, indicating that that aging or AD has less effect on the cell composition.

<p id="Par37">We used RNA-seq to assess mRNA purity and quantity. For each time point, microglia and astrocytes were isolated from whole-brain samples, with 3 replicates being included. Furthermore, we sequenced WT/AD whole-brain input samples (2 mice each) to verify the enrichment of microglia and astrocytes, and we developed a transcriptome list of well-known cell-type-specific genes for microglia (e.g., <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>, <italic>P2ry12</italic>, <italic>Tmem119</italic>, <italic>Aif1</italic>, <italic>Olfml3</italic>, <italic>Ccl3</italic>, <italic>Itgam</italic>), astrocytes (e.g., <italic>Aldh1l1</italic>, <italic>Atp1b2</italic>, <italic>Aqp4</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Slc4a4</italic>, <italic>Mlc1</italic>), neurons (e.g., <italic>Stmn2</italic>, <italic>Rbfox3</italic>, <italic>Syt1</italic>, <italic>Syn1</italic>), endothelial cells (Endo) (e.g., <italic>Pecam1</italic>, <italic>Tie1</italic>), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) (e.g., <italic>Pdgfra</italic>, <italic>Cspg4</italic>), and oligodendrocytes (Oligo) (e.g., <italic>Nfasc</italic>, <italic>Kndc1</italic>). Markers specific for microglia were expressed at high levels only in microglia and were undetectable or expressed at extremely low levels in the remaining cell types (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>b). Despite the high degree of enrichment of astrocyte-specific genes in the majority of samples, we found a small increase in certain neuronal, endothelial, and oligodendrocyte gene contaminants in our astrocyte RNA-seq samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>c). As reported previously, oligodendrocyte markers were detectable as low-level contaminants in adult ACSA2+ astrocytes. These results highlight the importance of validation.</p>
<p id="Par38">Next, we performed DESeq2 analysis on microglia and astrocytes, which revealed that both cell types showed a gradual increase in the number of age-associated DEGs (40 and 59 genes in 2-month AD microglia and astrocytes as compared to 2-month WT) (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>A-B). Therefore, we used 2-month WT mice as our mature-adult control for the follow-up analysis, in which DESeq2 R package was used to analysis polyA-selected mRNAs from microglia and astrocytes isolated from whole-brain samples, and we mapped &gt; 85% of the reads in the case of all samples. The reproducibility between replicates was high (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>A), and the results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear separation of expression between the different time points (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>B).</p>

<p id="Par40">In this study, we hypothesized that age-dependent pathogenic or protective genes could be expressed at consistently higher or lower levels throughout the different time points of mice as compared with the expression in the 2-month control. Therefore, we constructed a Venn diagram of the genes consistently upregulated in aging microglia (4 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months, relative to 2-month control), and from this we identified 48 genes (termed “age-up” microglial genes) (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">8</xref> shows the gene list with fold change and <italic>p</italic> values), which included a cassette of genes involved in the cytokine pathway. <italic>Cxcl10</italic> was upregulated 3-, 1.9-, 3.5-, and 3-fold in 4-month, 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month microglia relative to the expression in 2-month microglia.

<p id="Par41">We next applied the aforementioned filtering criteria to identify genes that are downregulated in microglia. Fewer genes were downregulated than those upregulated in microglia, and considerably more genes were differentially expressed in 6-month microglia (3381 genes) than those in 4-month, 9-month, and 12-month microglia (271, 320, and 582 genes, respectively) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>c).

<title>Association of age-altered genes in AD transcriptomes</title>
<p id="Par50">AD is a heterogeneous disease in which multiple detrimental factors contribute to cognitive loss and disease escalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To determine the aging transcriptomes in AD, we analyzed the expression of age-altered genes at 5 different time points in WT and AD mice. We found that most age-up genes were highly expressed in AD mice as compared to WT mice at the same time points. In contrast, age-down genes were highly expressed in WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>). Then we compared the expression of age-altered genes in microglia or astrocytes isolated from 12-month WT vs. 12-month AD mice. We found that among the 28 age-up genes in microglia from 12-month AD mice, 13 showed a significant increase (adjusted <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, |log<sub>2</sub> fold-change| &gt; 0.5) relative to the age-matched control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>a), whereas 4 of the 28 genes were downregulated. Among the age-down microglial genes, 7 genes were significantly downregulated in AD mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>b). We also analyzed age-related astrocyte genes in AD progression, and we found that 33 age-up genes were strongly upregulated and 53 age-down genes were markedly downregulated in 12-month AD mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>c, d). As shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM18">18</xref>, we identified several cross-changed genes between the DEGs (genes are altered in both aging and Alzheimer’s disease) and the DEGs (genes are altered in different AD groups compared with 2-month AD controls).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par53">The results of this study indicate that microglia exhibit an increase in responsiveness to inflammation stimuli with age, which is reflected by the consistently elevated expression of inflammatory-response genes, whereas astrocytes appear to function as “preservers” of inflammation, which is reflected by the upregulation of peptidase-inhibitor genes upon aging. In this study, we tried our best to reduce the artificial effect of the dissociation process. Although there are three biological replicates at each time point, individual differences still cannot be ignored. In this study, we have not found a significant difference of the percentage of microglia and astrocytes overtime.</p>
<p id="Par54">Transcriptome differences between microglia and astrocytes during aging have been addressed in a few previous studies. Aged astrocytes (2 years old) were shown to upregulate genes involved in synapse elimination but to minimally alter the expression of homeostasis-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and 2-year-old astrocytes were also reported to adopt the reactive phenotype of neuroinflammatory A1-like reactive astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Our astrocyte gene-expression dataset agrees with the findings of the previous studies, because we also detected a significant decrease in <italic>Thbs1</italic>, an increase in <italic>Thbs2</italic>, <italic>C4b</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, and reactive-astrocyte genes (<italic>Osmr</italic>, <italic>Serpina3n</italic>), and no change in homeostasis genes (<italic>Aldh1l1</italic>, <italic>Aqp4</italic>) in our 12-month astrocyte samples relative to the expression in 2-month astrocytes. Similarly, the DEGs identified between our 12- and 2-month microglial samples broadly agreed with previous RNA-seq profiles of microglia from the aged brain (24 months). Age-up genes in astrocytes, <italic>C4b,</italic> involved in synapse elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]; <italic>Snca</italic> and <italic>Sncg</italic>, 2 genes related to Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] that also play several roles in synaptic activity, such as regulation of synaptic-vesicle trafficking and subsequent neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], suggesting that astrocytes play a critical role in synapse elimination and synaptic transmission. <italic>Spock3</italic> and <italic>Timp4</italic>, encode proteins that participate in inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and the other genes encode proteins that inhibit lipoteichoic acid-induced NF-κB, MAP kinase, and Akt activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and decrease the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Pcsk1n, an inhibitor of prohormone convertase 1 that regulates the proteolytic cleavage of neuroendocrine peptide precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Cst3, can function as a protective factor in the AD brain, and its mechanisms of action include inhibition of cysteine proteases, induction of autophagy, induction of cell division, and inhibition of Aβ oligomerization and amyloid-fibril formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Cst3 is known to be enriched in adult astrocytes throughout the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], but the role of Cst3 in astrocytes during aging has remained obscure. Inhibition of proteolysis has been shown to protect neurons against ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], which suggests that astrocytes might protect neurons by commonly upregulating the expression of the aforementioned glial-cell-derived endogenous protease inhibitor. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] have reported that when the blood-brain barrier is destroyed, peripheral leukocytes are able to transit the astrocytic TJ barrier in inflammatory lesions and enter the CNS, secrete serine proteases and MMPs to cleave astrocytic CLDN4. Our results suggest that in normal aging, increased production of serine proteases inhibiter/MMPs inhibiter and decreased production of MMPs might control neuroinflammation and prevent the invasion of peripheral pathogens.</p>
<p id="Par55">Although we minimize ex vivo activation during the isolation procedure, there may still be some unknown activation when sorting cells from the brain. Evidence has been presented supporting the notion that the inflammatory responses of both astrocytes and microglia peak during the beginning of symptomatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Therefore, we focused here on the genes that start to change at an early stage and show sustained alteration throughout aging. Unexpectedly, we found sustained upregulated or downregulated expression in microglia throughout life of several inflammation-related genes. Ccl2 is a key mediator of spinal microglial activation, and blocking spinal Ccl2 alleviates heat hyperalgesia and augments glutamatergic transmission in substantia gelatinosa neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], reduces immunosuppression, and augments vaccine immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Ccl12 also plays a pivotal role during the early stages of allergic lung inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. These findings suggest that some of the predisposing or inflammatory factors associated with diseases might be related to the consistently elevated expression of Ccl2/Ccl12 in microglia, and blocking this might alleviate and minimize disease progression. Egr2, which has been proposed as a newly identified M2 (alternatively activated) marker for macrophages, is associated with the ability of these cells to respond to inflammatory stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], was included among the age-up microglial genes. Intriguingly, we found an increase in Nr1d2 (also known as REV-ERBβ), which acts as a nodal output of the circadian clock and thus links cellular circadian timers with innate-immune responses and thereby modulates the production and release of the proinflammatory cytokines Ccl2 and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. <italic>Nr1d2</italic> was increased 1.6–2-fold and <italic>Il6</italic> was increased 2.2–3-fold among age-up microglial genes, which suggests that Nr1d2 upregulation might stabilize the diurnal variation in Ccl2 and IL-6 levels and immune function caused by aging. Other age-up microglial genes involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes included <italic>Zfp36</italic> (anti-inflammatory signaling), <italic>Nfkbia</italic> (negative regulation of NFεB transcription factor activity), <italic>H2-Q1</italic> (MHC I protein-complex member), and <italic>Ccrl12</italic>. Taken together, these data support an active role for microglia in inflammation response throughout aging. We further found that neuropsin (Klk8), an extracellular matrix serine protease that induces neurite outgrowth and regulates Schaffer-collateral long-term potentiation (LTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], was also significantly increased throughout aging, which suggests that microglia could play a notable role in the establishment of LTP and synaptic plasticity. Over time, altered genes involvement in angiogenesis to subsequent innate immune inflammatory responses, indicates roles of microglia in neuroinflammatory responses during aging.</p>
<p id="Par56">We compared aging microglia heterogeneity between mice and humans by performing comparisons of our mouse age-related microglial datasets with two previous human microglial aging profile s[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Limited overlap was observed in microglial genes regulated during aging between mice and humans, indicating that human and mouse microglia age differently. In addition to doing the analysis relative to the earliest time point (2 months), we also used STEM analysis to cluster gene sets that showed similar trends in a certain pattern. The GO analysis showed that different pathways were involved in different categories such as mitochondrion organization, cellular respiration, or mRNA metabolic process, indicating that different genes and signaling pathways may play certain roles at different stages.</p>
<p id="Par57">At the early stage (2 months), the number of differentially expressed genes between WT and AD was negligible, and showed a gradual increase with age. When we compared the age-up related genes in WT/AD at the same time points, we found that most age-up genes were highly expressed in AD mice as compared to WT mice. This suggests that age genetic changes in the AD process occur earlier than aging. And the change may also involve in the development of AD. In the later stages of aging, the internal environment of the CNS shows increased complexity, and this might involve the actions of peripheral factors together with BBB dysfunction. Imaging analyses have revealed that the BBB is localized at the level of tight junctions between brain endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Aging and AD are both associated with diminished BBB integrity and an opening for T cell transendothelial migration into the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. In the parenchyma, bidirectional crosstalk occurs between the infiltrating cells and the resident glial cells; activated microglia impair BBB function by releasing several inflammatory modulators and thus lead to hyperpermeability; and the resulting T cell infiltration, in turn, favors increased microglial activation by secreting proinflammatory cytokines or acting in a protective manner toward senescent microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Notably, transient early depletion of regulatory T cells was shown to reduce the recruitment of microglia toward amyloid deposits and alter the disease-related gene-expression profile in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par58">In summary, our study on microglia and astrocytes throughout aging provides new insights into the gene-expression profiles of these 2 types of glial cells and into the age-related changes in the transcriptome in relation to normal aging. Some of the genes identified here to be altered might represent targets for the treatment of the cognitive decline that occurs in diseases associated with aging.</p>
