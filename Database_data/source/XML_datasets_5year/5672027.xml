<abstract>
<p>The neuroligin (Nlg) family of neural cell adhesion molecules is thought to be required for synapse formation and development and has been linked to the development of autism spectrum disorders in humans. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, mutations in the <italic>neuroligin 1–3</italic> genes have been reported to induce synapse developmental defects at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), but the role of <italic>neuroligin 4</italic> (<italic>dnlg4</italic>) in synapse development has not been determined. Here, we report that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroligin 4 (DNlg4) is different from DNlg1–3 in that it presynaptically regulates NMJ synapse development. Loss of <italic>dnlg4</italic> results in reduced growth of NMJs with fewer synaptic boutons. The morphological defects caused by <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutant are associated with a corresponding decrease in synaptic transmission efficacy. All of these defects could only be rescued when DNlg4 was expressed in the presynapse of NMJs. To understand the basis of DNlg4 function, we looked for genetic interactions and found connections with the components of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. Immunostaining and Western blot analyses demonstrated that the regulation of NMJ growth by DNlg4 was due to the positive modulation of BMP signaling by DNlg4. Specifically, BMP type I receptor thickvein (Tkv) abundance was reduced in <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants, and immunoprecipitation assays showed that DNlg4 and Tkv physically interacted <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our study demonstrates that DNlg4 presynaptically regulates neuromuscular synaptic growth via the BMP signaling pathway by modulating Tkv.</p>

<body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation, development, and plasticity of synapses are critical for the construction of neural circuits, and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1"><sup>2</sup></xref> is an ideal model system to dissect these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the past few decades, several subcellular events and signaling pathways have been reported to be involved in regulating synaptic growth at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs, such as local actin assembly, endocytosis, ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, the wingless pathway, and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Among these, BMP signaling is thought to be a major retrograde pathway that promotes the synaptic growth of NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>At the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ, the BMP homolog glass bottom boat (Gbb) is released by muscle cells and binds to the presynaptic type II BMP receptor wishful thinking (Wit). Wit is a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase and, upon binding to Gbb, forms a complex with the type I BMP receptor thickvein (Tkv) or saxophone (Sax), which results in their activation by phosphorylation. The activated type I receptor subsequently phosphorylates the downstream R-Smad protein mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad). Phosphorylated Mad (pMad) then binds to the co-Smad medea (Med). This complex translocates to the nucleus of motoneurons to activate or repress the transcription of target genes required for NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Mutation of any component in the BMP signaling pathway results in a striking deficiency of NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In addition, many molecules are reported to affect NMJ growth by negatively regulating BMP signaling at different points in the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Here, we report that <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroligin 4 (DNlg4), a trans-synaptic adhesion protein, acts as a positive regulator of BMP signaling to regulate NMJ growth.</p><p>Neuroligins (Nlgs) were initially reported to be the postsynaptic ligands of the presynaptic adhesion proteins neurexins (Nrxs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and loss of function of Nlgs in humans is thought to be associated with several mental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Nlgs are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins encoded by four independent genes in rodents and five independent genes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Nlgs have been reported to induce synapse assembly by co-cultured neurons when expressed in nonneuronal cells, and overexpression of Nlgs in neurons increases synapse density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). These <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture studies suggest a role of Nlgs in inducing the formation of synaptic contacts. However, an <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed, despite severe defects in synaptic transmission, that there was no alteration of synapse number in neurons from <italic>nlg1–3</italic> triple knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Similarly, loss of Nlg1 specifically in the hippocampus or amygdala did not alter the synapse number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), suggesting that the role of Nlgs is not to trigger the initial synapse formation. Rather, it is more likely that upon binding to Nrx, Nlg functions in maturation of nascent synapses, including differentiation and stabilization by recruiting scaffolding proteins, postsynaptic receptors, and signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, four Nlgs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Mutations in <italic>dnlg1–3</italic> result in defective synapse differentiation that is primarily characterized by abnormal protein levels or the ectopic postsynaptic localization of glutamate receptors in larval NMJs. In addition, loss of DNlg1–3 separately leads to impairment in NMJ synapse development, as indicated by abnormal synaptic bouton number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), but the precise underlying mechanism is poorly understood. A recent study showed that flies with a <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutation exhibit an autism-related phenotype of behavioral inflexibility, as indicated by impaired reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). DNlg4 also regulates sleep by recruiting the GABA receptor to clock neurons and thus modulating GABA transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), which suggests a role of DNlg4 in synapse differentiation. However, potential molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral defects caused by <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutation and the role of DNlg4 in synapse development have not been reported.</p><p>Here, we reported the generation of an independent null allele of <italic>dnlg4</italic> and characterized the role of DNlg4 in neuromuscular synaptic growth. We showed that loss of DNlg4 led to impaired NMJ synapse growth, as indicated by decreased synaptic bouton numbers and increased bouton size. Presynaptic knockdown of DNlg4 mimicked these phenotypes. These morphological abnormalities in <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants led to corresponding impairment in synaptic transmission efficacy. Unexpectedly, all of these defects were only rescued when DNlg4 was expressed in presynaptic, instead of postsynaptic, areas of NMJs. We next found that DNlg4 genetically interacted with components of the BMP pathway and that the presynaptic BMP signaling at NMJs was decreased in <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants. We further observed a reduction of the BMP type I receptor Tkv in <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants and demonstrated that DNlg4 physically interacted with Tkv <italic>in vivo</italic>. Altogether, our study revealed that DNlg4 regulated neuromuscular synaptic growth by positively modulating BMP signaling though Tkv.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>DNlg4 is predominantly expressed in central neurons and is concentrated at glutamatergic NMJs</title><p>The <italic>dnlg4</italic> (CG34139) gene is located on the right arm of the third chromosome at cytological position 92D5-8 and contains 16 exons and 15 introns. It encodes a protein of 1281 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 140 kDa. The DNlg4 protein is predicted to have three typical distinct regions similar to the typical structure of mammalian Nlgs: an extracellular region containing an N-terminal signal peptide and an inactive acetylcholinesterase-like domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region with a PDZ-binding motif.</p><p>To determine the expression pattern of endogenous DNlg4, we first performed embryonic immunostaining in WT flies with an antibody against the C terminus of DNlg4. DNlg4 was predominantly restricted to the brain and the ventral nerve cord (VNC) at embryonic stages 14–16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>A</italic>′). In third-instar larvae, DNlg4 accumulated in the brain and VNC, as indicated by co-staining with antibodies against DNlg4 and Bruchpilot (BRP) (a presynaptic active zone marker molecule), and it was especially concentrated at the neuropil, where the synapses of neurons aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>B–B</italic>″). We next sought to determine the distribution of DNlg4 at NMJs by immunostaining the larval body wall muscle with antibodies against DNlg4 and discs large (DLG) (a postsynaptic scaffolding protein and marker of type I boutons). However, we were unable to detect any immunoreactivity for endogenous DNlg4 at NMJs, perhaps because the protein level was too low to be detected or because the affinity of our antibody was not sensitive enough. We therefore overexpressed the full-length <italic>dnlg4</italic> cDNA in a WT background using the muscle-specific Mhc-Gal4 driver and the pan-neuronal Elav-Gal4 driver. In the lines in which DNlg4 was overexpressed in muscles, DNlg4 immunoreactivity accumulated at NMJs, but with a non-uniform distribution at distinct type I synaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>C–C</italic>″). In contrast, the exogenous DNlg4 that was overexpressed in neurons exhibited a uniform distribution in type I boutons of NMJs, indicating that DNlg4 expressed in the neurons could be transferred to NMJs and could concentrate at synaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>D–D</italic>″). This result suggested that DNlg4 was localized at the presynapses of NMJs. In most cases, presynaptic molecules in neurons tend to localize to presynaptic areas when they are overexpressed. We observed good presynaptic distribution of synaptotagmin (SYT; tagged by GFP), a well-known presynaptic molecule, at NMJs when it was overexpressed in motoneurons by a motoneuron-specific OK6-Gal4 driver. We also observed a presynaptic distribution of DNlg4-GFP at NMJs when we expressed a UAS-<italic>dnlg4</italic>-gfp cDNA using the Gal4 driver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.810242/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1, <italic>A–B</italic>′</ext-link>). However, when we overexpressed the postsynaptic molecule Dscam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) (tagged by GFP) using this driver, only a very low Dscam signal could be detected at presynaptic boutons of NMJs, and most accumulated at the axons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.810242/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1, <italic>C–C</italic>″</ext-link>). These results suggested that the overexpressed DNlg4 at presynaptic boutons of NMJs was not an ectopic distribution caused by protein overexpression. More likely, DNlg4 was localized in the synaptic boutons of NMJs as a presynaptic molecule. Based on the above results, DNlg4 may exist in both the presynapse and postsynapse of NMJs. To further confirm the distribution of DNlg4 in synapses of NMJs, we generated a DNlg4-Gal4 line by inserting an ∼6-kb genomic sequence flanking the transcription start site of the <italic>dnlg4</italic> gene (which included the core promoter regions of the <italic>dnlg4</italic> gene) into the pPT-Gal4 vector and used it to drive UAS-<italic>dnlg4</italic> or UAS-<italic>dnlg4</italic>-gfp to mimic the expression of endogenous DNlg4. The DNlg4-GFP that was expressed by the DNlg4-Gal4 driver displayed an expression pattern similar to that of endogenous DNlg4 in larval brain, distributing in brain and VNC regions and concentrating in neuropils (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.810242/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2<italic>A</italic></ext-link>). In the peripheral nervous system, overexpressed DNlg4 distributed in synaptic boutons of NMJs. High-magnification confocal images showed that the DNlg4 and DLG were located at different regions of the bouton. Major DNlg4 signals were surrounded by DLG, and only a few DNlg4 signals overlapped with DLG in their interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>E–E</italic>″). This result suggested that DNlg4 predominantly localized in presynaptic areas of boutons at NMJs. Overall, these results indicated that DNlg4 was predominantly expressed in the central neurons and was concentrated in presynaptic boutons of NMJs. However, postsynaptic localization of DNlg4 at NMJs could not be excluded.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DNlg4 is predominantly expressed in central neurons and concentrated at glutamatergic NMJs.</bold>

In brief, homologous recombination between the endogenous <italic>dnlg4</italic> locus and a donor DNA consisting of a mini-white marker gene flanked by 3.0- and 3.3-kb genomic sequences resulted in a 3.8-kb fragment of <italic>dnlg4</italic> genomic DNA (including the first to fifth exons of the <italic>dnlg4</italic> gene) being replaced with the mini-white transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). Using a PCR screen, we obtained two <italic>dnlg4</italic> KO lines, <italic>dnlg4<sup>KO7</sup></italic> and <italic>dnlg4<sup>KO10</sup></italic>, which were homozygous viable and fertile with no detectable abnormalities in body size or morphology. To verify that both knock-out lines were <italic>dnlg4</italic>-null mutants, we first performed an RT-PCR assay with <italic>dnlg4</italic> primers to examine the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mRNA in WT and the two mutant lines. The mRNA of <italic>dnlg4</italic> could be detected in the WT line, but it was undetectable in both knock-out lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). We further carried out Western blot analyses with larval brain extracts from the WT line, two mutant lines, and a DNlg4-overexpressing line driven by the Elav-Gal4 driver, using the anti-DNlg4 antibody.

We co-labeled the NMJs with an anti-HRP antibody, which labeled the neuronal membranes, and an anti-DLG antibody, which labeled type I boutons, and carried out an overall morphological analysis for type Ib synaptic boutons of NMJs in muscle 4 (NMJ4) of abdominal segment 2/3. Compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>), the overall morphology of NMJs in <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants appeared normal with a stereotypical “beads-on-a-chain” pattern.

To eliminate the possibility that these phenotypes were caused by a background mutation on the third chromosome, we also examined the NMJ morphology of <italic>dnlg4</italic> hemizygous mutants <italic>dnlg4</italic>/Df(3R)ED6027 and found that they also exhibited identical morphological defects at NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic>). The phenotype of this synaptic undergrowth was highly penetrant, and we also observed similar morphological defects of NMJs in muscle 6/7 (NMJ6/7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>D</italic>′–<italic>F</italic>′ and <italic>H</italic>).</p><p>In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have indicated that Nrxs/Nlgs are required to trigger synaptic differentiation by recruiting presynaptic vesicles and postsynaptic scaffolding proteins and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). We therefore assessed whether loss of <italic>dnlg4</italic> induced impaired synaptic differentiation.

A striking defect in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants appeared in the active zone structure: the presynaptic membrane within the active zone was detached from the opposite postsynaptic membrane at several points and displayed invaginations or ruffles, and the typical electron density of presynaptic membranes and the synaptic cleft in these sites were lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>I</italic>′, <italic>J</italic>′, and <italic>K</italic>).

To further verify which domain in DNlg4 protein interacted with Tkv, we expressed two fused proteins, including a DNlg4 N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–675, containing the acetylcholinesterase-like domain) fused with a His tag and a C-terminal fragment (amino acids 848–1281) fused with a GST tag in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 cells. We used these two fused proteins to precipitate Tkv-GFP from the adult head homogenates that were from <italic>tkv-gfp</italic> overexpressing flies and driven by the Elav-Gal4 driver. The Tkv-GFP could be precipitated with the N-terminal, instead of C-terminal, region of DNlg4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>H</italic>), indicating that the interaction between DNlg4 and Tkv was dependent on the acetylcholinesterase-like domain of DNlg4.</p></sec><sec><title>The dnlg4 mutants display decreased neurotransmission and reduced locomotor activity</title><p>Generally, abnormal development of NMJs leads to functional defects.

DNlg1 and DNlg2 have a positive effect on synaptic growth of NMJs, as indicated by an obvious reduction in synaptic boutons in the <italic>dnlg1</italic> and <italic>dnlg2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Conversely, loss of DNlg3 led to increased numbers of synaptic boutons at NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). In the present study, a <italic>dnlg4</italic> null mutant was generated by gene targeting, and this mutant exhibited significant defects in NMJ morphology, including fewer synaptic boutons and increased bouton size. However, neuronal overexpression of two copies of the <italic>dnlg4</italic> transgene induced a pronounced increase in bouton number. These results demonstrated a positive role of DNlg4 in regulating synapse development. Interestingly, neuronal overexpression of one copy of <italic>dnlg4</italic> in the WT background did not induce an increase in bouton number, but it did when expressed in a <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutant background. These results suggested a homeostatic adjustment during synapse development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which could somewhat counteract the effect caused by increased DNlg4. As a result, a moderate increase of DNlg4 in WT flies did not lead to increased synaptic growth of NMJs.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, loss of DNlgs in the <italic>dnlg1–3</italic> mutants also induced synaptic differentiation defects that were characterized by decreased protein levels or impaired distribution of glutamate receptors and other postsynaptic proteins at NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). In contrast to other <italic>dnlg</italic> mutants, we did not detect statistical alteration in the distribution or protein level of glutamate receptors at NMJs in <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants. In addition, the distribution and protein level of some presynaptic proteins, such as BRP, CSP, and SYT, were normal in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants. However, the ultrastructural analyses of the NMJs showed that there were still some defects in synaptic ultrastructure in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants, including the increased bouton area per active zone, longer single PSD, and reduced postsynaptic SSR regions. One striking ultrastructural defect in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants was the partial detachment of presynaptic membranes from postsynaptic membranes within the active zone, which was rarely observed in WT flies, suggesting the adhesion function of DNlg4 during synaptogenesis. It was interesting that this defect also appeared in <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants and <italic>dnrx</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>), suggesting that the DNlg4 might affect the synaptic architecture by a mechanism similar to that of DNlg1 and DNrx.</p><p>Functionally, <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants showed a mild impairment in transmitter release at NMJs, as characterized by slightly reduced evoked EJP amplitude and quantal contents. This phenotype was consistent with the morphological impairments and the ultrastructural defects of NMJs, suggesting a probable reduction in the number of total synapses or functional synapses at NMJs. The amplitude of mEJP was not changed in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants, which was consistent with the normal protein levels of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Interestingly, the frequency of mEJPs in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants was dramatically increased, indicating that DNlg4 affects spontaneous transmitter release. The detailed mechanism underlying this should be addressed in future work.</p></sec><sec><title>DNlg4 functions presynaptically in synaptic growth and transmitter release at NMJs</title><p>In mammals, Nlgs are generally considered to function as postsynaptic adhesion molecules and to help form trans-synaptic complexes with presynaptic Nrxs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, DNlg1 and DNlg3 are reported to be located in postsynaptic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). However, there are some exceptions to the postsynaptic localization of Nlgs. For example, an Nlg in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is reported to be present in both presynaptic and postsynaptic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). DNlg2 is also required both presynaptically and postsynaptically for regulating neuromuscular synaptic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). These studies support a more complex mechanism of Nlgs in synapse modulation and function. Our data add to this complexity by suggesting a presynaptic role of DNlg4 in larval neuromuscular synaptic growth and synaptic functions.</p><p>First, in the VNC of third-instar larvae, DNlg4 was concentrated in the neuropil region where the synapses aggregated. In NMJs, although endogenous DNlg4 was not detected by our anti-DNlg4 antibodies, the exogenous DNlg4 that was expressed in motoneurons was located in type I synaptic boutons of NMJs, suggesting a reasonable presynaptic location of DNlg4 at NMJs. In another assay, DNlg4 was expressed using a DNlg4-Gal4 driver to mimic the endogenous expression pattern of the <italic>dnlg4</italic> gene. The DNlg4 promoted by DNlg4-Gal4 was distributed in type I boutons of NMJs and was located in presynaptic areas of boutons, which also supported the presynaptic location of endogenous DNlg4 at NMJs, although a simultaneous postsynaptic localization of DNlg4 at NMJs could not be excluded. Second, knockdown of DNlg4 presynaptically led to morphological defects in NMJs similar to those observed in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants, indicated by decreased bouton numbers and increased bouton size. However, knockdown of DNlg4 postsynaptically did not cause the same phenotypes. These morphological defects of NMJs in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants could be completely rescued when DNlg4 was expressed in presynaptic neurons, but not when it was expressed in postsynaptic muscles. Third, <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants had a significant increase in spontaneous transmitter release frequency, which was usually interpreted as a presynaptic defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). In addition, all of the functional defects in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants, including decreased amplitude of EJPs, reduced quantal contents, and increased mEJP frequency, could be rescued by presynaptic expression of DNlg4. These results indicated that presynaptic DNlg4 was essential for proper proliferation and function of synapses at NMJs. Finally, the number of synaptic boutons at NMJs was significantly increased when two copies of <italic>UAS-dnlg4</italic> were overexpressed in presynaptic neurons, whereas this phenomenon was not observed when two copies of <italic>UAS-dnlg4</italic> were overexpressed in muscles, suggesting that presynaptic DNlg4 alone was sufficient to promote synaptic growth. Altogether, these data provided convincing evidence that DNlg4 functions as a presynaptic molecule in regulating synaptic growth and transmitter release at NMJs.</p></sec><sec><title>DNlg4 positively regulates BMP signaling through Tkv</title><p>The BMPs are major retrograde trans-synaptic signals that affect presynaptic growth and neurotransmission both in the CNS and at NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). In this study, we have presented immunohistochemical and genetic data showing that DNlg4 regulates NMJ growth via the BMP signaling pathway.</p><p>First, the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants shared similar phenotypes with the components of the BMP signaling pathway in synapse development, synapse architecture, and synapse functions of NMJs, including reduced synaptic bouton number, increased presynaptic membrane ruffles, and decreased synaptic transmission efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Second, several genetic crosses followed by neuromuscular bouton number analyses showed a definite dosage-sensitive genetic interaction between <italic>dnlg4</italic> and the components of the BMP signaling pathway, such as <italic>tkv</italic>, <italic>wit</italic>, <italic>mad</italic>, and <italic>dad</italic>, suggesting that DNlg4 was required for BMP signaling in regulating NMJ growth. Third, both immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses showed that the pMad, which serves as an indicator of BMP signaling, was decreased in both the synaptic boutons of NMJs and motoneuronal nuclei in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants, whereas it was increased in <italic>dnlg4</italic>-overexpressing flies. Finally, the expression of the BMP signaling target gene <italic>trio</italic>, was significantly reduced in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants, but it was increased in <italic>dnlg4</italic>-overexpressing flies. Together, these results supported our hypothesis that DNlg4 promoted synaptic growth by positively regulating BMP signaling.</p><p>The critical question to be addressed, therefore, is the mechanism underlying this regulation. Through Western blot analyses of larval brain homogenates, we found that the protein level of Tkv (as assessed by ectopically expressed Tkv-GFP) in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants was significantly decreased, whereas Wit and Mad, the other two components of the BMP pathway, were not altered. The immunohistochemical assay also showed that the Tkv protein in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants was reduced in both the VNC and the synaptic boutons of NMJs. These data indicated the specific positive regulation of Tkv by DNlg4. Previous studies reported that <italic>tkv</italic> mutants had decreased synaptic bouton number, increased presynaptic membrane ruffles, reduced amplitude of EJP, and unchanged mEJP amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In addition, neuronal overexpression of one copy of transgenic <italic>tkv</italic> did not induce NMJ overgrowth, but it induced such overgrowth when two copies of transgenic <italic>tkv</italic> were expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). These phenotypes were similar to what we observed in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants and <italic>dnlg4</italic>-overexpressing flies. All of these results strongly demonstrated that DNlg4 regulates BMP signaling by modulating Tkv protein levels.</p><p>Because the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants had a level of <italic>tkv</italic> mRNA comparable with that of the WT controls, DNlg4 did not affect the transcription of <italic>tkv</italic>. The possibility of Tkv trafficking defects from the cell body to the axon terminal could also be excluded because no retention of Tkv in the soma of motoneurons was observed. Thus, it seems reasonable to speculate that DNlg4 affects the recruitment or stability of Tkvs at the presynapse. In support of this hypothesis, co-localization of Tkv and DNlg4 at presynaptic regions of NMJs was observed by immunostaining. As further confirmation, we showed that Tkv could be co-immunoprecipitated with an antibody against DNlg4, and a reverse co-immunoprecipitation assay using anti-GFP antibodies also resulted in the precipitation of DNlg4 by Tkv-GFP, suggesting a physical interaction between DNlg4 and Tkv <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, using pull-down assay, we proved that the acetylcholinesterase-like domain of the N terminus was essential for DNlg4 interacting with Tkv.</p><p>If the recruitment of Tkv to the presynaptic membrane entirely depends on DNlg4, we would not detect the existence of Tkv in the presynaptic membrane, and accumulation of Tkv proteins in the presynaptic areas of NMJs would probably be observed in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants. However, we detected minor Tkv protein level at the presynaptic membrane, and no accumulation of Tkv was observed at NMJs in the <italic>dnlg4</italic> mutants. Thus, a more reasonable hypothesis is that DNlg4 affected the stability of Tkv at the presynaptic membranes. The protein level of Tkv in the presynapses of NMJs was reported to be regulated by several pathways, including direct proteasomal degradation, ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). The simplest model is that the DNlg4 might stabilize Tkv via inhibiting its degradation. Several protein kinases, such as the ribosomal protein S6 kinase-like protein (S6KL) and the serine/threonine kinase Fused, have been reported to interact physically with Tkv <italic>in vitro</italic> and to facilitate its proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). In particular, S6KL has been demonstrated to degrade Tkv at NMJs. DNlg4 might stabilize Tkv by inhibiting these protein kinases, but the detailed mechanism of such activity still needs to be addressed.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated that DNlg4 positively regulated neuromuscular synaptic growth by modulating BMP signaling through the maintenance of Tkv protein levels in the presynapse of NMJs. To accomplish this function, DNlg4 acted as a presynaptic molecule instead of a postsynaptic molecule. Our study further suggested a relationship between Nlgs and BMP signaling and provided a new understanding of the exact role of Nlgs during synapse formation and development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Drosophila stocks</title><p>The <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> strain was used as the WT control in this study.

Recordings were performed at 20–22 °C with an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Molecular Devices) in bridge mode, and the recorded data were processed with pClamp version 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). EJPs were evoked by suprathreshold stimulating pulses at 0.3 Hz using a Grass S48 stimulator (Astro-Grass Inc.). Three EJP responses were collected for each animal, and mEJPs were recorded for a period of 60 s after the EJP recording. Only recordings from cells with resting membrane potentials ranging from −60 to −65 mV were used for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Larval locomotion activity detection</title><p>The larval locomotor assay was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Individual larvae were placed in the center of 15-cm-diameter transparent dishes with 4% agar covering the bottom. A small amount of purple food colorant was added to the agar gel to obtain a dark purple color. The movement of the larvae was visualized via a standard commercial video camera, and the trajectory over 3 min was tracked by tracker software written in Python. A 3-min trajectory distance was calculated for assessing larval locomotion activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of synaptic boutons of NMJs</title><p>Wandering third-instar larvae were dissected, and the body wall muscles were immunostained with anti-HRP and anti-DLG antibodies. The serial confocal images of NMJs of muscle 4 of abdominal segments A2 and A3 were acquired. The individual synaptic boutons could be identified, and the number of type Ib boutons was counted. Bouton size was quantified as the average diameter of the three largest boutons at each NMJ4 measured with ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of fluorescence intensity</title><p>For comparisons of fluorescent intensities between genotypes, the samples were processed under identical conditions and were immunostained in the same vials. The confocal images of VNC or NMJ4 in the A2/3 segment of each animal were acquired using the same microscope settings. All assays were repeated at least three times. For each channel, the sum of pixel intensities was recorded by ImageJ software. The ratio of fluorescent intensities of the target protein <italic>versus</italic> the control protein was calculated and normalized to the control. The intensity of HRP and BRP were used as the internal control in the quantification of NMJs and VNC, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of tkv mRNA</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from the brains of third-instar larvae, and RT-PCR was performed with <italic>tkv</italic> primers (5′-GAATGTTCAGCCAGACGTCG-3′/5′-GCATAAACACGGACAGGGAG-3′). β-Tubulin mRNA was used as an internal control and was amplified with primers 5′-ATGGACTCTGTGCGATCGGG-3′/5′-TTAGTTCTCGTCGACCTCAG-3′. The positive signals of <italic>tkv</italic> cDNA from three independent repeats were calculated with the ImageJ software and normalized to the control.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was determined using Student's <italic>t</italic> tests for comparisons of two group means. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>W.
