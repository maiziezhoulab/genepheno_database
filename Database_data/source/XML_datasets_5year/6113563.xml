<abstract>
<p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) larvae are widely used to study otic functions because they possess all five typical vertebrate senses including hearing and balance. Powerful genetic tools and the transparent body of the embryo and larva also make zebrafish a unique vertebrate model to study otic development. Due to its small larval size and moisture requirement during experiments, accurately acquiring the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) of zebrafish larva is challenging. In this report, a new VOR testing device has been developed for quantifying linear VOR (LVOR) in zebrafish larva, evoked by the head motion about the earth horizontal axis. The system has a newly designed larva-shaped chamber, by which live fish can be steadily held without anesthesia, and the system is more compact and easier to use than its predecessors. To demonstrate the efficacy of the system, the LVORs in wild-type (WT), <italic>dlx3b</italic> and <italic>dlx4b</italic> morphant zebrafish larvae were measured and the results showed that LVOR amplitudes were consistent with the morphological changes of otoliths induced by morpholino oligonucleotides (MO). Our study represents an important advance to obtain VOR and predict the vestibular conditions in zebrafish.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vestibular dysfunction, due to aging, genetic diseases, injury, or medical conditions is common today, but a direct measurement or observation of inner ear defects is not feasible. Alternatively, the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) of the eyes, which refers to a reflex caused by tilting the patient's head, has been conventionally used in the clinics for assessment of vestibular function. To compensate the head movement that activates the three-neuron circuits in the vestibular system, our eyes intrinsically rotate in the opposite direction for stabilizing our gaze on the retina and maintaining spatial orientation (Barr et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1976</xref>; O'leary and Davis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">1990</xref>; Dai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2014</xref>; Carson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2017</xref>). The VOR testing has been successfully adopted in primates (Miles and Fuller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1974</xref>; Merfeld, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1995</xref>) and rodents (Curthoys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1979</xref>; Pettorossi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) has been popularly used to study the inner ear, in which both auditory and vestibular end-organs are physically situated. The zebrafish displays 71.4% homology to human genome (Howe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2013</xref>), and ~50 hearing-related zebrafish genes have been identified and many of them function similarly in comparison with other vertebrates (Nicolson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2005</xref>; Howe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2013</xref>). Zebrafish has auditory saccule and vestibular utricle in each inner ear to detect acoustic vibrations and linear acceleration, respectively. However, similar to mammalian otocysts, sensory hair cells (HCs) of zebrafish larval membranous labyrinth serve as the receptors for the sound and motion signals. Because zebrafish larvae are a few millimeters in length and live in water, methods to evaluate the vestibular function in human or adult zebrafish are not applicable to assess the vestibular function in fish larva (Kenyon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1998</xref>; Trapani and Nicolson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2010</xref>). To assess inner ear functions in zebrafish larvae is largely relied on the behavioral observation and evaluation (Mo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2010</xref>; Cameron et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2013</xref>). However, it becomes clear that C-startle response of free-swimming zebrafish, which has been measured in many previous studies, is a mixed value produced by hearing and noise generated from the swimming (Bang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2002</xref>; Neo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2015</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2017</xref>; Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2017</xref>). The unconditioned orienting response of zebrafish larvae to the water currents is used to assess hearing function, yet the visual, vestibular, hydro-mechanical, and proprioceptive cues are all known interfering factors (Platto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2014</xref>; Niihori et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Both visual and vestibular senses evoke smooth compensatory eye movements. The visually evoked eye movement is the optokinetic response (OKR) while the vestibular sense-triggered eye movement is named as the VOR. Using a simple and manually driven rotary platform, angular VOR (AVOR) in zebrafish larva sensed by the semicircular canals occurred about 1 h later than the occurrence of OKR in 3 days post fertilization (dpf) (Easter and Nicola, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">1997</xref>). Mounting zebrafish larva on an auto-rotational and heated (to keep 28Â°C) stage could be recorded by an infrared (IR) trans-illumination video system in a light-tight box. However, AVOR was undetectable until 35 dpf (Beck et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2004</xref>). Beck et al. suggested that the AVOR reported in Easter and Nicola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">1997</xref>) could be partially attributed to the OKR as the visual cues might not be adequately blocked. These attempts to live-monitor VORs have provided very useful information to understand how zebrafish develop vestibular senses. When placed on a stage in a head-down position toward the earth in a dark box, the compensatory eye movements of zebrafish larvae could not be evoked by the semicircular canals or vision. Then, in the 3 dpf larvae, a robust linear VOR (LVOR) response was measured using an IR trans-illumination video system, and the LVOR was relied on sensing a motion input by the otolith organ (Mo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2010</xref>). In these previous system, the larvae had to be anesthetized before being glued on a coverslip. Although the mounted larvae are awake during the test, it is hard to estimate how anesthesia affects the eye motion. In addition, the glue and water drop on the head region form a semispherical surface, which causes imaging distortion, or even worse, the shake of culture media drop placed on each larval head could potentially be counted as eye motion responses.</p>
<p>To develop a more accurate device to measure VOR in zebrafish larvae, a specially designed larva-shaped chamber was used to fix zebrafish larvae without using anesthesia. The chamber has been structured to allow better survival of larvae with culture media, and a glass coverslip to prevent semispherical surface and any unwanted wobbling. The efficacy of the assay for the evaluation of the vestibular functions in zebrafish larvae was verified by systematically quantifying the VORs in wild-type (WT) and morphant (Morpholino anti-sense oligo injection at 1â2 cell stage) zebrafish larvae.</p>

<title>Specimens</title>
<p>Wild-type zebrafish (TÃ¼bingen strain, TU) were raised and maintained under standardized conditions (Westerfield, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>). One- and two-cell-stage WT embryos in a single batch were injected with translation-blocking Morpholino oligonucleotides (MO; Gene Tools Inc, Philomath, US) to knock down <italic>dlx3b</italic> and <italic>dlx4b</italic> genes that were shown to regulate the otolith formation and otic HC number (Solomon and Fritz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2002</xref>). Injected and un-injected embryos were raised in Ã0.5 E2 embryo media, supplied with 0.002% of methylene blue as a fungicide and fed with dry food (Zeigler Bros Inc., PA, USA) starting at 5 dpf. The specimens used in the current study were 6 dpf larvae, which have both utricular and saccular otoliths in an otic vesicle (OV) with normal development of the inner ear (Riley and Moorman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2000</xref>; Inoue et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2013</xref>). The otoliths are in fine contact with HCs to initiate auditory or vestibular circuitry signals by deflecting the kinocilia/stereocilia bundles (Shotwell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1981</xref>; Inoue et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2013</xref>). The use of animals was approved by the Ethical Committee of Animal Experimentation of Southern University of Science and Technology.</p>

<title>Construction of a VOR testing device</title>
<p>A new VOR testing device was constructed to measure the eye movements of zebrafish larvae induced by motion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and its main innovation/functional domains include a larva-shaped chamber (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), an IR imaging video system (red dashed box in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) for recording stimulated eye responses, and a motorized rotary platform for generating the motion stimuli to the vestibular system. The chamber (6.5 mm Ã 5 mm Ã 4 mm, length Ã width Ã height) can be inserted into a 5 mm wide slot on a chamber holder. The chamber unit, including its holder, was made of transparent acrylics for trans-illumination. In the chamber, a trench was created to hold the larvae. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, it has a horn-shaped head region and a thin tail region, so that the zebrafish larva can be nicely fitted in. Three percent methylcellulose was applied over the tail for holding the fish in place (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Furthermore, the chamber was specifically structured to leave a space on its top for applying coverslip which not only keeps moisture but also prevents the wobbling and semispherical surface effect.</p>

</fig>
<p>The chamber unit was fixed on a two-dimensional (2-D) micro positioning stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) bolted on a rotary platform. An IR LED lamp, installed underneath the chamber unit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), emitted 850 nm IR trans-illumination light for the monochrome IR camera to acquire the eye movements of fish to be tested. A Ã 10 objective was connected to the monochrome IR camera (Point Gray, Richmond, Canada) that captured at 30-frame/second (fps) with 1024 Ã 1280 pixels resolution. The monochrome IR camera is fixed on a one-dimensional (1-D) micro positioning stage, which was bolted on the rotary platform. The specimen's eye movements, evoked by the vestibular sense due to the rotational motion, could be captured by the IR camera (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). During a typical testing, the larva was in a head-up position, relative to the rotary platform, and rotates about the earth horizontal axis (an area shaded in gray in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Since the chamber and the IR imaging system are fixed on the rotary platform together, there is no relative motion between the larva and the camera during the rotation process, and the eye movement induced only by vestibular stimulation is recorded.</p>
<p>The rotary platform was driven by a stepper motor (model TSM17Q-3AG, MOONS', Shanghai, China) running in a sinusoidal profile. The speed and amplitude of the stepper motor are adjustable via an STM8 microcontroller (STMicroelectronics, Geneva, Switzerland). A gear head (model 42PG1200-010, SAMSR MOTOR, Shanghai, China) with a gear ratio of 1:10 was attached to the stepper motor to convert/reduce the output speed and increase the motor torque. The 2-D and 1-D micro positioning stage were used to adjust the field of the view (FOV) and focus, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Data acquisition</title>
<p>The IR imaging system recorded series of larval eye movements stimulated by rotation about the earth horizontal axis, and the video recordings were used for quantifying the VOR using a customized computer imaging program (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>â<bold>4</bold>). In one rotation cycle, the platform swung about the earth horizontal axis in a sinusoidal profile (the white part in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The microcontroller automatically sent out a 16-ms pulse to turn off the IR LED for recording one dark frame in the video to indicate the end of a cycle. These dark frames indicate the numbers and finishing position of cycles for full period sampling, which also refer to the highest position of the platform. These dark frames are also used to check the phase lag of eye movements relative to the rotating platform. Up to 1,200 frames of video recording (about 40 s) will be automatically saved as an AVI file and then stored in hard drive connected to the VOR testing system for the subsequent image processing. Video <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">1</xref> reveals the elaborate steps to acquire VOR. The entire measurement of VOR response was performed in a black box (44 cm Ã 22 cm Ã 18 cm, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), to ensures that acquired VOR does not include the sensation evoked by visual senses (e.g., OKR).</p>

<title>Quantification the eye motion</title>
<p>A customized imaging analysis program/software (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplemental Files</xref>), written in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, USA), was used to quantitatively analyze the eye movements recorded in a video using the VOR and OKR test device.</p>
<sec>
<title>Quantification of VOR</title>
<p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> showed an image of the larval head in the larval frontal plane. The region containing the larval eyes was selected as the region of interest (ROI) in the video frames for quantitatively analyzing the eye movements, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> (the red dashed rectangle) and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. Then the image of ROI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) would be converted into a binary image (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) using Otsu's method (Otsu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1979</xref>). Then the binary image was performed a logical negation where the eyes are white (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). the small flecks in the binary image (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) were removed through an area threshold and the eyes were extracted for calculating the area of the eyes sequentially in the video (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). In this study, a larva was placed in a head-up position perpendicular to the rotary platform, and the larval eyes were found to only rotate approximately about its anterior-posterior (A-P) axis which was not on the image plane. It was not practical to directly measure this rotation using acquired 2-D images. Therefore, we analyzed the projection area of the eyes in the larval frontal plane to quantify the VOR.</p>
<p>To reduce the influence of the eye shape and size of individual larvae in the calculation of the projection area of each eye in the video recording was normalized by the mean value of the eye projection area using the equation: <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>Â¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>Â¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>Â¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>Â¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:munderover accent="false" accentunder="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover></mml:mstyle><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula> is the mean value of the projection area, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the projection area of an eye in the <italic>i</italic>th frame. <italic>N</italic> is the numbers of the frame.

<title>Quantification OKR</title>
<p>A customized device with a rotating white-and-black striped drum, similar to the one used in Beck et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2004</xref>) and Scheetz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2018</xref>), was constructed to test the OKR. To avoid visual shielding, the aforementioned larva-shaped chamber was modified for OKR test. After being mounted in the modified chamber, larvae were placed on an IR disc-LED which is located in the center of the white-and-black striped drum. Zebrafish eye movements were recorded with an IR camera and the recorded eye image was similar to the one recorded in VOR test. A similar imaging processing method was used to extract the eye. Different from eye rotation in VOR test, the larval eyes rotated about its dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis, which is on the image plane, so that we sequentially calculated the angle between the eye major axis and larval A-P axis. During the test, the drum was rotated back and forth, so that the eye rotation curve is sinusoidal-like and its amplitude or score is calculated for quantifying OKR.</p>

<sec>
<title>VOR testing</title>
<p>To validate the VOR assay developed in this study for assessing the vestibular function in zebrafish larvae, the VOR assay was used to quantify the eye responses of WT, <italic>dlx3b</italic> morphant, and <italic>dlx4b</italic> morphant larvae at 6 dpf to a motion stimulus of 30 rpm.</p>
<p>A zebrafish larva was gently placed in the larva-shaped chamber in a dorsal-up position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; Video <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">1</xref>). The tail of the larva was glued by 3% methylcellulose (Macklin, Shanghai, China) for immobility. After covering a piece of glass coverslip (6.5 cm Ã 5 cm Ã 0.17 mm) on the chamber, The head region was filled up with Ã 0.5 E2 embryo media to support the larval life. The glued larva could freely move its eyes. The chamber unit was then mounted as shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,C</xref>.</p>
<p>After aligning the larval eyes to the center of the FOV of the camera, optimal acquisition was conducted by adjusting the camera shutter, gain and frame rate based on the preview function in the IR camera. The video recording was triggered by pressing the button after the front door of the black box (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), and the platform started to rotate at a speed of 30 rpm inducing a vestibular stimulation.</p>

<p>To exclude the possibility that MO injection might injure oculomotor neurons and/or afferent visual path, indirectly contributing to vestibular defects if there were any. The OKR of WT and <italic>dlx3b</italic> morphant larvae were measured using the customized OKR device. A zebrafish larva was gently placed in the modified larva-shaped chamber as described in VOR testing. The chamber unit was then placed on the IR disc-LED in a dorsal-up position parallel to the earth. The rotating white-and-black striped drum with spatial frequency of 12.8Â°/cycle was rotated about the earth vertical axis at the speed of 6 rpm back and forth (Â± 45Â°).</p>

<title>Microscope observation</title>
<p>To see if the difference in VOR values obtained in above experiments was due to changes of otolith organ (Mo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2010</xref>) in each experimental group, the OVs of WT, <italic>dlx3b</italic> morphant, and <italic>dlx4b</italic> morphant larvae were morphologically compared. After the VOR and OKR testing, morphology of the larval ear was captured by a differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope (Zeiss Imager A1, Oberkochen, Germany) for evaluating the correlation of the VOR value and the morphological status of vestibular development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although zebrafish does not have a cochlea for sensing sound, the way that the utricle organ senses the motion is very similar to that in humans. Therefore, the VOR testing in zebrafish has provided some useful insights into the cellular mechanisms of the vestibular dysfunction, as well as the correlation between the development of OV and the regulatory genes.</p>
<sec>
<title>Am improved VOR testing assay</title>
<p>VOR testing offers a way to assess the vestibular function, so the accuracy of the VOR testing is crucial to not only the assessment of the vestibular function but also understanding the correlation between the VOR score and the vestibular function. In comparing with the previous VOR testing assay (Easter and Nicola, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">1997</xref>; Beck et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2004</xref>; Mo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2010</xref>), the VOR testing assay developed in this study possesses three main advantages: (1) the VOR testing device (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) developed in this study allows acquisition of the VOR in zebrafish larvae without anesthetics; (2) the imaging distortion generated by the semispherical surface of the culture media was completely excluded; (3) the interference induced by the wobbling medium was eliminated. Therefore, the amplitude of VOR acquired using our customized device was closely related to the vestibular function.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Validation</title>
<p>Since the vestibular function in zebrafish larvae fundamentally relies on the normal development of the vestibular organ, knocking down the regulatory genes that control vestibular organ formation should lead to an abnormal vestibular function (Torres and GirÃ¡ldez, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1998</xref>; Baker and Bronner-Fraser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2001</xref>; Solomon and Fritz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2002</xref>). Previous studies indicated that <italic>dlx3b</italic> and <italic>dlx4b</italic> have redundant function to regulate otolith formation in zebrafish; knocking down <italic>dlx3b</italic>, but not <italic>dlx4b</italic>, led to single-otolith formation in the ear while knocking down/knocking out both genes resulted in no-otolith/small ear vesicle phenotype (Solomon and Fritz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2002</xref>; Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2003</xref>; Schwarzer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2017</xref>). Consistent with the previous studies (Mo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2010</xref>; Cameron et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2013</xref>), the results of our <italic>dlx3b</italic> morphant larvae, which had only saccular otolith in their otic vesicles, suggest that utricular otolith is required for zebrafish LVOR. In addition, since there is a close relationship between the VOR and the genes responsible for regulating the structure of the vestibular organs and microstructure of the utricle, the development of the VOR testing assay may potentially offer a way to screen the genes involved in the development of the vestibular organ.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Limitation</title>
<p>The eye movements of VOR in larvae are complex and three-dimensional (3-D). In this study, we only analyzed the projection area of the eyes in the frontal plane of the larva to quantify the VOR. We did not find a remarkable difference in the amplitude of VOR between the WT and <italic>dlx4b</italic> morphant larvae. More parameters for characterizing the eye movement in 3-D should be introduced in the future study and, as a result, more comprehensive analysis generating extra information might be performed.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have developed a new VOR testing assay to successfully distinguish morphologically abnormal OVs from controls quantifying the amplitude of VOR in zebrafish larvae. Due to the high efficiency of our newly developed VOR testing device, such an assay is promising in screening drugs and mutants that are related to the abnormal vestibular development and/or function.</p>
