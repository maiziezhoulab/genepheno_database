<title>Abstract</title>
<sec id="s0100">
<title>Study Objectives</title>
<p>Daytime sleepiness is a consequence of inadequate sleep, sleep–wake control disorder, or other medical conditions. Population variability in prevalence of daytime sleepiness is likely due to genetic and biological factors as well as social and environmental influences. DNA methylation (DNAm) potentially influences multiple health outcomes. Here, we explored the association between DNAm and daytime sleepiness quantified by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s0101">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We performed multi-ethnic and ethnic-specific epigenome-wide association studies for DNAm and ESS in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; <italic>n</italic> = 619) and the Cardiovascular Health Study (<italic>n</italic> = 483), with cross-study replication and meta-analysis. Genetic variants near ESS-associated DNAm were analyzed for methylation quantitative trait loci and followed with replication of genotype-sleepiness associations in the UK Biobank.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s0102">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In MESA only, we detected four DNAm-ESS associations: one across all race/ethnic groups; three in African-Americans (AA) only. Two of the MESA AA associations, in genes <italic>KCTD5</italic> and <italic>RXRA</italic>, nominally replicated in CHS (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). In the AA meta-analysis, we detected 14 DNAm-ESS associations (FDR <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, top association <italic>p</italic>-value = 4.26 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). Three DNAm sites mapped to genes (<italic>CPLX3</italic>, <italic>GFAP</italic>, and <italic>C7orf50)</italic> with biological relevance. We also found evidence for associations with DNAm sites in <italic>RAI1</italic>, a gene associated with sleep and circadian phenotypes. UK Biobank follow-up analyses detected SNPs in <italic>RAI1</italic>, <italic>RXRA</italic>, and <italic>CPLX3</italic> with nominal sleepiness associations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s0103">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We identified methylation sites in multiple genes possibly implicated in daytime sleepiness. Most significant DNAm-ESS associations were specific to AA. Future work is needed to identify mechanisms driving ancestry-specific methylation effects.</p>

<title>Statement of Significance</title>
</caption>
<p>Excessive daytime sleepiness is associated with negative health outcomes such as reduction in quality of life, increased workplace accidents, and cardiovascular mortality. There are race/ethnic disparities in excessive daytime sleepiness. However, the environmental and biological mechanisms for these differences are not yet understood. We performed an association analysis of DNA methylation (DNAm), measured in monocytes, and daytime sleepiness within a racially diverse study population. We detected numerous DNAm markers associated with daytime sleepiness in African-Americans, but only one marker was associated with daytime sleepiness across all race/ethnic groups. Future work is required to elucidate the pathways between DNAm, sleepiness, and related behavioral/environmental exposures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), is estimated to affect between 10% and 20% of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. EDS is associated with numerous adverse clinical, behavioral and public health outcomes, including work and vehicular accidents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3–10</xref>]; reduced health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11–13</xref>]; cognitive and performance deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]; and increased rates of stroke and total and cardiovascular mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]. There are multiple mechanisms for EDS, including insufficient sleep duration due to behavioral, social or work-related factors; sleep disruption due to a sleep disorder (sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder); circadian misalignment; the presence of a primary disorder of hypersomnia that affects the central sleep–wake control processes (e.g. narcolepsy); as well as poorly understood mechanisms occurring in a variety of medical (e.g. diabetes) and psychiatric (e.g. depression) disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18–20</xref>]. The prevalence of EDS has increased over the past decades, likely due to an increase in working hours and availability of electronic devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. A rise in EDS prevalence may also reflect the increased prevalence of obesity, which is associated with sleepiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]. This association is hypothesized to be due to obesity-related co-morbidities that reduce sleep quality, including obstructive sleep apnea, as well as to metabolic and neuroendocrine effects of adipokines on wake-promoting neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Although EDS is prevalent in the population, there appears to be large inter-individual differences in propensity for sleepiness following sleep deprivation, sleep fragmentation, or sleep apnea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. Similarly, there is significant population variability in prevalence of EDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. Differences in sleepiness, including vulnerability or resilience to sleep-disrupting influences, have been suggested to be due to genetic and other biological differences, although social and environmental influences also likely play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]. Generally, the bases for differences in sleepiness between populations are not well understood.</p>
<p>Epigenetic modifications are increasingly recognized to mediate the impact of environmental influences on gene expression and on prevalence and severity of a wide range of health outcomes, including neuropsychiatric, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. The most studied epigenetic marker, DNA methylation (DNAm), occurs when a methyl group is added to a cytosine that is followed by guanine on the genome (a “CpG” site). Changes in DNAm occur in response to a wide range of exposures, many of which are associated with sleep and sleepiness, such as obesity, diet, and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29–35</xref>]. Therefore, we postulated that changes in DNAm would associate with variation in sleepiness and these changes may be population-specific, providing insights into underlying susceptibility to sleepiness that may be partially attributed to environmental, and possibly genetic, factors. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no reported study on DNAm and sleepiness.</p>
<p>In this article, we performed an Epigenome-Wide Association Study (EWAS) of daytime sleepiness quantified by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). We leveraged the racial/ethnic diversity of the sample to explore potential differences in EWAS associations by background groups. We further used the MESA dataset to study potential mechanisms underlying the associations. First, using gene-expression analysis in MESA, studying whether DNAm associated with sleepiness by modifying gene expression; and second, by identifying methylation quantitative trait loci (cis-meQTLs) near genes harboring associated methylation sites to suggest whether DNAm affects sleepiness by modifying genetic effects. Candidate genetic associations were carried forward for replication analysis in the UK Biobank.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s3">
<title>MESA study sample</title>
<p>The study population consisted of participants from the MESA, a prospective, longitudinal cohort study established to study factors associated with the development of cardiovascular disease. MESA clinic visits were first performed between 2000 and 2002 in six field centers across the United States when participants were free of known cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">36</xref>]. The subset of MESA individuals in this study is composed of those who participated in a sleep examination conducted in conjunction with MESA Exam 5 (described in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">36</xref>]), and who also participated in the MESA DNAm study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. The blood draws for the methylation study were obtained during MESA Exam 5 (2010–2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref>] on a random subset of MESA participants at four of the six field centers: John Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Columbia University, and Wake Forest University. A total of 623 individuals were available with both sleep data and DNAm data. After excluding four individuals due to missing ESS scores, the final study sample included 619 individuals: 132 African-Americans (AAs), 202 Hispanic Americans (HAs), and 285 European Americans (EAs), where race/ethnicities were self-reported. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each participating site, and participants provided written informed consent, including the use of genetic data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>DNAm collection and processing in MESA</title>
<p>Methods for collection and assays for DNAm have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref>]. In brief, peripheral blood was separated into mononuclear cells (CD14+) within two hours of collection. DNAm in monocytes was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Residual cell contamination in the monocyte data was assessed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, providing enrichment scores for neutrophils, B cells, T cells, and Natural Killer cells from Gene Expression data collected using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip and Illumina Bead Array Reader [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039">39</xref>]. The DNAm data underwent quality control tests prior to analysis using the lumi Bioconductor package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0040">40</xref>]. These included color bias adjustments via smooth quantile normalization, median background adjustment, standard quantile adjustment, checks for potential sex or race mismatches, and outlier detection via multidimensional plots. Additional details on preprocessing of the DNAm data can be found in Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. Following DNAm preprocessing, each of 484 882 methylation probes for each person has a Beta-value, representing the proportion of methylated monocytes at that site and person.</p>
<p>We further prepared the methylation data for analysis based on meta information and sample-specific characteristics, as follows. First, we excluded 61 219 probes that were within 10bp of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with a minor allele frequency greater than 1% in European, African, or American populations from the 1000 genomes reference data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041">41</xref>]. This was done to exclude loci where variation is solely due to genetic polymorphisms. We also removed any non-cg methylation probes and probes on sex chromosomes. We then removed any cross-reactive probes as defined by Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">42</xref>], leaving us with 399 526 DNAm probes to analyze. We used the software program ComBat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">43</xref>] on these CpG sites to remove any signal due to technical artifacts of chip and position on chip effects while maintaining correlation with our primary set of covariates (self-reported ancestry, recruitment site, sex, age, and residual cell type enrichment). ComBat was run on the M-values (logit transformed Beta-values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">44</xref>], see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Methods</xref>). After ComBat, the data was transformed back to the Beta-Value scale for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5">
<title>SNP data</title>
<p>For consenting individuals, DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotyped on Affymetrix 6.0 GWAS array. Standard quality control methods for SNP- and sample-level quality were applied, including the exclusion of participants and SNPs with over 5% missing call rates. This resulted in 895 289 genotyped variants in 615 individuals with DNAm data. For downstream analysis, we excluded SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 1%. Further details on the genotype and quality control can be found in Vargas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045">45</xref>]. We calculated the top 5 principal components (PCs) from the Linkage-Disequilibrium pruned set SNPs with MAF≥5%. PCs were calculated in the combined sample and also in each ethnic-specific group. There were four AA individuals that had missing SNP information; therefore, the PCs were imputed with the mean value of the respective PC in the AA subset that had SNP information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6">
<title>Sleep assessments</title>
<p>As part of the MESA Sleep Exam (2010–2013), participants completed standardized questionnaires and underwent single night in-home polysomnography (Compumedics Somte Systems, Abbotsville, Australia, AU0) and 7-day wrist actigraphy (Philips-Respironics Spectrum, Murrysville, PA), as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. The primary sleep measure was daytime sleepiness as quantified by the ESS, an 8-item validated instrument that asks the individual to assess likelihood of dozing off in a variety of daily activities using a 4 point (0–3) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">46</xref>]. ESS scores vary from 0 to 24, with higher scores denoting more sleepiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0046">46</xref>]. ESS was assessed within one year of blood draw for DNAm. We identified additional sleep phenotypes/exposures that might be associated with both DNAm and ESS, potentially acting as mediators or confounders of any DNAm and ESS association. These measures were: insomnia/insomnia symptoms (report of doctor-diagnosed insomnia or the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Insomnia Rating Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0047">47</xref>], a validated scale varying from 0 to 20); Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI] (sum of all apneas and hypopneas associated with 3% or more oxygen desaturation divided by total sleep time by polysomnography); overnight hypoxemia (percentage of sleep time <italic>t</italic> with oxyhemoglobin saturation less than 90% [Per90]); and sleep duration (average sleep duration over the 7 monitoring nights by actigraphy as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7">
<title>Covariates</title>
<p>Age, sex and race/ethnicity were self-reported. Other behavioral, socioeconomic and lifestyle exposures that may confound sleepiness-methylation associations were also assessed, as follows. Alcohol use was self-reported (yes/no). Smoking status was classified by ever/former/never. Depressive symptoms were based on responses to the Center for Epidemiological Studies (CES) depression scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0048">48</xref>]. Socioeconomic variables were defined by having less than a college education and mother having less than a college education; these were added because they were previously shown in MESA to be associated with methylation in inflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0049">49</xref>]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from weight and height measured at MESA Exam 5. Dietary variables were derived from a food frequency questionnaire: long chain score (sum of Omega fatty acids mg/d), total fats, carbohydrates, and Total Alternative Healthy Eating Index - 2010 (Total AHEI-2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0050">50</xref>]. Antidepressant and antipsychotic medications usage, potentially influencing sleepiness, were identified from medication inventories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8">
<title>The CHS</title>
<p>The CHS is a population-based cohort study of risk factors for coronary heart disease and stroke in adults ≥65 years conducted across four field centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">51</xref>]. The original predominantly European ancestry cohort of 5201 persons was recruited in 1989–1990 from random samples of the Medicare eligibility lists; subsequently, an additional predominantly AA cohort of 687 persons was enrolled for a total sample of 5888. CHS was approved by institutional review committees at each field center and individuals in the present analysis had available DNA and provided informed consent for use of genetic information. DNAm was measured on 336 self-reported European American and 329 AA participants at study year 5. The samples were randomly selected among participants without coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, valvular heart disease, stroke or transient ischemic attack at study baseline or lack of available DNA. Sleepiness was assessed at year 6 using the ESS.</p>
<p>Methylation measurements were performed at the Institute for Translational Genomics and Population Sciences at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center—Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA). Quality control was performed in the minfi R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0052">52–54</xref>] (version 1.12.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/minfi.html">http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/minfi.html</ext-link>). Samples were removed for any of the following: low median intensities of below 10.5 (log2) across the methylated and unmethylated channels; a proportion of probes falling detection of greater than 0.5%; QC probes falling greater than 3<italic>SD</italic> from the mean; sex-check mismatches; or failed concordance with prior genotyping or &gt;0.5% of probes with a detection <italic>p</italic>-value &gt; .01. In total, 11 samples were removed for sample QC resulting in a sample of 323 European-ancestry and 326 AA samples. Methylation values were normalized using the SWAN quantile normalization method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0054">54</xref>]. Since white blood cell proportions were not directly measured in CHS they were estimated from the methylation data using the Houseman method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0055">55</xref>].</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Our complete analysis approach is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. We first describe our discovery analyses, which includes a meta-analysis, followed by sensitivity, gene expression, local methylation expressive quantitative trait loci (cis-meQTL), and replication analyses.</p>

<title>Discovery analysis for methylation-ESS association</title>
<p>The primary analysis outcome was ESS score, square-root transformed to achieve approximate normality. It was analyzed in a linear regression on normalized DNAm Beta-values, treated as exposures. The primary analyses were adjusted for sex, age, residual cell type enrichment (in MESA) or estimated white blood cell counts (in CHS), recruitment site, and the top 5 genetic PCs. CHS analyses were further adjusted for current smoking status (in MESA, smoking status was adjusted in sensitivity analyses, as described below). We performed discovery analysis via two different approaches. The first approach focused exclusively on each cohort (MESA, CHS), followed by cross-replication, if associations were detected. We conducted analyses in both the combined multi-ethnic sample, and in self-reported race/ethnic group-specific analyses. In MESA, combined analyses adjusted for PCs calculated in the overall group, as well as for a covariate for self-reported ethnicity (EA, AA, or HA). In group-specific analyses, we adjusted for their specific PCs. In CHS, group-specific analyses were combined in inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis. We evaluated heterogeneity across race/ethnic-specific results by fitting a linear model in MESA using the overall sample with self-reported race/ethnicity interaction terms with DNAm and testing these interaction terms using an <italic>F</italic>-test via analysis of variance (ANOVA). For analyses reported in MESA only, we report replication <italic>p</italic>-values in the appropriate race/ethnic group (or combined) in CHS. Replication <italic>p</italic>-values are computed as the one-sided <italic>p</italic>-value, guided by the direction of association in MESA. This approach has been shown to be more powerful and have better control of type 1 error compared with two-sided <italic>p</italic>-values for replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>The second discovery approach was a meta-analysis combining both CHS AA and EA with their respective similar MESA groups, as well as a meta-analysis across all groups from both studies. The meta-analysis was done using inverse variance weighted, fixed-effects approach.</p>
<p>To account for multiple testing, we controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at the 5% level in each of the multi-ethnic and race/ethnic group-specific analyses. An association was deemed as significant if the <italic>q</italic>-value was less than 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0057">57</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s11">
<title>Sensitivity analysis for methylation-ESS associations</title>
<p>We next identified behavioral, socioeconomic and lifestyle exposures, including variation in sleep and sleep disturbances, that may influence the sleepiness-methylation associations and further adjusted for these factors in sensitivity analyses conducted in significant probe-trait primary associations. Covariates considered for the sensitivity analysis were: BMI, sleep duration (actigraphy-based), insomnia (both doctor diagnosed and the WHI insomnia rating scale), AHI, nocturnal hypoxemia [Per90], alcohol use, smoking status, CES depression scale, having less than a college education, mother having less than a college education, and dietary variables, as defined earlier. We also examined moderate sleep apnea (AHI &gt; 15), short sleep (&lt;5 hours), and overnight hypoxemia (Per90 &gt; 5%). Complete details for this sensitivity analysis are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Material</xref>.</p>
<p>In another sensitivity analysis, we repeated analyses in MESA for the top association, after excluding individuals who reported use of antidepressant or antipsychotic medications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s12">
<title>Screening for cis-meQTLs in MESA</title>
<p>We hypothesized that genetic associations underlie some of the DNAm-ESS associations. Due to our limited sample size, we implemented a screening process on genetic variants in the CpG region, followed by a replication analysis of the SNP-sleepiness association in an independent cohort (UK Biobank).</p>
<p>First, we mapped all DNAm sites that passed the significance threshold (<italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) to their respective genes to assess if genetic variants in that gene were associated with both ESS and DNAm. Specifically, for each gene that a top DNAm site mapped to, we performed association analysis between genotyped SNPs within 100kb of the gene (as exposures) and the associated DNAm site (as an outcome) adjusting for age, sex, top five PCs, study site, and residual cell type. This identified local (cis) meQTLs (screening step 1). SNPs with associations at <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 were next assessed for their association with sleepiness, with and without additional adjustment for the DNAm (screening step 2). These two screening steps were performed on the MESA subsample of the race/ethnic group in which the DNAm-ESS association was detected, and in all groups if the association was detected in the combined analysis. SNPs that were associated with ESS with <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 were carried forward to independent replication analysis (see below) of the SNP-sleepiness association in the UK Biobank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0058">58</xref>]. We also report SNPs-ESS associations in MESA race/ethnic groups that did not identify the original DNAm-ESS association, while noting that such associations may not be detected due to lower sample size and power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13">
<title>Replication analysis of cis-meQTL-sleepiness association in the UK Biobank</title>
<p>The UK Biobank is a large prospective study for a wide range of genetics and health outcomes in over 500 000 participants aged 40–69 years recruited from 2006 to 2010 in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0059">59</xref>]. Genotyping and imputation data are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0060">Bycroft et al. (2017)</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0060">60</xref>]. Sleepiness was assessed by self-reported responses to the question “How likely are you to dose off or fall asleep during the daytime when you don’t mean to? (e.g. when working, reading or driving)” with the options of “Never/rarely”, “sometimes”, “often”, “all of the time”, “do not know”, and “prefer not to answer.” For SNPs passing the cis-meQTL screening process in MESA, association analysis was performed in 452 071 individuals adjusted for age, sex, genotyping array, 10 PCs and genetic relatedness matrix.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s14">
<title>Gene expression analysis</title>
<p>For genes corresponding to the DNAm sites with FDR <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, we used gene expression data in MESA to study the evidence for association between DNAm and gene expression (of the same gene), and gene expression association with ESS. Gene expression profiling and processing are described in detail in Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. In brief, gene expression was measured using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip array in mononuclear cells, on the same participants with DNAm measures. We performed (1) association analysis of DNAm and gene expression, using all individuals with available data (234 AA, 386 HA, and 582 EA individuals), with ESS as the outcome and DNAm as exposure; and (2) association analysis of gene expression (as exposure) and squared-root ESS (as the outcome) in the set of individuals that had both gene expression and ESS measured.

<title>Study characteristics</title>
<p>The MESA sample consisted of 619 individuals (53% female) with a mean age of 68 years, with 132 AA, 202 HA, and 285 EA individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The mean ESS was 6.0 and 14% were classified as having EDS (ESS &gt; 10), with the highest prevalence of EDS among AAs (18%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.07). Sleep duration was significantly shorter in the AA group compared to the other groups (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001). Mean AHI was 19.6, and 46% of the sample had moderate or more severe sleep apnea (AHI &gt; 15). Across groups, sleep apnea was more prevalent and severe in the HA group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Significant differences were observed for BMI, having a college education, smoking status, sleep apnea, sleep duration, dietary long-chain score, and alcohol consumption by race/ethnic group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Associations between sleepiness and DNAm</title>
<p>We report histograms of <italic>p</italic>-values from the various analyses as well as inflation factors in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>. The genomic inflation ranged from 0.97 (CHS combined) to 1.09 (MESA AA). Results from the discovery analysis of each cohort with cross-replication in the other cohort are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. This analysis identified four significant associations (FDR <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05), all observed in MESA. A single DNAm-ESS association was detected in the combined analysis across MESA race/ethnic groups at cg25472882 located near gene <italic>C7orf50</italic> (<italic>p</italic>-value = 6.59 × 10<sup>–8</sup>). There were three DNAm-ESS associations observed in the AA group: cg12833508 (<italic>p</italic>-value = 1.38 × 10<sup>–7</sup>), cg26609398 (<italic>p</italic>-value = 2.33 × 10<sup>–7</sup>), and cg13687497 (<italic>p</italic>-value = 3.66 × 10<sup>–7</sup>) located near genes <italic>AP1S3</italic>, <italic>KCTD5</italic>, and <italic>RXRA</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). For each of these AA-specific associations, tests of interaction between race/ethnic group and DNAm on the transformed ESS scores conducted in the overall MESA sample were significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The race/ethnic associations between DNAm in these four sites are visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Replication (one-sided) <italic>p</italic>-values in CHS are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. Two DNAm sites were nominally associated with ESS in CHS: cg26609398 (replication <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.028), and cg13687497 (replication <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.045). Considering DNAm sites with FDR <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.1, there were two significant associations in DNAm sites within <italic>RAI1</italic>, a gene associated with several sleep and circadian phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0062">62</xref>]. Therefore, we further investigated these DNAm sites in follow-up analyses.</p>

<title>Cis-meQTL analysis and UK Biobank replication</title>
<p>We performed cis-meQTL analysis for the DNAm reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, which mapped to 14 genes.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reports for the first time a DNAm association analysis in a multi-ethnic population designed to detect DNAm markers associated with daytime sleepiness. We performed association analyses in two cohorts, MESA and CHS, using both a cross-replication approach and a meta-analysis, examining analyzing data for each race/ethnicity group (AA, EA, and HA) individually as well as by pooling groups. In the cross-replication analysis, two associated DNA sites discovered in MESA AAs (cg26609398, <italic>KCTD5</italic> gene, and cg13687497, <italic>RXRA</italic> gene) replicated in CHS AAs. In the meta-analysis, we discovered additional 14 DNAm associations in 11 genes in CHS and MESA AAs. At a higher statistical threshold, we also identified DNAm sites in the <italic>RAI1</italic> gene (FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.1). Some of the genes that we identified have strong biological relevance and were previously reported as associated with several sleep traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0061">61–66</xref>].</p>
<p>Our study focused on the multi-ethnic epigenetic bases of daytime sleepiness. Several studies have shown that even after accounting for sleep duration and sleep disorders, sleepiness is lower in EA compared to other ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0067">67–69</xref>]. Compared to EA groups, AAs also have a higher prevalence of both short and long sleep durations and sleep apnea syndrome (defined by an elevated AHI plus daytime sleepiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]) and in the larger MESA cohort, AA had higher ESS than EA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. Race/ethnicity differences in sleep patterns and susceptibility to EDS appear early in life. AA children have been shown to have shorter sleep duration than white children as early as 1 year of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0070">70</xref>]. In children with sleep apnea treated with adenotonsillectomy, AA children have higher sleepiness scores than EA children both at baseline and following treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0071">71</xref>]. Here, in our study of a middle-aged to older community multi-racial sample, we found significant epigenetic findings mostly in the AA samples of two independent cohorts. The specificity of the findings in the AA sample could reflect differences in underlying genetic architecture that influence susceptibility to methylation or differences in environmental exposures, such as air pollution, or stress that differentially affect different groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0072">72–75</xref>]. We address this hypothesis using sensitivity analyses that explored potential explanatory effects due to sleep variation and other lifestyle exposures. These analyses mostly did not find any phenotype explaining the association, when comparing the results to those obtained via permutation, with the exception of one DNAm-ESS association. However, these measures do not characterize lifetime exposures nor included precise measurements of the social or physical environments, emphasizing the need for additional research that links key aspects of an individual’s environmental and sociological exposures with epigenetic markers and health conditions such as sleepiness as important routes for understanding health disparities.</p>
<p>A few of our sleepiness-associated DNAm sites are within genes that have strong evidence for associations with sleep-related processes. In the MESA discovery analysis, the most significant DNAm association was in the combined MESA cohort (cg25472882, <italic>p</italic>-value = 6.59 × 2<sup>−8</sup>, CHS replication <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.75), in gene <italic>C7orf50</italic>. Among sub-Saharan Africans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0076">76</xref>] different DNAm sites in this gene were associated with type 2 Diabetes, a condition commonly associated with sleep problems. Epigenetic analysis of cord blood samples showed that epigenetic changes in this gene also were associated with serum immunoglobulin E in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0077">77</xref>].</p>
<p>Three DNAm associations were discovered in MESA AA only, and two of these has replication <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 in CHS. One of these associations was in the <italic>KCTD5</italic> gene (cg26609398 <italic>p</italic>-value 2.33 × 10<sup>–7</sup>, CHS AA replication <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.028). <italic>KCTD5</italic> is a mammalian ortholog of the Drosophila gene <italic>Inc</italic>, a gene expressed in multiple sleep associated regions in the central nervous system and shown to play a fundamental role in sleep in Drosophila by interacting with Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase (<italic>Cul3</italic>). When mutated, both genes (<italic>KCTD5</italic> and <italic>Cul3</italic>) produce similar phenotypes characterized by markedly shortened and fragmented sleep together with altered synaptic structure and impaired synaptic transmission in relevant neuronal circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0063">63</xref>]. This suggests that alterations in protein dynamics (e.g. ubiquitination) might disrupt synaptic function and impact sleep. Future research is needed to examine how epigenetic changes in <italic>KCTD5</italic> and similar genes influence gene expression and core elements of the sleep homeostat, with initial work indicating potential protein interactions with the circadian genes <italic>FBXW11</italic> and <italic>BTRC</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0078">78</xref>].</p>
<p>In MESA AA and replicated in CHS AA, DNA methylation association was also observed for cg13687497, within the <italic>RXRA</italic> gene, a retinoic acid receptor involved in lipid metabolism and cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0079">79–81</xref>]. Genes involved in retinoic acid pathways may be particularly relevant to sleepiness phenotypes given the central role of retinoic acid in central nervous system signaling pathways. Interestingly, two of our associated methylation sites (at a less significant statistical threshold) were within <italic>RAI1</italic>, which is induced by retinoic acid. <italic>RAI1</italic> encodes a protein that is highly expressed in neuronal tissues and is involved in early neural differentiation and transcriptional regulation of circadian clock components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0062">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0064">64–66</xref>]. Variants in this gene have been associated with circadian rhythm disruption, several abnormal sleep traits, neurobehavioral problems and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0066">66</xref>]. In addition, SNPs in <italic>RAI1</italic> have been found to be associated with sleep apnea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0061">61</xref>]. In addition to our DNAm-sleepiness association, we identified additional evidence supporting a role of RAI1 in sleepiness: (1) expression of <italic>RAI1</italic> in mononuclear cells was associated with ESS in MESA; (2) our cis-meQTL analysis detected a SNP in <italic>RAI1</italic> influencing sleepiness in an EA population from the UK Biobank. Moreover, our analysis in MESA suggests that the SNP rs9896285 has both direct and indirect (through DNAm) effects on sleepiness in MESA AAs. The nonsignificant associations in MESA HAs and EAs could relate to differences in genetic architecture, environmental exposures or to lower power, which is a result of both low sample size and lower allele frequency in EAs and HAs compared to AAs (0.04 and 0.11 in MESA EAs and HAs, respectively, compared to 0.28 in MESA AAs). More work is needed to further dissect the association of retinoic acid pathway genes with sleepiness.</p>
<p>In the meta-analysis of MESA and CHS AAs, we discovered 14 DNAm associations with ESS, revealing relevant biological mechanism associated with sleepiness. The most significant association was in the Histamine Receptor H2 (<italic>HRH2</italic>) gene (cg18371750, AA meta <italic>p</italic>-value = 4.3 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). The histaminergic system plays a central role in modulating brain activity, including alertness. H2 receptors are found in a wide variety of tissues, including neurons, where cross-talk with H1 receptors modulate complex signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0082">82</xref>]. Genetic variability in this gene is associated with some neurological diseases (e.g. Parkinson, autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0082">82–84</xref>]) and in pain reception in knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0085">85</xref>]. Another association was in the <italic>CPLX3/LMAN1L</italic> genes region (cg01904985, <italic>p</italic>-value = 2.5 × 10<sup>−7</sup>). <italic>CPLX3</italic> is involved in light sensitization and in thalamo-cortical integration, which are key for sleep regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0086">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0087">87</xref>]. Both genes are highly expressed in brain tissue (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Our cis-meQTL analysis identified rs7495739 associated with these genes which predicted methylation, was associated with ESS in MESA AAs (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.034), and was also nominally associated with sleepiness in UK Biobank whites (replication <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.038). Another gene highlighted by the meta-analysis is the Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (<italic>GFAP</italic>, cg01769243, <italic>p</italic>-value = 8.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), which is also highly expressed in brain tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), and is associated with nervous system disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0088">88</xref>].</p>
<p>Cedernaes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0089">89</xref>] recently reported numerous associations between experimental sleep loss in 15 individuals and DNAm in adipose tissue. Of the 148 DMRs reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Table 2</xref> in Cedernaes et al.), seven DNAm sites (cg25265360, cg05481452, cg01771651, cg25265360, cg23781467, cg20815339, and cg01168201) were within 5000 bp of a DNAm site associated with ESS in our analysis of MESA AA at the FDR &lt; 0.1 level. Interestingly, Cedernaes et al. reported that most of the differentially methylated regions following sleep loss were hypermethylated, while in our analysis, sleepiness was mostly associated with hypomethylation in the top associated DNAm sites. We studied whether this could be due to a global pattern of hypomethylation among participants with EDS in MESA. We computed mean global methylation for all participants and compared the distribution of these means between individuals with EDS, and others. However, the mean and median global methylation averages were nearly identical between the groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). There are multiple differences in the study by Cedernaes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0089">89</xref>] and our, including differences in sleep exposures, the age of study participants and tissue assayed (adipose tissue vs blood).</p>
<p>A unique feature of this study is its multi-ethnic sample. In MESA alone, we identified three DNAm-sleepiness associations that are only present in AAs, and one association in the combined population. Two of the AA-specific associations replicated in CHS. We further identified 14 AA-specific associations in the meta-analysis of MESA and CHS. DNAm differences in some of these sites may explain some of the differences in sleepiness between AAs and EAs, highlighting potential mechanisms to explore in studies of health disparities. A limitation is that we had small sample sizes in the group-specific analyses. Despite this, we could directly replicate two of the associations discovered in MESA AAs. Lack of further replication may relate to many factors, including the older sample of CHS participants, biases and misclassification in self-reported sleepiness assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0090">90</xref>], and potential difference in their exposure history compared to MESA participants. Another limitation is the time difference in measurement of DNAm, and sleep study. Participants filled the ESS questionnaire within a year following the blood draw for DNAm, and both DNAm and ESS may vary over this time frame. In addition, we examined DNAm within monocytes, while sleep is organized in the brain. Despite this, we identified associated DNAm sites near genes with potential neurological impact. A limitation which is shared by many epigenome-wide association studies, is the lack of identified exposure explaining the change in methylation and the group-specificity of the associations. We did study potential mechanism by considering cis-meQTLs analysis and a sensitivity analysis adjusting for various, plausible, exposure variable (sleep, lifestyle, and nutrition variables) which may be independently associated with either DNAm, ESS, or both, but these analyses did not lead to strong hypotheses about causal pathways.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified multiple DNAm sites associated with sleepiness. For the majority of these sites, sleepiness was associated with decreased methylation. Some of our top DNAm sites are near genes known to be associated with critical neuronal processes that influence sleep. Taken together, our findings suggest that these sleepiness-associated DNAm sites are related to genes that have a biologically meaningful function with regards to sleep. The significance of our findings, which were mostly in AAs, identifies biological areas that may contribute to the observed differences in sleepiness between AAs and EAs, providing an avenue for further investigation, both genetic and environmental, of health disparities. As mentioned in the introduction, poor sleep outcomes are associated with negative life outcomes and a recent review presented extensive evidence that obstructive sleep apnea and aging share various biological pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0091">91</xref>]. Future studies with larger sample sizes may elucidate these genomic pathways and how they relate to potential biological or sociological patterns that are being reflected in excessive sleepiness.</p>
