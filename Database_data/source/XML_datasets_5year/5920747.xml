<p id="P2">“Sundowning” in dementia and Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by early evening agitation and aggression. While such periodicity suggests a circadian origin, whether the circadian clock directly regulates aggressive behavior is unknown. We demonstrate that a daily rhythm in aggression propensity in male mice is gated by GABAergic subparaventricular zone (SPZ<sup>GABA</sup>) neurons, the major postsynaptic targets of the central circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Optogenetic mapping revealed that SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons receive input from vasoactive intestinal polypeptide SCN neurons and innervate neurons in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) known to regulate aggression. Additionally, VMH-projecting dorsal SPZ neurons are more active during early day than early night, and acute chemogenetic inhibition of SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> transmission phase-dependently increases aggression. Finally, SPZ<sup>GABA</sup>-recipient central VMH neurons directly innervate VMHvl neurons and activation of this intra-VMH circuit drove attack behavior. Altogether, we reveal a functional polysynaptic circuit by which the SCN clock regulates aggression.</p>

<body>
<p id="P3">Circadian rhythm disruption is a prominent feature of numerous neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and neuropsychiatric diseases that are also associated with verbal and physical aggression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, whether the central circadian clock directly regulates aggression, a complex motivated behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and the circuit basis by which it may do so, remain unknown. We hypothesized that the propensity towards aggressive behavior varies across the 24 h day, and that the central circadian clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, regulates this rhythm in aggression propensity. Neurons within the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMHvl) are known to directly regulate attack behavior in male mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, but it is unknown if the activity of these neurons is under temporal regulation by the SCN clock. SCN neurons can function as individual oscillators exhibiting rhythmic electrical activity with a period of about 24 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, and this rhythmic activity is controlled by an internal transcriptional-translational-postranslational feedback loop under the control of canonical clock genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. While this same genetic machinery is present in cells throughout the body, the SCN is necessary to synchronize peripheral oscillators and maintain rhythmic behavior, and axonal output appears to be the primary method by which the SCN establishes such synchrony <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that the circadian regulation of aggression may depend upon a polysynaptic pathway from the SCN to VMHvl neurons.</p>
<p id="P4">We tested this hypothesis using optogenetically-based circuit mapping and a series of genetically-targeted neuronal manipulations with an initial focus on the GABAergic subparaventricular zone (SPZ<sup>GABA</sup>), an obligate relay for most SCN clock synaptic output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Our work reveals that aggression propensity exhibits a robust daily rhythm and that a circuit, spanning four synaptically coupled hypothalamic nodes, directly modulates this daily rhythm of aggression, primarily by inhibiting aggressive behavior in a circadian phase-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Aggression propensity exhibits a daily rhythm mediated by SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> transmission</title>
<p id="P5">We first sought to examine whether the propensity for behavioral aggression follows a daily rhythm in mice and, if so, whether disabling neurotransmission by the SPZ, the major synaptic relay between the SCN clock and downstream structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, would disrupt this rhythm. We operationally defined the SPZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) as the region innervated by axons of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) SCN neurons (SCN<sup>VIP</sup>) and bordered ventrally and dorsally by arginine vasopression (AVP) neurons of the SCN and the paraventricular nucleus (PV), respectively, which is consistent with previous definitions in other rodent species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Given that the SPZ is predominantly GABAergic, we used transgenic mice expressing loxP sites flanking the second exon of <italic>Vgat, Slc32a1</italic>, the gene for the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT, <italic>Vgat</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. By placing injections of an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) containing Cre recombinase (AAV-iCre-2A-Venus)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> into the SPZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), we deleted this gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), rendering SPZ cells unable to release GABA. We specifically targeted these injections towards the dorsal SPZ (dSPZ), as this region has been shown to predominately target the VMH in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We then tested SPZ <italic>Vgat</italic>-deleted mice and their intact littermates (injected with AAV-GFP into the SPZ, which does not delete <italic>Vgat</italic>), using the resident intruder paradigm (a well-established assay for territorial aggression in male mice)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, at zeitgeber times (ZT)1, ZT7, ZT13, and ZT19 (ZT0=lights-on, 12/12 light-dark cycle).</p>
<p id="P6">We found that aggression propensity in intact male mice toward a male mouse intruder exhibited a daily rhythm with the highest total time spent engaged in attack behavior at ZT13 and the lowest at ZT1 (ZT13: 62.16 ± 12.52, ZT1: 24.95 ± 7.29, <italic>P</italic>=0.0067, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, blue). Intact GFP-injected mice also exhibited the highest number of attacks at ZT13 and the lowest number at ZT1 (ZT13: 19.38 ± 3.72, ZT1: 8.75 ± 2.30, <italic>P</italic>=0.0244, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, blue). This aggression propensity rhythm was completely lost in SPZ <italic>Vgat</italic>-deleted mice (number of attacks, ZT13: 18.63 ± 4.37, ZT1: 16.38 ± 2.21, <italic>P</italic>=0.99, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, red), and was accompanied by a significant increase in total time attacking at ZT1 compared to intact GFP-injected controls (deleted: 65.98 ± 8.13, intact: 24.94 ± 7.29, <italic>P</italic>=0.0055, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, red). Additionally, we found that attack latency was significantly affected (time X condition interaction, <italic>P</italic>=0.0362), with intact GFP-injected mice exhibiting a trend towards lower latencies at ZT13 compared to ZT1 (ZT13: 158.26 ± 41.32, ZT1: 284.26 ± 57.81, <italic>P</italic>=0.0605, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, blue), and SPZ <italic>Vgat</italic>-deleted mice exhibiting a trend towards decreased latency to attack at ZT1 compared to intact GFP-injected controls (deleted: 142.34 ± 22.95, intact: 284.26 ± 57.81, <italic>P</italic>=0.0683, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, red). Importantly, we also found that the lower propensity for aggression during the early resting phase in intact mice was not simply due to the direct effects of light. Specifically, control mice tested under free running conditions in constant darkness (DD) showed similar temporal differences in total time attacking between early subjective day and early subjective night [circadian time (CT)1: 12.47 ± 7.38, CT13: 27.30 ± 8.23, <italic>P</italic>=0.0305, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>], suggesting these rhythms are circadian in nature.</p>
<p id="P7">SPZ <italic>Vgat</italic> deletions also reduced the amplitude of entrained (under a 12–12 light-dark cycle, LD) and free running (in DD) rhythms of locomotor activity (LMA, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f–g</xref>), as well as the difference in day-night levels of plasma corticosterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Specifically, in LD conditions, SPZ <italic>Vgat</italic> deletions significantly blunted the elevated LMA counts observed in control mice during the dark period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), strongly so at ZT12 (deleted: 4.64 ± 0.66, intact: 7.84 ± 0.86), ZT13 (deleted: 4.61 ± 0.66, intact: 8.48 ± 2.13), and ZT23 (deleted: 3.48 ± 0.47, intact: 6.98 ± 1.53). Blunted elevation of plasma corticosterone levels at ZT13 as compared to controls was also observed (deleted: 13.82 ± 4.54, intact: 29.24 ± 8.31). Importantly, SPZ <italic>Vgat</italic> deletions did <italic>not</italic> significantly increase LMA counts (deleted: 1.24 ± 0.24, intact: 1.43 ± 0.26) or plasma corticosterone (deleted: 2.61 ± 0.72, intact: 1.98 ± 0.62) during the early light period (ZT1) when peak changes in attack behavior were observed, suggesting that the SPZ mediation of aggression propensity is independently regulated from LMA and plasma corticosterone rhythms. We should note that, although in some mice AAV-iCre-2A-Venus transduced cells in the PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), a structure extensively implicated in corticosterone regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, the mouse PV contains relatively few <italic>Vgat</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> neurons and hence its function was unlikely to be affected by Cre injections. Interestingly, we did not find any differences in entrained or free-running rhythms of body temperature (Tb, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), which is consistent with previous work demonstrating the dissociability of individual circadian rhythms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons inhibit VMH neurons and receive input from SCN<sup>VIP</sup> neurons</title>
<p id="P8">Given that the SPZ functions largely as a post-synaptic relay for the circadian clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, we sought to define the functional synaptic circuitry by which the SPZ may control daily rhythms of aggression. We first asked whether SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons have functional synaptic connections with neurons of the VMH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), a hypothalamic region known to regulate attack behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. To do this, we placed stereotaxically-guided injections of an AAV containing the gene for Cre-dependent expression of channelrhodopsin (ChR2, AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry) into the SPZ of mice engineered to express Cre in VGAT+ cells (<italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We then optogenetically mapped projections from SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) by recording light-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from randomly selected VMH neurons (ChR2 assisted circuit mapping, or CRACM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We detected light-evoked IPSCs, which were completely abolished by the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist bicuculline, in almost all (25 of 28) VMH neurons, confirming functional synaptic connectivity between SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> and VMH neurons. We next sought to establish functional synaptic connectivity between SCN<sup>VIP</sup> and VMH-projecting SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons (SPZ<sup>→VMH</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To do this, we placed stereotaxic injections of a Cre-dependent ChR2 fused with EYFP (AAV-DIO-ChR2-EYFP) into the SCN of <italic>VIP</italic>-IRES-Cre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> mice and a fluorescent retrograde tracer (CTb-555) into the VMH (to label SPZ<sup>→VMH</sup> neurons) of the same mice. We detected light-evoked GABAergic IPSCs in the majority of SPZ<sup>→VMH</sup> neurons (5 of 9), confirming functional synaptic connectivity between SCN<sup>VIP</sup> and SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons that project to the VMH. Our CRACM results therefore show that SCN<sup>VIP</sup> neurons provide GABAergic input to SPZ neurons that innervate the VMH and that SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons subsequently inhibit the VMH. This pathway provides a possible circuit substrate by which the SCN may modulate the activity of VMH neurons, including VMH neurons that regulate aggression.</p>
<p id="P9">To obtain a more detailed anatomic understanding of the SPZ<sup>GABA</sup>→VMH pathway, we injected an AAV coding for Cre-dependent expression of the anterograde tracer humanized <italic>Renilla</italic> Green Fluorescent Protein (AAV-FLEX-hrGFP) into the SPZ of <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d–f</xref>). Consistent with the foregoing optogenetic mapping experiments, we found that SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons densely innervate the central VMH (VMHc), and to a lesser extent the dorsomedial VMH (VMHdm) and ventrolateral VMH (VMHvl). Using subtraction methods across mice with different hrGFP injection sites, we found that VGAT+ neurons within the dSPZ predominately target the VMH, whereas VGAT+ neurons within the more ventral portions of the SPZ predominately target the DMH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). A similar topographic organization of SPZ projections was previously reported in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. When we constructed a heat map showing the regions of the SPZ in which <italic>Vgat</italic>-deletion produced maximal disruption of rhythms of aggression, the most critical region included the dSPZ, which maximally innervates the VMH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Importantly, we also noted that SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> projections show ramification and dense synaptic boutons among estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing neurons within the VMHvl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), which have previously been shown to regulate attack behavior in male mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. To examine whether SPZ projections to these cells form GABAergic synaptic connections we performed CRACM experiments using <italic>Esr1</italic>-2a-Cre mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Toward this end, Cre-independent ChR2 (AAV-CAG-ChR2-mCherry) was targeted to SPZ neurons and Esr1-expressing neurons were transduced with AAV-FLEX-hrGFP for their identification in brain slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). We detected light-evoked IPSCs, which were completely abolished by the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist bicuculline, in 10 out of 10 Esr1-expressing neurons, confirming direct functional synaptic connectivity between the SPZ neurons (which are nearly all GABAergic) and the VMHvl aggression locus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Dorsal SPZ<sup>→VMH</sup> neurons are active at ZT1 and acutely inhibiting them increases aggression</title>
<p id="P10">To determine whether low levels of aggressive behavior at ZT1 are associated with increased activity of SPZ<sup>→VMH</sup> neurons, we examined expression of Fos, a marker of neuronal excitation. First, we perfused control mice 90 min after ZT1 and found a high number of Fos-labeled cells in the dSPZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Using retrograde tracing with CTb, we next showed that these dSPZ neurons specifically project to the VMH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and are significantly more active at ZT1 compared to ZT13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b–c</xref>; t<sub>(16)</sub>=3.903, <italic>P</italic>=0.0013), altogether suggesting that low levels of aggression at ZT1 are gated by this dSPZ<sup>→VMH</sup> pathway.</p>
<p id="P11">Next, we examined the effects of acutely disrupting SPZ activity on aggression at ZT1 compared to ZT13. To inhibit SPZ neurons, we used a newly developed inhibitory viral vector that employs a mutated human glycine receptor in a Cre-dependent configuration (AAV-FLEX-hGlyR-mCherry; hGlyR-AAV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The hGlyR receptor is mutated to respond to the antiparasitic drug ivermectin (IVM), instead of its normal ligand glycine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We placed small bilateral injections of the hGlyR-AAV into the SPZ of <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice and then tested the effects of acute inhibition of SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons on aggression at either ZT1 or ZT13. At ZT1, mice showed significantly higher total time attacking [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, left; t<sub>(7)</sub>=4.404, <italic>P</italic>=0.0031], higher number of attacks [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, center; t<sub>(7)</sub>=4.615, <italic>P</italic>=0.0024], and lower attack latencies [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, right; t<sub>(7)</sub>=5.686, <italic>P</italic>s=0.0007] after the administration of IVM (5 mg/kg in propylene glycol) compared to vehicle (VEH). In contrast, at ZT13, IVM did not significantly change the total time attacking [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, left; t<sub>(7)</sub>=0.5467, <italic>P</italic>=0.6016], number of attacks [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, center; t<sub>(7)</sub>=1.93, <italic>P</italic>=0.0949], or attack latency [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, right; t<sub>(7)</sub>=1.118, <italic>P</italic>=0.3005] compared to VEH. We also found that this effect was not due to a phase-dependent effect of IVM at ZT1, as control animals did not show increased aggression compared to VEH conditions at this time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">To verify that the hGlyR-AAV and IVM inhibited SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons, we examined Fos expression in the dSPZ (which was among the most heavily weighted areas in the heat maps of our injection sites, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Importantly, we found that <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice injected with hGlyR-AAV in the SPZ and receiving IVM showed a significant decrease in the number of cFos expressing cells at ZT1 in the dSPZ compared to mice receiving VEH [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i–j</xref>; t<sub>(4)</sub>=3.497, <italic>P</italic>=0.025], indicating that hGlyR-AAV and IVM successfully inhibited dSPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons. Although <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice as a substrain were less aggressive overall than <italic>Vgat</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice, the acute, reversible neuronal inhibition permitted a within-animal design, which improved the sensitivity of the aggression assay, and demonstrated that inhibition of dSPZ neurons increased aggression at ZT1, recapitulating the results following chronic disruption of SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurotransmission.</p>

<title>An intra-VMH circuit receives circadian input and drives aggression</title>
<p id="P13">While SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons project directly to VMHvl neurons, our mapping experiments show that SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons most densely innervate the VMHc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether VMHc neurons engage and consequently excite VMHvl neurons, which then drive aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), since the vast majority of VMH neurons are glutamatergic (VGLUT2-expressing)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and hence excitatory. Importantly, such a SCN→SPZ→VMHc→VMHvl circuit could thus form a parallel pathway that also regulates daily rhythms of aggression propensity. To investigate this possibilty, we used <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre mice (PACAP, peptide pituitary adenylate cyclase activation polypeptide), which express <italic>Pacap</italic> (<italic>Adcyap1</italic>), and hence Cre-recombinase, in many VMHc neurons, but in much fewer VMHdm or VMHvl neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We first assessed axonal projections of PACAP neurons in the VMHc (VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons) by stereotaxically injecting the anterograde tracer AAV-DIO-Synaptophysin-mCherry into the VMHc of <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre mice. We found that both the VMHc and the VMHvl contained many VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In contrast, we found only a few VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> terminals in the VMHdm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">We next ascertained functional synaptic connectivity between VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> and VMHdm, VMHc, or VMHvl neurons using CRACM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). For this, we placed injections of AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry into the VMHc of <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre mice and recorded light-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from ChR2/mCherry-negative neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Consistent with the tracing data, we detected light-evoked EPSCs in almost all VMHc and VMHvl neurons (13 out of 15 neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In contrast, we detected light-evoked EPSCs in only 1 out of 13 VMHdm neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Thus VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons densely innervate and excite VMHc and VMHvl neurons, but not VMHdm neurons.</p>
<p id="P15">To determine if acute stimulation of VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons drives behavioral aggression, we placed bilateral injections of Cre-dependent excitatory chemoreceptor (AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry; hM3Dq) into the VMHc of <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Administration of the hM3Dq ligand, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 1 mg/kg in saline), significantly increased total time attacking compared to VEH [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>; t<sub>(5)</sub>=3.337, <italic>P</italic>=0.0206]. Strong induction of cFos served as further confirmation that CNO effectively activated VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). In agreement with our tracing and CRACM experiments, acute activation of VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons also increased cFos expression in VMHvl neurons, strongly suggesting that the increase in aggression was driven by this intra-VMH connection.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P16">Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that aggression propensity in male mice exhibits a daily rhythm. We then show using genetically targeted disruption and inhibition that this rhythm in aggression propensity requires normal functioning of SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> neurons and is independent of LMA and plasma corticosterone rhythms. Using the CRACM approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, we uncover a novel and functional polysynaptic circuit connecting the SCN clock with VMHvl neurons known to regulate attack behavior. We also show a parallel pathway from the SPZ through PACAP-expressing neurons within the VMHc that are highly interconnected with the VMHvl, forming an intra-VMH circuit that, upon activation, also drives attack behavior.</p>
<p id="P17">Agonistic encounters between conspecific males are characterized by the progression from an investigative motivational phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, in which the sex, size, and strength of the opponent are determined, to a consummatory phase comprised of attack behavior or retreat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and this progression is generally conceptualized as an escalation in the intensity of a continuous internal emotional state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Our data strongly suggest that input from the SCN clock to VMHvl neurons, either directly from SPZ neurons or indirectly through VMHc neurons, may increase or decrease the rate of this progression and the intensity or duration of consummatory attack behavior depending on the time of day of the encounter. Indeed, because the VMHc has also been shown to be relevant in other emotionally related behaviors associated with fear and anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, it is possible that this novel circuit may modulate circadian rhythms in the propensity for such behaviors as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P18">Since SCN activity in mice is high during the day and less active at night<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, it is interesting that dSPZ<sup>→VMH</sup> neurons, which receive GABAergic input from the SCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a–c</xref>) are more active at ZT1 compared to ZT13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a–c</xref>). We therefore believe that it is the summation of inhibitory GABAergic SCN→dSPZ input across the day that leads to low levels of dSPZ→VMH inhibiton, and therefore increased aggression propensity, during the end of the light and the early dark period (CT11 and 13, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>; ZT13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b–d</xref>). Furthermore, we believe the reduction of SCN activity during the night allows for the summation of GABAergic dSPZ→VMH inhibition over the dark period, leading to the lowest aggression propensity during the early light period (ZT1). A previous study examining SCN and SPZ multiunit activity (MUA) in mice reported that SPZ MUA was highest during the dark period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, antiphase to the day-active SCN, however the recording sites depicted in a <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure</xref> for that paper appear to be rostral and ventral to the dSPZ region which we show is highly active at ZT1. The SPZ is known to be composed of multiple subregions with differing input and output pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and which appear to modulate dissociable circadian rhythms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, the temporal pattern of activity for each SPZ subregion may be influenced by several other factors, such as intra-SPZ connectivity from other subregions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, direct input from the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, peptidergic input from different subpopulations within the SCN (VIP, AVP, etc.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, as well as input from other neural systems. Regardless of the underlying cause of increased dSPZ activity at ZT1, our results demonstrate that GABAergic transmission from these neurons serves to inhibit the propensity for aggression during the early resting period, most likely via their projections to the VMH.</p>
<p id="P19">A better understanding of how the SCN clock and its primary synaptic relay, the SPZ, modulate aggressive behavior will have important implications for treating patients with neurological disorders associated with circadian dysfunction and physical and verbal aggression. For instance, patients suffering from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease frequently exhibit sundowning syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, a poorly understood clinical phenomenon characterized by agitation, aggression, and delirium during the early evening hours. These symptoms take a tremendous toll on the patient’s caregivers and represent a common reason for institutionalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Our results showing that disruption of SPZ<sup>GABA</sup> output produces increased behavioral aggression during the early resting phase (morning for mice) are temporally consistent with the increased aggression seen during sundowning, suggesting that the SCN→SPZ→VMH pathway may be compromised in such neurodegenerative diseases. An examination of neuropathological changes to this pathway in AD and other neurological conditions may provide insight into future interventions that could greatly improve the quality of life for both patients and caregivers.</p>

<title>Resident-intruder paradigm</title>
<p id="P25">All “resident” mice (<italic>Vgat</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>, C57BL6/J, <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre, or <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre) were sexually experienced adult males (4–6 months old at testing), singly housed and isolated from other males for at least 1 month, which produces a territorially aggressive phenotype. For behavioral tests we pre-adapted resident mice to clear cylindrical home containers (diameter, 20 cm; height, 25 cm) for at least 5 days. All residents were maintained in these home containers inside light-tight isolation chambers under a 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle with lights on at 800 (zeitgeber time 0, ZT0). Chambers provided ventilation, ambient temperature of 22±2°C, and visual isolation from other mice. Mice received food (Lab Diet) and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Ambient lighting was provided by a white-light LED matrix, containing 18 single LEDs (light peak 490/540nm) using a phosphor layer (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet) on the surface of a blue (Gallium Nitride) chip (The LED Light, Inc.). For each test, residents were moved in their home containers to an adjacent testing room illuminated with red light (GE lighting, Red LED, A15, 620–640 nm), which does not alter circadian phase nor disrupt affective behaviors in nocturnal rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, and given 5 min to acclimate. A male group-housed and sexually naïve “intruder” mouse (C57BL6/J), maintained on the same LD cycle in a separate chamber, was introduced into the resident’s home container and behavioral interactions were video recorded for 10 min using 2 cameras from different lateral angles. No other mice were in the testing room during each test. Residents and intruders were always novel to one another and were of similar ages and weights.</p>
<p id="P26">We tested these mice under red light conditions, instead of under normal room lighting or only in the dark, in order to maintain the same level of visual cues across all time points. For instance, had half of our behavioral tests been performed in the light (at ZT1 and ZT7), resident mice would have had additional visual cues to aide them in attacking the intruder. On the other hand, had we instead put mice into a lighted environment during their normal dark phase (at ZT13 and ZT19), we might have actually induced sleep/inactivity (a phenomenon called negative masking) since mice are nocturnal, which would not have been conducive for measuring aggression. We do not believe that taking these mice out of a lighted environment and testing them under only red light biased our observed day-night (ZT1 vs ZT13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b–d</xref>) differences in aggression, because we saw similar temporal differences in attack behavior between CT1 and CT13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>) in our control mice that had been housed in constant darkness and then moved to red light conditions for testing in free running conditions (see below).</p>
<p id="P27">Littermate <italic>Vgat</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice (n=40) injected with AAV-iCre-2A-Venus or AAV-GFP into the SPZ were tested at 1 of 4 different time points: ZT1 (between 845–930), ZT7 (between 1445–1530), ZT13 (between 2045–2145), ZT19 (245–330). The order of time points was counter-balanced across all residents using a Latin square design. Following each test, home containers were changed and mice received 3–5 days before being tested again at the next time point until all 4 trials were completed. Mice were randomly assigned to experimental/control groups, and to which order they were tested.</p>
<p id="P28">Littermate <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice (n=23) injected with AAV-FLEX-hGlyR-mCherry into the SPZ received either IVM (5 mg/kg in propylene glycol) or VEH, administered via IP injection at ZT1 or ZT13. Because IVM has a long half-life and minor off-target effects (drowsiness) that are no longer present after 24 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, we tested these mice using the same resident-intruder assay, as described above, at ZT1 or ZT13, respectively, on the following day. We allowed two weeks following each test to ensure drug clearance and then mice were injected with the other compound (IVM or VEH) and tested again 24 h later, serving as within-animal controls. Half of each group of mice received IVM first and half received VEH first, with mice being randomly assigned to each group. As an additional control for the phase-dependent effects of IVM, we tested an additional group of <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice (n=10) injected with ChR2 into the SPZ (which does not respond to IVM) at ZT1 using the same methods described above.</p>
<p id="P29">Littermate <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre mice (n=6) injected with AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry into the VMH received CNO (1 mg/kg in saline) or VEH, administered IP, 1h before being tested with resident-intruder assays at ZT1 as described above. Mice received 3–5 days to allow for drug clearance and were then injected with the other compound and tested again, serving as within-animal controls. Half of these mice received CNO first and half received VEH first, with mice being randomly assigned to each group. Previous studies have shown that CNO has no effect on aggressive behavior in either WT C57BL6 mice or control mice injected with an AAV not containing hM3Dq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P30">Littermate intact C57BL6/J (n=15) were used to assess rhythms of aggression propensity under free running conditons (constant darkness, DD). Mice were put into DD, extending from the end of their normal dark period, for 2 full days and then tested at 1 of 4 time points: CT1 (between 845–930), CT11 (between 1845–1930), CT13 (between 2045–2145), or CT23 (between 645–730). Following each test, home containers were changed and mice were put back into LD for at least 3 days to reentrain, before being put back into DD for 2 full days and tested again at the next time point until all 4 trials were completed (6–8 days between each test). The order of tests for each mouse was counterbalanced using a Latin square design, with mice randomly assigned to each order. Although we would expect the internal phase of each mouse to drift in DD due to its period not being exactly 24 h, our data for average period length in DD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) from intact mice on a C57BL6 background would suggest an average drift of only about 15 min across 3 days [using the equation: (24 h – period length)* 60 min * 3 days]. Intruders used in these experiments were maintained on their normal LD schedule.</p>
<p id="P31">Recorded videos of resident-intruder tests were manually scored blind to the condition of each resident mouse and the time of day of the test. Videos were sequenced and the total time each resident spent engaged in attack behavior (including biting, chasing, lunging, wrestling, and boxing) was quantified on a frame-by-frame basis using the “Behavior Annotator” Matlab script developed by researchers at the California Institute of Technology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Video_Datasets/CRIM13/CRIM13/Main.html">http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Video_Datasets/CRIM13/CRIM13/Main.html</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.

<title>Cell Counting</title>
<p id="P36">All cell counts were analyzed blind to the time of day of perfusion and the condition of each animal. For quantification of day-night differences in Fos expression, adult male <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice, housed on a 12:12 LD cycle in chambers as described above, were perfused 90 min after ZT1 or ZT13 (n=9 per group). Bilateral images of the SPZ from sections immunostained for cFos were imported into ImageJ (NIH) and labeled neurons were counted in the last 2 sections containing the dSPZ using the Cell Counter plugin.</p>
<p id="P37">For quantification of differences of cFos expression following chemogenetic inhibition, a subset of <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre injected with AAV-FLEX-hGlyR-mCherry into the SPZ and tested for aggression, as described above, were given IVM (n=3) or VEH (n=3) at ZT1, and then perfused 90 min after ZT1 on the following day. These mice were housed on a 12:12 LD cycle in chambers as described above, and were given at least 2 weeks after aggression testing before these perfusions. Unilateral images of the SPZ from sections immunostained for dsRed and cFos were imported into ImageJ. Double-labeled neurons were counted in last 2 sections containing the dSPZ sections using the Cell Counter plugin. An Abercrombie correction was applied to all cell counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Heat map generation</title>
<p id="P38">Each experimental mouse was given an aggression score based on the magnitude of its total time attacking at ZT1 compared to the control mean at this time. Each injection site showing the extent of transduced neurons [identified using immunolabeling against Cre (Vgat<sup>lox/lox</sup> mice) or dsRed (<italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice)] was digitally projected onto representative templates at three rostral→caudal levels throughout the anterior hypothalamus, constructed using immunolabeling against VIP and AVP (to better delineate the SCN and PV). Each mouse’s injection site was weighted by its aggression score, and weighted sites for all mice were overlaid. Using a custom script (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</ext-link>, see Supplementary Software) the aggression score was summed over the group (pixel-by-pixel over each overlaid image), and heat maps were created demarcating brain regions most associated with increased aggression at ZT1, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA Probe In Situ Hybridization</title>
<p id="P39">Sections were cut in RNAse-free conditions, preserved in RNAlater® RNA Stabilization Solution, and frozen until use. Sections were washed in RNAse free PBS containing diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) then incubated in hybridization buffer for 1 h at 53°C. VGAT probe was denatured at 80°C for 10 min then incubated in the hybridization buffer overnight at 53°C. Sections were successively washed in 2× standard saline citrate (SSC) with 50% formamide solution and in 1× SSC 50% with formamide solution, both at 53°C. After tris buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.5) washes, sections were incubated in 1% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) for 30 min, then incubated overnight in peroxidase conjugated DIG antibody (1:500, Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Following TBS washes, sections were reacted with Tyramide signal amplification (TSA) Cy3 (1:50, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) for 30 min.

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p id="P40">All data were imported into Prism 7 (Graphpad) and normality was assessed using D’Agostino-Pearson and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, to verify the appropriateness of the following statistical analyses. For <italic>Vgat</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice, aggression data scored during resident intruder testing were compared across time and between SPZ conditions using two-way repeated measures ANOVA, with Sidak tests for multiple comparisons serving as <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses. Sample sizes were not predetermined using formal statistical tests for <italic>Vgat</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice, however, <italic>post hoc</italic> power calculations (G*Power software) using means and standard deviations from these analyses revealed this study was powered to detect respective effect sizes with &gt;90% reliability. Because of natural variability within strains, not all mice show aggression, and we set a criteria before these experiments of at least one attack bout in at least half (50%) of all tests for inclusion in statistical analyses. Interestingly, only 2 <italic>Vgat</italic>-deleted mice failed to meet criteria for inclusion, whereas 6 intact controls failed. Overall, 80.0% of <italic>Vgat<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice met criteria for inclusion.</p>
<p id="P41">LMA and Tb data from <italic>Vgat</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice was first analyzed and plotted using Clocklab (Coulbourne Instruments, Natick, MA). For each mouse, we obtained LMA and Tb rhythm period (Chi-squared periodogram) and cosinor amplitude for the last 7 days in LD and the last 7 days in DD, and a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare between lighting and SPZ conditions with Sidak tests for multiple comparisons serving as <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses. We excluded data from 2 mice (1 SPZ <italic>Vgat</italic>-deleted and 1 intact SPZ GFP-injected) due to a computer failure during the DD recording. Mean LMA counts and Tb per hour were calculated for 7 days in LD and analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Sidak tests for multiple comparisons as <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses. For comparing differences in day-night plasma corticosterone, two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used with Sidak tests for multiple comparisons as <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses.</p>
<p id="P42">Aggression data from <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice was compared between IVM and VEH conditions using separate paired t tests for ZT1, ZT13, and ChR2-injected control groups. For <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre mice, aggression data were compared between CNO and VEH conditions using paired t-tests. Sample sizes were not predetermined, however <italic>post hoc</italic> power calculations using means and standard deviations from <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre, and <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre, revealed we were powered to detect respective effect sizes with &gt;90%, and 80%, reliability, respectively. For C57BL6/J mice, differences in aggression data between CT1 and CT13 were compared using planned comparsions (paired t tests). Sample size for C57BL6/J mice was predetermined (G*Power software) using the effect size, means and standard deviations of previously tested intact control mice on a C57BL6 background and a power level of 80%. We set the same criteria (at least one attack bout in 50% of test trials) for inclusion in these analyses. Overall, 72.7% of <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice met criteria for inclusion (24 of 33), while 9 failed and were excluded. All 6 <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre mice met criteria for inclusion. For C57BL6/J mice, 80% met criteria (12 of 15), while 3 failed and were excluded.</p>
<p id="P43">For cell counting in <italic>Vgat</italic>-IRES-Cre mice, differences in Fos expression were compared between ZT1 and ZT13 conditions and differences in dsRed/cFos-labeled cells were compared between IVM and VEH, conditions using unpaired t-tests.

<p id="P44">Mice (9–12 weeks at testing) were deeply anesthetized, decapitated and brains quickly removed into ice-cold cutting solution consisting of (in mM): 72 sucrose, 83 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 22 glucose, 5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>, measured osmolarity 310 – 320 mOsm/l. 300-µm-thick coronal sections were cut with Leica VT1000S vibratome and incubated in oxygenated cutting solution at 34 °C for 45 min. Slices were transferred to oxygenated aCSF (126 mM NaCl, 21.4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose) and stored in the same solution at room temperature (20–24°C) for 60 min prior to recording. A single slice was placed in the recording chamber where it was continuously superfused at a rate of 3–4 ml per min with oxygenated aCSF. Neurons were visualized with an upright microscope (SliceScope, Scientifica) equipped with infrared-differential interference contrast and fluorescence optics. Borosilicate glass microelectrodes (5–7MΩ) were filled with internal solution.</p>
<p id="P45">Light-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs were recorded in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode, with membrane potential clamped at V<sub>h</sub>=−70 mV. Light-evoked IPSCs were recorded using a CsCl-based internal solution consisting of (in mM): 140 CsCl, 1 BAPTA, 10 HEPES, 5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP (pH 7.35 adjusted with NaOH; 295 mOsm·kg<sup>−1</sup>). Light-evoked EPSCs were recorded using Cs<sup>+</sup>-based internal solution consisting of (in mM): 135 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.4 Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH; 295 mOsm·kg<sup>−1</sup>) in presence of bicuculline (10 µM).</p>
<p id="P46">The light-evoked EPSC/IPSC detection protocol consisted of four blue light pulses (473 nm wavelength, 0.5–5 msec) administered 1 s apart during the first 4 s of an 8-s sweep, repeated for a total of 30 sweeps. Evoked EPSCs/IPSCs with short latency (≤6ms) upon light stimulation were considered light-driven. As discussed by others, such currents are most likely monosynaptic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Light-evoked IPSCs were recorded in presence of CNQX (10 µM) and D-AP5 (50 µM) to block polysynaptic glutamatergic excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Due to the high local connectivity, light-driven monosynaptic EPSCs recorded from VMH neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), could be influenced by intra-nucleus polysynaptic glutamatergic excitation. It is noteworthy that this, however, does not change our overall finding that VMHc neurons are much more likely to connect to VMHvl neurons (13 out of 15 neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) rather than VMHdm neurons (1 out 13 neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Number of animals used for CRACM experiments: SPZ<sup>GABA</sup>→VMH, n=3; SCN<sup>VIP</sup>→SPZ<sup>VMH</sup>, n=2; VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup>→VMHc, VMHdm or VMHvl, n=2 for each; SPZ→VMH<sup>Esr1</sup>, n=4.</p>
<p id="P47">All recordings were made using Multiclamp 700B amplifier, and data were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. To photostimulate ChR2-positive fibers, a LED light source (473 nm) was used. Blue light was focused onto the back aperture of the microscope objective, producing wide-field exposure around recorded cell of 10–15mW per mm<sup>2</sup>. Light power at specimen was measured using an optical power meter PM100D (Thorlabs). Light output was controlled by a programmable pulse stimulator, Master-8 (A.M.P.I.) and pClamp 10.2 software (Axon Instruments). All recordings were analyzed offline using Clampfit 10.</p>

VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons in <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre mice were transduced with AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry. Light-evoked EPSCs were detected in mCherry-negative neurons in the VMHc (representative of 2 mice from different litters) and VMHvl (representative of 2 mice from different litters), but not in the VMHdm (representative of 2 mice from different litters). (d) VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons in <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre mice were bilaterally transduced with AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry. Representative of 6 mice. (e) CNO/hM3Dq-mediated stimulation of VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons in <italic>Pacap</italic>-IRES-Cre mice increased total time attacking (n=6, paired t test, two-tailed, t<sub>(5)</sub>=3.337, <sup>†</sup><italic>P</italic>=0.0206). Means ± s.e.m. (f) CNO administration 2 h before perfusion produced a robust Fos response in VMHc<sup>PACAP</sup> neurons expressing AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry (immunostained for dsRed) as well as in hM3Dq-negative VMHvl neurons. Representative of 3 mice.</p>
