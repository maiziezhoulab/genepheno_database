<abstract>
<p>Calcium channel subunits, including <italic>CACNA1C</italic>, have been associated with multiple psychiatric disorders. Specifically, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have repeatedly identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1006737 in intron 3 of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> to be strongly associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Here, we show that rs1006737 marks a quantitative trait locus for <italic>CACNA1C</italic> transcript levels. We test 16 SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with rs1007637 and find one, rs4765905, consistently showing allele-dependent regulatory function in reporter assays. We find allele-specific protein binding for 13 SNPs including rs4765905. Using protein microarrays, we identify several proteins binding â¥3 SNPs, but not control sequences, suggesting possible functional interactions and combinatorial haplotype effects. Finally, using circular chromatin conformation capture, we show interaction of the disease-associated region including the 16 SNPs with the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> promoter and other potential regulatory regions. Our results elucidate the pathogenic relevance of one of the best-supported risk loci for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex psychiatric disorder with heritability estimated to be around 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref002">2</xref>]. Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have strongly associated over 100 loci with SZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref003">3</xref>]. The genes imputed to these loci are highly expressed in the brain cortex and include many ion channel subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref004">4</xref>]. However, in most cases the direct relationship between the variants demonstrating statistical association with disease risk and the gene they modulate remains to be established.</p>
<p>The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1006737 has been associated with risk for both SZ and bipolar disorder (BP). The two diseases have a degree of overlapping symptomatology and it was long suspected that they may share genetic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref006">6</xref>]. Recent GWAS have decisively confirmed this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref008">8</xref>]. The SNP rs1006737 is located in intron 3 of <italic>CACNA1C</italic>, along with two other SNPs associated with psychiatric disease. The SNP rs2007044 is associated with SZ and has an r<sup>2</sup> = 0.788 with rs1006737 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref003">3</xref>]. The less correlated SNP, rs4765913 (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.4 with rs1006737), has shown a strong association in a combined BP and SZ sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>CACNA1C</italic> encodes the alpha subunit of an L-type voltage gated calcium channel. Calcium channel subunit genes have been implicated in multiple psychiatric disorders, including SZ and BP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref010">10</xref>]. Calcium signaling is involved in neurotransmitter release and regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref011">11</xref>]. Disruption of these functions may play an important role in psychiatric disease.</p>
<p>SNPs identified by GWAS for complex diseases, such as SZ and BP, most often lie in non-coding sequences and are enriched for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), suggesting that dysregulation of transcriptional control plays a role in complex disease pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref012">12</xref>]. The SZ and BP-associated variant in <italic>CACNA1C</italic> is located in intron 3, more than 100 kb from each flanking exon, and does not have any coding variants in significant linkage disequilibrium (LD). We considered, therefore, that this SNP, rs1006737, or one of the many non-coding SNPs in LD with it, might regulate <italic>CACNA1C</italic> expression in the brain. Differences in regulatory activity between the two alleles might cause downstream changes that modulate risk of psychiatric disease.</p>
<p>Here, we characterize rs1006737 and all SNPs in strong LD in four ways, with the ultimate goal of explaining the association with psychiatric disease. First, we show that rs1006737 (and therefore all SNPs in high LD) is an eQTL for <italic>CACNA1C</italic> expression. Second, we test all 16 SNPs in high LD for differences between alleles in driving reporter gene expression and identify one, rs4765905, that consistently shows such differences. Third, we show by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) that many of these SNP-containing sequences bind nuclear extract proteins in an allele-specific manner, and using protein microarrays we report on specific candidate proteins. Finally, we characterize the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> regulatory landscape using chromatin conformation capture followed by next generation sequencing (4C-seq) and demonstrate protein-mediated interactions between the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> promoter and the disease-associated interval and a few other regions of potential interest.</p>

<title>eQTL Analysis in Normal Brain Tissue</title>
<p>We genotyped rs1006737and measured mRNA expression in 185 samples from the superior temporal gyrus (STG). This region is implicated in auditory processing, language, and social cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref013">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref018">18</xref>] and shows reduction in grey matter volume in patients with BP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref019">19</xref>] and first-episode SZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref020">20</xref>]. Given the extensive alternative splicing reported for <italic>CACNA1C</italic> in the UCSC genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>) and GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank</ext-link>), we decided to restrict our search to selected classes of transcripts. Following the designation introduced by Tang, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref021">21</xref>], we designed qPCR primers to assay three classes of splice variants previously shown to encode distinct <italic>CACNA1C</italic> isoforms that produce calcium channel subunits with different activation potentials. Transcripts where exon 32 splices to 33 are called WT class, transcripts where an alternative internal donor splice site is used in exon 32 are B class, and transcripts skipping exon 32 are D class. The primer design is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157086.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. We found that the risk allele (A) of rs1006737 was correlated with progressively decreased expression of all three classes of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> transcripts (WT class p = 1.14*10<sup>â3</sup>; B class p = 2.06*10<sup>â3</sup>; D class p = 8.35 *10<sup>â3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157086.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Bigos, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref022">22</xref>] had also previously reported a correlation between the risk genotype and the expression of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> in a study performed on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 269 brains, assayed using microarrays that measured the combined levels of all splice variants. That study reported an effect in the opposite direction to the one we observe in the STG. To test whether this is a region specific effect, we extended our analysis to include 87 independent samples from the DLPFC. In this smaller sample, we observed a non-significant trend for the risk allele (A) towards increased expression for all three <italic>CACNA1C</italic> transcripts, the same direction as Bigos, <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157086.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The potential pathological relevance of this region is reinforced by the observation that patients with SZ show activity deficits by fMRI in the DLPFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref023">23</xref>] and by its involvement in executive functions, including working memory, decision making, and organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref024">24</xref>].</p>

<title>Enhancer Activity Assays</title>
<p>The disease-associated SNP rs1006737 marks a large haplotype block (~68 kb), with multiple SNPs in high LD; any one (or more) of which might be responsible for the observed disease association and the correlation with the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> transcript levels. To identify those functional SNPs, we tested each SNP for enhancer activity by dual luciferase reporter (DLR) assays in two different cell lines: SK-N-SH cells, which are derived from a human neuroblastoma metastasis and HEK293 cells, which despite being derived from kidney show a similar transcriptional profile to neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref025">25</xref>]. We tested in total 16 SNPs for allele-specific regulatory activity. Fourteen SNPs were correlated with rs1006737 at an r<sup>2</sup> of 0.8 or higher (rs7965923, rs769087, rs1006737, rs2159100, rs12315711, rs11062170, rs4765905, rs758170, rs10774035, rs10774036, rs10744560, rs12311439, rs1024582, rs4298967), while another two were included (rs34382810 and rs2370414) because of their physical proximity (&lt;600 bp) with rs7965923 and rs10774035, respectively. Their r<sup>2</sup> with rs1006737 was &gt;0.7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157086.s006">S1 Table</xref>). In order to maximally maintain the genomic context, we cloned ~1 kb intervals encompassing each SNP into a reporter construct, upstream of an SV40 promoter driving firefly luciferase expression. In four instances, two SNPs were located within 1 kb of each other, so they were assayed in the same construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157086.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). As these pairs of SNPs are also in high LD and physical proximity, we tested together only the two risk alleles or the two non-risk alleles of each SNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157086.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The potentially positive results for SNPs rs12315711, rs4765905, rs12311439, and rs1024582 directed us to further scrutinize these results by performing the assays multiple times in each of the two cell lines. We also included rs2159100 in the repeat assays although it showed no allele-specific difference in enhancer activity, to attempt to reproduce the findings from Roussos, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref026">26</xref>]. The SNPs that originally gave weaker results (rs12315711, rs12311439, and rs1024582) did not replicate in the repeat assays. SNP rs2159100 did not show any consistent allele-specific regulatory activity. SNP rs4765905, however, consistently showed significantly reduced expression of the luciferase reporter gene with the risk allele (C) in SK-N-SH cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157086.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In HEK293 cells, while rs4765905 often showed significant differences, the direction was not consistent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157086.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Protein Binding Assays</title>
<p>To further characterize allele-specific regulatory effects, we assayed nuclear protein interactions for all 16 SNP-containing sequences by EMSA using nuclear extracts from HEK293 and SK-N-SH cell lines. We found that all sequences could bind nuclear proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> and that 13 of the 16 show allele-specific differences in protein binding affinity. We reproduced this and confirmed specificity of protein binding by competing out each radiolabeled allele with the reciprocal allele non-labeled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0157086.t001">Table 1</xref>). The variant rs4765905, for which we found consistent differential enhancer effects in the DLR assay in SK-N-SH cells, showed two shift bands presumably corresponding to two different protein-binding patterns. The risk allele (C) showed stronger binding for the binding pattern migrating higher as compared to the non-risk allele (G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157086.g003">Fig 3</xref>). After quantification using ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref027">27</xref>], the ratio of top to bottom band intensity was 6.70 for the risk allele and 0.91 for the non-risk allele in HEK293 cells and 4.47 vs. 0.75 in SK-N-SH cells, respectively.</p>

<p>To identify the proteins capable of binding the sequences that contained these SNPs, we utilized a protein microarray containing 4,215 transcription factor and nuclear proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref028">28</xref>]. Consistent with the EMSA results, all assayed sequences bound to one or more proteins. Moreover, some proteins showed allele-dependent capacity to bind (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157086.s007">S2 Table</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that some proteins bound multiple of the assayed SNP-containing sequences. To exclude that this resulted from proteins that bind DNA promiscuously or artifacts of our array, we applied two filters. The first filter, addressing promiscuously binding proteins, was based on previously published data where we tested 460 DNA motifs on an earlier version of the array containing 1,017 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref030">30</xref>]. The second, addressing artifacts of the current array, was based on three negative control sequence motifs selected from those in the published experiment that did not bind any of our candidate proteins. After removing proteins binding more than six (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">methods</xref> for justification) of the 460 DNA motifs (&gt;1.3%) or any of the three negative controls, we found that five proteins binding between three and seven SNPs remained: PKNOX2, PRNP, EIF1AD, GADD45A, ZKSCAN5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0157086.t002">Table 2</xref>). An additional 14 proteins did not bind our negative control sequences, but were not present on the earlier version of the array, so we have no more data on their frequency of DNA binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157086.s007">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Circular Chromatin Conformation Capture and sequencing (4C-seq)</title>
<p>Based on our underlying hypothesis that <italic>CACNA1C</italic> is the cognate gene with which the disease-associated interval and corresponding eQTL interacts, we performed 4C-seq to describe DNA-DNA interactions within this gene. In this analysis we utilize two different viewpoints (bait sequence) as candidate cognate promoters for interactions with the disease-associated SNPs. The first was the established primary <italic>CACNA1C</italic> promoter. The second was the promoter of an alternative transcript previously shown to express a short part of the 3â end of the gene resulting in a peptide called CCAT with transcription factor activity that affects the expression of the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> gene itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref032">32</xref>]. We performed experiments on SK-N-SH and HEK293 cells. To confirm initial positive results for the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> promoter experiments, we utilized three different restriction enzymes in independent experiments on SK-N-SH cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Identifying how DNA variants influence the risk for disease is a major goal in human genetics and is becoming increasingly important as GWAS start to produce large amounts of statistical associations without conclusively identifying the underlying genes and mechanisms. Our data support that the associations between rs1006737 and SZ and BP are likely due to changes in the expression of the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> gene. Two other SNPs in intron 3 of <italic>CACNA1C</italic>, rs2007044 and rs4765913, have been associated with SZ and BP, respectively. They both show at least moderate LD with our lead SNP, enhancing the evidence that this region is involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disease.</p>
<p>Here, we report that the risk allele (A) of rs1006737 is correlated with decreased expression of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> in the STG. In the DLPFC we observe, with a smaller sample size, a non-significant trend in the same direction as Bigos, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref022">22</xref>]. Although our findings in the DLPFC are consistent with a previous report by Bigos, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref022">22</xref>], there are significant differences. The prior study had a larger sample size, did not discriminate between transcripts, and found a significant correlation between risk allele (A) and increased <italic>CACNA1C</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Correlation between the disease-associated SNP and the geneâs expression was also reported by Rousos, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref026">26</xref>], using multiple public data sets, including the data of Bigos, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref022">22</xref>], yet with no details on strength or direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref026">26</xref>]. Another study of post mortem brain samples found that the risk allele (A) of rs1006737 is correlated with decreased expression of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> in the cerebellum, but there was no correlation in the parietal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref033">33</xref>]. Furthermore, in a study of induced neuron (iN) cells, the risk allele (A) of rs1006737 was correlated with increased expression of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref034">34</xref>]. These results suggest there may be differences between brain regions, which may reflect the importance of finely tuned regulation of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> in the brain.</p>
<p>Our effort to identify specific variant sequences driving the association with transcript levels and disease risk produced interesting new pieces of information. First, we identify one of the 16 tested variant sequences, the sequence including rs4765905, as showing consistent allele-specific effects on driving reporter gene expression in a human neuroblastoma cell line. There are undoubtedly many reasons for false negatives in reporter assays, so we do not consider this an exclusion of the remaining sequences, but rather a reason to focus attention to rs4765905. It is quite possible that other sequences, in cis or trans, variant or not, may participate in the regulation of <italic>CACNA1C</italic>, perhaps even interacting with rs4765905 in the genomic context of the gene, but are not sufficient to drive gene expression alone when transfected into the cell in a reporter gene construct.</p>
<p>Of note, previous work by Roussos, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref026">26</xref>] found another SNP, rs2159100, to show allele-specific activity in reporter assays in both HEK293 and Neuro2A cells. We tested this SNP in HEK293 cells in five independent experiments but did not see the same effect. Note, however, that in our experiments the constructs contained the SV40 promoter, rather than a minimal promoter as tested by Roussous, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref026">26</xref>], and each of our tests involved transfecting four independent DNA preparations of each construct. The latter safeguards against false positives, especially since the DNA prep efficiency can systematically influence the results of replicates, keeping them from being true biological replicates. Either or both of these differences might explain the disagreement.</p>
<p>While rs4765905 showed significant allelic effects with consistent direction in SK-N-SH cells, this was not the case for HEK293 cells. Interestingly, while often showing a significant effect, the direction was not consistent. This result might once more reflect complex regulation of <italic>CACNA1C</italic>, similar to the differences we observed between STG and DLPFC. It is possible that unknown subtle variables affect the regulatory activity of these sequences, which in addition to the effect of the sequence variants, makes it difficult to consistently capture the differences experimentally. This might be a particularity of HEK293 cells that are known to have a heterogeneous and unstable karyotype and lack a strong tissue-specific gene expression signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref035">35</xref>]. This particularity might explain our discrepancies with the data of Roussos, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref026">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, for SK-N-SH cells, this SNP showed a consistent and significant effect over three independent experiments.</p>
<p>Our EMSA results support that many of the disease-associated SNPs in <italic>CACNA1C</italic> differentially bind nuclear proteins. Although there is no data on how often this might happen for random sequences, together with finding some on the proteins on the microarray binding multiple variant sequences puts forth the possibility that many of these SNPs may participate in protein-mediated 3D interactions and the regulation of <italic>CACNA1C</italic>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, what connects these SNPs is that they are in near complete LD, located on two segregating haplotypes associated with different <italic>CACNA1C</italic> mRNA levels. Such a pattern could very well be the result of balancing selection, if each regulatory haplotype gains advantage when its frequency is reduced. A similar result extending to many more examples of disease associated haplotypes has been reported by Corradin, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref031">31</xref>]. While all this remains a speculation, our list of proteins makes for a good starting point for further studies. The most interesting of these proteins is perhaps PKNOX2. While it binds only ~1% of the 460 previously tested DNA motifs and none of our three negative controls, it binds seven of the 16 SNP sequences, of which it shows a preference for the risk allele in five and the non-risk in one. Although PKNOX2 does not bind rs4765905, it may interact with other SNPs in the locus to fine-tune the regulatory effect of rs4765905. Interestingly, the <italic>PKNOX2</italic> gene, a Homeobox-Containing Gene expressed highly in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref036">36</xref>], has been previously associated with substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref037">37</xref>] and formal thought disorder in SZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Our 4C-seq results confirmed that the region carrying the disease-associated SNPs shows interactions with the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> promoter. This is in agreement with the 3C experiment of Roussos, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref026">26</xref>] and validates the region as an eQTL. We tested interactions in HEK293 and SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell lines, but not in brain tissue. Results from the two cell lines were very similar, yet it is not unlikely that some differences with regard to the presence or absence of interactions exist in the brain. Nevertheless, by extending from 3C to 4C, we confirm the region of interaction and find that it is not limited to the single SNP tested by Roussos, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref026">26</xref>], but encompasses practically all associated SNPs. Additionally, we identify a region downstream of exon 12 that also may be a regulator of the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> gene promoter. Interestingly, this latter region was also identified by our experiments from the <italic>CCAT</italic> promoter. This suggests there may be common elements in the regulation of the two genes, and it also highlights the importance of <italic>CCAT</italic>, which has not yet received much attention in the literature after it was first reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results, overall, provide strong support for a role of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> regulation in psychiatric disease. We show that the disease-associated SNPs in the gene are eQTLS that the reside in a region that interacts with the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> promoter and at least one of the SNPs can consistently drive a reporter gene in SK-N-SH cells with differences between alleles. Our protein binding experiments suggest that more than that one SNP may be involved in the complex 3D interactions that regulate <italic>CACNA1C</italic> expression, which is reminiscent of the proposed role of combinatorial effects of variants in LD on gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref031">31</xref>]. Such a phenomenon could be the driver of the strong LD, which links 16 SNPs in only 2 haplotypes, by favoring the allele combinations in the context of balancing selection. This phenomenon may be important for more behavioral or other phenotype associations. Better understanding of these phenomena is important towards tapping the translational potential of this and other GWAS identified associations.</p>

<title>Reporter Assay</title>
<p>Approximately 75,000 HEK293 cells or SK-N-SH cells were seeded in 24 well plates 24 hours before transfection. 4 independent DNA extracts were transfected per allele of each experimental luciferase construct.

<p>GenePixPro was used to align the protein microarray list file, containing spot coordinates and protein names, to the protein microarray image file.

Proteins with an average Z score above 4 on both protein microarray replicates for a given allele are considered positive. A protein is considered to bind both alleles of a SNP if the average Z score of both alleles is above 4 and the difference between the allele Z scores is less than 2. A protein is considered to bind both alleles of a SNP, but show preference for one allele if the average Z score is above 4, but the difference between allele Z scores is greater than 2. Otherwise, if only one allele exceeds the threshold of 4 the binding is considered allele specific.</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>To safeguard against false negatives due to cell type specific interactions we used two human cell lines: SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells and the human embryonic kidney derived line HEK293. In follow up of positive results on SK-N-SH cells from the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> promoter viewpoint, we used 3 different primary restriction enzymes, so that the amplicons involved in each experiment would be different. We further performed each experiment in duplicate. We then applied quality controls requiring that we acquire at least one million reads from each experiment, that more than 80% of them originate from the viewpoint, and that more than a quarter can be mapped uniquely back to the human genome. This resulted in discarding some technical replicates. The benchmarks for the "passing" experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157086.s008">S3 Table</xref>. When more than one technical replicate is available, we report results from that with better read count benchmarks, although the results do not differ significantly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec033">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The resulting â.fastqâ files were processed through our 4C-seq analysis pipeline, which utilizes Unix shell scripts, Perl scripts, and R scripts. First, reads are separated and extracted to separate files by barcode (100% match required). Each barcode represents one experiment. Each file is then processed separately in the following steps. First, the sequences that match the sequence between the viewpoint primer and the primary restriction enzyme cut site are extracted, allowing for no more than two mismatches. This viewpoint sequence is removed so the resulting fragments now start at the ligation point of linked fragments. Next, any of these fragments containing secondary restriction sites are truncated at that site, as these would be hybrid fragments resulting from multiple fragment ligations. Next, the resulting fragments are aligned to the human genome (hg19) using Bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0157086.ref046">46</xref>]. The reads mapping to the chromosome of interest (chromosome 12 for <italic>CACNA1C</italic>) are extracted and their start nucleotide position is noted. The start positions that map to primary enzyme restriction sites are counted, these counts representing the ligation events.</p>
<p>Many factors must be accounted for in order to quantitatively evaluate the frequency of DNA fragments interacting with the viewpoint. There are two types of fragments captured by the 4C template preparation, those that start at a primary site and end at a secondary site and those that have no secondary site but only primary sites on both ends. The latter, that we call âblind,â have an amplification disadvantage, as any potential amplicon would need to include a primary-to-secondary fragment in order to circularize and be amplified. The amplification efficiency also depends on fragment size, GC content, and distance from the viewpoint. While there is a strong negative correlation between counts and the distance from the viewpoint, the relationship is exponential at small distances. To correct for these factors, we generate a file that includes this information, as well as the squared fragment length and the squared distance from viewpoint for every one of the possible fragments at the region of interest, in this case 1Mb up and downstream from the viewpoint.</p>
<p>This file is then used as input to R to calculate a residual for the counts at each site through a generalized linear model. The residual counts corresponding to each side of each primary fragment are then merged to one value, the maximum of the two. We choose to do this (instead of using for example the average) because there are many potential causes for an amplicon to fail to generate mappable products or to amplify (e.g too long, too short, possible interference of binding proteins), even if it does partake in interactions. The rationale is that if one side shows a strong result, this is sufficient to suggest interactions. The resulting file, which now contains information on count residuals for each primary fragment, is passed again to R to calculate Z scores and p-values. Occasional very high counts, presumably from the strongest interactions, create a highly skewed distribution, which can lead to deflation of signal. To overcome this, the highest count fragments are iteratively removed and p-values recalculated. Finally, the resulting p-values are -log<sub>10</sub> transformed and reported in a â.bedâ format file, which can be loaded into the UCSC genome browser and visualized. To improve visibility, the -log(p-values) in this file are truncated to a max of 20. The analysis pipeline also uses R to graph the residual counts across the region to ensure that the effect of distance is corrected and create QQ plots of the residuals to confirm that their distribution after all the adjustments is near normal with only relatively few high values as expected for true interactions.</p>
