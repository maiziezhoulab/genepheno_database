<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) plays a central role in motor, cognitive, and affective behavior. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN is the most common surgical intervention for advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD), and STN has lately gained attention as target for DBS in neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and addiction. Animal studies using STN-DBS, lesioning, or inactivation of STN neurons have been used extensively alongside clinical studies to unravel the structural organization, circuitry, and function of the STN. Recent studies in rodent STN models have exposed different roles for STN neurons in reward-related functions. We have previously shown that the majority of STN neurons express the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 gene (<italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic>) and that reduction of Vglut2 mRNA levels within the STN of mice [conditional knockout (cKO)] causes reduced postsynaptic activity and behavioral hyperlocomotion. The cKO mice showed less interest in fatty rewards, which motivated analysis of reward-response. The current results demonstrate decreased sugar consumption and strong rearing behavior, whereas biochemical analyses show altered dopaminergic and peptidergic activity in the striatum. The behavioral alterations were in fact correlated with opposite effects in the dorsal versus the ventral striatum. Significant cell loss and disorganization of the STN structure was identified, which likely accounts for the observed alterations. Rare genetic variants of the human <italic>VGLUT2</italic> gene exist, and this study shows that reduced <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene expression levels exclusively within the STN of mice is sufficient to cause strong modifications in both the STN and the mesostriatal dopamine system.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the most common target in deep brain stimulation of advanced Parkinson’s disease, and it has recently been implicated in the reward circuit. Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) is the main vesicular transporter of glutamate in STN neurons, and rare genetic variants of the VGLUT2 gene exist in humans. Blunting <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene expression levels throughout the extent of the mouse STN caused substantial cell loss in the STN, similar to that observed in pharmacologic lesion models. Mice became hyperactive but showed reduced sugar consumption. Opposite effects on motor versus reward behavior was correlated with opposite activity of dopamine parameters in the dorsal versus the ventral striatal system. This study thereby identifies an interaction between the STN and the dopamine reinforcement system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an excitatory structure that, via extensive glutamatergic projections, plays a central role in motor, limbic, and cognitive functions. Dysregulated excitatory output from the STN can be normalized by high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS). Clinically, STN-DBS is implemented for alleviation of motor dysfunction in in patients suffering from advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Benabid et al., 2009</xref>), and based on its role in limbic and cognitive functions, the STN has also been proposed as a putative target in DBS approaches to treat various neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Chabardès et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, STN-DBS has been tested with positive outcome in severe obsessive compulsive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Mallet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Blomstedt et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>In parallel to clinical studies of the STN, experimental animals have been used extensively to unravel the structural organization and circuitry of the STN as well as functional outcome upon STN intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Temel et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Baunez and Gubellini, 2010</xref>). In addition to STN-DBS experiments in animals, other models implement pharmacologic lesioning or inactivation to disturb STN function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Temel et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Pratt et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, a series of studies in rodent STN models have implicated the STN in the brain reward circuit alongside the classic mesoaccumbal reward pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Breysse et al., 2015</xref>). First, implementation of STN-DBS and STN lesioning were shown to elevate the motivation for food while reducing the motivation for cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Baunez et al., 2002, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Bezzina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Rouaud et al., 2010</xref>). Second, the presentation of either a positive (rewarding) or negative (aversive) stimulus (or cues conditioned to either stimulus) altered the firing pattern of neurons within the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Darbaky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Lardeux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Espinosa-Parrilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Breysse et al., 2015</xref>). Third, although the question of the structural organization of the STN is the focus of debate between those favoring the hypothesis of the STN as a tripartite structure and those favoring an STN organization without strict anatomical boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Temel et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Benarroch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Keuken et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alkemade and Forstmann, 2014</xref>), some recent studies have focused on identifying subpopulations of STN neurons. By electrophysiological profiling in rodents, distinct STN subpopulations were found that adapted their responses when the rewarding substance sucrose was exchanged for water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Lardeux et al., 2009, 2013</xref>) or an aversive substance, such as quinine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Breysse et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, by adapting to various reward-related contexts, STN neurons form a cerebral hub which participates in even more aspects of motor, limbic and cognitive functions than previously thought. Similar to the etiology of PD, to which aberrant STN activity is believed to contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Olanow and Tatton, 1999</xref>), dysfunctional STN activity may therefore contribute to reward dysfunction in patients. Clinically, a putative role in reward-related behavior is manifested by the recent proposals of the STN as a DBS target for treatment of addiction, eating disorders, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Pelloux and Baunez, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Val-Laillet et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The multitude of roles ascribed to the STN further strengthens the case for solving how this compact nucleus is organized to encompass such a high level of complexity. Based on the excitatory nature of the STN, we recently addressed expression of the genes encoding the three different vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1–3) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Takamori, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Liguz-Lecznar and Skangiel-Kramska, 2007</xref>) and could show that the vast majority of STN neurons express only the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>). Whereas a full knockout of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene was previously demonstrated as lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Moechars et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Wallén-Mackenzie et al., 2006</xref>), some rare genetic variants of the human <italic>VGLUT2/SLC17A6</italic> gene have been identified in schizophrenia and severe alcoholism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Flatscher-Bader et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Shen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Comasco et al., 2014</xref>). By implementing conditional targeting of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene in mice using the paired-like homeodomain 2 (<italic>Pitx2)-Cre</italic> driver to direct the targeting to the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Skidmore et al., 2008</xref>), Vglut2 mRNA levels were reduced by 40% exclusively within the STN structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>). This reduction was shown to result in decreased postsynaptic excitatory activity in STN target neurons followed by strong behavioral hyperactivity, including decreased latency to movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>). Despite hyperactivity, these STN-targeted mice did not perform more poorly in reward-baited memory and impulsivity tests, but they did take longer to collect the rewards. This finding led us to address the hypothesis that the <italic>Pitx2/Vglut2</italic>-coexpressing subpopulation of STN neurons is important for regulation of both motor activity and reward-related behavior.</p>

<title>Operant self-administration of sucrose</title>
<p>Twenty-three adult mice [13 males (seven cKO and six control) and 10 females (five cKO and five control)] were used to analyze the behavioral response to sugar in an operant self-administration setup (Med Associates, Fairfax, VT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Skinner, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Sanchis-Segura and Spanagel, 2006</xref>). Source data for this experiment, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://goo.gl/slIH4u">http://goo.gl/slIH4u</ext-link> as Figure 2-1. An outline of the experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, and an illustration of the operant chamber, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>. Two days before starting and throughout the trial, the mice were under mild food restriction [3 g standard rodent chow (Lactamin, Lantmännen, Sweden) per mouse per day] and thereafter were weighed throughout the entire course of the experiment. Water was accessible <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The mice were allowed to habituate to the novel environment for one session before beginning training, and each mouse underwent one operant session per day. The mice were then trained to enter their head into a feeder equipped with a food receptacle and a photo beam sensor to obtain a 20-mg sucrose pellet (5TUL TestDiet). Each pellet delivery was followed by a 10-s timeout period, in which head entries were registered but no pellet could be obtained. Training (acquisition of the operant task) was performed on a fixed ratio (FR) 1 schedule (one pellet per head entry, maximum 30 pellets). Although a house light was continuously on, a cue light was lit only upon head entry into the feeder giving sugar, which also led to the presentation of a sound cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, left). Head entry into an inactive feeder did not result in cue or sugar presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, right). During the timeout period, no cue light or sound cue was presented. FR1 training was followed by 3 days of testing on FR1 and then on FR5 to assess consummatory behavior. Before advancing the mice to an FR5 schedule (one pellet per five head entries), they were given one training day at FR2 to adjust to a task requiring multiple head entries. The mice were assessed in an FR5 schedule for 5 days, after which motivation to work for the sugar pellets was measured on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule, during which the amount of head entries required to obtain a pellet was successively increased by three per successful action. Next, extinction, reinstatement, and reversal of active and inactive feeders were used to assess task learning and cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p>During all trial days, the mice were left in the self-administration chambers until 30 sugar pellets were obtained (FR1, FR2, reinstatement, and reversal) or until trial time ended (FR5, PR, and extinction). Trial time was limited to 30 min for FR1, FR2, reinstatement, extinction, and reversal; 40 min for FR5; 90 min for PR, the maximum time possible for all animals to complete the PR task during the light-cycle of the day.</p>

<title>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry</title>
<p>Brains of cKO and control mice were cryosectioned at 12 µm, and sections encompassing the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) and globus pallidus (GP) were thaw-mounted with Pertex (HistoLab Products, Gothenburg, Sweden) on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging–compatible conductive glass slides (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The slides were dried in a vacuum desiccator for 20 min and then stored at –20°C. Before analysis, the sections were thawed in a desiccator for 30 min and then washed for 10 s in (1) 70% ethanol, (2) 95% ethanol, and (3) 95% ethanol (Solveco Chemicals, Rosersburg, Sweden) and for 30 s in an acid wash (95% ethanol and 5% glacial acetic acid; Merck, Solna, Sweden). The washing steps and matrix deposition were earlier been developed for rat brain sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Groseclose et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Andersson et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Matrix was deposited by a piezoelectric-based Chemical Inkjet Printer (ChIP-1000; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) to apply approximately 100-pl-sized drops of matrix in a grid across the tissue sections at a resolution of 200 µm (25 mg/ml DHB in 50% methanol, 10% ammonium acetate, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid in water; five drops per pass and 25 passes).</p>
<p>MALDI imaging mass spectrometry was performed on an Ultraflex II MALDI TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics) in reflector mode.

Baseline correction (convex hull) was performed for each spectrum and was exported as .dat files using FlexAnalysis (Bruker Daltonics). Spectra of the mass range from <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 440 to 8660 were acquired from each matrix spot consisting of 600 laser shots in a 20-step random pattern. Total ion current normalization was performed on each spectrum, and data quality was assessed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Karlsson et al., 2014</xref>). A total of 5400 peaks with a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;3 were selected, and peak borders were defined by binning analysis using mass spectrometry peak binning software pbin. The peak area was calculated for each peak using an R script developed in-house. Data are expressed as average peak area for 40–50 mass spectra collected from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of each mouse (761 spectra in total collected from NAc of six cKO and three control mice). To specify the anatomic localization of peptides, photomicrographs of matrix deposits were coregistered with histologic staining of the same sections. After mass spectrometry acquisition, the matrix was removed with 95% ethanol and the mouse brain sections were stained with toluidine blue (Göteborgs Termometerfabrik, Göteborg, Sweden). FlexImaging 2.0 was used for visualization of peptide distribution. <italic>F</italic>-test ANOVA revealed unequal variance between groups, and the data were log-scaled for further analysis using Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed, α = 0.05, null hypothesis rejected at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

Two independent probes were used, one composed of a mix of three oligonucleotides [NM_080853.3: bases 13–47 (exon 1); bases 872–908 (exons 1 and 2); bases 3220–3254 (exon 12)] and one specific for exon 5 (bases 1432–1464). Pdyn was detected by a probe mix composed of a mix of three oligonucleotides (NM_018863.4: bases 1078–1112, 1694–1727, and 2309–2342). Images (Fujifilm BioImaging Analyzer BAS-5000, exposure time 1 month) corresponding to hybridized sections were exposed on film for mRNA expression analysis at a 25-µm resolution. For cellular mRNA expression analysis, slides were dipped in NTB emulsion and revealed after an exposition of 6 weeks; sections were counterstained with toluidine blue. For fluorescent detection, cryosections were air-dried, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and acetylated in 0.25% acetic anhydride/100 mM triethanolamine (pH=8). Sections were hybridized for 18 h at 65°C in 100 μl of formamide-buffer containing 1 μg/ml Vglut2-DIG-labeled riboprobe (NM_080853.3: bases 2315-3244) and 1 μg/ml Pitx2 fluorescein-labeled riboprobe (NM_001042504.1 :bases 792-1579). Sections were washed at 65°C with SSC buffers of decreasing strength, and blocked with 20% FBS and 1% blocking solution. Fluorescein epitopes were detected with HRP conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody at 1:1000 and revealed with TSA<sup>™</sup> Kit (Perkin Elmer) using Biotin-tyramide at 1:75 followed by incubation with Neutravidin Oregon Green conjugate at 1:750.

<title>Vglut2 and Pitx2 mRNAs overlap and are both distributed over the entire STN</title>
<p>The STN in both primates and rodents has been suggested to constitute a tripartite structure composed of a dorsal motor aspect with efferent projections to the globus pallidus interna (GPi; in mice known as the entopeduncular nucleus) and externa (GPe; in mice commonly referred to only as globus pallidus); a ventral aspect that, via projections to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), regulates associative behavior; and a medial aspect that communicates with the limbic system via the ventral pallidum (VP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Kita and Kitai, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Groenewegen and Berendse, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Benarroch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alkemade and Forstmann, 2014</xref>). This model is based on projection patterns and functional outcome, but no genetic marker has been identified that distinguishes between these three aspects of the STN.</p>
<p>The <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene encoding the synaptic protein VGLUT2 is strongly expressed (mRNA) within the cytoplasm of neurons located in the STN in both rodents and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Hisano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Barroso-Chinea et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Rico et al., 2010</xref>) representing the major glutamatergic population within the STN in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>). For this reason, we wished to assess the distribution pattern of <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic>-expressing neurons within mouse STN to analyze whether these distribute differently within the dorsal, ventral, and medial aspects of the STN. High-resolution radioactive Vglut2 mRNA-selective <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis was performed to enable visualization and subsequent quantification of Vglut2 mRNA. Vglut2 mRNA, detected as silver grains, was readily visible across the entire extent of the STN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>, left). Whereas Vglut2 mRNA was present throughout all aspects of the STN, the level of expression was visibly higher in the medial and ventral parts. Most cells contained Vglut2 mRNA, but cells of different sizes appeared throughout the STN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>, right).</p>

</fig>
<p>Further, because the <italic>Pitx2</italic> gene has been shown to be highly expressed in the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Martin et al., 2004</xref>), we next used double fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to analyze the distribution of Pitx2 mRNA, as well as the overlap between Vglut2 and Pitx2 mRNA on a cellular level. A near-100% overlap between these two mRNAs was observed throughout all aspects of the STN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). The distribution pattern of both Vglut2 and Pitx2 mRNA was important to establish because, as discussed above, we use a <italic>Pitx2-Cre</italic> transgenic mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Skidmore et al., 2008</xref>) as a tool to enable targeted deletion of <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> expression within the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>). However, we had not previously addressed the possibility of subregional targeting within this structure. Our previous analysis showed that the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice and their control littermates (<italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre-</sup></italic>) as expected had similar levels of Pitx2 mRNA in the STN. However, <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> expression levels were blunted in the cKO STN, so the amount of cells with low-level expression was increased at the expense of cells with high-level expression, leaving a 40% decrease in Vglut2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Having now ensured that <italic>Pitx2</italic> and <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> expressions were overlapping and distributed all over the STN, we next quantified the amount of Vglut2 mRNA by counting the number of silver grains in 550 STN neurons of cKO mice and 792 neurons of control mice. Approximately 12% of all the counted STN neurons in the control mice lacked any detectable Vglut2 mRNA, whereas approximately 88% of STN neurons showed a wide range of Vglut2 mRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). The number of cells expressing no detectable Vglut2 mRNA at all was more than double throughout the STN structure in the cKO compared to control (28% vs. 12%). Further, the number of low-level Vglut2 mRNA levels (1–10 silver grains/cell) was higher in the cKO than control STN, and more control than cKO STN cells showed higher Vglut2 mRNA levels (11 or more silver grains/cell).</p>
<p>These histologic analyses show that in the mouse, Pitx2 and Vglut2 mRNAs are highly overlapping (near 100%) throughout the extent of the STN and thus do not represent any specific aspect of the STN. Moreover, in control mice, almost 90% of all STN neurons express the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene, whereas the majority of cKO neurons in the STN contain no or low levels of Vglut2 mRNA. Thus, the current results demonstrate that <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> expression levels are severely blunted throughout the entire STN structure of <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> (cKO) mice.</p>

<title>Normal reward-associated learning, memory, and cognitive flexibility but lower sugar consumption when Vglut2/Slc17a6 expression is blunted within the STN</title>
<p>Hyperactive individuals (mice as well as humans), can be lean without having any kind of deficiency in food consumption. Therefore, the slightly smaller size of the hyperactive cKO mice did not appear abnormal at first, but because a lower rate in collecting high-fat food pellets in the baited radial arm maze and in the delay discounting test was measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>), a more thorough analysis of feeding behavior was undertaken.</p>
<p>Generally, decreased consumption of fatty food might reflect decreased eating overall or a lack of consumption of palatable eatables specifically, the latter of which could reflect a deficiency in the mesostriatal reinforcement system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</xref>), also known as the brain reward system. To differentiate between these two possibilities, voluntary consumption of high-sucrose food, another palatable eatable, was assessed in an operant self-administration paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Skinner, 1966</xref>) under mild food restriction [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref> (schematic presentation of the entire experiment), 2<italic>B</italic> (illustration of the operant chamber)]. The results of this analysis showed that no difference between control and cKO groups could be observed in task acquisition (training), as both groups learned equally well to collect the maximum of 30 pellets and decreased the time for task completion during training (change over time: <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001; <italic>F</italic> = 13.16, Df = 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). Both groups were able to reliably collect 30 pellets on three consecutive days on the FR1 schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>, left and middle). However, the time to complete the FR1 task was significantly increased for cKO mice compared with controls (variation between genotypes: <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001; <italic>F</italic> = 23.58, Df = 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>, left). Furthermore, the control mice continued to increase the number of head entries during timeout over the trial, whereas the number of head entries of cKO mice declined (time × genotype: <italic>p</italic> = 0.00113; <italic>F</italic> = 5.024, Df = 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>, right).

<p>Whereas FR5 is used to measure sugar consumption rate, the PR paradigm has been described as a measure for the motivational aspect of consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Sanchis-Segura and Spanagel, 2006</xref>).

Upon reinstatement of the operant task, control and cKO groups showed no difference in level of activity at the active feeder (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) and were also equally able to switch sides upon reversal of the active and inactive feeders (time × genotype: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0015; <italic>F</italic> = 4.005, Df = 6; change over time: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0014; <italic>F</italic> = 7.172, Df = 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>I</italic></xref>).

<p>Because the cKO mice consumed normal amounts of standard chow during refeeding after the operant task, the results suggest that the observed effect on sugar consumption is specific to sweet food and that the leaner shape of the cKO mice before food-restriction rather reflects their hyperactivity than a deficiency in standard chow feeding.</p>

<p><italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice are both vertically and horizontally hyperactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>). After showing that they consume less sugar, we wished to know more about their motor behavior. Rearing behavior differs from locomotion, as it does not serve to move the mouse forward, but instead signifies a sensing of the environment, commonly interpreted as an exploratory behavior. Further, rearing displayed in a repetitive format is commonly interpreted as a form of stereotypy in rodent models of various neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). It has also been shown that the presentation of rearing behavior in mice can appear in different ways depending on body posture and the positioning of the paws and tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Waddington et al., 2001</xref>). To explore the type of rearing accentuated in the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice, we analyzed it in detail by subcategorizing rearing into three subtypes; wall rearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, left), seated rearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>, left), and free rearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, left), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Waddington et al., 2001</xref>). By quantifying the duration of each of the types of rearing, no significant difference in wall rearing was found between control and cKO mice (variation between genotypes: <italic>p</italic> = 0.2577; <italic>F</italic> = 1.441, Df = 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, right).

<p>Summarizing the behavioral findings, the results demonstrate that mice lacking normal expression levels of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene in the STN display severely elevated motor activity, including advanced subtypes of rearing barely detected in control mice, and blunted reward consumption.

<title>Significant alterations in DA receptor and DA transporter capacity</title>
<p>DA neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum (DStr), mediated by the nigrostriatal DA neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), is strongly correlated with locomotion and rearing, whereas DA transmission in the NAc, the ventral aspect of the striatum, is primarily mediated by DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area and is triggered by palatable food and drugs of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Björklund and Dunnett, 2007</xref>). The reduced interest in palatable food rewards alongside the elevated motor behavior thus suggested an opposing circuitry effect by the targeted deletion of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene in the STN on dorsal and ventral striatal DA signaling. Indeed, in our previous analyses, we showed that the nigrostriatal DA system is overactive, with increased levels of DA release and reduced DA clearance due to reduced levels of the DAT in the DStr, whereas no alteration in terms of DA receptor availability was detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Having now unraveled an effect of the <italic>Vglut2</italic> targeting of the STN on consumption of natural rewards, we focused on addressing a possible contribution of the NAc. The levels of DA receptors are important for the hedonic impact of drugs of abuse and palatable food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Volkow et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Wenzel and Cheer, 2014</xref>). We therefore implemented receptor autoradiography of [<sup>3</sup>H]SCH23390, [<sup>125</sup>I]iodosulpride, and [<sup>125</sup>I]7-OH-PIPAT binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Mahmoudi et al., 2014</xref>) to measure the density of DA receptor D1R, D2R, and D3R subtypes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). No difference between control and cKO mice was detected for D1R in either the core or shell subregions of the NAc (NAcC and NAcSh, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). However, for both D2R and D3R, ligand binding was altered in the NAcSh. D2R binding was elevated above control levels in the cKO brain, whereas D3R ligand binding was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic>, <italic>D</italic></xref>). In addition, D2R binding was above control levels in the cKO NAcC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>). Next, we assessed DAT capacity using [<sup>125</sup>I]RTI-121 binding. [<sup>125</sup>I]RTI-121 binding was significantly increased in the NAcSh of the cKO mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>).

<p>These findings point to different, and even opposite, modifications in the dorsal versus the ventral striatal DA systems upon the targeted deletion of <italic>Vglut2</italic> in the STN, such that the NAcSh of the cKO mice have altered D2R and D3R availability as well as increased DAT capacity, as opposed to unaltered receptor state and decreased DAT capacity in the DStr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>). The higher activity of the dorsal over the ventral striatal DA system likely accounts for the observed strengthening of motor behavior and weakening of the natural reward-related behavior; with focus on the reward system, the NAc was therefore analyzed in more detail.</p>

<p>To enable analysis of the molecular constitution within the neurons of the NAc and to assay for peptide alterations within this region of cKO and control mice, we implemented MALDI imaging as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Hanrieder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Ljungdahl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref> (schematic illustration of the procedure)].

<p>The majority of the more than 100 peptides detected in the MALDI imaging were not differentially expressed in cKO and control animals. However, 19 peaks were significantly downregulated and 48 upregulated in cKO mice. Among the upregulated peptides, the strong changes in the family of dynorphin (Dyn) neuropeptides were most striking. Ion images for the Dyn peptides DynA and α-neoendorphin (aNeo) revealed visibly elevated Dyn levels in the NAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Ion images obtained from cKO mice exhibited 25% to 50% higher levels of Dyn and aNeo peptides compared with control mice. These alterations were mainly localized to the NAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). Dyn peptides including DynB (9–13; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0290), DynB (1–6; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0087), DynB (2–13; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0334), aNeo (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0196 for first and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0352 for second isotope), aNeo (2–10; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0289), and DynA (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0021) were upregulated in the NAc of cKO compared with control brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6<italic>D</italic></xref>). The Dyn neuropeptides are products generated by prohormone convertase cleavage of the prodynorphin (Pdyn) propeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Berman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Yakovleva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Orduna and Beaudry, 2016</xref>). Dyn peptides can represent either afferent or local projections, so expression of the <italic>Pdyn</italic> gene was next analyzed at the mRNA level by in situ hybridization in the NAc. No difference in expression between control and cKO could be detected, suggesting that the regulation of the Pdyn peptide products does not occur at mRNA but at the peptide level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 6<italic>F</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together with the results from the DA receptor and DAT binding shown above, these findings reveal that the targeted reduction of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene expression levels within the STN had a strong impact on the mesostriatal DA reward system, and we sought to explore this correlation further.</p>

<title><italic>Pitx2</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic>–expressing STN neurons show projection patterns unique to EP/GP and SNr</title>
<p>The STN has been reported to send a multitude of efferents to the basal ganglia and their associated structures, including the GPi/EP, GPe/GP, SNr, VP, pedunculopontine nucleus, SNc, and basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Kita and Kitai, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Parent et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Sato et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Benarroch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Degos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Hachem-Delaunay et al., 2015</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no direct innervation from the STN to either the NAc or DStr has so far been identified. We already confirmed a strongly reduced glutamatergic activity by implementing patch-clamp recordings upon both electrical and optogenetic stimulations in postsynaptic neurons in the main STN target areas EP and SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>). We now aimed to establish whether there is a projection from <italic>Pitx2/Vglut2</italic> coexpressing STN neurons directly to the NAc, which could explain the strong effects observed in this region of the cKO mice. To selectively trace the efferent projections and thereby pinpoint their target areas, an adeno-associated virus carrying a Cre-dependent DNA construct <italic>ChR2</italic> and the gene encoding EYFP was stereotactically injected bilaterally into the STN of control <italic>Vglut2<sup>wt/wt;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic></xref>). Virus was injected in two different dorsal-ventral stereotactic STN coordinates to ensure expression throughout the length of the STN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>). Histologic analysis revealed absence of EYFP in structures surrounding the STN, whereas ample EYFP-positive cell bodies were detected throughout the extent of the STN, confirming both successful expression of the <italic>ChR2-EYFP</italic> construct exclusively in the <italic>Pitx2-Cre</italic>–expressing neurons and the observation described above, that <italic>Pitx2/Vglut2</italic> coexpressing cells are distributed uniformly over this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7<italic>D</italic></xref>). The EP, GP, and SNr were verified as targets of the <italic>Pitx2-Cre</italic>–expressing STN neurons by EYFP localization to fibers throughout these areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7<italic>E–G</italic></xref>). However, no EYFP-positive innervation at all could be detected in either the NAc or the DStr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7<italic>H</italic></xref>). Further, EYFP could not be detected in any of the other target areas described for the STN in different species: SNc, VP, basolateral amygdala, or pedunculopontine nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7<italic>H</italic></xref>).</p>

<title>Cell loss as well as altered structural size and shape of the STN</title>
<p>A previous study of dopamine-glutamate coreleasing neurons in the midbrain has shown that expression of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene is important for maintaining cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Fortin et al., 2012</xref>). During visual inspection of cryosectioned brains, we detected a difference in the shape of the STN between cKO and control mice; for this reason, we decided to quantify cell density and measure the size and shape of the STN. Toluidine blue contrast staining of the serially sectioned control and cKO mice used to quantify Vglut2 mRNA described above enabled quantification of cell number and cell size (area) in the same material. This analysis revealed a reduction in total number of cells by 39% in cKO compared with control. Further, more STN neurons in the cKO than control mice had larger cell area (201–350 µm<sup>2</sup>), leading to a right-sided shift in the histogram presenting cell area as a function of percentage of total cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>). It was also evident that within the STN of cKO mice, there are neurons of a larger size range (351–500 µm<sup>2</sup>) than observed at all in the control STN.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next analyzed whether the overall structure of the STN in the cKO mice had been altered as a consequence of this cell loss. For this task, 2D and 3D reconstruction analyses were performed in parallel. For 2D analysis, anatomical outlines of the STN were made on each section microscope photograph, and linear measurements were made at the widest part of the STN and the adjacent cerebral peduncle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic>, <italic>C</italic></xref>). These analyses revealed that the STN was slimmer in the cKO than in the control animals, whereas the cerebral peduncle was wider, thus pointing to shrinkage of the STN in the cKO mice. The STN outlines were subsequently used to establish 3D overlay pictures of cKO and control STNs from both coronal and sagittal views, both of which readily exposed the smaller size of the STN in the cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>D</italic></xref>). Further, the ventral and dorsomedial aspects of the STN were exposed as the regions most affected by the reduction in STN size, and this led to a change in the overall shape of the STN, which appeared visibly narrower ventrally and dorsomedially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>D</italic></xref>). Three-dimensional quantification confirmed a 14% smaller diameter as well as a 38% reduction in volume in the cKO STN.</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that the targeted deletion of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene in the STN causes substantial loss of neurons, primarily those of small cell area, which in turn likely has caused the alteration in the size and shape of the entire STN structure. This substantial alteration likely contributes to the motor and reward behavioral alterations observed. Further, the results obtained pinpoint <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene expression levels as crucial for the structure and function of the STN.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The STN has gained wide attention based on its pivotal role in motor, limbic, and cognitive functions, and therapies based on electrical brain stimulation of the STN show a steady increase as a treatment of advanced PD and a range of neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Chabardès et al., 2013</xref>). Aberrant excitation from the STN not only contributes to the core symptoms of PD (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and axial instability), but excessive excitation from the STN has also been proposed to contribute to the degeneration of midbrain DA neurons and may thus play a role in the etiology of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Olanow and Tatton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the so-called tripartite model of the STN dominates the current way of correlating the anatomy of the STN with its many functional roles, this model has recently been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Keuken et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alkemade and Forstmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Lambert et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, no molecular markers have been identified that could be used to delineate putative anatomical borders between the three main subdivisions of the STN; this lack of subdivision-selective markers contributes, in our mind, to the difficulty in firmly confirming or dismissing the tripartite model. Both Vglut2 and Pitx2 mRNAs localize within the mouse STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Martin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>), but the current study shows that they are both distributed throughout the entire STN structure; neither Vglut2 or Pitx2 can thus serve as a selective marker for any specific aspect within the STN. We further conclude that whereas we previously referred to the <italic>Pitx2/Vglut2</italic> coexpressing neurons as a subpopulation of the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>), the demonstration that Pitx2 and Vglut2 mRNA overlap in almost 90% of all STN neurons now pinpoints that the <italic>Pitx2/Vglut2</italic> subpopulation represent the vast majority of the STN.</p>
<p>Given this broad distribution of Vglut2 and Pitx2 mRNAs throughout the STN, and the reduction of Vglut2 mRNA levels throughout the STN structure of the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice, a strong behavioral phenotype might not be surprising. The surprise, if any, rather lies in the seemingly opposing effects observed on motor and reward-related behavior. Although motorically hyperactive both vertically and horizontally, the cKO mice consume less sugar than control mice. Previous studies in rats selected for their low (LRA) or high (HRA) rearing activity have shown that HRA rats display elevated locomotor activity and collect rewards in the baited radial arms maze faster than LRA rats, but as they also make more working memory errors. These results suggested that higher reward consumption in hyperactive rodents is correlated with working memory failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Görisch and Schwarting, 2006</xref>). Although the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice previously were shown to be strongly hyperactive both in terms of locomotion and rearing, they did not make more errors in the baited radial arm maze; neither reference or working memory errors were elevated in the cKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Pupe et al., 2015</xref>). However, consistently throughout our natural reward-related tests (the baited radial arm and delay discounting tests as well as the sugar self-administration presented here), the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice consumed less than controls.</p>
<p>Based on these observed behavioral alterations, we argue that the motoric hyperactivity overrides the interest in palatable food. In efforts to unravel the biochemical correlates of such a behavioral phenotype, we identified a series of modifications that support this argument. First, a strong correlation between DA signaling in the NAcSh and reward-related behaviors is already well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</xref>), and dysfunction of the mesostriatal DA system is strongly implicated in disorders with a reward-related component, including addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Volkow et al., 2009</xref>), anorexia nervosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Kontis and Theochari, 2012</xref>), and overeating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Stice et al., 2008</xref>). By now demonstrating that the targeting of <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> has caused an increase in DA activity in the DStr (mainly motor) but decreased it in the NAc (mainly reward), opposite behavioral outcomes mediated by these two systems might indeed be achieved. The selective lack of interest in palatable food while showing normal levels of regular chow consumption is likely correlated with the biochemical alterations in the NAc. Increased DAT capacity suggests faster clearance of DA, whereas elevated levels of Dyn peptides might represent a biochemical indication for a dysphoric state in these animals.</p>
<p>Microinjection of the selective κ opioid receptor agonist DAMGO in the NAc of experimental animals has been shown to produce conditioned place aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bals-Kubik et al., 1993</xref>), whereas an antagonist of these receptors causes an antidepressant effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Shirayama and Chaki, 2006</xref>). The Dyn neuropeptides are mainly present in D1R-expressing cells of the NAcSh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</xref>); although we did not observe D1R upregulation, the observed reduction in binding to D3R, which can oppose D1R activity, could have relieved D1R intracellular signaling to increase Dyn levels in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Schwartz et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, although elevated motor activity might be explained by the observed reduction of glutamatergic postsynaptic activity in the EP and SNr alongside the reduced DAT clearance in the DStr observed in the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice, the current findings of elevated DAT levels in the NAcSh as well as increased levels of both D2R and Dyn neuropeptides likely provide a biochemical correlate of the deficiency in the reward-collecting behavior demonstrated by the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice. Further, by unraveling the severe impact on the size and shape of the STN structure itself, we propose that slimming of the ventral (presumably associative) and part of the medial (limbic) aspects of the STN might cause the reduced dopaminergic activity in the NAc. Similar slimming of the STN structure has been observed upon ibotenic acid–induced STN lesioning, in which a substantial amount of STN cells are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Baunez et al., 1995, 2002</xref>), whereas targeted deletion of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene in the midbrain has been shown to lead to reduced cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Fortin et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice, expression of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene is targeted from early embryogenesis onward. Having now verified that reduced Vglut2 mRNA levels occur throughout the STN structure, and also that the STN suffers from cell loss and structural modifications, we posit that this genetic intervention resembles to some extent a pharmacologic lesion model of the STN. Indeed, pharmacologic lesioning, as well as inactivation, of the STN increases motoric activity and has been shown more recently to affect motivated behavior, including consumption of palatable food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Baunez et al., 2002, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Bezzina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Rouaud et al., 2010</xref>). Although pharmacologic lesioning and inactivation of the STN, as well as STN-DBS, in experimental animals show beneficial effects on motor behavior similar to STN-DBS in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Baunez and Gubellini, 2010</xref>), the results have been more variable and difficult to interpret in terms of motivated and reward-related behavior; this is likely because of different experimental paradigms and metabolic states of animals (e.g., food restriction) analyzed in the reported studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Uslaner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Pratt et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> “genetic lesion model” (represented by the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice) has a developmental onset that sets it apart from current pharmacologic lesion models. In the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice, there is a significant reduction in number of STN neurons in the adult animal, which in turn likely causes the alteration in STN shape. Addressing dysfunction in developmental processes, such as defects in proliferation or premature cell death, is beyond the scope of the present study. Further, STN neurons may not differentiate or migrate in a normal manner, and they may not even form functional connections in the absence of normal levels of <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene expression.</p>
<p>The impact of a developmentally induced genetic lesion likely has a substantial effect of overall circuitry. Therefore, identifying the exact nature of the correlation between the reduced <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene expression levels, the altered shape of the STN, and the observed effects on the DA system is not straightforward. Although we can conclude that there is no direct innervation of either the ventral or dorsal striatum by the <italic>Pitx2/Vglut2</italic> coexpressing STN neurons that might be directly affected by the targeted deletion of <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic>, we have established that both the EP and SNr are innervated by these STN neurons, and that the glutamatergic input into these targets is reduced in the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice. The EP is the main projection target in the STN motor loop, whereas the SNr also mediates associative functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Benarroch, 2008</xref>), and we therefore hypothesize that the observed alterations in reward-related behavior might be connected more specifically to the STN-SNr pathway. Although STN neurons generally are excitatory in nature, high-frequency stimulation of the STN leads to a reduced drive for burst firing in the SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Shen and Johnson, 2008</xref>) and can, through endocannabinoid mechanisms, attenuate the GABAergic innervation of the SNc through the SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Freestone et al., 2015</xref>). The reduction in glutamatergic transmission in the STN of <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO could therefore have led to a developmental alteration in the excitation/inhibition balance within the STN-SNr-SNc axis, presumably via the structurally disturbed ventral and part of the medial aspects of the STN.</p>
<p>Developmental effects might make it difficult to pinpoint additional circuitry components in the STN-EP/GP/SNr-striatum loop unraveled here. However, targeting the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene bears a physiological relevance that is not matched by toxin-induced models. Null mutations of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene in mice are lethal directly after birth because of disturbance of the pre-Bötzinger respiratory central pattern generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Wallén-Mackenzie et al., 2006</xref>), and the same is likely true for humans. However, some rare genetic variants of the human <italic>VGLUT2/SLC17A6</italic> gene have been identified in schizophrenia and severe alcoholism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Flatscher-Bader et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Shen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Comasco et al., 2014</xref>). In the <italic>Vglut2<sup>f/f;Pitx2-Cre+</sup></italic> cKO mice, expression levels of the <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene are merely blunted, but not eliminated, and therefore effects may be exposed that are of relevance to human conditions. Indeed, we show that the blunting of <italic>Vglut2/Slc17a6</italic> gene expression levels selectively within the STN of mice causes opposite biochemical modifications in the dorsal and ventral striatal DA systems, followed by behavioral hyperactivity and decreased interest in palatable food, possibly due to a dysphoric state. We tentatively propose that genetic variants of the human <italic>VGLUT2/SLC17A6</italic> gene might be correlated with similar modifications. Further, by demonstrating an association between reduced Vglut2 mRNA levels in the STN and reduced STN size in mice, brain imaging analysis of STN size in human individuals might serve a purpose in future clinical investigations of human brain disorders implicating the STN, and where STN-based therapies are implemented already, such as PD and obsessive compulsive disorder, as well as for addiction, eating disorders and obesity, disorders proposed to benefit from STN-based therapy.</p>

<p>Reviewing Editor: Thomas McHugh, RIKEN Brain Science Institute&lt;br /&gt;Decisions are customarily a result of the Reviewing Editor and the peer reviewers coming together and discussing their recommendations until a consensus is reached. When revisions are invited, a fact-based synthesis statement explaining their decision and outlining what is needed to prepare a revision will be listed below. For some manuscripts transferred from JNeurosci, a decision is made to accept the manuscript without peer review, and a brief statement to this effect will follow.</p>

<p>The authors' changes in the text and response to the previous reviewers comments are sufficient to warrant publication with no further review.</p>
