<p>According to most models of mycobacterial infection, inhibition of the pro-inflammatory macrophage immune responses contributes to the persistence of bacteria. <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> subsp. <italic>paratuberculosis</italic> (MAP) is a highly successful pathogen in cattle and sheep and is also implicated as the causative agent of Crohnâs disease in humans. Pathogenic mycobacteria such as MAP have developed multiple strategies to evade host defence mechanisms including interfering with the macrophagesâ capacity to respond to IFN-Î³, a feature which might be lacking in non-pathogenic mycobacteria such as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>. We hypothesized that pre-sensitisation of macrophages with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-Î³ would help in overcoming the inhibitory effect of MAP or its antigens on macrophage inflammatory responses. Herein we have compared a series of macrophage activation parameters in response to MAP and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> as well as mycobacterial antigens. While IFN-Î³ did overcome the inhibition in immune suppressive mechanisms in response to MAP antigen as well as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>, we could not find a clear role for IFN-Î³ in overcoming the inhibition of macrophage inflammatory responses to the pathogenic mycobacterium, MAP. We demonstrate that suppression of macrophage defence mechanisms by pathogenic mycobacteria is unlikely to be overcome by prior sensitization with IFN-Î³ alone. This indicates that IFN-Î³ signaling pathway-independent mechanisms may exist for overcoming inhibition of macrophage effector functions in response to pathogenic mycobacteria. These findings have important implications in understanding the survival mechanisms of pathogenic mycobacteria directed towards finding better therapeutics and vaccination strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pathogenic mycobacteria are responsible for considerable mortality and morbidity in human and domestic livestock populations worldwide. A characteristic feature of this group of pathogens is their ability to cause chronic infection, often associated with similar immunopathological features, in a wide variety of host species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref002">2</xref>]. <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> subsp. <italic>paratuberculosis</italic> (MAP) is the causative agent of a chronic enteropathy in ruminants leading to death, termed paratuberculosis or Johneâs disease, and has also been implicated as a possible etiological agent of Crohnâs disease in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref003">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref008">8</xref>]. Recently MAP was detected in the human population in a region of northern India with endemic Johneâs disease, at times associated with clinical enteritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref010">10</xref>]. MAP has been suggested to also play a role in a range of other diseases such as thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes and autism, due to the mechanism of antigenic mimicry, thus making this organism an intriguing potential zoonotic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref012">12</xref>]. Since MAP has been isolated from food sources for human consumption including dairy products, meat and drinking water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref013">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref016">16</xref>] there is a need to fully understand the pathogenesis of this organism and devise strategies to eliminate it from the food chain.</p>
<p>Macrophages, apart from their innate immune functions like nitric oxide production, pathogen recognition and phagocytosis, apoptosis and secretion of cytokines, are also target cells that respond to cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) resulting in the initiation of adaptive immune responses via major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mediated processing and presentation of antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref017">17</xref>]. The interplay between IFN-Î³ and macrophages in infection and inflammation involves a complex mechanism dependent on both host- and pathogen-associated factors and is fundamental to the hostâs ability to control a pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Mycobacteria are highly successful pathogens of humans and animals and the obligate pathogenic strains have developed multiple strategies to evade host defence mechanisms and survive intracellularly in cells such as the macrophage. Therefore, the cell signaling pathways initiated by pathogenic mycobacteria such as MAP are likely to differ from non-pathogenic strains such as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> or <italic>M</italic>. <italic>phlei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref019">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref021">21</xref>]. One of the survival strategies of pathogenic mycobacteria includes interfering with the host macrophagesâ capacity to respond to IFN-Î³; both the whole bacterium and sub-cellular components of mycobacteria have the potential to inhibit macrophage immune responses to IFN-Î³ via toll-like receptor (TLR)2 dependent or independent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the success of these immune evasion strategies, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that if IFN-Î³ stimulation precedes infection, this can prime macrophages to initiate a pro-inflammatory phenotype and potentiate anti-bacterial mechanisms. Macrophage immune responses such as activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) production as well as nuclear factor kappa B (NFÎºB) activation in response to stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TLR agonists and bacterial DNA are enhanced upon IFN-Î³ priming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref024">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref029">29</xref>]. Moreover, IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± signaling pathways act synergistically, as many genes induced by IFN-Î³ are also induced by TNF-Î± such as <italic>IRF-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref031">31</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesize that these mechanisms of increased cellular activity due to IFN-Î³ pre-sensitization could help in overcoming the inhibition of inflammatory/protective responses that occur during infection with pathogenic mycobacteria such as MAP.</p>
<p>RAW 264.7 is a murine macrophage cell line which is extremely sensitive to stimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref032">32</xref>]. It is an immortal cell line that grows continuously in culture due to alteration of genes which might also affect functional properties such as signalling cascades affected by microbial ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref034">34</xref>]. Despite this drawback, several studies have utilized the RAW 264.7 cell line for studying nitric oxide production in response to mycobacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref035">35</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref037">37</xref>] and have reported differences in the immune responses and gene expression elicited between non-pathogenic and pathogenic mycobacteria or variant forms of mycobacteria such as cell-wall deficient forms in murine macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref039">39</xref>]. A bovine SV40 transformed peritoneal macrophage cell line available for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using mycobacteria, however detailed studies addressing the characteristics of this line are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref041">41</xref>]. Although primary cells isolation from the blood of natural hosts for MAP like cattle and sheep is possible, the availability of reagents for functional studies in murine cells as well as the ease of culturing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref042">42</xref>] makes cell lines such as RAW 264.7 an attractive alternative model for conducting studies. Therefore, we utilized the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line as a model system to examine the effect of IFN-Î³ priming on the modulation of a comprehensive array of macrophage activation indices in response to a pathogenic mycobacterium (MAP), a non-pathogenic mycobacterium (<italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>) as well as whole-cell derived and purified mycobacterial antigens. We demonstrate that the suppression of macrophage immune mechanisms by live pathogenic mycobacteria is unlikely to be overcome by prior sensitization with IFN-Î³ alone. Also, macrophages exhibit differential immune responses when exposed to whole mycobacteria in comparison to mycobacterial antigens, which should be borne in mind when trying to integrate antigenic mechanisms to explain mycobacterial pathogenesis.</p>

<p>RAW 264.7, a mouse macrophage cell line, was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and grown at 37Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen), penicillin at 100 U/mL and streptomycin at 100 Î¼g/mL (Gibco) and Î²-mercaptoethanol (58 Î¼M) (Sigma). Cells were plated 24 h prior to infection at 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate (Griener Bio-one).

<p>The QuantiGene 2.0 Plex Assay<sup>Â®</sup> (Panomics Solutions, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), a branched DNA (bDNA) hybridisation based method of target-specific RNA quantitation by signal amplification using labelled DNA probes, was used to target RNA for genes of interest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0176400.t001">Table 1</xref>) following the manufacturerâs protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cdn.panomics.com/downloads/UM13074_QG2Manual_RevC_100111.pdf">http://cdn.panomics.com/downloads/UM13074_QG2Manual_RevC_100111.pdf</ext-link>). Briefly, target hybridization was carried out by incubating RNA samples with a mixture of Luminex beads coated with capture probes, capture extenders, label extenders and blocking probes. This was followed by the signal amplification step where the hybridized RNA was incubated with pre-amplifier, amplifier and label probe. Detection was by addition of streptavidin phycoerythrin and signals were read using the Luminex<sup>Â®</sup> flow cytometer (Life Technologies). Signal is reported as MFI and is proportional to the number of target RNA molecules in the sample. Gene expression was calculated as a fold change in the expression of the gene of interest between the negative untreated and treated samples as detailed by the manufacturerâs protocol. To do this, firstly the average background signal was deducted from MFI for the different genes. If this value was â¤ 0, then the value was set to the minimum fluorescence detectable (1) so that calculations of fold change could be performed. The MFI result for individual wells was then normalized by dividing by the respective reference gene MFI. The fold change was then calculated for each test gene by dividing the average values for the treated samples in each treatment group by the corresponding average values obtained for those genes in the media control without IFN-Î³ pre-treatment.</p>

<title>Modulation of cellular responses by mycobacterial antigens in response to prior sensitization of cells with IFN-Î³</title>
<p>The optimum dose of PPDA, PPDB and MAP cattle strain 316v whole cell-derived antigen (316v Ag) was selected by titration (0â128 Î¼g/mL), following pre-treatment of RAW 264.7 murine monocytic cells for one hour with IFN-Î³ at a final concentration of 100 ng/mL. An increase in nitric oxide production in response to the mycobacterial antigens tested was observed from 32â128 Î¼g/mL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0176400.s001">S1AâS1D Fig</xref>). However, the overall nitric oxide response to MAP 316v Ag was relatively low compared to the other mycobacteria-derived antigens tested. The positive control, LPS, consistently induced nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0176400.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), while background nitric oxide production was seen in the media control.</p>
<p>Pre-treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with LPS or IFN-Î³ was compared, followed by stimulation with the mycobacterial antigens, PPDB and 316v Ag. Pre-treatment with IFN-Î³ led to significantly enhanced (<italic>P</italic> â¤ 0.05) nitric oxide production in response to mycobacterial antigen stimulation, however there was no induction of nitric oxide production by either of the antigens tested following LPS pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176400.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). All the mycobacterial antigens tested induced some production of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-Î± and IL-10. Following pre-treatment with IFN-Î³, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î± and IL-6) was markedly enhanced while there was an apparent decrease in IL-10 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176400.g001">Fig 1Câ1E</xref>). No changes were observed in IL-1Î± levels between the MAP 316v Ag and PPDB treatment groups in the absence of prior stimulation. However, IFN-Î³ pre-treatment resulted in a decrease in IL-1Î± levels in response to PPDB and 316v Ag when compared with the no pre-treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176400.g001">Fig 1B</xref>); but these changes did not reach statistical significance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has been shown that pre-treatment of macrophages with IFN-Î³ increases macrophage inflammatory responses which could confer protection against infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref047">47</xref>]. Therefore, in this study we intended to answer the question as to whether prior sensitization of macrophages with IFN-Î³ could alter macrophage activation parameters in response to MAP or its antigens. We further compared these responses to non-pathogenic mycobacteria. We have found that while IFN-Î³ pre-treatment could selectively overcome the inhibitory effect to mycobacterial antigens, including MAP 316v Ag, non-pathogenic <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> as well as heat-killed MAP, on some parameters, it did not have any effect on the macrophage effector responses to live MAP.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that the inhibitory action of MAP 316v Ag and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> PPDB on nitric oxide production could be overcome by pre-treatment with IFN-Î³ but not LPS. The effect of IFN-Î³ pre-treatment was akin to a âswitchâ that enabled the cells to go from no nitric oxide response to full responsiveness to these antigens. This shows selective responsiveness of macrophages to mycobacterial antigens if they are exposed to IFN-Î³ prior to encounter with these antigens. This altered response did not correlate with any change in the expression of TLR2, a two pattern recognition receptor known to be involved in recognition of mycobacterial antigens.</p>
<p>This response pattern was reversed if the first encounter of the macrophage is with antigens from pathogenic mycobacteria. A recent study has reported that PPE2 protein of Mtb was capable of translocating to the nucleus of host cells and thereby inhibiting NO production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref048">48</xref>]. We observed a significant reduction in the responsiveness to LPS-induced nitric oxide production upon prior sensitization with 316v Ag and PPDB, but not PPDA in our study. This could be attributed to immune tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref049">49</xref>]. These findings are similar to that observed by Trajkovic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref050">50</xref>] using a secreted protein of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), wherein an Mtb specific antigen 10 (MTSA-10) was found to bind to the surface of J774 macrophage-like cells and induce nitric oxide in synergy with IFN-Î³. However pre-treatment of cells with MTSA-10 or a whole cell lysate of Mtb caused a marked reduction in nitric oxide production upon further incubation with LPS. This reduction in nitric oxide production after pre-treatment with MTSA-10 was attributed to desensitisation of macrophages mediated by MAPKp38 activity. A similar mechanism involving MAPKp38 may be occurring upon pre-treatment with PPDB and MAP 316v whole cell-derived antigen, as this signalling pathway has been shown to be activated upon exposure to certain MAP lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref051">51</xref>]. It could be speculated that a similar effect may occur <italic>in vivo</italic>, which would possibly reduce the ability of macrophages pre-exposed to antigens derived from pathogenic mycobacteria like MAP and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> to carry out nitric oxide-mediated killing of intracellular bacteria upon subsequent infection. However, lack of a similar response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> PPDA indicates that tolerance could be a phenomenon related to the relative pathogenic potential of an organism. Assessing a time line of the capability of macrophages exposed to different mycobacterial antigens to inherently produce NO and the ability of IFN-Î³ to possibly alter this might provide further insight into the pathogenic potential of mycobacterial antigens.</p>
<p>In contrast to the mycobacterial antigens, IFN-Î³ pre-treatment did not increase the nitric oxide response to live or heat-killed mycobacteria. Nitric oxide levels produced in response to the non-pathogenic mycobacteria tested were significantly higher than upon incubation with live MAP. We also observed that heat-killed MAP was more potent in inducing nitric oxide production in comparison to live MAP. In certain bacterial diseases like <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection, live bacteria were shown to inhibit nitric oxide production, however heat-killed bacteria were able to stimulate nitric oxide production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref052">52</xref>]. The reason attributed to this was that live bacteria suppress iNOS expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref052">52</xref>]. It has been established that in macrophages activated with LPS and IFN-Î³, an actin dependent recruitment of iNOS occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref053">53</xref>]. However, this is inhibited in macrophages infected with live mycobacteria. Downregulation of expression of EBP50, a scaffolding protein involved in binding of iNOS and linking it to the actin skeleton, is implicated as the mechanism for this and this phenomenon depends on the viability of the organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref053">53</xref>]. This increase in nitric oxide response after prior treatment with IFN-Î³ in response to mycobacterial antigens could be mediated by iNOS as found in this study. Interestingly, this increase in <italic>iNOS</italic> expression in response to mycobacterial antigens after pre-treatment with IFN-Î³ was not correlated with increased expression of <italic>IFNGRA-1</italic> or <italic>IRF-1</italic> in this study. Examination of varying time-points of post-stimulation or other factors such as MAPKp38 activity should be assessed by future studies.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to note that an increase in <italic>iNOS</italic> gene expression was noticed in cells incubated with only live <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> and not live MAP in this study. Moreover, we have previously published data showing significantly increased TLR2 expression in response to the pathogenic mycobacteria MAP in comparison to the non-pathogenic <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> even after IFN-Î³ pre-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref054">54</xref>]. This along with the data obtained in our current study leads us to speculate that decreased nitric oxide response in response to pathogenic mycobacteria could be mediated through TLR2 and is likely independent of the presence or absence of IFN-Î³ in the environment. Hence, it could be argued that the decreased capacity of MAP-infected macrophages to generate appreciable amounts of nitric oxide could be due to the inherent capacity of the live bacteria to inhibit the nitric oxide response in macrophages which cannot be overcome even with prior sensitization with IFN-Î³.</p>
<p>We also found that MAP as well as its antigen 316v induces activation and translocation of NFÎºB and that IFN-Î³ pre-treatment does not cause a significant difference in this parameter. The results of this study agree with that of Weiss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref055">55</xref>], who reported that MAP induces activation and translocation of NFÎºB in bovine monocytes resulting in enhanced TNF-Î± and IL-10 secretion. It has been shown that an increase in NFÎºB has been associated with a decrease in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref057">57</xref>]. This was validated in our study, in which the <italic>FAS</italic> gene was poorly induced in response to MAP and 316v Ag even after IFN-Î³ pre-treatment, in comparison to the induction seen by non-pathogenic <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>. This gene codes for the FAS death receptor (CD95) located on the surface of cells and is involved in promoting apoptosis. Pathogenic mycobacteria like <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> and Mtb upregulate host macrophage production of anti-apoptotic genes and prevent macrophage apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> depending on the MOI; apoptosis and cell death are enhanced at very high bacterial loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref058">58</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref062">62</xref>]. The interaction between FAS-ligand (FasL) and the FAS-receptor is critical for apoptosis to occur as FasL associates and trimerizes the FAS receptor on cell surfaces resulting in the initiation of extrinsic apoptosis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref064">64</xref>]. Mycobacteria have been shown to increase expression of FAS-ligand and decrease expression of FAS receptor on infected macrophages and thus overcome apoptosis which is believed to be one of the mechanisms for its survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref065">65</xref>]. Moreover, autophagy which is another innate immune mechanism capable of eliminating mycobacteria is under the control of pattern recognition receptors such as TLR and is activated by Th1 cytokines including IFN-Î³ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref066">66</xref>]. Some pathogenic mycobacteria such as the Beijing strain of Mtb are capable of suppressing JNK and p38 kinases and NFÎºB by exploiting host ubiquitination mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref068">68</xref>]. Although we did observe an increase in TLR2 expression in response to pathogenic mycobacterial antigens it was independent of IFN-Î³ pre-sensitization and therefore it is likely that MAP might alter autophagy also but this requires further targeted studies.</p>
<p>IFN-Î³ pre-treatment also failed to overcome the inhibition of another critical component of macrophage activation; namely, MHC-II expression, which is believed to be downregulated by pathogenic mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref069">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref070">70</xref>]. Decreased MHC-II expression even after IFN-Î³ pre-treatment in response to incubation with pathogenic mycobacteria has also been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref071">71</xref>]. Prolonged TLR signaling by Mtb has been shown to inhibit certain macrophage immune responses to IFN-Î³, especially those related to MHC-II antigen presentation, which was believed to be a survival mechanism of Mtb in evading T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref072">72</xref>]. Our findings indicate that this downregulation of MHC-II expression by MAP occurs irrespective of prior sensitization to IFN-Î³ and this feature was not observed in response to non-pathogenic <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic>, indicating the potential for pathogenic mycobacteria to overcome the potentiating capability of IFNÎ³. This is likely to be associated with enhanced signaling via TLR2 as it has been shown previously by our group that increased TLR2 expression was observed only in response to MAP and not MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results agree with those of several previous publications on pathogenic mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref073">73</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref080">80</xref>]. Although IFN-Î³ failed to overcome the inhibitory effect by pathogenic mycobacteria and its antigens on the parameters mentioned earlier, IFN-Î³ increased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î± and TNF-Î± in response to MAP and 316v Ag respectively. It also enhanced the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 significantly in response to MAP but decreased it in response to antigens. This leads us to believe that MAP can initiate a mixed M1/M2 polarization in macrophages, supporting our recently published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref081">81</xref>]. Also, antigens behave differently to whole bacteria in the way they interact with and induce innate immune responses and attempting to interpret the pathogenesis of a disease based on antigenic responses could be confounding. IFN-Î³ mediated increases in IL-1Î± and TNF-Î± may alter the cellular energy metabolic status due to their hypoglycaemic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref082">82</xref>] resulting in the phenomenon of cellular polarisation characterised by decreased expression of antigen presenting molecules and co-stimulatory molecules such as MHC-II, CD80 and CD86 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref083">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0176400.ref084">84</xref>]. Furthermore, although MHC-II expression was decreased even after IFN-Î³ pre-treatment, the impact of other cytokines or cellular effectors and the pathways involved would need to be verified. This has important implications as the notion that IFN-Î³ elicits solely a protective immune response in mycobacterial infections is a paradigm that developed with time, it is not an axiom and future studies would need to examine the relative contribution of this cytokine to inhibiting or possibly promoting mycobacterial persistence.</p>
<p>Based on our findings, we propose that although pre-stimulation with IFN-Î³ prior to encounter with viable mycobacteria may be advantageous in the initiation of selective protective immune responses it does not fully overcome the host immune inhibition initiated by pathogenic mycobacteria. This model system may be useful to investigate mycobacterial components that elicit optimal protective responses in relation to vaccine design. Under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, cells are likely to be exposed to a plethora of stimuli with synergistic interaction between different signaling mechanisms occurring simultaneously. Therefore, it would be interesting for future studies to assess the role of IFN-Î³ signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> in mycobacterial infection models or utilize 3D cell culture technology for <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches. This would help to gather critical information on IFN-Î³ signaling in macrophage function during infection with pathogenic mycobacteria and in response to vaccines.</p>
