<abstract id="ABS1">
<p id="P3">Multicellular organisms have co-evolved with complex consortia of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, collectively referred to as the microbiota. In mammals, changes in the composition of the microbiota can influence a wide range of physiologic processes (including development, metabolism, and immune cell function) and are associated with susceptibility to multiple diseases. Alterations in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviors such as social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms through which the microbiota influence neuronal activity and host behavior remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that manipulation of the microbiota in either antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single nucleus RNA-sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in multiple cell types including excitatory neurons and glial cells. Transcranial two-photon imaging following deliberate manipulation of the microbiota demonstrated that extinction learning deficits were associated with defective learning-related remodeling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition to effects of manipulating the microbiota on behavior in adult mice, selective re-establishment of the microbiota revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which microbiota-derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Lastly, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and were previous reported to be related to human and mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that microbiota-derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behavior. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires microbiota-derived signals during both early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p id="P4">Pavlovian fear conditioning is an evolutionarily conserved associative learning process that is critical for the survival of an organism and its ability to respond appropriately to neutral stimuli that reliably predict dangerous or aversive outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In the classical fear conditioning paradigm, extinction learning occurs when repeated cue presentations are no longer paired with an unconditioned stimulus (such as a foot shock) and the organism learns to modify its behavior accordingly. Deficits in extinction learning after an environmental threat has passed have been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Clinical and epidemiological studies have reported correlations between changes in the microbiota and other neuropsychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Animal studies indicate that the absence or modification of the intestinal microbiota affects neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, cortical myelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, blood-brain barrier function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and microglia maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, as well as social behavior, stress-related responses and fear learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, there are conflicting reports on how the microbiota influence behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and the mechanisms through which the microbiota regulate associative learning and its neurobiological substrates remain unclear.</p>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Extinction learning deficits following manipulation of the microbiota</title>
<p id="P5">To test whether the microbiota influence fear conditioning and extinction, we first antibiotic-treated adult mice (termed ABX mice)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and employed a classical cued fear conditioning and extinction learning paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. ABX mice and Ctrl mice showed comparable food/water intake and weight gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">c</xref>). The bacterial burden was 600-fold lower in ABX mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>), and 16S rDNA sequencing revealed a shift in bacterial community structure due to the antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">g</xref>). Following fear conditioning, ABX mice displayed equivalent freezing behavior to control mice, indicating that the acquisition of fear conditioning was normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Extinction learning reduced conditioned freezing in control mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, extinction learning and conditioned freezing were significantly impaired in ABX mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">c</xref>). To further examine the influence of the microbiota on extinction learning, we performed a similar cued fear conditioning and extinction learning assay in adult germ-free (GF) mice. To maintain the microbe-free status of the GF mice, we used a modified single-session fear extinction protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Again, both ABX and GF mice exhibited impaired extinction learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">e</xref>). These data demonstrate that signals derived from the microbiota are indispensable for optimal extinction of conditioned fear responses.</p>
<p id="P6">The vagus nerve is one mechanism through which neuronal communication between the intestine and the brain is established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. We sought to test whether the vagus nerve is involved in extinction learning deficits following deliberate manipulation of the microbiota by employing surgical vagotomy in adult animals. Notably, vagotomized ABX mice exhibited similar deficits in extinction learning as Sham ABX mice, suggesting that the extinction learning deficits in ABX mice is vagus nerve-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">Given that microbiota-derived signals can regulate the immune system and that immune cells can influence brain function and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, we tested whether extinction learning deficits were associated with alterations in immune responses in the brain. Compared to control mice, ABX and GF mice exhibited no differences in the percentages and numbers of CD45<sup>high</sup> leukocytes in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">e</xref>), and no differences in the percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs), F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages and Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">f</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">j</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which lack adaptive immune cells, exhibited normal extinction learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3k</xref>), while GF-<italic>Rag1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited deficits in extinction learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3l</xref>), indicating that the adaptive immune system is not required for extinction learning deficits in ABX and GF mice.</p>
<p id="P8">Given that deficits in extinction learning appear to occur independently of changes in the immune system, we sought to examine their neuroanatomical basis. We performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area of the brain known to play a critical role in extinction learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, from adult ABX and control mice. The mPFC tissue dissected in the absence of fear conditioning and extinction exhibited comparable transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">b</xref>). However, significant differences in the transcriptome of ABX and control mPFCs were revealed after extinction learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">g</xref>). Search tool for recurring instances of neighboring genes (STRING) analysis depicted networks of interactions of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ABX and control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">j</xref>); Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses revealed pathways that are associated with neuronal activity, synapse function, central nervous system maturation and the regulation of synaptic plasticity and postsynaptic dendritic spine development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">To test whether alterations in gene expression associated with these neuronal processes were associated with changes in neuronal activity, we examined neuronal activity in fear learning circuits by analyzing c-Fos expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is critical for encoding and storing conditioned fear memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and in the infralimbic region (IL) of mPFC, which facilitates extinction learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Compared to control mice, ABX and GF mice exhibited a higher density of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> neurons in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">m</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">d</xref>) and lower density of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> neurons in the IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1n</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">o</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">f</xref>), which is consistent with their deficits in extinction learning.</p>

<sec id="S2">
<title>Altered excitatory neurons and microglia in the mPFC following alterations in microbiota</title>
<p id="P10">To define the cell subsets in the mPFC that contribute to the effect of the microbiota on extinction learning, we performed single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of mPFC samples dissected from ABX and control mice after extinction learning, and identified 24 cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Changes in the microbiota were associated with significant changes in gene expression in multiple clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). Among the neuronal clusters, excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>) were more affected than inhibitory neurons including Pvalb<sup>+</sup>Tac1<sup>+</sup>, Sst<sup>+</sup>, Vip<sup>+</sup> or Npy<sup>+</sup> subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>, for comparable statistical power we calculated the number of DEGs after downsampling each cluster to 500 nuclei). Astrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes and microglia were also affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). DEGs shared across excitatory neuronal subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>) and across multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>) were linked to synapse-related pathways and calcium signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">3</xref>), which is consistent with our bulk RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>) and supports a model in which gene expression is altered in brain-resident cells, including specific cell populations such as excitatory neurons and microglia, following manipulation of the microbiota.</p>
<p id="P11">Given that microglia are important for maintaining neuronal function and brain health by dynamically regulating synaptic pruning and surveying their local microenvironment and have been reported to be affected by the microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, we further investigated the DEGs of microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The microglial DEGs were enriched in the pathways related to synapse organization and synapse assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), suggesting that deliberate manipulation of the microbiota may alter microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. In addition, consistent with the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, we found elevated percentages and numbers of microglia in GF mice, with elevated expression of CSF1R and F4/80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">d</xref>). The percentages and numbers of microglia in ABX mice were not changed, with no changes in CSF1R expression, but F4/80 expression was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9e</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">h</xref>). CSF1R and F4/80 are strongly developmentally regulated, with decreasing levels during maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Together, these data suggest that the microglia in GF and ABX mice exhibit an immature state reminiscent of developing juvenile microglia, which may in turn contribute to deficits in extinction learning by disrupting dendritic spine remodeling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Alterations in the microbiota are associated with defective extinction learning-related spine remodeling</title>
<p id="P12">Next, we employed two-photon laser scanning microscopy to directly quantify the remodeling of postsynaptic dendritic spines in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) during cued fear conditioning and extinction learning in transgenic Thy1/YFP reporter mice following manipulation of the microbiota in adulthood. Postsynaptic dendritic spines are membranous protrusions on neuronal dendrites that form primarily excitatory synapses with presynaptic axonal inputs and are dynamically remodeled during learning and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Previous work showed that fear conditioning and extinction learning are correlated with opposing effects on the formation and elimination of dendritic spines in the mPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We acquired images of the same dendritic spines during a baseline period and before and after fear conditioning and extinction learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">c</xref>). Compared to control mice, baseline spine elimination rates were significantly elevated in ABX mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">f</xref>), while baseline formation rates were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">g</xref>). Consistent with the previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, cued fear conditioning and extinction learning had opposing effects on spine remodeling in control mice. Fear conditioning increased spine elimination rates in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), such that there was no significant difference in spine elimination or formation rates in the 24 hours after conditioning in ABX mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">g</xref>). In contrast, extinction learning-related spine remodeling was significantly altered in ABX mice. Extinction learning increased spine formation rates in control mice but not in ABX mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">g</xref>), and spine elimination rates remained persistently elevated in ABX mice relative to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">Consistent with elevated spine elimination in ABX mice, we observed comparable expression of the pre-synaptic marker synaptophysin but lower expression of the post-synaptic marker PSD-95 in the mPFC of GF mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">k</xref>). In addition, the expression of <italic>Dlg4</italic> in excitatory neuron subset 1 (exPFC1) was downregulated in ABX samples compared to control samples. Together, these data indicate that alterations in the composition of the microbiota are associated with deficits in learning-induced spine plasticity. Notably, plasma corticosterone levels were comparable in control, ABX and GF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, indicating that HPA axis function may not be altered and is not a major driver in microbiota-mediated changes in spine remodeling and fear extinction learning.</p>

<title>Defective tone-encoding neuronal ensembles in ABX mice</title>
<p id="P14">To investigate whether signals derived from the microbiota regulate learning-related neuronal activity in the mPFC, we used two-photon imaging and a genetically encoded calcium sensor (AAV5/hSyn/GCaMP6s) to quantify neuronal activity during extinction learning in control and ABX mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">c</xref>). We identified mPFC neurons that encoded the conditioned stimulus, and discovered two differentially responding functional cell types. In both control and ABX mice, one neuronal population (representing 13.5% of all cells) exhibited equivalently reduced activity during tone presentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">e</xref>). In contrast, a second population (representing 14.9% of all cells) displayed increased activity during tone presentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Neuronal activity during tone presentations was modestly but significantly reduced in the latter cell population in ABX mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), consistent with their deficits in spine formation and behavior. Notably, 26.8% of these neurons also encoded the precise timing of the tones, exhibiting tone-locked activity that increased and decreased in response to the onset and offset of each tone, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). Again, tone-locked activity in these multicellular tone-sensitive ensembles was significantly reduced in ABX mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>). In conjunction with the RNA-seq and dendritic spine remodeling analyses, these data indicate that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota disrupts learning-related spine formation and interferes with the emergence of multicellular tone-encoding ensembles.</p>

<title>A diverse microbiota is required to restore extinction learning</title>
<p id="P15">To test whether the extinction learning deficits caused by altered microbiota can be rescued by colonization with defined individual microbes or consortia of microbes, we performed fear conditioning and extinction learning in gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacteria that are known to influence other physiologic processes. Notably, following colonization with segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, <italic>Clostridia spp</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, <italic>Enterobacter spp</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, or altered Schaedler flora (ASF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, these gnotobiotic mice still exhibited impaired extinction learning compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), suggesting that a more diverse microbiota is required for normal extinction learning and fear extinction behavior.</p>
<p id="P16">To investigate whether the extinction learning deficits caused by altered microbiota are reversible, we re-colonized previously germ-free (ex-GF) mice with a complete microbiota from healthy control mice at various developmental time points. Both ex-GF mice colonized when they were adults and ex-GF mice colonized at weaning age still displayed impaired fear extinction compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">c</xref>), indicating that extinction learning deficits were not reversible in GF mice after weaning. However, when ex-GF mice were colonized immediately following birth via fostering to microbiota-replete specific pathogen-free surrogate mothers (ex-GF_fostered mice), they exhibited a restoration of normal fear extinction behavior comparable to control_fostered mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>), indicating that extinction learning and learning-related plasticity require microbiota-derived signals during a critical developmental period prior to weaning. Lack of the microbiota in the neonatal period, no matter whether microbially-colonized or not after weaning, renders deficits in fear extinction learning in adulthood. While ex-GF_fostered mice restored fear extinction, we found no significant shift in the transcriptome of the mPFC of the ex-GF_fostered mice or control_fostered mice, compared to GF mice after the single-session fear extinction (data not shown). This could reflect the shorter extinction model employed in GF mice that may induce smaller transcriptional changes than the 3-day/session fear extinction model employed in ABX mice. Alternatively, the lack of transcriptional changes in the GF fostering studies could indicate other processes such as post-translational or epigenomic modifications.</p>

<title>Altered metabolites in the brain are associated with fear extinction</title>
<p id="P17">Next, we sought to examine whether changes in neuronal development and fear extinction learning were associated with alterations in microbiota-derived metabolites. We employed untargeted comparative metabolomics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and fecal samples from adult GF mice, control_fostered mice and ex-GF_fostered mice using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Using the <italic>xcms</italic> platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> for comparative analysis of the MS data sets, we identified four metabolites – phenyl sulfate, pyrocatechol sulfate, 3-(3-sulfooxyphenyl)propanoic acid (all phenolic compounds) and indoxyl sulfate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10c</xref>) – that were significantly decreased in CSF, serum and fecal samples of GF mice compared to control_fostered mice, and were recovered in ex-GF_fostered mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10d</xref>). Downregulation of the same four metabolites was also detected in comparisons of GF <italic>vs</italic>. control CSF samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10e</xref>), as well as in comparisons of ABX versus control samples (data not shown). Notably, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid (HPHPA, a derivative of 3-(3-sulfooxyphenyl)propanoic acid) and indoxyl sulfate have been associated with human neuropsychiatric disorders such as impaired executive function, schizophrenia and autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Other microbiota-derived phenolic compounds such as 4-ethylphenylsulfate were reported to influence autism-related mouse behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, suggesting these microbiota-derived compounds may play conserved roles in the development and function of neurons in multiple contexts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P18">This study informs a model whereby alterations in exposure to the microbiota in neonatal and adult mice can have profound and long-lasting effects on neuronal function and learning-related plasticity that subsequently regulate fear extinction behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10f</xref>). From bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq data, the deficits in extinction learning correlate with malfunctions of the mPFC, notably in excitatory neurons. Transcranial two-photon live imaging confirmed the changes in neurons in the ABX mice, specifically, reduced extinction learning-associated spine formation and altered learning-related neuronal activity. Given that the vagus nerve does not contribute to the extinction learning deficits in ABX mice in this setting, the microbiota may affect the central nervous system through circulating microbiota-derived metabolites, directly influencing excitatory neurons in the mPFC, leading to deficits in extinction learning. In addition, microbiota-derived metabolites may also influence other cell subsets in the mPFC, such as microglia, and indirectly affect the excitatory neurons and behavior. In accordance with this and consistent with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, we found that the microglia in GF and ABX mice exhibited an immature state reminiscent of developing juvenile microglia, which may contribute to elevated spine pruning and reduced extinction learning-associated spine formation. In this context, future studies are necessary to determine the molecular basis for how alterations in microbiota-derived metabolites affect cellular activities in the mPFC.</p>
<p id="P19">In summary, our findings offer one compelling explanation for the profound deficits in fear extinction learning in ABX and GF mice, and suggest alterations in microbiota-derived metabolites contribute to altered neuronal activity and behavior. Coupled with the growing literature on the influence of the microbiota, diet and lifestyle on chronic inflammatory diseases, metabolic health and cancer, the effects of beneficial microbes on brain health and behavior highlight the need to better define the co-evolved relationship between the microbiota, the nervous system and mammalian behaviors.</p>

PhiX contaminant sequences were removed, and merged sequences were filtered according to FASTQ quality scores using a maximum expected error number of 0.1. Filtered sequences were clustered into OTUs at a 97% identity threshold using the USEARCH cluster_otus command with default settings. Merged reads (unfiltered) were mapped to the OTU representative sequences, generating an OTU table.

<p id="P45">Demultiplexed FASTQ files were generated using Cell Ranger v2.0. Reads were aligned to the mm10 mouse transcriptome containing pre-mRNA annotations, similarly to previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, to generate raw gene expression matrices (nuclei by genes). Expression matrices across all four samples were merged and loaded into Scanpy (version 1.4.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Genes found in less than 3 nuclei were filtered out. Nuclei were filtered out using the following criteria: less than 600 genes (likely empty droplets), more than 5,000 genes (likely doublets), &gt;2% of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes, &gt;0.1% of reads mapping to caspase genes to remove apoptotic cells. The resulting filtered matrix consisted of 38,649 nuclei and 22,451 genes. The filtered gene expression matrix was normalized within each nucleus, resulting in a filtered, nuclei-normalized matrix X, then log-normalized by calculating ln(X+1). Before selecting variable genes, we masked genes that either contain highly repetitive regions in intronic regions that result in inflated read counts (PISD, Mylip, Gm17660) or highly expressed lncRNAs that affect within-nuclei normalization (Gm28928, Malat1). We selected 1,535 highly variable genes using the highly_variable_genes module in scanpy (min_mean=0.1, max_mean=3, min_disp=0.8) for clustering analysis.</p>

Mice were anesthetized via an IP injection of a Ketamine (144mg/kg)/Xylazine (13mg/kg) cocktail. A midline incision was made and the stomach was retracted inferiorly to expose the distal esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction. The anterior (left) and posterior (right) branches of the vagus nerve were identified running alongside the esophagus and severed distal to the hepatic branches. The stomach was then placed back into the anatomical position and a pyloromyotomy was performed using a bent 23 gauge needle. The superficial muscular layers were incised in a longitudinal fashion and closed transversely with 4–0 vicryl sutures. The peritoneum was then closed with a running 4–0 vicryl suture and the skin approximated with staples. Animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia under a heat lamp and returned to the colony room once awake and ambulating. For non-vagotomized mice, the vagus nerve was gently exposed without further manipulation. Animals were monitored for 7 days. The completeness of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy was verified by examining fluorescent label of the dorsal motor vagal nucleus (DMV) on brainstem sections one week after intraperitoneal injection of FluoroGold. No presence of fluorescent label in DMV neurons was accepted as a marker of complete vagotomy.</p>
