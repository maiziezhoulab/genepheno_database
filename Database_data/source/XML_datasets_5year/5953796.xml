<abstract>
<p id="P2">Loss of pleasure (clinically referred to as anhedonia), impairments in
other reward-related processes such as reward learning, motivation, and reward
valuation, and blunted affect characterize several mood and other psychiatric
disorders. Despite the availability of many therapeutic options for these
disorders, reward-related impairments remain challenging to treat and often
persist despite alleviation of other symptoms. Lack of animal models of
reward-related impairments and affect that have high construct and predictive
validity is a key obstacle to developing novel treatments. This review will
highlight: 1) guidelines to consider when developing translatable animal models;
and 2) recent efforts to develop new reward-related assessments in humans and
non-human animals that have been translated or back-translated from one species
to another. The procedures described in this review are used to assess aspects
of reward learning, motivated behavior, reward valuation, and affect. In several
cases, researchers have attempted to implement task parameters that are as
identical as possible to the parallel parameters used in existing cross-species
tasks, with the goal of improving the translation of preclinical drug discovery
findings to the clinic. In this regard, Dr. Athina Markou had great influence on
conceptualizing the development and use of translational animal models of
reward-related processes. Thus, this review is dedicated to Dr. Markou and her
tireless efforts throughout her career to understand and treat reward-related
impairments across several psychiatric disorders.</p>
