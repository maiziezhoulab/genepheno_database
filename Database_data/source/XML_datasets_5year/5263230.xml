<abstract>
<p>The function of the serotonin transporter (SERT) is regulated by its membrane trafficking. Previously, we showed that the C-terminus-deleted mutant of SERT (SERTΔCT) exhibited an aberrant membrane trafficking and subsequent retention at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, we found that proteasome inhibitor-induced ER stress resulted in the impairment of SERT membrane trafficking and retention of SERT at the ER, an impairment very similar to that of SERTΔCT. Based on the result that the chemical chaperone 4-phnylbutulic acid (4-PBA), which relieves ER stress, accelerated the membrane trafficking and upregulated SERT activity, we hypothesized that drugs that facilitate the membrane trafficking of SERT would have potential therapeutic effects on an ER stress-related disease. In this study, we aimed to develop simple screening methods for such drugs using SERT. We first validated the serotonin uptake assay using fluorescent substrates. This simple and reliable assay method was useful for screening for drugs that affected the wild-type SERT but not SERTΔCT. In addition, we verified an assay focusing on the formation of SERTΔCT aggregates. The drugs 4-PBA and SKF-10047 facilitated the trafficking of SERT to the membrane and reduced SERTΔCT aggregates, indicating that the drugs with such characters could be potential candidates for ER stress relief. For both assays, we clarified the usefulness of a high-content screening microscope. These results could pave the way for high-throughput screening for such drugs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p001">The serotonin transporter (SERT) terminates serotonergic neural transmission by the reuptake of serotonin into preterminals in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The SERT is a well-known target of antidepressants and is involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of mood disorder, anxiety disorder and autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p>
<p id="p002">The serotonin uptake activity of SERT-expressing cells is regulated by the membrane trafficking of SERT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The SERT is translated and initially glycosylated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is transferred to the Golgi apparatus, where it is maturely glycosylated. Thereafter, SERT is transferred to the plasma membrane, where it serves its function. To elucidate the functional <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">regulation</styled-content> of SERT, it is important to clarify the molecular mechanism by which SERT membrane trafficking is regulated.</p>
<p id="p003">In our previous study, we investigated the role of <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">the SERT</styled-content> C-terminus in its membrane trafficking and <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">glycosylation</styled-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For this purpose, we characterized a <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">C-terminus-deleted</styled-content> mutant of SERT (designated as SERTΔCT) by its uptake activity, localization and glycosylation. The results revealed that the membrane trafficking and glycosylation of SERTΔCT were disturbed and that its expression in the plasma membrane was robustly reduced, suggesting that the SERT C-terminus has a critical role in SERT membrane trafficking and glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p>
<p id="p004">Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neural diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic brain disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To elucidate the pathophysiological significance of SERT membrane trafficking in neural disease, we investigated how the SERT function was affected in the case of ER stress induced by proteasome inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">previous</styled-content> study demonstrated that ER stress impaired the membrane trafficking of SERT from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, thereby reducing the SERT activity of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This result indicated that features of wild-type SERT with ER stress were very similar to that of SERTΔCT. In other words, SERTΔCT mimics the wild-type SERT exposed to ER stress. In addition, we elucidated that the chemical chaperone 4-phnylbutulic acid (4-PBA), which relieves ER stress, facilitated the membrane trafficking of SERT, thereby upregulating the cellular SERT activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p>
<p id="p005">Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that the screening of drugs that accelerate the membrane trafficking of SERT would be useful for searching for therapeutic drugs that can improve ER stress-related disease. It is also speculated that drugs that modulate the SERT membrane trafficking would have beneficial effects on SERT-related neuropsychiatric diseases. In this study, we aimed to develop simple and valuable methods using SERT that can be applied to the high-throughput screening of such drugs.</p>

<title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
<p id="p007">A plasmid that can express FLAG-tagged rat SERT in mammalian cells was constructed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Briefly, a rat SERT cDNA fragment with <italic>Mun</italic>I sites on both the 5' and the 3' ends was obtained by PCR using the full-length rat SERT cDNA as a template. PCR products were subcloned into the pTB701FL expression plasmid, which can add FLAG amino acid residues to the N-terminus of the target protein. The plasmid is designated here as pFLAG-SERT. A plasmid that can express a <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">mutated</styled-content> form of SERT that lacks the C-terminus was made as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This plasmid is designated here as pFLAG-SERTΔCT.</p>
<p id="p008">COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with heat-inactivated FBS (10%), penicillin (100 unit/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Culturing was performed in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. For electroporation, pFLAG-SERT or pFLAG-SERTΔCT was transfected into COS-7 cells using an electroporator NEPA21 (NEPA GENE, Chiba, Japan) according to the protocol recommended by the supplier. Briefly, plasmids of 10 μg were transfected into 2×10<sup>6</sup> COS-7 cells and transfected cells were seeded into appropriate culture dishes.</p>
</sec>
<sec sec-type="2">
<title>[<sup>3</sup>H] 5-HT-Uptake Assay</title>
<p id="p009">Approximately 6×10<sup>6</sup> transfected COS-7 cells were equally divided into 24-well plates. As previously described, [<sup>3</sup>H] 5-HT uptake assays were carried out 48 hr after transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In brief, the culture medium was removed and replaced with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer, which contained the following (in mM): NaCl, 120; KCl, 4.7; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.2; HEPES, 25; MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2; KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2; and glucose, 10; pH 7.4. After a 15-min pre-incubation period at 37°C, the cells were incubated for an additional 15 min in the presence of [<sup>3</sup>H] 5-HT. To prevent the degradation of 5-HT, 100 μM pargyline and 100 μM L-ascorbic acid were added to the KRH buffer. The uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H] 5-HT was stopped by washing three times with cold KRH buffer containing 10 μM fluvoxamine, and the cells were then lysed with RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA pH 7.4). The cell extracts were diluted in a scintillation cocktail (Clear-Sol II, Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and their radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (LSC-5100, Aloka, Mitaka, Japan). The results were considered to represent the total 5-HT cellular uptake. [<sup>3</sup>H] 5-HT uptake in the presence of 10 μM fluvoxamine was also measured and was considered to represent the non-specific 5-HT cellular uptake. The specific 5-HT uptake was obtained by subtracting the non-specific 5-HT uptake from the total uptake amount. The 5-HT uptake assay was conducted at a concentration of 100 nM 5-HT. To calculate the uptake per mg of protein in the cells, the concentration of protein in the cell extract was measured using a BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s directions (Pierce Biotech., Rockford, IL, USA). The SERT uptake activity was defined as the amount of [<sup>3</sup>H] 5-HT uptake per mg of protein.</p>
<p id="p010">The drugs (4-PBA and SKF-10047) were applied to culture medium 24 hr after the transfection, and cells were cultivated for another 24 hr until the uptake assay was <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">performed</styled-content>.</p>

<title>Measurement of serotonin uptake using a fluorescent <break></break>substrate</title>
<p id="p011">For this purpose, we used a Neurotransmitter Transporter Uptake Assay kit from Molecular Devices Corporation. <styled-content specific-use="print" style="letter-spacing3">This fluorescence-based assay can detect dopamine</styled-content>, nor<styled-content specific-use="print" style="phyphen"></styled-content>adrenaline and serotonin transporter activity in expressing cells.

<p id="p012">The wild-type SERT- or SERTΔCT-transfected cells were seeded into 96-well plates (μ-plate, ibid, Martinsried, Germany) at a density of 8000 cells per well. The drug application procedure was the same as that used for the [<sup>3</sup>H] 5-HT uptake assay. The fluorescence of the substrate incorporated into cells was measured using a high-content screening microscope, Opera Phenix (PerkinElmer, <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">Waltham</styled-content>, MA, USA). For the detection of the cell nucleus, cells were stained with NucRed<sup>®</sup> Live 647 ReadyProbes<sup>®</sup> Reagent just before the uptake assay was performed.</p>
<p id="p013">The uptake assay started with the application of the fluorescent substrate in the extracellular buffer in each well. Five minutes after the application, the fluorescence of the cells was measured using the Opera Phenix microscope every 5 min for 45 min. The fluorescence of stained <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">nuclei and</styled-content> incorporated substrates was excited by 640 and <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">488 nm laser-induced</styled-content> fluorescence, respectively.

<title>Immunocytochemistry and counting aggregates</title>
<p id="p014">The 1×10<sup>5</sup> FLAG-SERTΔCT-transfected cells were seeded on glass-bottom culture dishes for the manual counting of aggregates. For analysis using the Opera <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">Phenix</styled-content> microscope, the 8×10<sup>3</sup> cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate. The drugs were applied using the same protocol for the serotonin uptake assay.</p>
<p id="p015">Immunocytochemistry was carried out for FLAG-SERTΔCT-expressing COS-7 cells as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In brief, the cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min at RT, washed twice with PBS, and then permeabilized with 500 μl PBS supplemented with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum (NGS) for 15 min. Then, the cells were washed twice in PBS with 0.03% Triton-X (PBS-T) and incubated for &lt;1 hr at RT with the desired primary antibodies and for &lt;1 hr at RT with the secondary antibodies <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">in PBS-T and</styled-content> 1% NGS. The primary and secondary antibodies used were the anti-DYKDDDDK tag mouse monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000) and the anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500), respectively.</p>
<p id="p016">For the manual counting of the number of aggregates, the fluorescent signals of cells in glass-bottom culture dishes were observed by fluorescence microscopy (BZ900, Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Three independent experiments were carried out. In each experiment, we counted the number of aggregates of 10–20 cells, calculated the average number of aggregates per cell and compared these values between the control and drug-treated groups.</p>
<p id="p017">For automatically counting aggregates, the fluorescent signals in the 96-well plate were observed using the Opera Phenix microscope.

<title>Effects of 4-phenylutyric acid and SKF-10047 on the <break></break>serotonin uptake activity of SERT and SERTΔCT</title>
<p id="p019">First, we focused on the drugs that have or induce chaperone activity. In our previous study, 4-phenylutyric acid (4-PBA), a chemical chaperones, was shown to accelerate the membrane trafficking of SERT, thereby, increasing the SERT activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To confirm this result, we investigated the effects of 4-PBA on the serotonin uptake activity of wild-type SERT or SERTΔCT, which was transiently transfected in COS-7 cells. For this purpose, we performed the conventional serotonin uptake assay using [<sup>3</sup>H] serotonin. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, the uptake activity of SERTΔCT was almost 10% of that of wild-type SERT. Treatment with 3 mM 4-PBA for 24 hr increased the SERT activity by 43% or 71% of control levels in wild-type SERT or SERTΔCT-transfected cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>B), confirming the previous results.</p>
<p id="p020">SKF-10047 is known to exert its chaperone activity by binding as an agonist to the Sigma-1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of SKF-10047, an agonist of the Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), on the serotonin uptake activity of wild-type SERT or SERTΔCT. Treatment with SKF-10047 for 24 hr did not increase the activity of wild-type SERT but robustly increased the activity of SERTΔCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>C).</p>
<p id="p021">The rate of increase by 4-PBA and SKF-10047 was greater in SERTΔCT-expressing cells than in wild-type SERT-expressing cells. This result suggests that SERTΔCT is more sensitive to drugs with chaperone activity than wild-type SERT. The SERTΔCT would be a beneficial tool as a sensor for screening for drugs that accelerate the membrane trafficking of SERT.</p>
</sec>
<sec sec-type="2">
<title>Serotonin uptake assay using a fluorescent substrate for SERT</title>
<p id="p022">The conventional serotonin uptake assay using radio isotope-labeled substrate is not suitable for the high-performance screening of numerous drugs because this assay requires many complicated procedures, as described in the materials and methods. To overcome this limitation, we utilized a Neurotransmitter Transport Assay Kit, which was provided by Molecular Device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The principles underlying this method are as follows: 1) the fluorescent substrate for SERT was applied to the SERT-expressing cells in an appropriate extracellular buffer. 2) This substrate was covered with masking dye in extracellular fluid. However, when the fluorescent substrate was incorporated into cells via SERT, the masking dye detached from the fluorescent substrate. Therefore, only substrates incorporated into cells were detected as fluorescence. The serotonin uptake activity of SERT was reflected by the accumulation of <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">fluorescence</styled-content> in cells. 3) This kit enables the real-time measuring of SERT uptake activity when used with a <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">fluorescence</styled-content> imager such as the Opera Phenix microscope.</p>
<p id="p023">The wild-type SERT- or SERTΔCT-transfected cells seeded on 96-well plates were stained with NucRed<sup>®</sup> Live 647 for later detection of the nucleus. The observation using the Opera Phenix microscope began 5 min after the fluorescent substrates were applied to the cells. The fluorescence of the nucleus, which was detected by NucRed<sup>®</sup> Live 647, and cytosol, which was detected by the fluorescent substrate incorporated into cells via SERT, were <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">measured</styled-content> every 5 min for 45 min. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows a representative fluorescence image of wells when SERT-transfected cells were seeded. The staining of nuclei showed that the number of cells detected in each well were nearly identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>A). In SERT-transfected cells, the fluorescence of incorporated substrates was apparently increased in control and 4-PBA treated wells at 45 min after the application compared with that at 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>B). To determine the non-specific uptake of substrates, the <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">fluorescence</styled-content> was measured in the presence of 10 μM <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">fluvoxamine</styled-content>, an inhibitor of SERT. No obvious change of fluorescence was observed in the fluvoxamine-treated well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>B).</p>
<p id="p024">The fluorescence intensity of each cell was quantified using the Opera Phenix microscope. The fluorescence intensity of cells treated with target drugs represented the total cellular uptake of the substrate. The specific substrate uptake was obtained by subtracting the non-specific substrate uptake from the total substrate cellular uptake. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows the time course of the fluorescence intensity, which corresponded to the specific substrate uptake of SERT-expressing cells. The substrate uptake was gradually increased up to 45 min. The treatment with 3 mM 4-PBA significantly augmented the substrate uptake of SERT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>A). By contrast, the treatment with 500 μM SKF-10047 tended to increase the substrate uptake of SERT, but the change was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>B). These results were very similar to those obtained using conventional radio isotope-based methods.</p>
<p id="p025">Next, we investigated the uptake of the fluorescent substrate in SERTΔCT-expressing cells. In contrast to the fluorescence change in SERT-expressing cells, there was <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">no obvious</styled-content> change in the fluorescence in SERTΔCT-expressing cells 45 min after the application of the fluorescent substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The fluorescence levels of SERTΔCT-expressing cells seemed to be comparable to those in the fluvoxamine-treated cells. The time courses of the fluorescence intensity are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. In the 4-PBA-treated group, neither obvious specific uptake of <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">fluorescence</styled-content> substrate nor significant effects of 4-PBA on SERTΔCT uptake activity were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>A). In the SKF-10047-treated group, obvious specific uptake via SERTΔCT was not observed in the controls; however, although very faint, an increase in fluorescent intensity was observed in the SKF-10047-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>B). These results for SERTΔCT obtained using the fluorescent substrate-based method was very different from those obtained using the radioisotope-based one.</p>

<title>Evaluation of drug effects using aggregation of SERTΔCT</title>
<p id="p026">As mentioned above and shown in a supplemental figure, SERTΔCT was mainly localized to the ER and was scarcely expressed at the plasma membrane. The representative immunostaining of SERTΔCT showed the aggregate formation at the ER in the perinuclear and cytosol compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>A). Furthermore, the number of aggregates was reduced by the treatment with 4-PBA and SKF-10047 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>A). These results led to the idea that aggregation of SERTΔCT was available for the evaluation of drugs that ameliorate ER stress.</p>
<p id="p027">First, we manually counted the number of aggregates for quantitative analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B, the treatment with 1 and 3 mM 4-PBA significantly reduced the number of SERTΔCT aggregates. Additionally, 200 μM SKF-10047 reduced the number of SERTΔCT aggregates. These results were comparable to the incremental effects <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">of 4-PBA</styled-content> and SKF-10047 on the uptake activity of SERTΔCT.</p>
<p id="p028">To automatically count the number of aggregates and pave the way to the high-performance screening of drugs, we again utilized the high-content screening microscope, Opera Phenix. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, the Opera Phenix microscope could recognize the cells and intracellular aggregates; therefore, this machine could automatically count the number of aggregates per cell. The quantitative analysis using the Opera Phenix microscope revealed that 4-PBA significantly reduced the number of SERTΔCT aggregates in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>B, left). The treatment with SKF-10047 also significantly reduced the number of aggregates; however, dose-dependent effects were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>B, right). These results indicated that the high-content screening microscope was very beneficial for automatically counting aggregates of SERTΔCT, suggesting that this method would pave the way to a high-throughput screening of drugs that can attenuate ER stress.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec sec-type="2">
<title>The SERTΔCT would be used as a sensitive and beneficial sensor protein in case of screening the drugs that facilitates trafficking of membrane proteins, thereby ameliorates the ER stress</title>
<p id="p029">To elucidate the role of the SERT C-terminus in its membrane trafficking and glycosylation, we previously investigated the character of SERTΔCT, the C-terminus-deleted mutant of SERT, in light of its uptake activity, localization and glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The results are summarized as follows: 1) The uptake activity of SERTΔCT was reduced to 1/10 of the level of that of wild-type SERT. 2) The maturely glycosylated SERTΔCT was reduced, whereas the immaturely glycosylated form was increased compared with the wild-type SERT. 3) The SERTΔCT was mainly localized at the ER and was not observed in plasma membrane, whereas wild-type SERT was expressed at both the ER and plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These results revealed that the disturbance of SERTΔCT membrane trafficking and glycosylation reduced the expression of functional SERT in the plasma membrane, thereby showing the critical role of the SERT C-terminus in SERT membrane trafficking and glycosylation. Indeed, it is known that the SERTC-terminus region has an export signal sequence that is important for transporting the SERT from the ER to the Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p>
<p id="p030">We also previously investigated how ER stress affects the membrane trafficking of SERT to elucidate the pathophysiological significance of the SERT functional regulation via its membrane trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. ER stress, induced by proteasome inhibitors, resulted in the impairment of SERT membrane trafficking and subsequent retention of SERT at the ER, the state of which was very similar to that of SERTΔCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These findings led to the idea that drugs that facilitate membrane trafficking of SERT, and especially SERTΔCT, would alleviate ER stress.</p>
<p id="p031">We first focused on a chemical chaperone and a sigma-1A receptor agonist as candidate drugs, which either have chaperon-like activity itself or enhance the chaperone activity, respectively. Our previous study already revealed that a chemical chaperone 4-PBA upregulated the SERT activity via accelerating its membrane trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and our present results confirmed it. In this study, we also found that SKF-10047, a sigma-1A receptor agonist, upregulated the SERT activity. In our preliminary study, western blotting analysis confirmed that SKF-10047 also facilitated the membrane trafficking of SERT. These results indicate that 4-PBA and SKF-10047 are candidate drugs that validate the drug screening methods.</p>
<p id="p032">Importantly, the incremental effects of 4-PBA and SKF-10047 on serotonin uptake activity were more prominent in the SERTΔCT than in the wild-type SERT. It is plausible that the ER stress relief drugs could have more apparent effects in the stressed state than normal state. These ideas suggest that the SERTΔCT would be a beneficial tool as a sensor protein for screening for drugs for this purpose.</p>
</sec>
<sec sec-type="2">
<title>Validation of the serotonin uptake assay using fluorescent substrates</title>
<p id="p033">To establish a simple and reliable assay system for screening various drugs with high performance, we tried to develop another method for a serotonin uptake assay other than the conventional radio isotope-based assay methods. For this purpose, we used the Neurotransmitter Transport Assay Kit provided by Molecular Device Corporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This assay kit enables the measurement of serotonin uptake activity by simple application of fluorescent substrates to wild-type SERT- or SERTΔCT-expressing cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, the fluorescence time-dependently increased in accordance with the accumulation of substrates in SERT-expressing cells, although the fluorescent intensity did not reach a plateau within the observed period in this study. <styled-content specific-use="print" style="keep-together.within-line">By contrast</styled-content>, the fluorescent increase was not observed in fluvoxamine-treated cells. These results suggest that fluorescence accumulation occurred via SERT. The effects of 4-PBA and SKF-10047 on the SERT activity were very similar to those obtained using the radio isotope-based assay, indicating that this method is reliable and suitable for screening for drugs that affect the SERT uptake activity.</p>
<p id="p034">By contrast, the accumulation of fluorescence was <styled-content specific-use="print" style="letter-spacing1">scarcely observed in SERTΔCT-expressing cells. With SKF-</styled-content><styled-content specific-use="print" style="space"></styled-content>10047 treatment, there was a very faint increase in fluorescence observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>B) possibly because the effect of SKF-10047 on SERTΔCT was robust. Based on the results <styled-content specific-use="print" style="letter-spacing1">provided from the manufacturer, the Km value of fluorescent</styled-content> substrate for the human SERT is 0.96 μM (https://www.<styled-content specific-use="print" style="space"></styled-content><styled-content specific-use="print" style="letter-spacing2">moleculardevices.com/products/assay-kits/neurotransmitter-</styled-content>transporter-uptake-assay-kit), which is comparable to that <styled-content specific-use="print" style="letter-spacing1">of radioisotope-labeled serotonin for rat SERT, 0.32 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</styled-content> These results suggest that the sensitivity for the detection of incorporated serotonin is higher in the radio isotope-based methods than in the methods using fluorescent substrates. It is unfortunately concluded that the serotonin uptake assay using fluorescent substrates is not suitable for screening drugs that affect the activity of SERTΔCT.</p>
</sec>
<sec sec-type="2">
<title>The aggregation of SERTΔCT would be a beneficial index for screening for drugs that accelerate membrane trafficking and attenuate ER stress</title>
<p id="p035">Based on the immunohistochemical observation, we found that the retained SERTΔCT tended to form aggregates. These aggregates were observed mainly in the perinuclear region and sparsely in the cytosol, where the ER was suggested to be localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The reduction of aggregates by a drug would become direct evidence that this drug possibly ameliorates ER stress. Therefore, we focused on the appearance of SERTΔCT aggregates when 4-PBA or SKF-10047 was applied. The results of manually counting the aggregates showed that both 4-PBA and SKF-10047 significantly reduced the number of SERTΔCT aggregates in a dose-dependent manner.</p>
<p id="p036">Next, we tried to automatically count the SERTΔCT aggregates using the Opera Phenix microscope. The analysis software, which was originally prepared for lipid droplet analysis (Ready Made Solution #15), was suitable for this purpose. The results of automatically counting SERTΔCT aggregates were very similar to those using manual counting. With the automatic count, the number of analyzed cells was increased by approximately 10 times compared with the manual count, indicating that more reliable results could be obtained. Furthermore, the automatic count was finished within a few minutes. These results suggest that evaluation of SERTΔCT aggregates using high-content screening microscopes such as Opera Phenix would be a powerful method that can pave the way to the high-throughput screening of drugs that attenuate ER stress.</p>
</sec>
<sec sec-type="2">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p id="p037">The analysis of fluorescent substrates was suitable for high-performance screening of drugs that affect the activity of wild-type SERT but was not applicable for screening SERTΔCT-affecting drugs. By contrast, the analysis of SERTΔCT aggregates was suitable for high-performance screening of drugs that provide ER stress relief. In both analyses, the high-content screening microscope was found to be a beneficial and powerful tool that can pave the way to the high-throughput screening of drugs with ER stress relief effects.</p>

<p>The COS-7 cells expressing GFP-SERTΔCT was immunostained with anti-KDEL antibody (10C3, Enzo Life Sciences, 1:100), which can recognize ER. The signals of ER were visualized by Alexa546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (middle). The co-localization of GFP-SERTΔCT and ER was observed by the fluorescence microscopy (BZ900, Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The Aggregation of GFP-SERTΔCT (upper) was clearly colocalized with ER (middle).

<p>Effects of 4-PBA and SKF-10047 on the uptake activity of SERT and SERTΔCT. The conventional serotonin uptake assay using [<sup>3</sup>H] serotonin was carried out for these experiments. <bold>A</bold>: Comparison of the serotonin uptake activity of wild-type SERT and SERTΔCT. The serotonin uptake activity of SERTΔCT was reduced to almost 1/10 of the level of that of wild-type SERT. The data represent the mean±S.E.M (**P&lt;0.01 vs. non-treated control, n=4, Student’s t-test). <bold>B</bold>: Effects of 3 mM 4-PBA on the serotonin uptake activity of SERT and SERTΔCT. Serotonin uptake activity was significantly augmented with 4-PBA more prominently in SERTΔCT than wild-type SERT. The data represent the mean±S.E.M (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 vs. non-treated control, n=4, Student’s t-test). <bold>C</bold>: Effects of SKF-10047 on the serotonin uptake activity of SERT and SERTΔCT. SKF-10047 exhibited no significant effects on wild-type SERT, whereas SKF-10047 significantly increased the serotonin uptake activity of SERTΔCT in a dose-dependent manner. The data represent the mean±S.E.M (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 vs. non-treated control, n=8, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test).</p>
