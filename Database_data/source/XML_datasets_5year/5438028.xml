<abstract>
<p>Reduced dendritic spine density (DSD) in cortical layer 3 of the superior temporal gyrus (STG), and multiple other brain regions, is consistently observed in postmortem studies of schizophrenia (SZ). Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of this intermediate phenotype holds promise for understanding SZ pathophysiology, identifying SZ treatment targets and developing animal models. DNA methylation (DNAm), the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine nucleotide, regulates gene transcription and is a strong candidate for such a mechanism. We tested the hypothesis that DNAm correlates with DSD in the human STG and that this relationship is disrupted in SZ. We used the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip Array to quantify DNAm on a genome-wide scale in the postmortem STG from 22 SZ subjects and matched non-psychiatric control (NPC) subjects; DSD measures were available for 17 of the 22 subject pairs. We found DNAm to correlate with DSD at more sites than expected by chance in NPC, but not SZ, subjects. In addition, we show that the slopes of the linear DNAm-DSD correlations differed between SZ and NPC subjects at more sites than expected by chance. From these data, we identified 2 candidate genes for mediating DSD abnormalities in SZ: brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2 (<italic>BAIAP2</italic>) and discs large, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, homolog of, 1 (<italic>DLG1</italic>). Together, these data suggest that altered DNAm in SZ may be a mechanism for SZ-related DSD reductions.</p>

<sec>
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Schizophrenia (SZ) is thought to be a disorder of cerebral cortical circuitry disruption. Particular SZ symptoms are associated with dysfunction of certain cortical circuits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> For example, cortical circuit abnormalities in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), a brain region critical for auditory processing, are associated with auditory verbal hallucinations and impaired auditory sensory processing. Impaired auditory processing further contributes to phonologic dyslexia and difficulty recognizing and expressing spoken emotional tone (prosody) in SZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reduced dendritic spine density (DSD) in cortical STG layer 3, and other brain regions, is observed in postmortem studies of SZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> We have previously demonstrated reduced DSD in STG layer 3 of SZ subjects in multiple cohorts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> We have also shown that the DSD reduction in SZ is of a similar magnitude in both the Heschl's Gyrus and planum temporale of the STG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reduced DSD has several features indicating it is an intermediate phenotype for SZ. An intermediate phenotype is a heritable quantitative biological trait that is correlated with a disorder due, in part, to shared genetic architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> A number of genes contribute to regulation of dendritic spine features including DSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> and several of these are also SZ risk genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most useful intermediate phenotypes are functionally associated with aspects of the core clinical deficits of the disorder. DSD is intimately linked to neuronal function and changes in DSD are essential for normal cognition and sensory processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Many disorders characterized, in part, by impaired cognition are also characterized by DSD abnormalities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> thus suggesting that reduced DSD likely contributes to cognitive deficits in SZ. For example, in the auditory cortex, dendritic spines on layer 2/3 neurons segregate frequency inputs to the neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Thus reduced DSD on these neurons would likely lead to impaired frequency discrimination, a deficit that has been observed in SZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elucidating the mechanisms of this intermediate phenotype is important for understanding SZ pathophysiology, identifying SZ treatment targets and developing animal models. DNA methylation (DNAm), the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine nucleotide, regulates gene transcription and is a strong candidate for such a mechanism. DNAm is altered in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> of SZ subjects and DNAm alterations are present in other contexts characterized by DSD abnormalities including neurodevelopmental disorders, models of addiction, and activity-dependent plasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that DNAm correlates with DSD in the human STG and that this relationship is disrupted in SZ.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec>
<title>Postmortem brains</title>
<p>Brains were recovered and processed as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Briefly, brains were recovered during routine autopsies at the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office, Pittsburgh, PA, USA following informed consent from next-of-kin. DSM-IV diagnoses were made based on clinical records and structured interviews with surviving relatives. The right hemisphere was blocked coronally and the resultant slabs snap frozen and stored at −80 °C. Slabs containing the STG were identified and the STG was removed as a single block. Samples containing all six cortical layers of STG (planum temporale), but excluding the adjacent white matter, were harvested. All procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Committee for the Oversight of Research and Clinical Training Involving the Dead and the Institutional Review Board for Biomedical Research.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Cohort membership</title>
<p>The cohort was comprised of 22 subjects with either schizophrenia (<italic>N</italic>=16) or schizoaffective disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were considered together because studies of DSD have not found differences between them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Each SZ subject was matched with a non-psychiatric control (NPC) subject for sex, hemisphere, and as closely as possible for postmortem interval (PMI), age and other characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). DSD measures from STG layer 3 were available for 17 SZ-NPC pairs (NPC=0.036±0.0019 spines per μm<sup>3</sup>, SZ=0.028±0.0021 spines per μm<sup>3,</sup>
<italic>t</italic>=2.8, <italic>P</italic>=0.084; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The 17 SZ-NPC pairs are a subset of the cohort studied in Shelton <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> and there is no overlap between the 17 SZ-NPC pairs and subjects studied in Sweet <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Each pair was processed together to minimize experimental variability, and experimenter was blinded to subject's diagnosis throughout.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>DNA preparation and bisulfite conversion</title>
<p>DNA (~10 μg) was isolated from STG gray matter (~20 mg) using AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and bisulfite converted using EZ-96 DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), both as per manufacturer's protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>DNAm arrays</title>
<p>DNAm is the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine nucleotide within the context of a cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide, usually, but also within the context of a cytosine-phosphate-H dinucleotide (CpH; H=adenine, cytosine or thymine).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> CpGs and CpHs are referred to as ‘DNAm sites' or ‘sites' in this manuscript. DNAm was measured at 485 577 sites (482 421 CpG dinucleotides, 3091 CpH dinucleotides and 65 SNPs) using Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip Array (HM450; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as per manufacturer's protocol. <italic>β</italic>-values, the ratio of signal from a methylated probe relative to the sum of both methylated and unmethylated probes, were calculated. A <italic>β</italic>-value corresponds to the proportion of a particular site that is methylated in a sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Data preprocessing and filtering</title>
<p>Data analyses were performed using the R software environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.r-project.org</ext-link>). Color adjustment and background correction were performed using the bgAdjust2C method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Normalization was performed using the <italic>β</italic>-mixture quantile normalization method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Multidimensional scaling (MDS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> was used to visualize the degree of similarity among subjects using HM450 data. Prior to data filtering, samples from four subjects were run in replicate and replicate samples from each of the four subjects clustered together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>β</italic>-values for each replicate pair were averaged for the remaining analyses. Samples also segregated by sex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>) and this segregation remained after filtering out data from SNP probes (<italic>N</italic>=65) and probes with detection <italic>P</italic>-values&gt;0.01 in any sample (<italic>N</italic>=3390; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). After filtering out probe data from sex chromosomes (<italic>N</italic>=11 648), samples no longer segregated by sex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>), but segregation by race became evident (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). Filtering data from invariable probes (s.d.&lt;5th percentile; <italic>N</italic>=23 547), did not alter similarity among samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>). Data from 447 392 probes remained for downstream analysis.</p>
<p>Because samples did not segregate by sex on MDS analysis after filtering out probe data from sex chromosomes, sex was not considered a covariate in downstream analyses. Others have shown that DNAm sex differences on autosomal chromosomes are often small in magnitude and inconsistently reproduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> Given segregation by race on the MDS analysis, race was included as a covariate in downstream analyses. One subject in this study was of Asian Indian ancestry. This subject, consistent with known genetic architecture,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> clustered with the subjects of European ancestry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>) and was thus combined with this group for analyses. Although the samples did not segregate by age on the MDS analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1F</xref>), age was considered as a covariate in downstream analyses given the overwhelming evidence that DNAm varies extensively by age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Similarly, the samples did not segregate by PMI (data not shown) on the MDS analysis but because many factors that may have an impact on DSD in postmortem brain have been found to be particularly sensitive to PMI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> PMI was considered as a covariate for downstream analysis. All analyses presented in the body of this paper adjust for race, age and PMI. Results of analyses adjusting only for race and age can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables 3–6</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Cell population estimation</title>
<p>DNAm differs markedly between neurons and glia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> The proportion of neurons to glia in samples was estimated using a model based on <italic>β</italic>-values from cell-type-specific sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> Neuronal proportion did not differ between SZ and NPC subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Site-specific DNAm-DSD correlations</title>
<p>Pearson correlations between DNAm (normalized <italic>β</italic>-values) at each site and DSD (spines per μm<sup>3</sup>) were calculated for all subjects. Examination of the linear DNAm-DSD correlations was performed for each of 3 groups (NPC and SZ subjects, NPC subjects and SZ subjects) using linear regression models with race, age and PMI adjusted.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Diagnosis-dependent differences in the DNAm-DSD correlations</title>
<p>Differences in the slopes DNAm-DSD correlations were assessed using linear regression models. For each site, two models were fitted: (1) DSD~<italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>+<italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub> × DNAm+<italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> × diagnosis and (2) DSD~<italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>+<italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub> × DNAm+<italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> × diagnosis+<italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub> × (DNAm × diagnosis). The likelihood-ratio test (LRT) was then used to test whether the DNAm-DSD correlation differed between SZ and NPC subjects.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Candidate genes for mediating reduced DSD in SZ</title>
<p>For each candidate gene, a permutation-based test was performed to assess whether the difference in slope of the DNAm-DSD correlation (SZ-NPC; across all sites in that gene) is significant. The diagnosis label (SZ or NPC) was permuted 1000 times for all 34 samples. Within each permutation, the differences in slopes of the DNAm-DSD correlation (SZ-NPC) for all the sites in that gene were computed, and then a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test statistic was computed for these difference values. Finally, the permutation-based <italic>P</italic>-value was generated by comparing this one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test statistic under the true diagnosis to those under the permutation.</p>
</sec>

<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<sec>
<title>There are more DNAm-DSD correlations than would be expected by chance in NPC, but not SZ, subjects</title>
<p>When all subjects are combined for analysis, there are more DNAm-DSD correlations than would be expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a and b</xref>). This is true when NPC subjects only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c and d</xref>) are considered. The number of DNAm-DSD correlations in SZ subjects is no more than would be expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1e and f</xref>). In the combined group, no DNAm-DSD correlations reached significance (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>) and 84 reached a suggestive level of significance (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In NPC subjects, one DNAm-DSD correlation reached significance and 150 reached a suggestive level of significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In SZ subjects, no DNAm-DSD correlations reached significance and 51 reached a suggestive level of significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> and Table 3). After adjusting for potential confounders, DNAm-DSD correlations were, in general, less statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>DNAm-DSD correlations at multiple sites differ between NPC and SZ subjects</title>
<p>Not only were there many fewer strong DNAm-DSD correlations in SZ subjects, the slopes of the linear DNAm-DSD correlations differed between NPC and SZ subjects at more sites than would be expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The slopes of the DNAm-DSD correlations at two sites differed significantly (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1x10<sup>-7</sup>), and at 269 sites suggestively (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), between SZ and NPC subjects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p>

<sec>
<title>Candidate genes for mediating reduced DSD in SZ</title>
<p>We selected for more detailed follow-up genes meeting three criteria: (1) it was a gene for which there is evidence that one of its variants, either rare or common, genetically associates with SZ; (2) it was a gene in which a role in regulation of dendritic spines is established; and (3) it was one of the genes (or closest genes) to a site with a DNAm-DSD correlation reaching at least the suggestive level of significance, <italic>P</italic>&lt;1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>. For this latter criterion the more liberal suggestive level of significance was chosen so as not to preclude detection of potentially causally related genes due to the limited power inherent in a study of the current sample size. Two genes met all three criteria: Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2 (<italic>BAIAP2</italic>) and Discs Large, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Homolog of, 1 (<italic>DLG1</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>BAIAP2</title>
<p>DNAm-DSD correlations at two <italic>BAIAP2</italic> sites (cg01276536 and cg23261327) reached a suggestive level of significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>; criterion 1). Multiple rare <italic>BAIAP2</italic> mutations have been associated with SZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> (criterion 2). <italic>BAIAP2</italic> encodes a scaffolding and adaptor protein that regulates membrane and actin dynamics in dendritic spines and <italic>Baiap2</italic> null mice exhibit reduced DSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> (criterion 3).</p>
<p>DNAm (normalized <italic>β</italic>-values) at 120 of 176, or 68.2%, of the <italic>BAIAP2</italic> sites were relatively hypomethylated in SZ subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), significantly more than the proportion of such sites observed among all sites analyzed (43.2%, Pearson <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>-test, <italic>P</italic>=0.00013).</p>
<p>DNAm was correlated with DSD at many sites across <italic>BAIAP2</italic> in both SZ and NPC subjects but the direction and magnitude of correlation often differed by diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The slopes of the linear DNAm-DSD correlations differed between NPC and SZ subjects using the LRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Further, the difference in slope of the DNAm-DSD correlation (SZ-NPC; across all 176 <italic>BAIAP2</italic> sites) is significant (permutation-based <italic>P</italic>=0.011).</p>
<p>The <italic>BAIAP2-AS1</italic> gene is an antisense-oriented long non-coding RNA with a head-to-head orientation with respect to the 5′ region of <italic>BAIAP2</italic>. Like <italic>BAIAP2, BAIAP2-AS1</italic> is characterized by DNAm-DSD correlations at multiple sites, which differ between NPC and SZ subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The LRT performed to assess whether the correlations differ by diagnosis showed an excess of small <italic>P</italic>-values compared to what would be expected by chance (data not shown). The difference in slopes of the DNAm-DSD correlation (SZ-NPC; across 13 <italic>BAIAP2-AS1</italic> sites) is significant (permutation-based <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Notably, the slope of the correlation was negative at all sites in NPC subjects and positive in 11 of 13 of the sites in SZ subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>

<title>DLG1</title>
<p>One site for which the DNAm-DSD correlation differed significantly between SZ and NPC subjects (cg07756562) is located in the region 5′ to <italic>DLG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>; criterion 1). Studies have found common <italic>DLG1</italic> variants to be associated with SZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Further, studies of copy-number variation have found a significant excess of deletions at the chromosomal position 3q29, which includes the <italic>DLG1</italic> gene, in SZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> (criterion 2). <italic>DLG1</italic> encodes a scaffolding protein that participates in the localization of glutamate receptors to the post-synaptic membrane and overexpression of <italic>DLG1</italic> in organotypic slice cultures alters dendritic spine morphology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> (criterion 3).</p>
<p>DNAm sites in <italic>DLG1</italic> and the genomic region immediately 5′ to <italic>DLG1</italic> were characterized by a wide range of DNAm levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). DNAm levels did not exhibit any discernible pattern with respect to <italic>DLG1</italic> gene features, though such an assessment is limited by the fact that no data for DNAm sites at the 3′ end of <italic>DLG1</italic> were available in the data set. No overall hypo- or hypermethylation in SZ is evident in <italic>DLG1</italic> (Pearson <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>-test, <italic>P</italic>=1).</p>
<p>The linear DNAm-DSD correlation at site cg07756562 differed between SZ and NPC subjects (<italic>P</italic>=6.22x10<sup>-8</sup>). At this site, DNAm correlates positively with DSD in SZ subjects and negatively with DSD in NPC subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first postmortem brain study of the relationship of DNAm to DSD in SZ subjects. We evaluated the hypothesis that DNAm correlates with DSD in the human STG and that this relationship is disrupted in SZ subjects. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found DNAm to correlate with DSD at more sites than expected by chance in NPC, but not SZ, subjects. We also found that the slopes of DNAm-DSD correlations often differed between NPC and SZ subjects. We identified <italic>BAIAP2</italic> and <italic>DLG1</italic> as candidate genes for mediating DSD abnormalities in SZ.</p>
<sec>
<title>DNAm-DSD correlations</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that DNAm is an important upstream mechanism for generating normal DSD and that this mechanism is disrupted in SZ subjects. Although, to our knowledge, this is the first time a DNAm-DSD relationship has been demonstrated in SZ, DNAm is altered in a number of contexts characterized by abnormal DSD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> Perhaps the most convincing evidence for a causal effect of DNAm on DSD comes from the study of addiction models where overexpression of a DNA methyltransferase, and downstream DNAm, alone, is sufficient to alter DSD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>The DNAm alterations observed in SZ, and thus the disrupted DNAm-DSD relationships, are likely to result from a combination of both genetic and environmental factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Notably, common risk variants for SZ have been shown to regulate local DNAm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> but none of the sites in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref> have been identified as targets of methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) that overlap with SZ risk loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> or neurodevelopmental mQTLs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://epigenetics.essex.ac.uk/mQTL/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://epigenetics.essex.ac.uk/mQTL/</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> A number of environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SZ,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> and many of them have been shown to alter DNAm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> It is also important to consider that alterations in DNAm and DNAm-DSD correlations observed in SZ subjects may be the result of treatment-induced changes in the brain. We have previously found that antipsychotic treatment does not alter STG DSD in an animal model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> but accumulating evidence suggests that antipsychotics do alter DNAm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> However, DNAm alterations are observed in peripheral blood from early SZ subjects with only brief (&lt;16 weeks) antipsychotic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> thus suggesting that not all DNAm alterations in SZ are explained by antipsychotic treatment. In some cases, SZ-associated DNAm alterations are normalized by antipsychotic drugs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> perhaps suggesting that the therapeutic effect of antipsychotics are mediated, in part, by affecting DNAm.</p>

<sec>
<title>Putative mechanisms underlying DNAm-DSD correlation</title>
<p>The study of DNAm function has historically focused on its role in promoter regions. In this context, DNAm usually blocks transcription. It is now recognized that DNAm function is context dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup> and that intragenic and intergenic DNAm affects transcription. Notably, DNAm affects alternative promoter usage, regulation of short and long non-coding RNAs, alternative splicing and enhancer activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>DNAm-DSD correlations in <italic>BAIAP2 and DLG1</italic> were distributed throughout intragenic, associated non-coding RNAs, and promoter regions, suggesting that DNAm may alter DSD in SZ by affecting transcription via both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms. DNAm at two <italic>BAIAP2</italic> sites within intron 7–8 are strongly and positively correlated with DSD. These two sites are in a CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding site. CTCF binds unmethylated DNA and, in intragenic contexts, promotes exon inclusion into the mature transcript.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup> We predict that DNAm at these sites leads to an increase in <italic>BAIAP2</italic> transcript variants with exclusion of exons local to intron 7–8 and that these transcript variants positively regulate DSD. Consistent with this prediction, multiple <italic>BAIAP2</italic> transcript variants have been identified which differ with respect to the composition of their 3′ end (Miyahara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003) and primary data including mRNA and EST alignments suggest that there are transcripts that do not contain exon 7 and/or 8.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most of the <italic>BAIAP2</italic> DNAm-DSD correlations in NPC subjects, however, were negative ones in which lower DNAm was correlated with higher DSD. DNAm at a site 5′ to <italic>DLG1</italic> (cg07756562) is similarly correlated with DSD in NPC subjects. Decreased DNAm in 5′ regions is usually associated with increased total transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> We suggest that lower DNAm at these sites allows for increased <italic>BAIAP2</italic> and <italic>DLG1</italic> transcription, promoting dendritic spine formation. Supporting this interpretation is evidence that <italic>BAIAP2</italic> overexpression promotes DSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> and <italic>DLG1</italic> overexpression promotes dendrite growth and complexity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other DNAm-DSD correlations are annotated to <italic>BAIAP2-AS1</italic> and are also relatively hypomethylated in SZ subjects. We anticipate increased <italic>BAIAP2-AS1</italic> transcription in SZ as a result of this hypomethylation. It is difficult to know how higher levels of <italic>BAIAP2-AS1</italic> might affect expression of <italic>BAIAP2</italic>. Antisense long non-coding RNAs, like <italic>BAIAP2-AS1,</italic> often regulate local gene transcription at multiple levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup> but <italic>BAIAP2-AS1</italic> has not been studied.</p>
<p>DNAm differences between SZ and NPC subjects at particular sites is one mechanism by which the DNAm-DSD correlations may be disrupted in SZ. Indeed, our data suggest that there are many sites where DNAm differs between SZ and NPC subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Global DNAm, however, does not appear to differ between SZ and NPC subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Disruptions of DNAm-DSD correlations in SZ that do not result from a change in DNAm may reflect an abnormality downstream of DNAm (e.g., disrupted binding of a DNAm-dependent transcription factor and so on).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Despite plausible relationships between DNAm in multiple genes (including <italic>BAIAP2</italic> and <italic>DLG1</italic>) and DSD, the findings, like those of any postmortem brain study, are only correlative and cannot establish a mechanistic relationship. Our use of SZ risk gene and DSD regulator criteria to define candidate genes limits the ability to identify novel genes important in SZ pathophysiology or dendritic spine regulation. However, because of the large number of sites tested, there is a likelihood that some DNAm-DSD correlations are spurious and not relevant to the DSD phenotype in SZ. We chose to use these criteria to increase the probability of identifying DNAm alterations that may contribute causally to the DSD phenotype in SZ. Another potential technical limitation is that the sites studied were constrained by the use of the HM450 array. It only measures a fraction of the &gt;28 million DNAm sites in the human genome and coverage is biased toward CpG islands, promoters and genic regions.</p>

<title>Conclusions and future directions</title>
<p>The study of reduced DSD as an intermediate phenotype in SZ across different levels of analysis including genetics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref></sup> transcriptomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref></sup> and proteomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> has provided valuable insights into SZ. This study suggests that epigenetic alterations, specifically disrupted DNAm-DSD correlations, in SZ may be a mechanism for SZ-related reductions in DSD and justify future studies probing this relationship.</p>
<p>Studies to confirm the DNAm-DSD relationship and the effect of DNAm on candidate gene transcription in additional, larger cohorts will be a critical next step. Also, DNAm varies widely between cell types in the human cerebral cortex, with studies indicating that DNAm in GABA neurons is more extensive by several fold than in glutamatergic neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref></sup> Thus, future cell-type-specific studies, using laser capture microdissection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref></sup> fluorescent-activated nuclei sorting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref></sup> or similar methods, may increase the likelihood of detecting diagnosis-specific DNAm alterations by decreasing variability and revealing findings that were masked by opposing DNAm changes in different cell types. Studies in model systems to evaluate the correlative versus causal nature of the DNAm-DSD relationship will be also important. Understanding the DNAm-DSD relationship may facilitate the development of new, and/or the repurposing of existing, DNAm modifying drugs for SZ treatment.</p>
