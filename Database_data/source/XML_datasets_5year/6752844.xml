<abstract>
<p>It has been reported that neuroinflammation occurs in the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with neuropathic pain, Alzheimer’s disease and autism spectrum disorder. The 18-kDa translocator protein TSPO is used as an imaging target in positron emission tomography to detect neuroinflammation, and its expression is correlated with microglial activation. However, the mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Tspo</italic> induced by inflammation is not clear. Here, we revealed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced <italic>Tspo</italic> expression was activated by the AP-1 complex in a mouse microglial cell line, BV-2. Knockdown of c-Fos and c-Jun, the components of AP-1, reduced LPS-induced <italic>Tspo</italic> expression. Furthermore, the enrichment of Sp1 in the proximal promoter region of <italic>Tspo</italic> was increased in the presence of LPS. In addition, the binding of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the enhancer region, which contains the AP-1 site, was decreased by LPS treatment, but there were no significant differences in HDAC1 binding to the proximal promoter region with or without LPS. These results indicated that HDAC1 is involved not in the proximal promoter region but in the enhancer region. Our study revealed that inflammatory signals induce the recruitment of AP-1 to the enhancer region and Sp1 to the proximal promoter region of the <italic>Tspo</italic> gene and that Sp1 may regulate the basal expression of <italic>Tspo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and play a pivotal role in maintaining the neuronal environment. Resting (ramified) microglia monitor neurons by “palpating” synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref001">1</xref>]. Individual microglia have their own territory in the CNS and are distributed throughout the brain so that they do not overlap. In the case of homeostatic disruption in the CNS, microglia transform into an amoeboid (activated) morphology and migrate toward the damaged regions to release neurotoxic or neuroprotective molecules. M1 phenotype microglia produce various types of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNF-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref003">3</xref>], and M2 phenotype microglia also produce neuroprotective and neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF and IGF-1 according to the conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref005">5</xref>]. In addition, if possible, damaged cells are repaired; excessively damaged cells are phagocytosed by activated microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent studies showed that neuronal inflammation occurs in patients with neuropathic pain, Alzheimer’s disease and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref009">9</xref>]. To visualize inflammation in the CNS, positron emission tomography with a radiotracer, such as [<sup>11</sup>C] (<italic>R</italic>) PK-11195 or [<sup>11</sup>C] PBR28, is widely used in animal models or human subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref011">11</xref>]. These radiotracers are specific ligands for the 18-kDa translocator protein TSPO, alternatively called peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref012">12</xref>]. These tracers are helpful for evaluating the level of neuronal inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>, thereby determining the treatment plan for CNS disease.</p>
<p>TSPO is expressed in various organs, including glial cells in the CNS, and contributes to the regulation of steroid hormone production by transporting cholesterol, the precursor of pregnenolone, from the cytosol to the mitochondrial intermembrane space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref014">14</xref>]. Additionally, TSPO is distinct from the central benzodiazepine receptor [γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor] and plays different roles, for example, in the regulation of cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref015">15</xref>] and ATP production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The expression of TSPO is correlated with M1 phenotype microglial activation; however, the mechanism underlying the upregulation of TSPO expression during neuroinflammation has not been elucidated. Previous studies have suggested two possible mechanisms: an increase in the number of microglia in the CNS or of monocytes and macrophages that infiltrate the CNS in response to inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref017">17</xref>] and transcriptional activation of <italic>Tspo</italic> in microglia. Expression profiling data (GEO NCBI, #GSE37611) revealed that LPS, a classical inducer of inflammation, increased <italic>Tspo</italic> expression in mouse microglial cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref018">18</xref>]; therefore, upregulation of TSPO was the result of transcriptional activation. Accordingly, we focused on transactivation of <italic>Tspo</italic> gene expression in this study, and LPS was used as an inducer of neuroinflammation to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of TSPO.</p>
<p>In the present study, we showed that recruitment of both c-Fos and c-Jun, which are components of the AP-1 complex, to the enhancer region of the <italic>Tspo</italic> gene was increased upon LPS treatment in the microglial cell line BV-2. This evidence was supported by the observation that <italic>Tspo</italic> expression was reduced by knockdown of c-Fos and c-Jun. In addition, we found that the concentration of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the AP-1 binding site in the <italic>Tspo</italic> enhancer region was decreased by LPS treatment. These data suggest that LPS-induced <italic>Tspo</italic> gene expression in BV-2 was upregulated by AP-1 activation and that the release of HDAC1 from the AP-1 site was increased by LPS treatment.</p>

<title>Cell culture and chemical treatment</title>
<p>The mouse microglial cell line BV-2 (RRID: CVCL_0182) was purchased from Banca Biologica e Cell Factory (San Martino, Italy). Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics and grown at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were treated with LPS from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (O111, Wako, Osaka, Japan) at 1, 10, 100 or 500 ng/ml for various duration. Recombinant murine IFN-γ and IL-1β were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA).</p>

<title>Animals and primary microglial cell culture</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6 mice approximately 12 weeks old were used in this study. Mice were housed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref019">19</xref>]. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations the guidelines for animal research issued by the Physiological Society of Japan. The experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Hirosaki University (Approval Number: M12007), and all efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. Isolation of microglia from adult mice and primary microglial cell culture were performed as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref020">20</xref>]. Primary microglial cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes at a density of 1.0×10<sup>4</sup> cells/dish. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 8 hours.</p>

BV-2 cells were seeded at a density of 1.0×10<sup>5</sup> cells/35-mm dish (for whole-cell extracts) or at a density of 1.0×10<sup>6</sup> cells/100-mm dish (for cell fractionation). The mitochondrial, membrane, cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared according to the following method. After washing the cells with cold PBS (-) containing 1 mM PMSF, cells were harvested via centrifugation. Cells were suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH7.9], 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT and Complete<sup>™</sup> Protease Inhibitor Cocktail: Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were homogenized using a Dounce Tissue Grinder with a tight pestle (WHEATON, Millville, NJ, USA). Nuclei and unhomogenized cells were precipitated via centrifugation at 3,300×g for 5 min at 4°C, and then, the supernatants were then centrifuged at 8,000×g for 15 min at 4°C to obtain the mitochondrial fraction. In addition, the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000×g for 60 min at 4°C, and the pellets were recovered as the membrane fraction. The resulting supernatants were used as the cytosolic fraction. The nuclear, mitochondrial and membrane fractions were washed 3 times with isotonic buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH7.9], 150 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT and Complete<sup>™</sup> Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) and were then suspended in isotonic buffer containing 1% SDS.

<p>To determine the optimum assay conditions, BV-2 cells were treated with LPS for various durations and at various concentrations.

<title>LPS treatment increased TSPO expression in the mitochondrial and membrane fractions</title>
<p>The TSPO protein is mainly localized in mitochondria in the adrenal gland homogenate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref023">23</xref>]. To investigate whether TSPO in microglial cells is localized in mitochondria and whether the intracellular localization of TSPO is affected by LPS treatment, subcellular fractionation analysis was performed. BV-2 cells were collected, and cell fractions were prepared for Western blotting after stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS for 8 hours. First, the purity of the fractions was confirmed by fraction markers, such as COXIV, the alpha1 subunit of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, GAPDH and Lamin-B1, and there was no contamination or variation in expression between the control and LPS-treated groups in the same fractions. Similar to the fractionation analysis results, TSPO expression was significantly increased in the mitochondrial fraction by LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222861.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Interestingly, TSPO was also localized in the membrane fraction in the control group and was 1.94-fold higher in the LPS-treated group than in the control group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005). To verify whether TSPO is localized in the plasma membrane, TSPO, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase and mitochondria were stained by immunocytochemistry and analyzed by laser confocal microscopy. As previously reported, almost all TSPO protein was localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane. However, some fluorescence signals corresponding to TSPO protein were detected in non-mitochondrial regions in both the absence and presence of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222861.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, upper, arrowhead). In addition, some TSPO signals were colocalized with or very close to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222861.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, lower, arrowhead).

<title>AP-1, Sp1 and HDAC1 regulated <italic>Tspo</italic> expression</title>
<p>Based on the results of the reporter gene assay and previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref025">25</xref>], we examined via a ChIP assay whether the enrichment of AP-1 at the binding site in the <italic>Tspo</italic> regulatory region was promoted by LPS treatment. A previous study showed that <italic>TSPO</italic> expression is regulated by the binding of Sp1, Sp3 and/or Sp4 to the proximal promoter region in human breast cancer cell lines, and a similar sequence was observed in the mouse <italic>Tspo</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref026">26</xref>]. In addition, there is the possibility that HDAC1 acts as an inhibitory factor of <italic>Tspo</italic> expression by binding to Sp1 in a transcriptionally repressed state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref027">27</xref>]. Furthermore, since few studies have examined the interaction between HDAC1 and Sp3 or Sp4, we excluded Sp3 and Sp4 from this study and focused on the interaction between Sp1 and HDAC1 in the proximal promoter region of the <italic>Tspo</italic> gene. Based on these observations, the primer sets used for the ChIP assay were designed as shown in the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222861.g004">Fig 4A</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, LPS-induced gene expression of <italic>Tspo</italic> in a microglial cell line was examined. Our experiments clearly demonstrated that AP-1, Sp1 and HDAC1 are involved in the transactivation of <italic>Tspo</italic> expression. Specifically, the release of HDAC1 from the enhancer region of the <italic>Tspo</italic> gene in the presence of LPS was a novel finding.</p>
<p>The transcription factors c-Jun and STAT3 bind to the enhancer region of the <italic>Tspo</italic> gene in the mouse cell lines MA-10 and NIH-3T3 via PKCε activation through phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref025">25</xref>]. PKCε activation via PMA activates the Raf1, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 pathways. This signal transduction promotes <italic>Tspo</italic> gene expression following the activation and DNA binding of STAT3 and c-Jun. Our results indicating that LPS stimulation led to the binding of c-Fos and c-Jun to the enhancer region were partially consistent with those of previous studies. In general, LPS binds directly to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref028">28</xref>] and activates downstream factors such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref030">30</xref>]. The MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK pathways induce phosphorylation of c-Fos and enhance transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref031">31</xref>]. Additionally, c-Jun phosphorylation is induced by TLR4 signaling via the MKK4/7 and JNK pathways, and dimerization of c-Jun and c-Fos is promoted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref033">33</xref>]. Collectively, these results indicate that LPS treatment is likely to activate the AP-1 complex in a manner mediated by several transduction pathways, such as the MAPK pathway, and that <italic>Tspo</italic> expression is consequently promoted by the binding of the AP-1 complex to DNA. In contrast to the facilitation of AP-1 binding, the enrichment of HDAC1 at the AP-1 binding site was decreased by LPS treatment. The reduction in HDAC1 enrichment in the enhancer region by LPS treatment possibly led to hyperinduction of <italic>Tspo</italic> expression via recruitment of AP-1 or another transcriptional activator. A recent study revealed that deletion of sequences between -593 and -520 bp from the TSS, which contains the AP-1, Stat3 and Ets.2 <italic>cis</italic> elements, abolished the transactivation of <italic>Tspo</italic> gene expression in BV-2 and Raw-264.7 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref034">34</xref>]. Since our results were consistent with those of that recent report, it is convincingly concluded that the AP-1 and Sp1 are involved in the LPS-induced transcriptional regulation of <italic>Tspo</italic>. In addition to the involvement of AP-1 and Sp1, Rashid <italic>et al</italic> reported that the Pu.1 and its binding motif, Ets, play an important role in the transactivation of <italic>Tspo</italic> gene expression. Prediction tools for transcription binding sites were used in this study; however, Pu.1/Ets was not identified as a candidate transcription factor for the regulation of the <italic>Tspo</italic> gene. Contrary to the prediction results, the Ets sequence (5’-GGAA-3’) is located 3 bp from the AP-1 binding site and acts as a transcriptional activator of <italic>Tspo</italic> in response to LPS stimulation.</p>
<p>In addition to LPS stimulation, treatment with IFN-γ and IL-1β also induced <italic>Tspo</italic> transcription. Generally, IFN-γ activates the JAK-STAT pathway, and STAT acts as a transcriptional activator of inflammatory genes. The consensus sequence of STAT3 is located the upstream region of the <italic>Tspo</italic> gene, which overlaps with the AP-1 and Ets sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref025">25</xref>]. The IL-1β signaling pathway activates several transcription factors, including AP-1, via MAPKs such as p38, JNK and ERK1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref035">35</xref>]. These lines of evidences indicate that the general inflammatory response induces the expression of <italic>Tspo</italic> in microglial cells via the activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 or STATs.</p>
<p>Sp1, which belongs to the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-type zinc-finger protein family, binds to GC-rich motifs and regulates numerous genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref036">36</xref>]. A previous study showed that there are several GC-rich sequences in the proximal promoter region of the mouse <italic>Tspo</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref026">26</xref>]. In this study, LPS treatment of BV-2 cells increased the enrichment of Sp1 in the proximal promoter region of <italic>Tspo</italic>. This evidence suggests that Sp1 binds to GC-rich sequences to regulate various genes by interacting with a transcriptional activator or repressor such as CBP/p300 or HDAC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref038">38</xref>]. In the proximal promoter region of the <italic>Tspo</italic> gene, Sp1 enrichment was increased by LPS treatment, but HDAC1 enrichment was not affected. This result indicated that HDAC1 localized in the proximal promoter region was not involved in the pathway downstream of TLR4 activation by LPS. Furthermore, the finding that <italic>Tspo</italic> was expressed to some extent even under the control condition suggested that HDAC1 might minimally bind to the proximal promoter region under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>The expression of TSPO can be upregulated in noninflammatory conditions. According to the Human Brain Transcriptome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hbatlas.org/">http://hbatlas.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref039">39</xref>], human <italic>TSPO</italic> expression increases during the embryonic to the prenatal period and decreases during the neonatal period, and the <italic>TSPO</italic> expression level in the neonatal period is maintained throughout life. These data suggest that the functions of TSPO, such as increasing cholesterol transport from the cytosol to mitochondria and promoting pregnenolone production, might be important for fetal development. In addition, there is a possibility that the increase in <italic>TSPO</italic> expression during the neural developmental stage might be reflective of activated microglia. During neural development, microglia are activated and maintain CNS homeostasis by removing apoptotic cells, myelin debris and other endogenous redundant debris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref040">40</xref>]. It is unknown which transcription factor or factors regulate the transcription of the <italic>TSPO</italic> gene in the fetal period; however, the unknown pathway might activate AP-1 and Sp1 or a different transcription factor.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that TSPO was not only localized in mitochondria but also in the plasma membrane fraction, as evidenced by the cell fractionation, Western blotting and immunocytochemical analysis results. The results of Western blot analysis indicated that not only the mitochondrial fraction but also in the membrane fraction contained TSPO. Consistent with this finding, the immunocytochemical results revealed that TSPO was mainly colocalized with mitochondria and that small amounts of TSPO signals were not distant from but were closely localized with Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase signals regardless of LPS stimulation. Generally, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase localizes to the transmembrane region and is used as a marker of the plasma membrane. However, the plasma membrane is not solely constituted by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. Consequently, the TSPO signals were not completely colocalized with the plasma membrane signals. In addition to mitochondria and the plasma membrane, other organelles appeared to feature TSPO immunostaining signals. Thus, as it is reported that not all of the TSPO protein colocalizes with mitochondria, it is possible that TSPO localizes in organelles other than mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref022">22</xref>]. Further research is needed to assess the localization and physiological function of TSPO induced by LPS stimulation.</p>
<p>In patients with ASD, the binding potential of [<sup>11</sup>C] (<italic>R</italic>) PK-11195 to TSPO is increased in multiple brain regions, such as the cerebellum, brainstem and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref009">9</xref>]. These results indicate that the activation of microglia, i.e., neuroinflammation, and the expression of TSPO are increased. However, the conditions in our <italic>ex vivo</italic> study using a microglial cell line and LPS differed from the those of the CNS in patients with ASD; therefore, further investigation is needed to clarify the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Tspo</italic> using an animal model of ASD. It is necessary to elucidate whether this alteration in TSPO is due to transcriptional activation via AP-1 or a different transcriptional factor or factors in patients with ASD or animal model of ASD.</p>
<p>It is also important to clarify whether expressed TSPO leads to biological protection against or promotion of inflammation in the CNS. Because TSPO expression is increased under inflammatory conditions, it is thought that TSPO may act as a mediator of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref041">41</xref>]. However, a recent study reported that TSPO acts as a negative regulator of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref022">22</xref>]. Furthermore, TSPO overexpression rescues LPS-induced cognitive impairment. TSPO reduced inflammatory cytokines production and microglial activation, and neurogenesis in the hippocampus was promoted. Consequently, LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction was ameliorated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222861.ref042">42</xref>]. TSPO may play a neuro-protective role in inflammation, and thus, it could be expected that elucidating the mechanism of TSPO induction under conditions other than inflammation could lead to the development of molecular targeted drugs.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript could be improved by considering the following points</p>
<p>1. I think it would be important to include something about PU.1 in the discussion (The binding motif of PU.1 is in enhancer region (-593-520) and lies 3 bp apart from the AP1 core binding motif). The expression pattern of TSPO in microglia is very specific, and therefore Lineage dependent transcription factors (LDTFs) such as PU.1 have to play a role (Especially since we have already provided evidence of strong Pu.1 enrichment in this region). Infact, the initial steps of enhancer selection in closed chromatin regions containing regularly positioned nucleosomes involves the binding of LDTFs. This binding results in the depletion/sliding of nucleosomes to expose enhancer DNA sequences. Indeed, in microglia/macrophages, enhancers controlling endotoxin-stimulated gene expression are almost invariably bound by the lineage dependent Ets transcription factor Pu.1 (Ghisletti et al., 2010; Holtman et al., 2017). These LDTFs bound to enhancers induce histone modifications (such as H3K4me1) associated with a primed state of activity (Smale and Natoli, 2014). Histone mark H3K4me1 is a core chromatin signature of primed enhancers and serves as a beacon for signal-dependent effectors of signaling pathways such as nuclear factor-κB (NFκB), interferon responsive factors (IRFs) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) (Ghisletti et al., 2010; Heinz et al., 2010; Smale and Natoli, 2014).</p>

<p>Smale, S.T., and Natoli, G. (2014). Transcriptional control of inflammatory responses. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 6, a016261.</p>
<p>2. It would be important to comment on differences observed in TSPO expression following knockdown of cFos and cJun. In a recent paper (Raashid et al.Biochim Biophys Acta Gene Regul Mech. 2018 Dec;1861(12):1119-1133.), decreased TSPO expression was only observed following a combined knockdown of cJun and cFos. In the current paper, the authors report a decrease in TSPO expression when either cJun or cFos is knockdown. Is this due to cell-line differences? (I noticed they used a different BV-2 cell-line which was maintained in DMEM medium).</p>
<p>3. In paragraph 4 of the discussion, Sp1 transcription factor is discussed. There is no mention of either Sp3 or Sp4, despite Rashid et al. showing that these factors bind the GC-boxes in the proximal promoter (Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 share common binding site motifs) and that knockdown of either Sp3 or Sp4 significantly reduces TSPO promoter activity in BV-2 microglia.</p>
<p>4. In paragraph 5 of the discussion, the authors state “ human TSPO expression increases during the embryo to prenatal period and decreases during the neonatal period, and the TSPO expression level in the neonatal period is maintained throughout life. These data suggest that the TSPO functions, such as increasing cholesterol transport from cytosol to mitochondria and promoting pregnenolone production, might be important for fetal development.” While this statement might be true, I think it also important to acknowledge that the increase in TSPO expression during development might simply be a reflection of an activated microglia state. During development, microglia are predominantly in the amoeboid state as they play a major role in removing excessive produced apoptotic neurons and large amounts of extracellular debris from the developing CNS.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The authors adequately addressed the issues from the original review. The paper describes a data-supported mechanism for transcriptional regulation of TSPO in LPS-treated microglia. A few minor points:</p>
<p>1) Regarding M1/M2 classification - it should be noted that the range of microglial activation phenotypes is complex and that the M1/M2 classification in the paper is being used for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p>2) The antibodies and oligonucleotide sequences used can be placed in supplemental information.</p>
<p>3) There were a few grammatical errors throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: In this manuscript the authors described a potential mechanism of the increased TSPO expression after LPS treatment which were regulated by AP-1 complex and HDAC1 in BV-2 microglia cell at the transcriptional level. I have some specific issues that need clarification.</p>
<p>1. The title should be replaced as “Lipopolysaccharide induces mouse translocator protein (18 kDa) expression by AP-1 complex in microglial cell line, BV-2”.</p>
<p>2. As the authors stated in the manuscript, the concentration of HDAC1 (a transcriptional repressor) was decreased in the enhancer region of TSPO at the AP-1 binding site after LPS treatment. I have concerns about the potential effects of HDAC1 intervention on TSPO expression or LPS induced inflammatory reaction.</p>
<p>3. Writing of the paper might be improved to meet sufficient quality.</p>

<p>Reviewer 1</p>
<p>1. Thank you for the constructive comments to improve our study. We should have mentioned about Pu.1/Ets.2 in the discussion. We added the sentences as below (P17, line 15-21).</p>
<p> “... transcriptional regulation of Tspo. In addition to the involvement of AP-1 and Sp1, Rashid et al reported that the Pu.1 and its binding motif, Ets, play an important role in the transactivation of Tspo gene expression. Prediction tools for transcription binding sites were used in this study; however, Pu.1/Ets was not identified as a candidate transcription factor for the regulation of the Tspo gene. Contrary to the prediction results, the Ets sequence (5’-GGAA-3’) is located 3 bp from the AP-1 binding site and acts as a transcriptional activator of Tspo in response to LPS stimulation.”</p>
<p>2. Thank you for the constructive comments to improve our study. We also wondered the differences between our results and a recent study (Rashid et al, Biochim Biophys Acta. Gene Regul Mech, 2018). Batarseh et al reported that PMA-induced Tspo expression was reduced by the solely knockdown of c-Jun in MA-10 cells and NIH-3T3 cells (ref#.25, Figure 4 and 6), hence, it is thought to be that the expression of Tspo was inhibited by the knockdown of either of c-Fos or c-Jun. In case of our study, the protocols such as cell and its culture condition, the dose or time of LPS stimulation and the measurement of gene expression by qRT-PCR or Western blotting were diffed from previous studies, the results were not completely consistent with those studies.</p>
<p>3. Thank you for your comments. Rashid et al (Ref. #34) and Batarseh et al (Ref. #26) reported that the enrichment of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 were increased at the GC-boxes in the proximal and distal promoter region of Tspo gene and the knockdown experiments of Sp3 or Sp4 significantly reduced the transactivation of Tspo, hence, it is considered to be a certain phenomenon that the involvement of Sp family in the Tspo gene expression.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that Sp1 and HDAC1 forms a transcriptional repressor complex at the transcriptional inactive state. Upon the stimulation, the enrichment of Sp1 did not affect, however, HDAC1 was released from Sp1 and replaced to CBP/p300 (Ref. #21 and 27).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the same molecular mechanism was occurred in the transcriptional regulation of Tspo gene. Furthermore, since there were few studies that the interaction between HDAC1 and Sp3 or Sp4, we excluded Sp3 and Sp4 from this study. The additional information is shown in the results section as described below. (P14, line1-4)</p>
<p>“... a, transcriptionally repressed state [21,27]. Furthermore, since few studies have examined the interaction between HDAC1 and Sp3 or Sp4, we excluded Sp3 and Sp4 from this study and focused on the interaction between Sp1 and HDAC1 in the proximal promoter region of the Tspo gene.”</p>
<p>4. Thank you for the constructive comments to improve our study. As you pointed out, we should have mentioned about the activation of microglia during CNS development. We added the sentences in the discussion section with reference (Hanisch UK, Kettenmann H. Microglia: active sensor and versatile effector cells in the normal and pathologic brain. Nat Neurosci. 2007 Nov;10(11):1387-94. Review. PubMed PMID: 17965659) as below. (P19, line2-5)</p>
<p> “... for fetal development. In addition, there is a possibility that the increase in TSPO expression during the neural developmental stage might be reflective of activated microglia. During neural development, microglia are activated and maintain CNS homeostasis by removing apoptotic cells, myelin debris and other endogenous redundant debris [40].”</p>
<p>Reviewer 2</p>
<p>1. Thank you for your advice. As you pointed out, the classification of microglia is complicated according to various studies. We described only classical classification of microglia in introduction section and did not mention detailed classification such as M (LPS) and M (IL-4 and IL-13) (previously named as M2a) that reported recently (Michell-Robinson MA et al, Brain. 2015 May;138(Pt 5):1138-59). The objective of this study is clarification of transcriptional mechanism of Tspo gene in mice, hence, we did not intend to mention the classification of microglial cell. LPS and IFN-γ were used for induction of activated microglia and Tspo gene expression as pro-inflammatory inducers.</p>
<p>2. Thank you for your advice. The lists of oligonucleotide sequences and antibodies were transferred to S1 and S2 Table.</p>
<p>3. Thank you for your advice. We revised the manuscript and was proofread by the Springer Nature Author Services.</p>
<p>Reviewer 3</p>
<p>1. Thank you for your advice. The title was replaced as follows. “Lipopolysaccharide induces mouse translocator protein (18 kDa) expression via the AP-1 complex in the microglial cell line, BV-2.”</p>
<p>2. Thank you for your comments. Upon LPS or pro-inflammatory stimulation, various pathways were activated and HDAC1 was released from AP-1 binding site, transcriptional activators were then recruited to the Tspo promoter. Of course, since it is thought that not all HDAC1 molecules were released from AP-1 binding site, some HDAC1 molecules remained at the AP-1 binding site. Furthermore, the enrichment of HDAC1 might gradually returns to normal condition in time-dependent manner after once upon release from AP-1 binding site to inhibit activated gene expression.</p>
<p>3. Thank you for your advice. We revised the manuscript and was proofread by the Springer Nature Author Services.</p>
