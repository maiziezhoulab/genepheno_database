<title>Objective</title>
<p>To determine how single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) contribute to molecular diagnosis in familial Parkinson disease (PD), we integrated exome sequencing (ES) and genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and further probed CNV structure to reveal mutational mechanisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We performed ES on 110 subjects with PD and a positive family history; 99 subjects were also evaluated using genome-wide aCGH. We interrogated ES and aCGH data for pathogenic SNVs and CNVs at Mendelian PD gene loci. We confirmed SNVs via Sanger sequencing and further characterized CNVs with custom-designed high-density aCGH, droplet digital PCR, and breakpoint sequencing.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Using ES, we discovered individuals with known pathogenic SNVs in <italic>GBA</italic> (p.Glu365Lys, p.Thr408Met, p.Asn409Ser, and p.Leu483Pro) and <italic>LRRK2</italic> (p.Arg1441Gly and p.Gly2019Ser). Two subjects were each double heterozygotes for variants in <italic>GBA</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic>. Based on aCGH, we additionally discovered cases with an <italic>SNCA</italic> duplication and heterozygous intragenic <italic>GBA</italic> deletion. Five additional subjects harbored both SNVs (p.Asn52Metfs*29, p.Thr240Met, p.Pro437Leu, and p.Trp453*) and likely disrupting CNVs at the <italic>PRKN</italic> locus, consistent with compound heterozygosity. In nearly all cases, breakpoint sequencing revealed microhomology, a mutational signature consistent with CNV formation due to DNA replication errors.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Integrated ES and aCGH yielded a genetic diagnosis in 19.3% of our familial PD cohort. Our analyses highlight potential mechanisms for <italic>SNCA</italic> and <italic>PRKN</italic> CNV formation, uncover multilocus pathogenic variation, and identify novel SNVs and CNVs for further investigation as potential PD risk alleles.</p>

<body>
<p>Up to 20% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) report a positive family history,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and genetic risk factors are more common in these families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> Identification of specific genetic risk factors can reveal prognostic information, such as risk of cognitive impairment and/or rate of progression, and may soon highlight eligibility for personalized therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> In addition, discovery of risk variants may inform genetic counseling of unaffected family members. Indeed, surveys of patients with PD and caregivers reveal a high level of interest in genetic testing for PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>More than 40 different loci that increase PD susceptibility have been identified in familial and sporadic PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Exome sequencing (ES) is ideally suited to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in genetically heterogeneous diseases. In a study of adult patients referred for diverse clinical indications, ES had a diagnostic yield of 10% in individuals older than 30 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> In a recent study of 80 early-onset sporadic PD cases, ES yielded an overall diagnostic rate of 11%, with <italic>GBA</italic> alleles accounting for 5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> Nevertheless, clinical genetic testing is not routinely performed for PD, and ES remains poorly studied as a potential genetic diagnostic tool.</p>
<p>Although most identified PD risk alleles are SNVs, chromosomal structural rearrangements, or copy number variants (CNVs), also play an important role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> Despite notable recent advances,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> ES remains insensitive for detection of small CNVs (&lt;50 kb).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> Several complementary approaches, including multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, bacterial artificial chromosome arrays, and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> have shown mixed success for identification of CNVs in PD cohorts. In contrast, genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a highly-validated, sensitive clinical screening tool for CNV detection, offering exon-by-exon coverage for a multitude of disease-associated genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Although not yet adopted in most diagnostic laboratories, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is also emerging as a rapid and cost-efficient, targeted approach for the assessment of small CNVs at specific loci. Compared with standard quantitative PCR, digital PCR offers enhanced copy number and gene dosage sensitivity, precision, and reliability due to sample partitioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> In addition, mechanisms of CNV formation in PD remain understudied.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, integrated ES and aCGH for analysis of SNVs and CNVs, respectively, have not previously been systematically used in PD. We hypothesized that ES and aCGH in combination will yield an increased genetic molecular diagnostic rate. We also evaluated ddPCR as a novel strategy for confirmation of pathogenic CNVs in PD, and using breakpoint sequencing, we investigated potential mechanisms for CNV formation.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>We studied 110 PD cases evaluated in the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) PD Center and Movement Disorders Clinic in Houston, TX, with a family history of PD. As a positive control for aCGH, we included a sample from a known subject with an <italic>SNCA</italic> triplication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> We also interrogated a Baylor Genetics diagnostic laboratory sample including 12,922 clinical referral samples for aCGH from peripheral blood using either v9 or v10 Baylor arrays.

<sec id="s1-3">
<title>Gene set definition and variant criteria</title>
<p>We focused our analyses on genes and variants established to cause familial PD, including the autosomal dominant loci, <italic>SNCA</italic> (<italic>PARK1</italic>, MIM#168601), <italic>GBA</italic> (MIM#168600), <italic>LRRK2</italic> (MIM#607060), <italic>GCH1</italic> (MIM#600225), <italic>DNAJC13</italic> (MIM#616361), and <italic>VPS35</italic> (MIM#614203), as well as the autosomal recessive loci, <italic>PRKN</italic> (<italic>PARK2</italic>, MIM#600116), <italic>PINK1</italic> (MIM#605909) and <italic>PARK7</italic> (<italic>DJ1</italic>, MIM#606324), based on the available literature in April 2015 when this study was initiated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> In our CNV analyses, we also considered deletions at 22q11.2. Gene names in this study conform to current guidelines from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genenames.org/">genenames.org</ext-link>). All pathogenic alleles included in this study are well-established, nonsynonymous coding variants with moderate to high penetrance (odds ratio [OR] &gt;2) meeting stringent evidence for replication across studies or within the same study. We considered all other variants discovered in these genes but not previously reported in PD to be variants of unknown significance (VUSs).</p>

<sec id="s1-4">
<title>Detection and confirmation of SNVs and CNVs</title>
<p>We extracted genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples obtained from each participant and performed ES using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the BCM Human Genome Sequencing Center. Samples achieved an average of 95% of targeted exome bases covered to a depth of 20X or greater. All pathogenic SNVs detected were confirmed via Sanger sequencing. Genome-wide array CGH was performed on 99 of 110 subjects for which sufficient DNA remained using Baylor Genetics v10 2x400K clinical-grade oligonucleotide microarrays. We defined potential CNVs as those regions with 3 or more consecutive probes with consistent direction of effect. For confirmation, we used a custom 8x60K high-density array through Agilent (Santa Clara, CA). To confirm CNVs at <italic>PRKN</italic> and <italic>GBA</italic>, we additionally performed ddPCR (see e-Methods for detailed protocol, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A305">links.lww.com/NXG/A305</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We pursued genetic diagnostic evaluation of 110 total subjects (including 109 unrelated probands) with familial PD. The mean age at onset was 50 years (SD = 15); 51% were male. The ethnic composition of the cohort was 72% Caucasian, 17% Hispanic, 6% East Asian, South Asian or Middle Eastern, and 6% undefined (not reported).</p>
<sec id="s2-1">
<title>Single nucleotide variants</title>
<p>We first examined subject ES data for pathogenic SNVs in established PD genes (see Methods). Among the dominant PD loci, 15 individuals had variants in <italic>LRRK2</italic> (c.6055G&gt;A:p.Gly2019Ser and c.4321C&gt;G:p.Arg1441Gly) and <italic>GBA</italic> (c.1093G&gt;A:p.Glu365Lys, c.1223C&gt;T:p.Thr408Met, c.1448T&gt;C:p.Leu483Pro, and c.1226A&gt;G:p.Asn409Ser) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref> and table e-1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A306">links.lww.com/NXG/A306</ext-link>). Two subjects each harbored heterozygous SNVs in both <italic>GBA</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic>, i.e., were double heterozygotes. One such subject had a combination of <italic>LRRK2</italic> p.Gly2019Ser and <italic>GBA</italic> p.Glu365Lys (subject 2), whereas the other had <italic>LRRK2</italic> p.Gly2019Ser and <italic>GBA</italic> p.Leu483Pro (subject 13). Both subjects had onset of PD symptoms in their 40s. On initial examination, subject 2 had tremor at rest, rigidity, bradykinesia, and dystonic posturing in both hands. She reported a history of PD in her father and paternal grandfather (figure e-1A, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A305">links.lww.com/NXG/A305</ext-link>, and table e-1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A306">links.lww.com/NXG/A306</ext-link>). There was no history of cognitive impairment or dementia. Subject 13 presented with resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. She reported a family history of PD in her paternal uncle (figure e-1B, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A305">links.lww.com/NXG/A305</ext-link>, and table e-1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A306">links.lww.com/NXG/A306</ext-link>). Ten years after PD diagnosis, she developed visual hallucinations and delusions. The subjects were of European and Hispanic ancestry, respectively; neither reported Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>ES also revealed 7 individuals with pathogenic variants in loci usually associated with autosomal recessive PD, including <italic>PRKN</italic> (6 individuals) and <italic>PARK7</italic> (1 individual). However, all subjects were heterozygous SNV carriers, and therefore, isolated ES was nondiagnostic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>). Therefore, based on ES alone, we identified a pathogenic variant accounting for PD in 13.8% (n = 15 of 109 probands) of our familial PD cohort. We confirmed all implicated variants via Sanger sequencing. Besides the pathogenic variants noted above, ES also identified heterozygous VUSs in many PD risk genes (table e-2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A306">links.lww.com/NXG/A306</ext-link>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-2">
<title>Copy number variants</title>
<p>We next interrogated aCGH data for pathogenic CNVs among PD genes. Our analyses included 99 of 110 total subjects evaluated by ES. We did not detect any CNVs in <italic>VPS35</italic>, <italic>LRRK2</italic>, <italic>DNAJC13</italic>, <italic>GCH1</italic>, <italic>PARK7</italic>, or <italic>PINK1</italic>, nor did we identify any candidate deletions at the 22q11.2 locus. However, we discovered CNVs in <italic>SNCA</italic> (n = 1), <italic>GBA</italic> (n = 1), and <italic>PRKN</italic> (n = 5). We confirmed all reported CNVs through custom high-density arrays and breakpoint sequencing. CNVs in <italic>SNCA</italic> and <italic>GBA</italic> affect dominant PD genes and were therefore diagnostic based on aCGH alone. We consider all heterozygous CNVs in the recessive PD gene, <italic>PRKN</italic>, in combination with ES results (see next section). Overall, isolated aCGH identified a diagnostic genetic risk factor for PD in 2.0% of our cohort (n = 2 of 99 probands). Based on aCGH, we also detected numerous large CNVs (&gt;1 Mb) within our cohort that affect other genomic loci; these variants remain of uncertain clinical significance (table e-3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A306">links.lww.com/NXG/A306</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In subject 3, we detected a 248-kb duplication encompassing <italic>SNCA</italic>, as well as the adjacent gene, <italic>MMRN1</italic>. We confirmed this CNV by high-density aCGH and breakpoint analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>). On initial examination, this subject exhibited rigidity, tremor, and gait impairment, along with hyperreflexia and clonus. The subject was of Hispanic and Native American ancestry; the subject's father had PD with dementia. Besides providing independent confirmation, breakpoint sequencing can provide clues to mechanisms of CNV formation. In the case of subject 3, we identified a 1-bp microhomology domain, which is a short sequence that is identical to another region in the genome reduced from 2 copies to 1 during the template switch accompanying replicative repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Microhomology is characteristic of certain DNA replication errors that can generate CNVs (see Discussion).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> As a positive control for our aCGH analysis, we also included a known <italic>SNCA</italic> triplication sample from the index family in which <italic>SNCA</italic> locus multiplication was first discovered as a cause for PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> Breakpoint sequencing revealed that this copy number alteration is a 1.7-Mb complex genomic rearrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>), consisting of a duplication-inverted triplication-duplication (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP).

<title>Integrated analysis of SNVs and CNVs</title>
<p>As highlighted above, isolated ES and aCGH each identified a number of subjects with heterozygous SNVs or CNVs affecting recessive genes. To determine whether these changes might be diagnostic, we next examined the results together for potential biallelic variation due to both an SNV allele and a CNV allele. Indeed, 3 subjects in our cohort were newly identified as potential compound heterozygous carriers of both a pathogenic CNV and SNV in <italic>PRKN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>).

Subject 11 harbored a pathogenic <italic>PRKN</italic> SNV (c.1310C&gt;T:p.Pro437Leu) and a complex locus rearrangement, including a copy number neutral region flanked by 404 kb and 199 kb duplications affecting exons 2 and 3 and exons 5 and 6, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>).

<title>Digital droplet PCR</title>
<p>Given the observed high frequency of <italic>PRKN</italic> CNVs in this familial PD cohort (∼5%), and the high cost of clinical-grade aCGH, we examined the feasibility of an exon-by-exon ddPCR assay to detect <italic>PRKN</italic> CNVs as a proof of principle. ddPCR is an emerging cost-effective method for sensitive and reliable assessment of specific CNVs. Indeed, ddPCR revealed all <italic>PRKN</italic> CNVs detected using aCGH (subjects 6, 11, 20, 21, and 22) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>). We also interrogated an additional 92 cases from our cohort with available DNA for intragenic <italic>PRKN</italic> CNVs using ddPCR, without discovery of additional CNVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref> and figure e-2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A305">links.lww.com/NXG/A305</ext-link>). We also applied ddPCR to screen for potential CNVs at the <italic>GBA</italic> locus. The 12-exon <italic>GBA</italic> shares high homology with the nearby 13-exon pseudogene, <italic>GBAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>, using ddPCR, we successfully amplified all 12 exons of <italic>GBA</italic>. Six exons (1, 2, 4, 7, 9, and 10) identified unique amplicons with a positive droplet ratio of 1, whereas the other 6 exons (3, 5, 6, 8, 11, and 12) demonstrated shared amplicons with the pseudogene, resulting in a droplet ratio of 2. Importantly, ddPCR also confirmed the deletion of <italic>GBA</italic> exons 2–8 in subject 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>) and did not reveal evidence for additional CNVs in 85 other samples tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref> and figure e-3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A305">links.lww.com/NXG/A305</ext-link>). Of note, ddPCR initially suggested a single exon deletion (exon 6) in subject 48; however, further investigation using Sanger sequencing revealed an intronic SNV likely degrading ddPCR amplification (figure e-4, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A305">links.lww.com/NXG/A305</ext-link>).

<title>CNV burden in clinical cohorts</title>
<p>Compared with SNVs, limited reference data are available on the population frequency of CNVs, especially in neurologically healthy adult samples, hampering the interpretation of CNV frequencies detected in our cohort. We therefore leveraged data from the Baylor Genetics diagnostic laboratory, including 12,922 aCGH clinical referral samples. This large cohort is skewed for pediatric cases (mean age = 7.4 years, SD = 9.7 years, range 0–79 years), reflecting the more common use of aCGH in this population. Although the cohort includes a substantial proportion of individuals with developmental delay, autism, and dysmorphic features, there were no recorded submissions for PD. Based on stringent criteria (see e-Methods, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A305">links.lww.com/NXG/A305</ext-link>), at most PD loci, CNVs were either absent (<italic>DNAJC13</italic>, <italic>LRRK2</italic>, <italic>PINK1</italic>, and <italic>SNCA</italic>) or very rare at <italic>VPS35</italic> (n = 2), <italic>GCH1</italic> (n = 1), and <italic>PARK7</italic> (n = 6, all subjects had 1p36 deletion syndrome).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Establishing a specific genetic diagnosis can provide information about PD risk and progression relevant to patients and their families and may soon influence treatment decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> In our familial PD sample, ES and aCGH independently identified a genetic cause for PD in 13.8% and 2.0%, respectively. The diagnostic yield for ES was slightly higher than that recently reported for an early-onset PD cohort (11.25%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and was also greater than the 10.7% diagnostic rate in an unselected adult series referred for clinical diagnostic ES.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Given incipient treatment trials for <italic>GBA-PD</italic> and the potential importance of identifying eligible subjects in the future,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> our analyses considered lower-risk pathogenic alleles (OR ∼2.4),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> p.Glu365Lys and p.Thr408Met, along with higher-penetrance variants (e.g., p.Leu483Pro, OR &gt;5).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> Importantly, integrated ES and aCGH identified 5 additional subjects (4 unrelated probands)—including a subject with a <italic>GBA</italic> deletion—yielding an overall combined diagnostic rate of 19.3%. We also uncovered numerous VUS, including SNVs within Mendelian PD genes (table e-2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A306">links.lww.com/NXG/A306</ext-link>) as well as large CNVs affecting other loci (table e-4, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" specific-use="external-ds" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/NXG/A306">links.lww.com/NXG/A306</ext-link>). Although additional evidence will be required to confirm or refute pathogenicity, our genetic diagnostic rate would nearly double if these VUS in PD genes are bona fide risk factors. Overall, our findings suggest that integrated ES and aCGH analysis is essential for routine, high-confidence genetic diagnosis in familial PD.</p>
<p>Most genetic diagnostic studies in PD cohorts to date have ignored the potential contribution of CNVs. Similarly, except in several notable targeted CNV studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> research-based PD gene discovery has almost exclusively focused on SNVs, using ES or genotyping arrays. Importantly, we would have missed multiple pathogenic CNV alleles at both autosomal dominant (<italic>SNCA</italic> and <italic>GBA</italic>) and recessive (<italic>PRKN</italic>) loci without performing aCGH. In 5 subjects, pathogenic alleles discovered at <italic>PRKN</italic> would have been nondiagnostic based on isolated ES, leading to misclassification as heterozygous carriers, whereas integrated SNV-CNV analyses successfully established the molecular diagnosis of <italic>PRKN</italic>-PD. Our findings suggest caution for interpretation of studies attributing PD risk to either <italic>PRKN</italic> CNV or SNV heterozygous carrier states in isolation, consistent with prior studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> Although we did not detect any CNVs at <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>PARK7</italic> in our cohort, the importance of integrated SNV-CNV analysis may extend to other autosomal recessive PD loci besides <italic>PRKN</italic>. Because our CNV and SNV data are unphased, and parental genotypes are not available, we cannot definitively exclude the possibility that certain CNVs and SNVs at <italic>PRKN</italic> were in cis- rather than trans-configuration. Nevertheless, our data suggest that structural variants may co-occur with SNVs more commonly than previously recognized, making consideration of both allele types important for comprehensive genetic diagnosis in PD.</p>
<p>ES has significantly accelerated the scope of gene discovery in PD and other neurologic disorders, but remains insensitive to allele classes such as trinucleotide repeat expansions and CNVs. Although bioinformatic tools may help identify CNVs from ES data, available algorithms have high false-positive rates when compared with aCGH,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and this method may miss up to 30% of clinically relevant CNVs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> To our knowledge, genome-wide aCGH with exon-by-exon coverage has not been previously applied in PD. Limitations of aCGH include significant cost and the possibility of missing small deletions/duplications. Alternative methods, such as ddPCR, may offer a cost-effective alternative for screening specific genes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> including for small CNVs. In our study, ddPCR showed high sensitivity and specificity for detection of CNVs at both <italic>PRKN</italic> and <italic>GBA</italic>. Moreover, ddPCR successfully differentiated copy number changes affecting exons unique to <italic>GBA</italic> avoiding potential confounding by the adjacent pseudogene, <italic>GBAP1</italic>.</p>
<p>Despite evidence of an important role in disease risk, the mechanism(s) for generating CNVs relevant to PD remain largely unknown. Broadly, CNVs may form through mechanisms associated with DNA recombination, DNA replication, and/or DNA repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Nonallelic homologous recombination can result in recurrent rearrangements. In contrast, nonhomologous end joining,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS) and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> lead to nonrecurrent CNVs. In our study, all junction breakpoint sequencing results were consistent with the FoSTeS/MMBIR mechanism, including for CNV alleles discovered at <italic>SNCA</italic>, <italic>PRKN</italic>, and <italic>GBA</italic>. These results are consistent with a recent analysis of <italic>SNCA</italic> duplications from 6 independent cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> These findings have important implications for screening assays because the detection of nonrecurrent CNVs requires methods sensitive for heterogeneous, exon-by-exon changes. The FoSTeS/MMBIR mechanism can also trigger multiple iterative template switches in a single event, leading to the generation of more complex genomic rearrangements. Breakpoint sequencing of an <italic>SNCA</italic> CNV first observed in the Spellman-Muenter/Iowa kindred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> confirmed the DUP-TRP-DUP structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and further revealed an internal inversion (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP) and microhomology. This rearrangement must have arisen during mitosis via FoSTeS/MMBIR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and therefore likely represents a de novo triplication, in contrast to the meiotic <italic>PMP22</italic> triplications observed in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (MIM#118220), which derives from a duplication in the previous generation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> Our results therefore demonstrate the essential role of breakpoint junction sequencing in definitively resolving CNV structure and responsible mechanisms.</p>
<p>Deletions in <italic>GBA</italic> rarely contribute to autosomal recessive Gaucher disease (MIM#230800).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> Our discovery of a <italic>GBA</italic> deletion allele in a subject with PD, expected to cause glucocerobrosidase haploinsufficiency, adds to other emerging evidence supporting a loss-of-function mechanism in <italic>GBA</italic>-PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> It will be informative to screen for additional <italic>GBA</italic> CNVs in additional case/control cohorts—perhaps using ddPCR—to determine how commonly these alleles are associated with PD risk and estimate their effect size and penetrance. We also identified 2 subjects doubly heterozygous for SNVs in both <italic>GBA</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic>, consistent with prior reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> We expect that additional PD cases compatible with oligogenic inheritance models will emerge following widespread adoption of comprehensive, genome-wide diagnostic approaches, including ES and aCGH. Future studies must address how such alleles may interact to modify PD risk and/or clinical manifestations. Finally, although our study focused on pathogenic alleles in established Mendelian loci, future assessment of a more complete spectrum of genetic variation through integrated SNV-CNV analysis is also likely to enhance power for novel PD gene discovery.</p>
