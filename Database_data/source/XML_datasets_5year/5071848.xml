<abstract>
<p>The ability to directly enhance electrical excitability of human cells is hampered by the lack of methods to efficiently overexpress large mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC). Here we describe the use of small prokaryotic sodium channels (BacNa<sub>v</sub>) to create <italic>de novo</italic> excitable human tissues and augment impaired action potential conduction <italic>in vitro</italic>. Lentiviral co-expression of specific BacNa<sub>v</sub> orthologues, an inward-rectifying potassium channel, and connexin-43 in primary human fibroblasts from the heart, skin or brain yields actively conducting cells with customizable electrophysiological phenotypes. Engineered fibroblasts (‘E-Fibs') retain stable functional properties following extensive subculture or differentiation into myofibroblasts and rescue conduction slowing in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of cardiac interstitial fibrosis. Co-expression of engineered BacNa<sub>v</sub> with endogenous mammalian VGSCs enhances action potential conduction and prevents conduction failure during depolarization by elevated extracellular K<sup>+</sup>, decoupling or ischaemia. These studies establish the utility of engineered BacNa<sub>v</sub> channels for induction, control and recovery of mammalian tissue excitability.</p>

<p>Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) exist in all animal organisms and govern processes fundamental to life including neuronal communication, muscle contractions or hormonal release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In electrically excitable tissues, VGSCs enable firing and spread of action potentials (APs) and their loss-of-function mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> cause a variety of neuronal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, cardiac<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and skeletal muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> disorders. Similarly, acute tissue injuries resulting in permanent excitability loss (for example, stroke, spinal cord injury and heart attack) are associated with long-term disability and death. In addition to excitable tissues, the VGSCs are expressed in many unexcitable cells including macrophages, microglia and islet β-cells, where they play important roles in phagocytosis, migration, insulin secretion and other cellular processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The ion-conducting α-subunits of mammalian VGSCs have four structurally homologous domains, each consisting of ∼300 amino acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. These four domains are simultaneously transcribed and translated from a single, relatively large (&gt;6 kb) gene. This large gene size precludes stable and efficient expression of mammalian VGSCs in primary cells, a strategy that could potentially lead to new remedies for impaired tissue excitability.</p>
<p>The recent discovery of a large bacterial VGSC family (BacNa<sub>v</sub>) has provided novel insights into the structure and biophysical properties of eukaryotic VGSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In contrast to their eukaryotic counterparts, BacNa<sub>v</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> consist of four identical domains, individually transcribed and translated from single genes of only ∼900 bp in size. Although the small size of BacNa<sub>v</sub> facilitates their overexpression and purification for crystallography studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, it is plausible that <italic>BacNa</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub> genes could be efficiently packaged into viral vectors, either alone or with other ion channel genes, and used to stably introduce or modify electrical excitability of mammalian tissues. Furthermore, utilization of BacNa<sub>v</sub> orthologues with diverse biophysical properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, combined with targeted channel mutations, may allow custom engineering of cellular electrophysiological phenotypes tailored to specific tissue types, diseases and individuals.</p>
<p>Here we combined electrophysiological, computational and genetic engineering techniques to establish a versatile BacNa<sub>v</sub>-based platform that enables stable conversion of unexcitable primary human fibroblasts into AP conducting cells that can successfully recover conduction slowing in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of cardiac interstitial fibrosis. Moreover, we demonstrate that direct expression of engineered BacNa<sub>v</sub> channels in mammalian excitable cells can enhance their excitability and prevent loss of AP conduction in pathological conditions when endogenous Na<sup>+</sup> channels fail to activate.</p>

<title>Genetic engineering of actively conducting human fibroblasts</title>
<p>To stably convert unexcitable primary fibroblasts into actively conducting cells (named engineered fibroblasts or ‘E-Fibs'), we first explored a BacNa<sub>v</sub> variant from <italic>Roseobacter denitrificans</italic>, Na<sub>v</sub>RosD G217A, shown in our preliminary tests to be capable of generating AP propagation when transfected in a monolayer of HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 and connexin-43 (Cx43). We generated a high-titre bi-cistronic lentivirus pRRL-CMV-RosDG217A-P2A-eGFP-Kir2.1 encoding both Na<sub>v</sub>RosD G217A and inward-rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 (gene <italic>KCNJ2</italic>) fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) (eGFP-Kir2.1), separated by the self-cleaving peptide P2A. Adult human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) transduced with this virus stably expressed inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current, <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>), and bacterial Na<sup>+</sup> current, <italic>I</italic><sub>NaRosD G217A</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>), at much higher levels compared with endogenous currents, and exhibited a significantly hyperpolarized resting membrane potential of −78.4±0.2 mV (<italic>n</italic>=6) compared with that of wild-type (wt)-HDFs (−23.3±2.9 mV; <italic>n</italic>=5). The resulting voltage dependencies of activation and inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>RosD G217A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>) in transduced HDFs were similar to those previously reported in transfected HEK293s (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Importantly, transduced HDFs became electrically excitable, whereby injection of 1 ms current pulses of increasing amplitude elicited reproducible firing of an ‘all-or-none' AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). These results demonstrated the ability of BacNa<sub>v</sub> to yield creation of <italic>de novo</italic> electrically excitable cells.</p>
<p>To enable electrical coupling in excitable HDFs, we co-transduced them with a pRRL-CMV-Cx43-P2A-mCherry lentivirus. Transduced cells robustly expressed membrane-bound Cx43 gap junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>), which resulted in improved intercellular coupling compared with wt-HDFs as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, albeit not to the same level as measured in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). These engineered HDFs (E-HDFs) were then cultured at confluence in 2 cm diameter monolayers in a random or aligned configuration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). When electrically stimulated by a bipolar platinum electrode, randomly oriented E-HDFs supported circular AP spread at an average conduction velocity (CV) of 3.63±0.23 cm s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). As expected, aligned E-HDFs exhibited elliptical (anisotropic) AP spread with higher CVs along (3.86±0.14 cm s<sup>−1</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=5) versus across (2.07±0.19 cm s<sup>−1</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=5) cell orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). Although the above approach enabled AP propagation in initially unexcitable human fibroblasts, CVs were low, which could be at least in part attributed to the relatively slow activation kinetics of Na<sub>v</sub>RosD G217A.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Improved E-Fib electrical properties with NavSheP mutants</title>
<p>To augment the excitability and conduction of E-HDFs, we developed a combined computational and experimental strategy to screen and identify BacNa<sub>v</sub> variants with more favourable properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We set to explore the BacNa<sub>v</sub> orthologue from <italic>Shewanella putrefaciens</italic>, Na<sub>v</sub>SheP, for its fast current kinetics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. As the wt Na<sub>v</sub>SheP channel has a highly hyperpolarized voltage dependency of steady-state inactivation, it does not yield AP firing when co-expressed with Kir2.1. We thus proceeded to shift the activation and inactivation curves of Na<sub>v</sub>SheP to more depolarized voltages based on the previous studies of specific residues in NaChBac channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and significant homology between different BacNa<sub>v</sub> orthologues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>); we created a library of Na<sub>v</sub>SheP mutants where either the D60 or E43 residue was substituted with other standard amino acids. These 38 Na<sub>v</sub>SheP mutants were transiently expressed in a monoclonal HEK293 line stably expressing Kir2.1 and the resulting sodium current was recorded by voltage clamp. The E43 mutants exhibited highly depolarized voltage dependence of activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>); therefore, we focused on detailed characterization of D60 mutants. The D60 mutant channels exhibited a wide range of steady-state and kinetic parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and predominantly exhibited fast kinetics compared with the Na<sub>v</sub>RosD channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Based on the recorded parameters, we applied computational modelling to infer AP upstroke, threshold, duration and CV that would result from the same expression level of different Na<sub>v</sub>SheP mutants in an electrically coupled, Kir2.1 HEK293 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b–e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) and constructed Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60X-Kir2.1 lentiviruses for three D60X mutants (D60A, D60N and D60S) that exhibited the steepest AP upstrokes and highest CVs among different BacNa<sub>v</sub> models. All three mutants exhibited significantly faster kinetics compared with Na<sub>v</sub>RosD G217A in transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>), which allowed generation of APs with shorter duration and sharper upstroke velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h–j</xref>). Co-transduction of these viruses with Cx43 in HDFs yielded a 2.5-fold improvement in CV compared with the use of Na<sub>v</sub>RosD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2k,l</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 2</xref>). This demonstrated the potential for combining BacNa<sub>v</sub> mutagenesis and computational modelling, to engineer primary human fibroblasts with desired electrophysiological phenotypes.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Fine-tuning of E-Fib electrical properties via FACS</title>
<p>The use of fluorescence reporters in multi-cistronic lentiviruses (for example, pRRL-CMV-SheP D60N-P2A-eGFP-Kir2.1) allowed us to further vary <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> levels, and characterize their functional effects on E-HDFs. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we sorted E-HDFs into three populations with low, medium and high GFP expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>), which yielded corresponding low, medium and high levels of <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), and distinct changes in AP shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Specifically, a trend towards more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, one-way analysis of variance, <italic>P</italic>=0.15) and the significantly higher maximum upstroke velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>) could be attributed to higher <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub>, respectively, whereas the increased APD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>) resulted from net depolarizing effect of increased <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub> on membrane repolarization. Although higher AP upstroke velocities expectedly yielded higher CVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g,h</xref>), this effect was moderate, which we hypothesized was due to simultaneous increase in <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> along with <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub>. We thus modelled concurrent increase in <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub> to simulate the experiment (model 1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>) and compared resulting CVs with those caused by an increase in <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub> alone (model 2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Despite the same AP upstroke velocities in both models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>), CV in model 1 increased less (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>), because more depolarizing current was needed to overcome high <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub>, reach threshold and elicit AP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). Examining a wide range of channel conductances (<inline-formula id="d33e578"><inline-graphic id="d33e579" xlink:href="ncomms13132-m1.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="d33e581"><inline-graphic id="d33e582" xlink:href="ncomms13132-m2.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>) further revealed that although threshold current required to elicit AP is primarily sensitive to level of <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>), AP upstroke velocity is mainly dependent on <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6e</xref>), with these two currents inducing opposite effects on CV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6f</xref>). Furthermore, as E-HDFs were also transduced with pRRL-CMV-Cx43-P2A-mCherry lentivirus, sorting cells based on mCherry fluorescence level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>) allowed us to vary Cx43 expression and gap junctional coupling of engineered cells. Optical mapping revealed that E-HDFs with higher mCherry/Cx43 expression supported faster AP propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>), whereas contrary to eGFP sorting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), mCherry sorting had no effect on APD<sub>80</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). Simulation results further revealed that intercellular coupling strength does not influence the relative effects of varying <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub> on CV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6g</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Robustness of E-Fib electrical phenotype</title>
<p>To test whether E-HDFs can maintain stable electrophysiological phenotype under various perturbations, we expanded them 500-fold over a 4-week period, either directly or after 2 freeze–thaw cycles. In both cases, expanded E-HDFs retained proliferative potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and were able to undergo additional rounds of expansion (for example, 100-fold, 4 passages; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In addition, as fibroblasts can differentiate into smooth muscle actin expressing myofibroblasts during wound healing and tissue repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, we treated the expanded E-HDFs with 10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> transforming growth factor-β1 for 7 days, to induce their conversion to myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Subsequent electrophysiological analysis revealed that despite significant cell expansion or myofibroblast differentiation, the <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>) and AP characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g–i</xref>) of E-HDFs remained unchanged, demonstrating the stability of the acquired functional phenotype. The ability of these cells to undergo repeated freeze–thaw cycles without phenotypic alterations suggested the potential for off-the-shelf delivery applications. Electrophysiological phenotype of E-HDFs remained stable until the cells reached senescence (after additional eight passages and ∼10<sup>6</sup>-fold expansion; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a–d</xref>). Furthermore, using a classical heterologous expression system—monoclonal HEK293 line expressing Cx43, K<sub>ir</sub>2.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60A—stable electrical properties were maintained beyond 20 passages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7e–g</xref>), with cells adapting to higher pacing rates by decreasing APD<sub>80</sub> and CV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7h,i</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Applicability to other sources of human unexcitable cells</title>
<p>To further demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we used the Kir2.1-Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60N lentivirus to stably convert human ventricular fibroblasts (HVFs), human astrocytes (HAs) and HEK293s into engineered electrically excitable cells (E-HVFs, E-HAs and E-HEK293, respectively). All engineered cell types displayed strong <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub>, and fired APs on stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Expression of the Kir2.1 channels hyperpolarized the resting membrane potentials in all transduced cells to a similar value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4j</xref>), whereas similar <italic>I</italic><sub>NaSheP</sub> levels resulted in comparable upstroke velocities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4k</xref>). Significant differences in AP duration among different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4l</xref>) could be attributed to differences in their endogenous currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4m</xref>) and potentially other differences in epigenetic, posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation of ion channel expression and function. Collectively, these results confirmed the robustness of the BacNa<sub>v</sub> engineering approach against the starting unexcitable cell phenotype.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>E-Fibs improve conduction in model of interstitial fibrosis</title>
<p>To test whether E-Fibs could improve impaired AP conduction in native excitable tissues, we designed a zig-zag micropattern of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>), which mimics the tortuous electrical conduction of cardiac tissue with interstitial fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The cardiomyocyte zig-zag micropattern displayed normal AP propagation in the longitudinal direction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>), but significantly slowed down transverse CV (3.2±0.4 cm s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>), which was fully rescued (12.0±0.5 cm s<sup>−1</sup>) by the electrical coupling of actively conducting E-HDFs and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary video 3</xref>). In contrast, unexcitable wt-HDFs or excitable Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60A+Kir2.1 HDFs coupled only by endogenous junctions (no Cx43 overexpression) did not alter the transverse conduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9d,e</xref>), whereas unexcitable HDFs with overexpressed Cx43 yielded only a small conduction improvement (to 6.5±0.3 cm s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9f</xref>). All groups had similar AP durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>); thus, wavelength differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>) reflected the differences in CV. Importantly, these studies suggested that slow electrical propagation in cardiac tissues with interstitial fibrosis could be significantly improved if fibroblasts were engineered to actively conduct APs by becoming both excitable and robustly coupled.</p>

<title>BacNa<sub>v</sub> augment and rescue mammalian tissue excitability</title>
<p>Our computational results showed that select BacNa<sub>v</sub> mutant (Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60A) displayed comparable AP upstroke and slightly lower CV than mammalian Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 channel in an excitable cell model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>), suggesting that in addition to custom design of <italic>de novo</italic> excitable cells and tissues, BacNa<sub>v</sub> channels could be exploited to directly manipulate or augment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> mammalian tissue excitability. Specifically, when lentivirally expressed in cardiomyocyte cultures, Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60A channels significantly improved CV from 15.9±0.8 to 26.1±0.7 cm s<sup>−1</sup> without altering AP duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Furthermore, expression of BacNa<sub>v</sub> channels could ameliorate reduced cardiac tissue excitability and arrhythmogenic conduction slowing in various pathological conditions (for example, ischaemia, infarction and congenital disease) associated with membrane depolarization and inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> or diminished intercellular coupling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. For proof-of-concept studies, we used a Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60A mutant, which exhibits ∼10 mV more depolarized inactivation <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (−76.8 mV) compared with Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 channel (−87.4 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). Elevating extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration to depolarize resting potential and inactivate Nav1.5 channels in Ex293 cells (a monoclonal HEK293 line engineered to stably express Kir2.1, Cx43 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) resulted in conduction failure after addition of as little as 3 mM KCl. In contrast, Ex293 monolayers transduced with the Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60A lentivirus sustained AP conduction at significantly higher extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentrations (up to 12.4 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Furthermore, Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60A expression in Ex293 monolayers subjected to increased doses of gap junctional blocker palmitoleic acid (PA) attenuated conduction slowing and prevented conduction block at 60 μM PA when cells expressing only Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 channel failed to conduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Finally, we tested whether viral expression of Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60A could increase the resistance to conduction failure in cardiomyocyte cultures that underwent regional ischaemia after being covered with a glass coverslip<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). During ischaemia, cardiomyocytes exhibited gradual conduction slowing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f,g</xref>) and APD shortening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11a,b</xref>), followed by the partial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11c</xref>) and eventually complete conduction block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 4</xref>). Importantly, Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60A expression preserved cell excitability to significantly prolong the time to conduction block (from 10.5±1.0 min in control to 14.2±0.7 min in BacNa<sub>v</sub>-expressing cardiomyocytes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6i</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since their discovery 15 years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, prokaryotic Na<sup>+</sup> channels have contributed greatly to understanding structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and pharmacology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> of the more complex eukaryotic VGSCs. Yet, it has remained unexplored if large diversity and small gene size of BacNa<sub>v</sub> could be employed to stably modify and augment the excitability of mammalian tissues, a feat difficult to achieve using large mammalian VGSCs. In this study, we presented a combined experimental and computation strategy for use of BacNa<sub>v</sub> channels in the <italic>de novo</italic> induction and control of mammalian tissue excitability. Our goal was to develop a versatile platform that would be cost-effective, applicable to a variety of cell types and amenable to rapid production of large quantities of excitable cells for off-the-shelf use.</p>
<p>Previously, we applied a non-viral stepwise expression of cardiac Na<sup>+</sup> channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir2.1 and gap junctional protein Cx43, combined with antibiotic selection, to generate a stable monoclonal HEK293 line capable of active AP conduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Other proof-of-concept studies applied adenoviral expressions of mammalian VGSCs to induce or modify excitability in primary tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>; however, these effects were transient and unsuitable for long-term studies or the development of antiarrhythmic gene therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Although the use of split-intein-mediated protein <italic>trans</italic>-splicing strategy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> might be adapted in the future to induce stable expression of mammalian VGSCs in primary cells, efficacy of this approach may be limited due to the need for co-transduction of two or more viruses to reconstitute functional channels. To circumvent the need for expressing large mammalian VGSCs, we exploited much smaller <italic>BacNa</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub> genes and designed high-titre multi-cistronic lentiviruses coding minimum sets of ion channels required for stable and efficient induction of excitability in primary cells. In fact, using BacNa<sub>v</sub>+Kir2.1 lentiviruses, human and rodent fibroblasts were routinely transduced with 90% efficiency without any loss of cell viability (not shown). Including a fluorescent reporter in the same virus allowed us to further purify transduced cells and fine-tune their electrical properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, lentivirally expressed ion currents in all engineered fibroblasts were much larger than their endogenous currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). As such, resulting electrophysiological phenotype of engineered cells was relatively insensitive to the cell's epigenetic state and both predictable <italic>in silico</italic> and for the most part reproducible among different cell types <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4j–l</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). The ability to generate actively conducting HVFs, in particular, suggested a potential therapeutic strategy whereby <italic>in situ</italic> fibroblast engineering could improve impaired conduction in fibrotic heart tissues. As a proof of concept, we showed that well-coupled and excitable (but not weakly coupled and/or unexcitable) fibroblasts successfully restored normal neonatal rat cardiomyocyte conduction in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of interstitial fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). On the other hand, distinct forms of cardiac fibroses, differing in size, and cellular and non-cellular components can result from various types of heart disease or injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. <italic>In situ</italic> engineering of actively conducting fibroblasts, while potentially beneficial in improving cardiac conduction in small regions of interstitial or diffuse fibrosis where these cells come in close contacts with cardiomyocytes, may not prove as effective in large cardiac scars with low cellularity. Of note is also that without the prominent Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, engineered fibroblasts are unlikely to spontaneously fire APs or be a source of triggered activity, which could potentially make them less arrhythmogenic compared with the use of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, transduction of mammalian excitable tissue cultures with specific BacNa<sub>v</sub> mutants augmented or rescued conduction in healthy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>) and pathological (depolarization, decoupling and ischaemia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>) conditions, suggesting that BacNa<sub>v</sub>-based gene therapies could be targeted directly to excitable cells. In addition, previous studies have shown that BacNa<sub>v</sub> could be converted into Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective channel (BacCa<sub>v</sub>) by substituting three amino acid residues of the selectivity filter with Aspartate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Hence, stable expression of engineered BacNa<sub>v</sub> channels or their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective derivatives may enable direct therapeutic effects on excitable and unexcitable cells whose function relies on voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.</p>
<p>Although in this study we focused on altering specific amino acid residues (E43 or D60) in a particular BacNa<sub>v</sub> orthologue (Na<sub>v</sub>SheP), various combinations of other BacNa<sub>v</sub> orthologues and residues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> could be explored to customize phenotype of engineered or native excitable cells. For example, mutations in the ‘glycine hinge' region in some BacNa<sub>v</sub> orthologues could change channel inactivation rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and along with tuning of Kir2.1 expression via an independent promoter, could be used to control AP duration to avoid arrhythmogenic dispersion of refractoriness if E-Fibs were used for cardiac cell or <italic>in situ</italic> gene therapy. Furthermore, replacing the highly conserved negative residues (E70 and D91) of BacNa<sub>v</sub> voltage-sensitive domain with positively charged residues could shift activation to more hyperpolarized voltages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> and be used to reduce AP threshold. Similarly, substituting the negatively charged residues in the neck region of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the BacNa<sub>v</sub> channel into glycine could destabilize the helix conformation of this region, decrease the depolarization energy required for channel opening<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> and further augment cell excitability and conduction. Furthermore, a recent study by Arrigoni <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> showed that BacNa<sub>v</sub> CTD plays a critical role in voltage dependence of activation, suggesting CTD swapping among different orthologues could provide yet another method to control excitability of engineered cells.</p>
<p>Basic studies in ‘lower' organisms, including prokaryotes, have led to versatile approaches to manipulate and study mammalian biology. Recent examples include optogenetics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> and genome-editing techniques<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> that, in addition to becoming powerful research tools, have been extensively investigated for potential medical applications. In line with these undertakings, our work supports expansion of prokaryotic ion channel research to basic studies of mammalian tissue excitability and development of new human therapies.</p>

<title>Screening of bacterial sodium channels</title>
<p>To engineer excitable cells, we first explored use of NaChBac channel, the longest studied BacNa<sub>v</sub> orthologue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. However, its slow recovery from inactivation yielded excitable cells with very low maximum capture rate (&lt;1 Hz). This prompted us to instead use Na<sub>v</sub>RosD G217A and Na<sub>v</sub>SheP channels that were kindly provided by Dr Katsumasa Irie from Kyoto University<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Libraries of SheP(D60X) and SheP(E43X) mutants were generated using Quikchange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies), as per the manufacturer's instructions.

Each gene was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5(CuO)-IRES-GFP (Qbiogene) and transfected into HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies).

<title>Lentivirus production</title>
<p>Lentiviral plasmids were constructed from the pRRL-CMV vector (a gift from Dr Inder Verma, Salk Institute). BacNa<sub>v</sub> (Na<sub>v</sub>RosD G217A or Na<sub>v</sub>SheP mutant, without a stop codon) was ligated with eGFP-Kir2.1 (Kir2.1 fused with eGFP at the amino terminus) via the viral P2A peptide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref> before being subcloned into pRRL-CMV, to create the bi-cistronic lentiviral plasmid pRRL-CMV-BacNa<sub>v</sub>-P2A-eGFP-Kir2.1. To enhance gap junction expression in engineered cells, Cx43 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) was linked with mCherry via P2A and subcloned into the pRRL-CMV lentiviral plasmid (pRRL-CMV-Cx43-P2A-mCherry). In the main text, BacNa<sub>v</sub>-Kir2.1 and Cx43 lentiviruses refer to pRRL-CMV-BacNa<sub>v</sub>-P2A-eGFP-Kir2.1 and pRRL-CMV-Cx43-P2A-mCherry virus, respectively. Other lentiviral constructs used in the study were pRRL-CMV-BacNa<sub>v</sub>-P2A-Kir2.1-T2A-eGFP and pRRL-CMV-BacNa<sub>v</sub>-T2A-eGFP. High-titre lentiviruses were produced using second generation lentiviral packaging system. Briefly, 293FT cells (Life Technologies, R700-07) were co-transfected with lentiviral plasmid, packaging plasmid psPAX2 and envelope plasmid pMD2.G (2:1:1 mass ratios) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies).

<title>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings</title>

Patch pipettes were fabricated with tip resistances of 1–2 MΩ when filled with pipette solution consisting of (in mM): 140 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES and 5 MgATP. Whole-cell voltage-clamp and current-clamp recordings were acquired at room temperature (25 °C) and 37 °C, respectively, using the Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments), filtered with a 10-kHz Bessel filter, digitized at 40 kHz and analysed using WinWCP software (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde). To measure BacNa<sub>v</sub> activation properties, membrane voltage was stepped from a holding potential of −100 mV to varying 500 ms test potentials (−50 to 60 mV, increments of 10 mV). Inactivation of BacNa<sub>v</sub> was derived from peak currents measured at 0 mV after varying 3 s prepulse potentials (−160 to −30 mV, increments of 10 mV). For the channels with more hyperpolarized activation and inactivation (Na<sub>v</sub>SheP WT and D60E), holding voltage for steady-state activation protocol was set at −160 mV, whereas steady-state inactivation protocol included prepulse potentials from −180 mV to −30 mV.

As the whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed at 25 °C, to model AP generation at 37 °C, we scaled up <italic>E</italic><sub>K</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub>Na</sub> from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> by 310.15 °K/298.15 °K and further scaled <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>endo</sub> using <italic>Q</italic>-values of 2.7, 1.8 and 2.1, respectively.</p>

The <italic>R</italic><sub>i</sub> value was adopted to simulate the mean CV measured in optically mapped monolayers of a monoclonal HEK293 line expressing K<sub>ir</sub>2.1, Cx43 and Na<sub>v</sub>SheP D60A. All simulations were performed with the identical model parameters given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> and distinct kinetic properties measured in different BacNa<sub>v</sub> mutants (adjusted to 37 °C as described above).</p>
<p>The total length of the simulated cable was 0.72 cm (that is, 300 nodes). The first three nodes in the cable were stimulated by current injection (1.2 × threshold) at 1 Hz rate and activation time at each node was determined as the time of maximum upstroke velocity of propagated AP. Inverse slope of activation time versus distance line fit in the central 0.24 cm of the cable was used to calculate CV.</p>
