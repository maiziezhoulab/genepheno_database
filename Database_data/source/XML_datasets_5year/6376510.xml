<italic>NKX2-1</italic> mutations have been usually associated with a non-progressive
neurological disease. Recent reports revealed a vast variability regarding its clinical
expressivity. Aim of this work was widening the Benign Hereditary Chorea neurological,
cognitive and behavioral phenotype through the description of a child and her family
pedigree. Molecular analysis focused on <italic>NKX2-1</italic> gene revealed a novel
frameshift mutation in the three-generation members described. Cognitive scales detected a
relevant developmental delay, and the clinical observation and Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule -2 administration allowed the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder
in the proband. Microarray testing, further executed to exclude a double hit contextually
provoking the complex neurodevelopmental disorder, revealed the 22q11.2 Duplication
Syndrome. This paper may contribute to enlarge Benign Hereditary Chorea variable
expressivity and, together with other studies reported in the literature, underlines the
need to reconsider the term “benign,” verifying the opportunity of more a complex
diagnosis.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Benign hereditary chorea (BHC, MIM 118700) is a rare multisystemic disorder with autosomal
dominant inheritance. Its more frequent presentation is a childhood-onset movement disorder
manifesting with chorea or even, rarely, with dystonia, tremor, myoclonus and ataxia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2329048X19828881">1</xref> ,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2329048X19828881">2</xref></sup> that usually has no or minimal progression
into adulthood. Its most characteristic presentation symptom is motor delay associated with
random flow of rapid abnormal movements, not rhythmic or stereotypical, unpredictably
involving many different parts of the body at different times. Cognitive function is
typically normal or slightly below the norm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2329048X19828881">1</xref> ,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2329048X19828881">2</xref></sup> and it helps to differentiate BHC versus
other choreas (i.e. Huntington’s disease, chorea-acanthocytosis), though at least a portion
of cases are found to have reduced Intelligence Quotient (IQ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2329048X19828881">3</xref> ,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2329048X19828881">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Far from being a pure neurological disorder, the clinical spectrum of BHC is associated
with hypothyroidism and respiratory disease in approximately 30-50%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2329048X19828881">4</xref></sup> composing a triad known as the “brain-lung-thyroid” syndrome.</p>
<p>BHC is a highly phenotypically heterogeneous disorder, both due to the variable
combinations of lung, thyroid, and neurological abnormalities, and the different
intrafamilial clinical presentations. Choreic movements, in fact, greatly vary, ranging from
infrequent and hardly detectable to severely choreic movements that interfere even with
simple motor tasks and become debilitating. Sometimes, symptoms improve with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2329048X19828881">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Neurologically unusual manifestations, peculiar brain imaging findings and microcephaly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2329048X19828881">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2329048X19828881">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2329048X19828881"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2329048X19828881">7</xref></sup> and some dysmorphic features have also been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2329048X19828881">6</xref></sup> A psychiatric phenotype (including depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-ADHD) has also been reported in
different families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2329048X19828881">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2329048X19828881">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2329048X19828881">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The first BHC pedigree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2329048X19828881">9</xref></sup> suggested the autosomal dominant mode of transmission. Mutations in
<italic>TTF1</italic> gene (also named <italic>TITF1</italic>, <italic>TEBP</italic> or
<italic>NKX2-1)</italic> on chromosome 14q13, implicated in the morphogenesis of thyroid,
lung and brain, causes BHC, although mutations in <italic>ADCY5</italic> have also been
recently detected in quite different neurological and extraneural phenotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2329048X19828881">10</xref></sup>
<italic>NKX2-1</italic> encodes the thyroid transcription factor-1 and it seems to play a
role in striatal interneurons and cholinergic neurons of the basal ganglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2329048X19828881">11</xref></sup> In BHC the most common manifestation of lung disease in the neonatal period is
respiratory distress syndrome, also related to surfactant dysfunction, and even pulmonary
infections are recurrent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2329048X19828881">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Here we provide a detailed description, focused on neuropsychiatric features, of a
three-year old child and of her pedigree, in order to add complexity to the wide phenotypic
variability of the disorder.</p>

<title>Patients Description and Methods</title>
<p>The child was a female born mildly preterm (34 weeks gestational age) by planned cesarean
section due to intrauterine growth retardation. Birth weight was 1636 g (5th centile),
length was 41 cm (5th centile) and head circumference was 30 cm (10th centile). Apgar score
was 7 at fifth minute. Congenital hypothyroidism was detected at birth by neonatal
laboratory screening, and a substituent therapy was started. Laryngomalacia was diagnosed at
3 months. The family history was positive for a non-progressive movement disorder. The
mother presented with motor delay in childhood, successively evolved towards choreic
movements and myoclonic jerks, involving also oro-facial muscles, with stuttering and mild
dysarthria. Her brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was negative. She was affected by
clinical hypothyroidism, needing the thyroid substituent therapy, and recently she started
tetrabenazine therapy to control the movement disorder. She did not complete high school
level education, and her adaptive functioning indicated a borderline cognitive impairment.
The maternal grandmother presented a similar but less severe movement disorder associated
with a partial thyroid agenesis that did not require replacement treatment (see Video
1).</p>
<p>The child was firstly admitted to our department at the age of 10 months for a motor delay,
primarily characterized by postural immaturity, and followed up until the age of 40 months.
Head control had been obtained at the age of 8 months, rolling at 12 months, without
parachute reflexes in sitting position. Mild hypotonia and excessive motor activity, without
a clear movement disorder, were detected. Spontaneous Babinski sign was present without
signs of spasticity. Mild dysmorphic signs were noticed: prominent glabella, mild palpebral
ptosis, bilateral inverse epicanthus, enlarged nasal bridge and nares, prominent columella,
deep philtrum, wide mouth, thinned lips. At 16 months she was able to sit without support,
but could not crawl. Ataxic features (sub-continuous postural rebalancing and imprecision in
reaching objects) and hypotonia were observed. Cognitive performance was below the norm,
with a developmental quotient between -2 Standard Deviations (SD) and -3SD, as assessed by
Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales. Electroencephalogram and brain MRI were performed and
resulted normal.</p>
<p>At the age of 28 months, crawling and wide-based gait with support were possible,
characterized by instability and marked articular hyperextension. Gesture and pincer grasp
were more precise. Mild hypotonia and laryngeal stridor were still present and tongue was
maintained extruded. Play schemes were mainly sensomotor (See Video 2).</p>
<p>Thyroid appeared echographically hypoplastic, and substituent therapy, previously
interrupted, was reintroduced because of mild elevation of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone blood
levels.</p>
<p>Successively, at 40 months her neurological picture was still characterized by mild ataxic
features, significantly improved with thyroid hormones therapy, while chorea was not present
yet. Her cognitive level, evaluated with Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development-III
edition (Italian Standardization), was equivalent to a mental age of 19 months and 15 days
(-3SD), configuring a moderate developmental delay. Her behaviour was characterized by motor
instability and attention weakness, poor motivation and tendency to research preferred
objects, which she used in a repetitive way.</p>
<p>Interaction was possible only for a short time and was greatly discontinous. Speech was
limited to sporadic vowels. Verbal comprehension was possible for simple and contextual
messages, supported by gestures. She engaged relationships mainly with requisite aim.
Pointing had not yet emerged and eye contact was poor. Response to name was highly
inconsistent. Play schemes were limited to sensorial exploration and sporadic functional use
of daily objects. She could participate in and anticipate social and play routines. Some
imitation ability was present, but she did not have access to imaginary play. She was not
yet able to choose between two alternatives. Sensorial interests and atypical attachment to
objects she used stereotypically were noticed. At Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2
Module 1 evaluation she met the criteria for a diagnosis of mild autism spectrum
disorder.</p>
<p>Hearing evaluation had not detected any impairment.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>On the basis of the pedigree and the presence of movement disorder in the proband and her
mother and grandmother, we indicated the molecular analysis focused on
<italic>NKX2-1</italic> gene. A DNA change (cDNA): NM_003317 c.379delC Protein:
p.R127AfsX7DNA change (hg19): g.36987220delC, determining a novel frameshift mutation which
predicted a truncated protein has been found in the three-generation members described. This
mutation had never been reported in public databases.</p>
<p>In addition, array-CGH analysis, using a 60K array platform, detected an interstitial
duplication of about 3.1 Mb in 22q11.2 ranging from 18,327,965 to 21,440,514 (GRCh37/hg19).
Parental segregation analysis is ongoing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>BHC, as suggested by its name, is a non-progressive movement disorder, usually not
associated with cognitive impairment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2329048X19828881">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2329048X19828881">2</xref></sup> though cases with IQ reduced have been rarely described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2329048X19828881">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2329048X19828881">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, autism spectrum disorder has not been reported to be related
to BHC until now. The atypical BHC phenotype of our patient led us to deepen the diagnosis
with the Array-CGH, as the first tier test in children with developmental delay/intellectual
disability, autism spectrum disorders and dysmorphic features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2329048X19828881">13</xref></sup> We detected the “22q11.2 duplication syndrome” (MIM#608363), a disorder with a highly
variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, that has been related to autism spectrum disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2329048X19828881">14</xref></sup> and ADHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2329048X19828881">15</xref></sup> Our patient met the criteria for both autism spectrum disorder and global
developmental delay; moreover, her behavior was characterized by motor instability and
attention weakness, though not meeting criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD.</p>
<p>The complex neurodevelopmental disorder affecting the proband could thus be concurrently
provoked by a double genomic alteration, namely a chromosomal interstitial duplication and a
genetic mutation, which mutually worsen the clinical picture. Thus, the co-occurrence of a
dual diagnosis might further widen the BHC psychiatric correlations already reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2329048X19828881">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2329048X19828881">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2329048X19828881">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Considering the effects of <italic>NKX2-1</italic> on basal ganglia function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2329048X19828881">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2329048X19828881">16</xref> ,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2329048X19828881">17</xref></sup> its mutation might represent a double
negative effect on neurodevelopment, being the subcortical structures crucially involved
both in motor and non-motor higher functions such as cognition, attention, action
finalisation and social behavior. Basal ganglia and cerebellar interconnections with
different cortical areas of the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex, have recently been
considered crucial for the processing and integration of different types of information.
Anomalies of these circuits have been reported as related to some neurodevelopmental disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2329048X19828881">16</xref> ,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2329048X19828881">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Basal ganglia regulate the balance between inhibition and excitation, thus modulating motor
sequences and cognitive, relational, emotional and executive functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2329048X19828881">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>As observed in other genetic conditions, environment, hormones, epigenetic factors and
other modifying genes should be considered as contributors to the phenotypic heterogeneity
in BHC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2329048X19828881">18</xref></sup> In particular, thyroid hormones may mediate genomic actions involving the control of
the expression of many genes involved in brain development and function of cerebellum,
cerebral cortex and striatum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2329048X19828881">19</xref></sup> Moreover, intrauterine growth retardation reported in our proband might be caused by
both the maternal hypothyroidism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2329048X19828881">20</xref></sup> and the syndromic condition of the baby, and it might itself be a confounding factor
for later cognitive/motor development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2329048X19828881">21</xref></sup> We cannot exclude that 22q11.2 duplication might have contributed to hypothyroidism,
hypotonia, language delay and mild dysmorphic features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2329048X19828881">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>As reported in other cases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2329048X19828881">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2329048X19828881">5</xref></sup> in our patient BHC was detected due to a motor delay associated with hypotonia.
However, she had an unusual ataxic evolution rather than a choreic picture, though a similar
picture has been already described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2329048X19828881">22</xref></sup> Ataxia might be the onset of many movement disorders later evolving towards
extrapyramidal involvement, and this finding could be explained considering the complex
circuitry connecting basal ganglia, cerebellum and cerebral cortex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2329048X19828881">16</xref> ,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2329048X19828881">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Early-onset ataxic pictures of unknown cause, following motor delay with normal imaging and
associated with congenital or subclinical hypothyroidism and/or respiratory tract diseases,
should thus raise suspicion of BHC and require mutation screening of the
<italic>NKX2-1</italic> gene. Clinicians should consider BHC in differential diagnosis
even in cases of intellectual and behavior impairment, especially if family history is
strongly suggestive.</p>
<p>Variability in clinical expression among family members might be due to an incomplete
penetrance of the disorder, a recurrent condition in autosomal dominant diseases, although
correlations between genotype and phenotype have not been found in order to explain it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2329048X19828881">4</xref> ,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2329048X19828881">5</xref></sup>; moreover, it may represent subsequent
evolutionary steps of the condition.</p>

<sec id="section5-2329048X19828881" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This report might contribute to a better understanding of BHC, that cannot be defined as a
benign condition at least in some conditions. The occurrence of neurodevelopmental disorders
such as global developmental delay/intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder and
of non-conventional motor signs such as ataxic features should not make clinicians exclude
BHC, though this diagnosis might not be exhaustive and require further genetic studies. A
two-hit model in which the concomitant presence of genomic alterations could influence
clinical manifestations should always be evaluated. At the same time, as the clinical
hypothyroidism can be detected following a silent period, a normal thyroid hormones dosage
concomitant with the typical movement disorder should not make clinicians exclude BHC in the
diagnostic process.</p>
