<p id="Par1">Aberrant sperm flagella impair sperm motility and cause male infertility, yet the genes which have been identified in multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) can only explain the pathogenic mechanisms of MMAF in a small number of cases. Here, we identify and functionally characterize homozygous loss-of-function mutations of <italic>QRICH2</italic> in two infertile males with MMAF from two consanguineous families. Remarkably, <italic>Qrich2</italic> knock-out (KO) male mice constructed by CRISPR-Cas9 technology present MMAF phenotypes and sterility. To elucidate the mechanisms of <italic>Qrich2</italic> functioning in sperm flagellar formation, we perform proteomic analysis on the testes of KO and wild-type mice. Furthermore, in vitro experiments indicate that QRICH2 is involved in sperm flagellar development through stabilizing and enhancing the expression of proteins related to flagellar development. Our findings strongly suggest that the genetic mutations of human <italic>QRICH2</italic> can lead to male infertility with MMAF and that <italic>QRICH2</italic> is essential for sperm flagellar formation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Sperm defects are the direct causes of male infertility, which includes decreased sperm count, reduced sperm motility and abnormal morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Sperm motility is a critical factor for normal fertilization, and over 80% of male infertility is caused by impaired sperm motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Sperm morphology plays an essential role in sperm locomotion, and defective sperm morphology makes an assignable contribution to male infertility, which consists of a wide range of phenotypes involving the head, neck, mid-piece or tail of the spermatozoa. Among these, multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) is characterized by a mosaic of morphological abnormalities of the flagellum including coiled, bent, irregular, short or/and absent flagella<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Normal sperm flagella contain a 9 + 2 axonemal arrangement of nine peripheral microtubule doublets (OD) and two central microtubules (CP), surrounded by outer dense fiber (ODF) and fibrous sheath (FS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Almost all MMAF cases are accompanied by visible ultrastructural derangement and/or defects, such as incomplete or disorganized axoneme arrangement or absence of ODF/FS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Any defects in these structures would result in aberrant sperm morphology and further lead to reduced motility or even sperm immobility.</p>
<p id="Par4">Research is ongoing to investigate the molecular mechanisms of MMAF. Using knock-out (KO) mouse models, several genes have been found to be associated with sperm flagellar development in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The complete ablation of <italic>Spata6</italic> caused impaired development of the connecting piece and tight head-tail conjunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Subtle disorganization of the ultrastructure was observed in <italic>Tekt4</italic>-null mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The sperm flagella of <italic>Tssk4</italic>-absent mice represented morphological defects at the midpiece-principal piece junction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Mice lacking <italic>Odf2</italic> showed axoneme defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. <italic>Ropn1</italic>-deficient mice exhibited structural defects in the principal piece of sperm flagellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. A significant disorganization in the fibrous sheath, as well as abnormal configuration of doublet microtubules, was observed in <italic>Cabyr</italic>-knockout male mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Although MMAF is not a rare autosomal-recessive inherited disorder in humans, the genetic etiology of a large proportion of MMAF cases remains elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. To date, mutations in only six genes have been determined in humans related to MMAF: <italic>AKAP4</italic>, <italic>CCDC39</italic>, <italic>DNAH1</italic>, <italic>CFAP43</italic>, <italic>CFAP44</italic>, and <italic>CFAP69</italic> (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>); however, these could explain the mechanism of only a few MMAF cases. Therefore, it remains necessary to improve the discriminative power of a single candidate gene in human MMAF.</p>
<p id="Par5">In this study, two homozygous nonsense mutations of the glutamine rich 2 (<italic>QRICH2</italic>) gene are identified in two MMAF patients from two consanguineous families through whole-exome sequencing (WES). The <italic>Qrich2</italic> KO mouse model represents typical MMAF phenotypes including coiled, bent, irregular, short or/and absent flagella and defects of sperm flagellar ultrastructure. These phenotypes are consistent with those observed in human subjects who carried the loss-of-function mutations of <italic>QRICH2</italic>. This study provides compelling evidence that the loss-of-function mutations of <italic>QRICH2</italic> could result in MMAF and cause male infertility, and QRICH2 is a functional molecule essential for sperm flagellar development by regulating the genes associated with the accessory structure of sperm flagella.</p>

<title>Loss-of-function mutations of <italic>QRICH2</italic> in males with MMAF</title>
<p id="Par6">Two infertile males from two consanguineous families were investigated in our study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>). Semen analysis is presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>. The sperm quantity was basically normal, whereas abnormalities in the spermatozoa tail region were up to 99%. Therefore, almost no progressive motility of spermatozoa was observed in these two cases. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) further identified the MMAF phenotypes of these two cases. We observed some spermatozoa with short tails, some with thick short tails, and some with coiled tails, and some spermatozoa appeared to have only the head region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). In addition, a variety of ultrastructural defects were detected in the sperm flagella under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). For patient A (PA) integrated and regularly arranged OD and ODF were observed, whereas the CP were missed in the mid-piece of most flagella. In the principal piece of most flagella, some ODF and OD were absent, the remainders were disorganized, and the CP could not be observed as well. For patient B (PB) the atypical 6 + 0 composition of axonemal microtubules was shown in the flagellar mid-piece; additionally, a complete lack of CP and the irregular arrangement of the OD and ODF were revealed in the principal piece.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Sperm morphology and ultrastructure in the two MMAF patients. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> The pedigree structure and segregation analysis in two families.

<p id="Par7">The previous studies have reported that the homozygous loss-of-function mutations of several genes could cause MMAF and have suggested that MMAF is a disorder with an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. According to this, we performed WES on the two males to elucidate the underlying genetic causes of the MMAF phenotypes, and many homozygous variants were found in the two patients (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">1</xref>). Briefly, variants were removed if (1) the minor allele frequency was ≥1% in any database, including the gnomAD, ExAC Browser and 1000 Genomes Project, because the pathogenic variants responsible for MMAF are rare in human populations; (2) the heterozygous variant, because MMAF has been assumed to be an autosomal-recessive inheritance; (3) the variant affected: 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions, noncoding exons, or intronic sequences except canonical splice sites; and (4) the variant was not predicted damaging by PolyPhen-2, SIFT and MutationTaster tools. Subsequently, the selected genes harboring candidate pathogenic variants from WES were evaluated by Human Protein Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">http://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>), which contains tissue-specific protein expression data, and the genes which are primarily or specifically expressed in the testis were included in our research. Remarkably, after exclusion of frequent variants and application of technical and biological filters, two homozygous nonsense mutations were identified in <italic>QRICH2</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>): a homozygous stop-gain mutation in exon 3 (c.192G&gt;A [p. L64*]) in the individual PA and a homozygous stop-gain variant in exon 4 in the individual PB (c.3037C&gt;T [p.R1013*]). To clarify the putative contribution of these mutations to the MMAF phenotypes, we investigated the <italic>QRICH2</italic> gene by Sanger sequencing in PA and another affected individual (IV:3 and IV:5), their healthy parents (III:3 and III:4), and unaffected siblings (IV:2, IV:8 and IV:9) from Family A. In this family, the another affected individual (IV:5) carried the homozygous mutation (c.192G&gt;A) and their healthy parents (III:3 and III:4), as well as one unaffected sibling (IV:8) carried the heterozygous mutation (c.192G&gt;A) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). For family B, we detected the heterozygous mutation (c.3037C&gt;T) in their healthy parents (III:1 and III:2) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). The results of DNA sequencing suggested that the two homozygous nonsense mutations of PA and PB were inherited from their parents carrying heterozygous mutations, which is in line with the nature of MMAF being an autosomal recessive inheritance.</p>

<title>The expression of <italic>QRICH2</italic> in sperm flagella</title>
<p id="Par8">The Human Proteins Atlas Database indicates that the expression of human <italic>QRICH2</italic> is restricted to the testes, while no information was available with regard to QRICH2 protein distribution in spermatozoa. To determine the location of QRICH2 on human spermatozoa accurately, we used stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), which enables 3D reconstruction at 10–20 nm or higher resolutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Notably, QRICH2 co-localized with microtubule protein α-Tubulin which is an axonemal component, indicating that QRICH2 is expressed in sperm tail and plays a vital role in sperm flagellar development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d–i</xref>, Supplementary Movies <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>QRICH2 is detected in human sperm flagella. <bold>a</bold>–<bold>i</bold> 3D STORM images of QRICH2 (green) (<bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>), α-Tubulin (red) (<bold>d</bold>–<bold>f</bold>) and their co-localization (yellow) (<bold>g</bold>–<bold>i</bold>). <bold>a</bold>, <bold>d</bold>, <bold>g</bold>, <italic>x</italic>-<italic>y</italic>-<italic>z</italic> projections (scale bars, 5 µm). <bold>b</bold>, <bold>e</bold>, <bold>h</bold>, <italic>x</italic>–<italic>y</italic> projections: sections surrounded by white square (scale bars, 0.5 µm). <bold>c</bold>, <bold>f</bold>, <bold>i</bold>, y-z cross-sections near the annulus (white arrowheads) (scale bars, 0.1 µm). <bold>j</bold> The domains of QRICH2 and the positions of two mutations in <italic>QRICH2</italic>.

<p id="Par9">The <italic>QRICH2</italic> gene is localized on human chromosome 17, contains 19 exons and encodes a predicted 1663-amino acid protein (NP_115510.1) with three principal domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2j</xref>). The homozygous stop-gain mutation of c.192G&gt;A [p.

The other homozygous stop-gain variant, c.3037C&gt;T [p.R1013*], which is located in exon 4 of <italic>QRICH2</italic>, results in the loss of SMC_N super family domain and DUF4795 domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2j</xref>). To confirm the effect of the two mutations on <italic>QRICH2</italic> expression, we performed immunofluorescence assays on spermatozoa of the two MMAF patients. The QRICH2 protein was not detected in spermatozoa from PA and was remarkably weak in spermatozoa from PB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2k</xref>). Thus, the two homozygous stop-gain variants did impact the expression of <italic>QRICH2</italic> negatively, leading to the abnormal development of sperm flagella.</p>

<title>Lacking <italic>Qrich2</italic> leads to MMAF in male mice</title>
<p id="Par10"><italic>QRICH2</italic> is highly conserved during evolution. The human QRICH2 shares 96.7, 89.5, 74.2, 61.2, 81.8, and 59.5% of protein identity with its orthologs in chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, dogs, cattle, mice and rats, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a, b</xref>). The expression profile of <italic>Qrich2</italic> in adult mice suggested that <italic>Qrich2</italic> is primarily expressed in the testis tissue (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref>). Accurately, immunofluorescent stain of testis sections from WT mice showed that Qrich2 is mainly expressed in the round and elongated spermatids during the spermiogenesis, and the Qrich2 staining is absent in the testis sections from KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a–d</xref>). To better understand the localization of Qrich2 in different steps of germ cells, we carried out flow cytometry coupled to cell sorting assay to isolate elongated spermatids, round spermatids and spermatogonia. The immunofluoresence results indicated that Qrich2 is distributed in the nuclear membrane of the spermatogonia (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3e</xref>), in the nucleus of the round spermatids (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3f</xref>), in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the early elongating spermatids (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3g</xref>), in the cytoplasm of late elongating spermatids (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3h</xref>) and in the flagella of epididymal spermatozoa (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3i</xref>). Furthermore, to find out the temporal expression of <italic>Qrich2</italic>, <italic>Qrich2</italic> expression levels were investigated in mice testes at different postnatal days. The real-time PCR results showed that <italic>Qrich2</italic> began to be expressed obviously at postnatal day 15, reached the peak of expression at postnatal day 22, and then maintained a stable expression level afterward (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). Thus, <italic>Qrich2</italic> is stably, highly and exclusively expressed in adult mice testes during evolution.</p>
<p id="Par11">Considering that Qrich2 protein in mice is highly homologous to human QRICH2 protein and primarily expressed in mice testes, we established <italic>Qrich2</italic>-KO mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to define the physiological role of QRICH2 in sperm flagellar formation.

<p id="Par12">Although no significant differences in testis size and weight were observed between the WT and KO mice, differences in epididymis size and weight were obvious (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4d,e</xref>). To determine which spermatogenesis stage that Qrich2 affects on, we compared the histology of testicular tissue sections between the KO and WT mice by hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Flagellar formation defects were observed at stages VI-VIII in the KO mice compared with WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>), which indicates that Qrich2 is involved at the stage of sperm flagellar formation. On analyzing the epididymis sections, few spermatozoa were observed, the flagella of which were aberrant in the KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). Light microscopy first demonstrated the morphological abnormalities of most sperm flagella in the KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4f</xref>). The detailed and clear MMAF phenotypes in the KO mice were revealed by SEM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). The sperm flagella of KO mice presented with short, coiled, bent, or other irregular shapes, which were consistent with the clinical phenotypes in the two subjects with MMAF.

<title>QRICH2 regulates flagellum-development-related proteins</title>
<p id="Par14">To determine the molecular mechanism of QRICH2 during sperm flagellar formation, the protein expression levels in the testes of the WT and KO mice were investigated by a proteomics approach. A total of 6849 proteins were quantified, of which 108 proteins were identified to be expressed differentially, including 92 down-regulated proteins and 19 up-regulated proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Among the decreased proteins, 33 are involved in the development of sperm flagella, and 15 are required for energy metabolism, which is crucial for sperm motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). According to the literature, six of these proteins, namely, A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP3), outer dense fiber of sperm tails 2 (ODF2), testis specific serine kinase 4 (TSSK4), calcium binding tyrosine phosphorylation regulated (CABYR), rhophilin associated tail protein 1 (ROPN1) and membrane associated ring-CH-type finger 10 (MARCH10), were directly related to the formation of the sperm tail; the complete ablation of these proteins caused impaired development of sperm flagella in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, we focus on these six proteins. Western blotting results further confirmed the decreased expression of these six proteins in the KO mice compared to the WT mice, which was consistent with TMT quantification results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c, d</xref>). Meanwhile, the bindings between QRICH2 and AKAP3, ODF2 or TSSK4 were confirmed by exogenous Co-IP in HEK 293 cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>). Furthermore, these proteins, similar to QRICH2, were predominantly localized in the human spermatozoa flagella, supporting their vital roles in sperm tail formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Proteins for sperm flagellum development are down-regulated in KO mice. <bold>a</bold> The heat map from three independent proteomic analyses of testes from the WT and KO mice. <bold>b</bold> The proteins down-regulated in the KO mice are associated with sperm flagellum development and related energy metabolism. <bold>c</bold> The different MS/MS spectra of Akap3, Odf2, Tssk4, March10, Ropn1, and Cabyr in the KO mice and the WT mice. <bold>d</bold> The expression of the key proteins in the testes of the WT and KO mice.

<p id="Par15">To confirm the decreased expression of Akap3, Tssk4, Ropn1, March10, Cabyr, and Odf2 was caused by the deficiency of Qrich2 directly, but not by the sperm tail defects, we performed further research on heterozygous (Ht) <italic>QRICH2</italic> mice which have the normal flagella development (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>). The western blotting results showed that the expression of these six proteins in Ht mice is lower than in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5c</xref>). In addition, when we knocked down <italic>QRICH2</italic> in NT2 cells (human testicular embryonic carcinoma cell) which have been identified to express QRICH2, AKAP3, CABYR, ODF2, and TSSK4, and the decreased protein amount of AKAP3, CABYR, ODF2, and TSSK4 was observed in these knocked-down cells compared to the control cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5d</xref>), Therefore, the decreased levels of the proteins which we focus on are caused by the reduced expression of QRICH2 directly but not the lack of sperm tail structures. Taken together, <italic>QRICH2</italic> is involved in sperm tail formation through regulating the expression of sperm tail structural proteins and energy metabolism proteins.</p>
<p id="Par16">Real-time PCR was used to investigate whether Qrich2 regulated these proteins via their transcriptional levels. We observed that the mRNA levels of <italic>Odf2</italic> and <italic>Cabyr</italic> from KO-mice testes were approximately 60 and 52% lower than that of WT mice, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). Meanwhile, the significant decreased mRNA levels of <italic>Cabyr/CABRY</italic> and <italic>Odf2/ODF2</italic> were also observed in Ht mice or QRICH2-knocked-down NT2 cells, compared with WT mice and control cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5e,f</xref>). To find out whether QRICH2 acted as a trans-acting factor to enhance the transcriptional activity of <italic>ODF2</italic> and <italic>CABYR</italic>, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR was performed and the results showed that QRICH2 could bind to the promoter regions of <italic>CABYR</italic> and <italic>ODF2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). Similarly, the ChIP-qPCR results showed the enhanced binding of QRICH2 to the promoter fragments of <italic>ODF2</italic> and <italic>CABYR</italic> approximately 4-fold, 11-fold, and 5-fold respectively, compared with the negative control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5g</xref>). Furthermore, we constructed luciferase reporter vectors containing <italic>ODF2</italic> and <italic>CABYR</italic> promoter fragments and co-transfected them with QRICH2 expression vector individually.

<p id="Par17">The limited difference in the mRNA levels of <italic>Akap3</italic>, <italic>Tssk4</italic>, <italic>Ropn1</italic>, and <italic>March10</italic> between the KO and WT mice indicates that Qrich2 may not affect their transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesized that QRICH2 may be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of these four proteins. The degradation levels of these proteins were determined by analyzing the ubiquitination levels of Akap3, Tssk4, Ropn1, and March10 between the KO and WT mice, which is the most common mechanism for protein degradation. As expected, the increased ubiquitination degradation of Akap3, Tssk4, Ropn1, and March10 was observed in the KO mice compared with the WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>). We further confirmed the influence of QRICH2 on AKAP3 and TSSK4 by inhibiting their ubiquitination degradation in vitro. We observed that the overexpression of QRICH2 significantly inhibited the ubiquitination of exogenous AKAP3 and TSSK4 in the HEK 293 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f, g</xref>). These data suggest that QRICH2 is a key molecule that regulates sperm flagellar formation by stabilizing the related proteins through suppressing their ubiquitination degradation.</p>
<p id="Par18">It has been suggested that ROPN1 and CABYR utilize docking interactions with AKAP3 to regulate cilia and flagellar formation through the PKA-related pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In this study, we observed that the binding of Ropn1 and Cabyr to Akap3 was weakened in the KO mice compared with the WT mice by Co-IP assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6h</xref>). Furthermore, TSSK4 was reported to influence sperm flagellar formation by enhancing the phosphorylation state of ODF2, which is a prominent protein of the sperm tail outer dense fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Because no commercial antibody was available, we did not confirm that TSSK4 can increase the phosphorylation of ODF2. However, we found that the overexpression of TSSK4 could increase ODF2 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6i</xref>). In all, QRICH2 could suppress the ubiquitination degradation of AKAP3 and ROPN1 and facilitate CABYR expression as a trans-acting factor, correspondingly reinforcing the binding of AKAP3, ROPN1, and CABYR in sperm flagella. Additionally, QRICH2 regulates the formation of outer dense fiber in sperm flagella by directly enhancing the transcription of ODF2 and stabilizing TSSK4 through inhibition of its ubiquitination degradation, which is a crucial factor for ODF2 phosphorylation. Overall, these findings reveal that QRICH2 is required for maintaining the normal structure of sperm flagella by regulating key proteins in the related signaling pathways (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>The mechanisms were elucidated by proposed models. <bold>a</bold> The mechanisms of QRICH2 modulating the development of sperm flagella.

<title><italic>QRICH2</italic> mutations detected in patients with asthenozoospermia</title>
<p id="Par19">Two homozygous nonsense mutations of <italic>QRICH2</italic> were observed in two MMAF patients from two consanguineous families. Additionally, <italic>Qrich2</italic>-deficient male mice showed MMAF phenotypes and infertility. These results suggested that <italic>QRICH2</italic> plays a crucial role in male reproduction associated with MMAF. The results of proteomics analysis showed that several proteins which are not only related to the development of sperm tail structure, but also to energy metabolism were significantly reduced in <italic>Qrich2</italic>-deficient mice. The energy metabolism in sperm flagella provides the sliding force for flagella beating which directly affects the sperm motility. Reduced sperm motility is the basic character for asthenospermia which is defined as a semen sample containing less than 40% of motile sperm and less than 32% with progressive motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The expressions of ROPN1 and CABYR have been observed remarkably decreasing in asthenospermia subjects in comparison with the conrols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the mutations of dynein genes were found in isolated non-syndromic asthenozoospermia patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Consequently, we suppose that whether <italic>QRICH2</italic> mutations are associated with asthenospermia. To investigate the variation of <italic>QRICH2</italic> in interfile males with asthenospermia, we sequenced all 18 exons and their flanking intronic regions of <italic>QRICH2</italic> in 150 asthenospermia patients. Finally, six heterozygous mutations, including five missense mutations and one nonsense mutation, were observed in six subjects (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>). These mutations were predicted to be pathogenic by bioinformatic tools: SIFT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, PolyPhen-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and M-CAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>). To further understand the effect of these mutations, we investigated the conformational changes of QRICH2 protein caused by these mutations with SWISS-MODEL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://swissmodel.expasy.org/">https://swissmodel.expasy.org/</ext-link>) and PyMoL software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (1.3r1, DeLano Scientific LLC). The results of silico analysis showed that the mutations of c.3313C&gt;A [p.Q1105K], c.3335G&gt;A [p.G1112E], and c.4039A&gt;G [p.M1347V] could change the conformation of QRICH2 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b, d</xref>). Because no gap-free homology templates for the spacer fragments (aa 550–600 and aa 1300–1360) could be identified in the PDB database, the effects of c.1706T&gt;A [p.V569E] and c.4039A&gt;G [p.M1347V] on QRICH2 protein structure were not predicted.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Analysis of <italic>QRICH2</italic> mutations in asthenozoospermia patients</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan="6">Human subject</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>P76</th><th>P19</th><th>P72</th><th>P34</th><th>P364</th><th>P241</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>cDNA mutation<sup>a</sup></td><td>c.3380T&gt;A</td><td>c.1706T&gt;A</td><td>c.3313C&gt;A</td><td>c.3335G&gt;A</td><td>c.4039A&gt;G</td><td>c.4481G&gt;A</td></tr><tr><td>Protein alteration</td><td>p.L1127<sup>a</sup></td><td>p.V569E</td><td>p.Q1105K</td><td>p.G1112E</td><td>p.M1347V</td><td>p.R1494H</td></tr><tr><td>Mutation type</td><td>Nonsense</td><td>Missense</td><td>Missense</td><td>Missense</td><td>Missense</td><td>Missense</td></tr><tr><td>Allele frequency in ExAC Browser</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0.000008237</td><td>0.00001648</td><td>0.0009482</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7">Function prediction</td></tr><tr><td> SIFT</td><td>NA</td><td>Deleterious</td><td>Deleterious</td><td>Deleterious</td><td>Deleterious</td><td>Deleterious</td></tr><tr><td> PolyPhen-2</td><td>NA</td><td>Probably damaging</td><td>Probably damaging</td><td>Probably damaging</td><td>Probably damaging</td><td>Probably damaging</td></tr><tr><td> M-CAP</td><td>NA</td><td>Possibly pathogenic</td><td>Possibly pathogenic</td><td>Possibly pathogenic</td><td>Possibly pathogenic</td><td>Possibly pathogenic</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>NA</italic> not available</p><p><sup>a</sup>The accession number for <italic>QRICH2</italic> is GenBank: NM_032134.2</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
<p id="Par20">Accordingly, no homozygous mutations or compound heterozygous mutations were found in the asthenospermia patients, suggesting that the recessive <italic>QRICH2</italic> may just relate to MMAF. Several variants were indeed detected in the normal controls (200 normal fertility males) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), whereas those rare and deleterious heterozygous mutations of <italic>QRICH2</italic> were found only in asthenospermia (asthenozoospermia: 6/150; control: 0/200; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.006, the Fisher exact test, two-sided), indicating that deleterious heterozygous mutations of <italic>QRICH2</italic> may increase the risk of asthenospermia. To further prove the vital role of heterozygous mutations of <italic>QRICH2</italic> in sperm movement, we performed research on epididymal spermatozoa of Ht mice. We observed that the morphology of most sperm is normal in Ht mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>) and the number of abnormal sperm tail was not significantly different between Ht mice and WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref>). Notably, by CASA, the sperm motility parameters were decreased in Ht mice compared with WT mice (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The diminished sperm movement in the Ht mice compared to WT mice is directly showed in Supplementary Movies <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">7</xref>. Given that the reduced sperm motility in Ht mice closely resembles the sperm phenotype of human asthenospermia, these data suggest that the deleterious heterozygous mutations of human <italic>QRICH2</italic> may contribute to asthenozoospermia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par21">Impaired sperm motility is a major contributor to male infertility, and the sperm flagellum is the key factor affecting sperm motility. Variations in the genes involved in the formation of sperm flagella can cause abnormalities in sperm flagellum morphology and further reduce sperm motility, thus impairing male fertility. Several genes have been reported to be associated with the development of the sperm flagellum in mouse models, whereas mutations in these genes in mice are rarely identified with those in humans with MMAF, except <italic>AKAP4, CCDC39, DNAH1, CFAP43</italic>, <italic>CFAP44</italic>, and <italic>CFAP69</italic> (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>). Therefore, it is crucial to explore the pathogenic genes of MMAF in humans and further understand the mechanisms required for the structure of sperm tails and their effect on fertility.</p>
<p id="Par22">In this study, we detected two homozygous nonsense mutations of the <italic>QRICH2</italic> in two MMAF patients from two consanguineous families. It is the first time that <italic>QRICH2</italic> has been identified to cause MMAF in humans, providing a new genetic diagnostic cue for male infertility. Our further investigations suggest that the two variants result in dysplasia of sperm flagellum: almost all observed sperm from affected patients exhibited multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella. Additionally, irregular sperm ultrastructures were observed by TEM: peripheral fibers or microtubules were absent, such as in 9 + 0 and 6 + 0 axonemal arrangement. Furthermore, the <italic>Qrich2</italic>-deficient mouse models showed MMAF phenotypes and abnormal flagellum ultrastructure, supporting the vital role of <italic>QRICH2</italic> in the development of the sperm flagellum and that homozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>QRICH2</italic> cause the abnormal development of the sperm flagellum, which leads to male infertility.</p>
<p id="Par23"><italic>QRICH2</italic> is evolutionarily conserved in several species, indicating its fundamental role in organisms. However, the functions of <italic>QRICH2</italic> have not been characterized so far. QRICH2 contains three principal domains: Glutenin hmw super family, SMC_N super family and DUF4795 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>). The SMC_N super family is the only known functional domain in QIRCH2. The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) super family proteins have ATP-binding domains at the N-termini and C-termini, which are involved in chromatin and DNA dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. SMC-like domains are highly conserved in some ciliary and centrosomal proteins, which are related to intraflagellar transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, suggesting that SMC-like domains might represent signature sequences that are recognized during these transport processes. Importantly, the mutations in the SMC_N domain of <italic>CFAP43</italic> and <italic>CCDC39</italic> have been reported to be associated with MMAF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Hence, QRICH2 containing the SMC_N domain supports that QRICH2 is required for sperm flagellar development.</p>
<p id="Par24"><italic>QRICH1</italic> is the homologous gene of <italic>QRICH2</italic>, whose mutations are associated with developmental delay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. However, to date, there are no studies reporting the functions of <italic>QRICH2</italic>. To understand the molecular mechanism of QRICH2 in the development of the sperm flagella, we used a proteomics approach to compare the different expression of proteins in the testes of the WT and KO males. Intriguingly, 33 proteins suggested to be associated with the formation of sperm tail were significantly decreased in the KO mice compared with the WT mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Among them, <italic>CFAP44</italic> variants have been reported to cause MMAF in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Mice missing some of these genes have demonstrated abnormal sperm tail structures (<italic>Spata6, Tekt4, Odf2, Ropn1</italic>, and <italic>Cabyr</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A potential mechanism is that ROPN1 and CABYR are involved in the development of the sperm flagella though binding with AKAP3 and further regulating PKA signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In this study, we observed that QRICH2 inhibited the ubiquitination degradation of AKAP3 and ROPN1, increased CABYR mRNA levels, and further maintained the complex of AKAP3, to which ROPN1 and CABYR stably bind in the sperm flagella. Meanwhile, QRICH2 stabilized TSSK4/ODF2-mediated pathways, which are crucial for sperm tail structure growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, by promoting their protein and mRNA expression. In addition, QRICH2 restrained the ubiquitination degradation of MARCH10, a microtubule-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating the formation and maintenance of the flagella in developing spermatids. Our findings elucidate the potential mechanisms of QRICH2 in regulating the development of the sperm flagellum and provide additional cues for future research on the functions of QRICH2.</p>
<p id="Par25">In this study, no homozygous mutations but six deleterious heterozygous variants were detected in patients with asthenozoospermia. Remarkably, in addition to the deleterious heterozygous variant (c.3313C&gt;A), P72 carried a rare SNP (rs780426606). For P241, two other SNPs (rs67948583 and rs73999020) with extremely low frequency were determined. We therefore speculate that the compound deleterious heterozygous variants and rare SNPs of <italic>QRICH2</italic> may be the risk for P72 and P241. Besides that, the Ht mice represented the decreased sperm motility. Thus so, the pathologic heterozygous variants of <italic>QRICH2</italic> could increase the risk for asthenozoospermia. Certainly, this theory needs to be further investigated.</p>
<p id="Par26">In summary, our genetic and functional data based on human subjects and mouse models strongly suggest that homozygous loss-of-function mutations of <italic>QRICH2</italic> are a novel genetic cause of MMAF. Additionally, the underlying mechanism that QRICH2 regulates sperm flagellar development was elucidated in this study. The screening of the deleterious mutations of <italic>QRICH2</italic> could be important for clinical molecular diagnosis of male infertility. As the findings about <italic>QRICH2</italic> in this study are novel, further research is required on this unfamiliar gene to explore the importance of <italic>QRICH2</italic> in male fertility.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="Par37">The proteins of the cultured cells and mice testes tissues were extracted using a universal protein extraction lysis buffer (Bioteke) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The denatured proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) for the immunoblot analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec19">
<title>Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)</title>
<p id="Par38">The extracted proteins were incubated with 3 µg of target antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Next, 50 μl of Protein A/G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) was added to each incubation sample for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with 1× PBS. Finally, the co-immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by standard 1× SDS sample buffer and heated for 10 min at 70 °C and then separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and PVDF membranes for the immunoblot analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec20">
<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR and ChIP-qPCR</title>
<p id="Par39">ChIP assays were performed using a ChIP-IT Express Enzymatic Kit (Active Motif). In brief, the testes tissues were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, and chromatin was extracted in cell lysis buffer and then in nuclear lysis buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail and then sheared by sonication (Bioruptor, Scientz) on ice to a mean length of 500 bp. 1% of the sheared chromatin was retained as a positive control input DNA and another portion was precipitated by incubation with IgG as a negative control in the subsequent PCRs. The remaining chromatin was precipitated by incubation with antibodies against QRICH2. PCR and qPCR were performed to amplify the target regions of <italic>CABYR</italic> and <italic>ODF2</italic> which QRICH2 binding to. The qPCR data were analyzed by Fold Enrichment Method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> and Percent Input Method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> simultaneously, and in Percent Input Method, the value of target DNA fragments that were enriched in testes tissue was normalized to the value of the 1% input DNA. Each assay was performed in triplicate to confirm the reproducibility of the results. The primers are listed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>.</p>

<title>Flow cytometric analysis and cell sorting</title>
<p id="Par40">The testes from 8-week-old male mice were removed and decapsulated. Firstly, the seminiferous tubules were incubated in 10 ml 1× PBS containing 90 mg/ml of collagenase (Invitrogen) with continuous agitation for 15 min at 32 °C and then allowed to sediment for 5 min and the supernatant was removed. Next, the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of PBS with 60 mg/ml of trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 µg/ml of DNase (Promega), and incubated under the same conditions for 15 min. After gently being pipetted with a Pasteur pipette, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 400 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and then washed three times with 1× PBS, filtered using 40 µm nylon mesh to remove cell clumps and last resuspended in HEPES-buffered RPMI containing 0.5% BSA. After the testicular single cell suspensions were obtained, two million cells were diluted in 2 ml of 1× PBS buffer and stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h at 32 °C. Before analysis, PI (2 μg/ml; Sigma) was added to exclude dead cells. Finally, cell analysis and sorting were performed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) equipped with a cell sorting system.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence staining</title>
<p id="Par41">After being washed with Sperm Washing Medium (CooperSurgical Inc.), the spermatozoa samples or the selected germ cells were fixed onto slides with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% BSA. Next, the slides were sequentially incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The slides were washed in 1× PBS, incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000, A21206, Thermo Fisher) or Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1000, A11005, Thermo Fisher) labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and then counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich) to label the nuclei. Images were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus).</p>

<title>Histology hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining</title>
<p id="Par42">Testicular and epididymal tissue samples from male mice were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, dehydrated in ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. The sections were stained routinely with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec24">
<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p id="Par43">For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) assay, the spermatozoa samples were fixed onto slides of 1 cm diameter using 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing the slides with 1× PBS three times and post-fixing in 1% osmic acid for 1 h at 4 °C, dehydration was performed using 30, 50, 75, 95, and 100% ethanol sequentially, and the slides were dried using a CO<sub>2</sub> critical-point dryer (Eiko HCP-2, Hitachi). Finally, the slides were mounted on aluminum stubs, sputter-coated by an ionic sprayer meter (Eiko E-1020, Hitachi), and analyzed by SEM (Hitachi S3400) under an accelerating voltage of 10 kV.</p>
<p id="Par44">For the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay, each semen sample was rinsed in Sperm Washing Medium. The semen samples were pre-fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in 1% buffered OsO4, dehydrated through gradient acetone solutions, and embedded in Epon 812. Before ultrathin-sectioning, a half-thin section was made to enable sperm location under a light microscope. The ultrathin sections were double-stained with both lead citrate and uranyl acetate and then analyzed under a TEM (TECNAI G2 F20, Philips) with an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.</p>

<title>STORM imaging</title>
<p id="Par45">Sperm cells were fixed and immunostained with rabbit anti-QRICH2 (1:50, HPA021935, Sigma-Aldrich) and mouse anti-α-Tubulin (1:100, T7451, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C. After washed in 1× PBS, sperm cells were incubated with Atto 488 (1:500, 41051, Sigma-Aldrich) or Alexa fluor 568 (1:500, A10037, Thermo Fisher) secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the sperm samples were stained with imaging buffer (PBS with the addition of 100 mM mercaptoethylamine at pH 8.5, 5% glucose (w/v), 0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), and 40 μg/ml catalase (Roche Applied Science)) and illuminated at 657 nm for imaging. The 501 nm and 568 nm lasers were used to activated Atto 488, and Alexa fluor 568, respectively. A cylindrical lens (focal length = 1 m) used for 3D localization was inserted into the detection path to enable determination of z positions from the ellipticities of the molecular images and the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> positions from the centroid positions.</p>
