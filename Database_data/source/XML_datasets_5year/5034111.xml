<abstract>
<p>Gene editing in non-human primates may lead to valuable models for exploring the etiologies and therapeutic strategies of genetically based neurological disorders in humans. However, a monkey model of neurological disorders that closely mimics pathological and behavioral deficits in humans has not yet been successfully generated. Microcephalin 1 (<italic>MCPH1</italic>) is implicated in the evolution of the human brain, and <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutation causes microcephaly accompanied by mental retardation. Here we generated a cynomolgus monkey (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) carrying biallelic <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutations using transcription activator-like effector nucleases. The monkey recapitulated most of the important clinical features observed in patients, including marked reductions in head circumference, premature chromosome condensation (PCC), hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and upper limb spasticity. Moreover, overexpression of <italic>MCPH1</italic> in mutated dermal fibroblasts rescued the PCC syndrome. This monkey model may help us elucidate the role of <italic>MCPH1</italic> in the pathogenesis of human microcephaly and better understand the function of this protein in the evolution of primate brain size.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human pluripotent stem cells can be used to develop various <italic>in vitro</italic> organoid culture systems, including cerebral organoid, which may be used to understand the mechanisms involved in organogenesis and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>. However, the human brain contains over 170 billion neurons and non-neuronal cells distributed throughout various regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> organogenesis remains insufficient to model human neurological and mental disorders. In recent decades, gene-edited animal models, especially rodent models, have been generated and used to improve our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and to test potential treatments for human neurological diseases. However, given the myriad behavioral, physiological and anatomical differences between humans and rodents, many rodent models fail to faithfully recapitulate the human condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup>. Because non-human primates have perceptual, cognitive and behavioral repertoires very similar to those of humans, the development of non-human primate models that mimic human neurological diseases would critically contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms at work in the human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is defined by the presence of a head circumference that is three standard deviations below the mean (−3 SD) for age and sex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup>. More than 12 causative genes have been identified; the first of which was designated as <italic>MCPH1</italic> (microcephalin 1; also known as <italic>BRIT1</italic> for BRCT-repeat inhibitor of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup>. Evolutionary studies have suggested that changes in the <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene played an important role in the enlargement of the human brain. Moreover, this gene demonstrates evidence of positive selection during the evolution of humans and great apes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>. Truncations in the <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene are associated with significantly reduced brain size and short stature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>. Some patients exhibit mental retardation and other neurological conditions, including spasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup>. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the presence of cerebral malformations, such as a simplified gyral pattern in the brain and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup>. Several elegant studies have demonstrated that <italic>MCPH1</italic>-deficient mice could recapitulate some key features of microcephaly and could thus help us understand the pathogenic mechanism. For example, Chen <italic>et al</italic>. reported <italic>MCPH1</italic>-deficient mice exhibited small skull sizes and hearing impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup>. Another group also found disruption of <italic>MCPH1</italic> caused microcephaly due to a premature switching of neuroprogenitors from symmetric to asymmetric division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup>. So far, no neurologic symptoms have been found in mouse models and not all <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant mice recapitulate the severely reduced brain size observed in human patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, a nonhuman primate model is desirable.</p>
<p>Genetically modified monkey models for human diseases, such as a transgenic Huntington's disease monkey model and an autism-related gene <italic>MECP2</italic> transgenic monkey model, have been created and were thought to mimic human behavior and cognitive phenotypes better than rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup>. However, precise gene editing in monkeys is still a time-consuming and difficult undertaking. More recently, several studies have improved upon the techniques using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup>. Two groups reported the generation of <italic>MECP2</italic> knockout monkey models using TALENs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup>. However, it is not clear whether the TALEN-mediated gene mutagenesis can effectively disrupt the targeted gene function and recapitulate disease phenotypes in non-human primates. Here we report a TALEN-generated <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant cynomolgus monkey and the phenotypic characterization of this potential monkey model of MCPH.</p>

<title>Generation of the <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant monkey</title>
<p>Similar to the human gene, the monkey <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene comprises 14 exons and encodes an 842 amino acid protein, which contains three BRCT (BRCA1 C terminus) domains playing the diverse roles of MCPH1 by mediating its interactions with distinct partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup>. We designed three TALEN pairs targeting different sites inside exons 2 and 3 (<italic>MCPH1</italic>-T1∼T3), which encode the N-terminal BRCT1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>The targeting efficiency of TALEN pairs was examined in COS-7 cells using the T7 endonuclease 1 (T7EN1) assay; all three TALEN pairs could introduce mutations in the <italic>MCPH1</italic> locus. The best indel rate approached 45.2%. Sanger sequencing revealed that <italic>MCPH1</italic>-T2 yielded the highest mutation rate (8 of 24 sequencing reads were mutated; 33%) in its target site, indicating that this TALEN pair could efficiently introduce genomic mutations in the <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene. The targeting efficiencies of all three TALEN pairs are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S1A</xref>.</p>
<p>To further test the targeting efficiency of <italic>MCPH1</italic>-T2 in monkey embryos, we injected the <italic>MCPH1</italic>-T2 mRNA at two concentrations (20 ng/μl and 50 ng/μl) into the cytoplasm of 23 cynomolgus monkey zygotes obtained by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Although Sanger sequencing revealed that 85.7% of embryos injected with 50 ng/μl mRNA were mutant, only 50% of the embryos developed to the morula/blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S1B-S1D</xref>). In the lower concentration group, the mutation rate was 50%, and the embryos were of better quality, with 62.5% developing to the morula/blastocyst stage. As these results indicate that 20 ng/μl <italic>MCPH1</italic>-T2 could produce mutations in monkey embryos with acceptable efficiency and low toxicity, this was used for the subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>We injected 55 embryos with <italic>MCPH1</italic>-T2 mRNA and transferred 52 embryos into nine surrogate female monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Three surrogates became pregnant. One experienced a miscarriage at day 46 after embryo transfer. The aborted embryo was not collected. The remaining two females delivered three offspring upon the completion of pregnancy (∼165 days).</p>

<sec>
<title>Genotype analysis of the <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant monkey</title>
<p>T7EN1 assays and Sanger sequencing both revealed that the twin offspring were wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S2B</xref>). In contrast, the singleton offspring (female) carried biallelic <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene mutations at the targeting site and was designated as the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey. Samples from the ear, tail, skin, blood, oral epithelium (Epi) and dermal fibroblast cells (DFs) of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey could be cleaved by T7EN1, whereas those of its parents and the controls could not be cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results demonstrate that the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey contains mutations in the <italic>MCPH1</italic> sequence. Further sequencing of the TALEN-targeting site of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey revealed the presence of two different mutations in the <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>): an 8-bp deletion together with a 6-bp insertion that resulted in a nonsense mutation and a 6-bp deletion with a 3-bp insertion that resulted in a deletion/missense mutation. These two alterations were observed in all tested tissue samples at a ∼ 1:1 ratio. We selected &gt; 200 colonies and failed to identify any wild-type colony upon sequencing. We performed PCR with a primer pair that could amplify the wild-type allele but not the mutant allele to detect more sensitively the biallelic mutations of the <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene, and did not find the wild-type <italic>MCPH1</italic> allele in the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S2C</xref>). These results demonstrate that the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey carries biallelic mutations in the <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene. Parents of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey contain only the wild-type <italic>MCPH1</italic> allele. This result confirms that the mutations in the offspring were generated by TALEN-mediated mutagenesis.</p>
<p>Because TALENs may also cause off-target mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup>, we searched for any potential off-target mutations in the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey. TALENoffer computational prediction tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> was used to predict the possible off-target sites (OTSs) in the <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic> genome. Thirteen potential OTSs with TALENoffer score &gt; −1.61 were chosen, and no mutation was detected by T7EN1 assays and Sanger sequencing in these sites in the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey. Because these potential OTSs were all intronic loci, we next tested additional 18 potential OTSs located in exons with TALENoffer score &gt; −1.98 and found no mutation in these sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Table S1</xref>). The frame-shift and deletion/missense mutations in the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey genome were predicted to generate a truncated protein (75 aa) and a protein missing one amino acid (p.57QST&gt;HL), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S2E</xref>). Western blot revealed that microcephalin was expressed at lower levels in the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey DFs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant monkey exhibited a visibly smaller brain</title>
<p>Humans with <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutations are characterised by significant reductions in head circumference and may exhibit shortened height<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>. To assess the phenotype of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey, four age-matched wild-type female cynomolgus monkeys were selected as controls. The female <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey exhibited a visibly smaller brain (head) and a slightly shorter stature than the wild-type monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Noticeable microcephaly was observed at birth, with an occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) of 15.3 cm (−5 SD, mean ± SD of controls: 17.3 ± 0.4 cm). The monkey's body length at birth was average at 16.2 cm (−2.3 SD, mean ± SD of controls: 17.4 ± 0.5 cm), whereas the body weight at birth was only 0.241 kg (−5 SD), which was much lower than that of wild-type monkeys (mean ± SD: 0.390 ± 0.030 kg) of the same age and sex. Longitudinal measurement of OFC, body weight, body length, tail length and chest circumference revealed a slower growth trajectory of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The OFC of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey was below normal (− 4 to −11 SD) during the first year of life. The weight of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey was only ∼65% compared with wild-type animals before 6 months of age and below normal (−2 to −8 SD) during the first year of life. The differences between the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey and controls in body length, tail length and chest measurement were also significant. In contrast, monthly examinations of the teeth revealed no significant difference between the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey and controls, with all teeth erupting before 6 months of age.</p>
<p>Because previous studies demonstrated that <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant patients may exhibit a simplified gyral pattern, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and frontal lobe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup>, we performed MRI to detect the brain size of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey. The total brain volume (TBVs) was 41.9 ml in the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey compared with 67.6 ± 3.3 ml (mean ± SD) in wild-type monkeys at 6-month old (−8 SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The corpus callosum formed but appeared thin for the animal's age, most notably in the region of the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C (a-c, e-g)</xref>). In addition to hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, MRI did not detect any other obvious malformations in the brain of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C (d, h)</xref>). These results suggest that the phenotype of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey is similar to the symptoms of <italic>MCPH1</italic> patients.</p>

<title>Behavior and neurologic changes in the <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant monkey</title>
<p>Neitzel <italic>et al</italic>. reported a <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant patient who was unable to walk without support until 4.75 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>, whereas another report described a patient with delayed acquisition of fine motor skills<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup>. The <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey walked freely without any assistance similar to the controls; however, the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey had occasional spasms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Movie S1</xref>) and often could not jump or climb as flexibly as the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Movie S2</xref>). We evaluated the videos at random and calculated the success rates of jumps made by wild-type and <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkeys over 30 min. The total number of times the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey attempted to jump did not differ from the wild-type monkeys. However, the former succeeded only one-seventh of the time, whereas the controls never failed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Notably, the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey rarely hung upside down, whereas the wild-type monkeys did so once approximately every 4 min. The wild-type monkeys hung upside down 3-13 times within 30 min, whereas the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey did so only once within 180 min (from a total of six random videos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the above results, the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey's arms could not be fully extended under external force, even when the animal was anesthetized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which was similar to the previous observation that a <italic>MCPH1</italic> patient demonstrated spasticity with hyperreflexia of the patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes and clonus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>. Radiological examination of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey did not find any bone deformity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, we used shear-wave elastography to quantify biceps brachii stiffness at a 90° fixed position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup>. Among the control monkeys, the mean elasticity values of the right biceps brachii muscle ranged from 9.90 to 12.20 kPa, whereas those of the left ranged from 9.95 to 12.38 kPa. In contrast, in the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey, these values averaged 19.12 ± 1.37 and 20.77 ± 0.75 kPa (mean ± SEM), respectively. The biceps brachii of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey had significantly greater stiffness than the controls, as confirmed by one-way ANOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This result suggests that the introduced <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutation may affect the motor skills of the mutant monkey in a manner similar to that observed in some patients.</p>

<sec>
<title>Cellular phenotype of the <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant monkey</title>
<p><italic>MCPH1</italic>-related microcephaly has also been associated with premature chromosome condensation (PCC) syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup>, in which PCC occurs at interphase, resulting in a high number of cells with prophase-like chromatin. To investigate whether cells of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey exhibited evidence of PCC, we examined chromosome preparation made from DFs. Markedly more nuclei containing condensed prophase-like chromatin were found in the DFs of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey (mean ± SEM: 11.5% ± 0.7%) than in the wild-type cells (mean ± SEM: 0.9% ± 0.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To investigate whether the nuclear envelope was retained or disassembled in PCC in the prophase-like cells (PLCs), the expression of Lamin B in DFs was detected by immunofluorescence staining, and the chromatin was stained with DAPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). PLCs with intact nuclear envelopes were relatively common among the DFs of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey (mean ± SEM: 12.0% ± 1.1%), but not in the controls (mean ± SEM: 1.30% ± 0.2%). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey presents typical cellular symptoms of <italic>MCPH1</italic>-mutant microcephalus patients.</p>
<p>As <italic>MCPH1</italic> is a BRCT-repeat protein capable of inhibiting hTERT expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup>, we examined whether TERT was inhibited in <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> cells. We used the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) to assess telomerase enzymatic activity and found that telomerase activity was significantly activated in <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> DFs compared with wild-type DFs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>A previous report revealed that normal prophase cells decondense their chromatin to allow repair following DNA damage, but <italic>MCPH1</italic> patient cells do not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup>. We examined whether ionizing irradiation (IR) affected the chromosome condensation behavior of <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> DFs compared with controls. Cultured DFs were subject to 1 Gy irradiation, and cytological preparations were made at 2-h intervals for 8 h following IR before chromatin morphology was analyzed. We found that <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> DFs failed to completely decondense their chromatin following DNA damage. The number of PLCs remained relatively constant at all time points in <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> DFs, whereas relatively fewer PLCs were found in control DFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Therefore, the chromosome condensation behavior of <italic>MCPH1</italic>-mutant DFs remained after DNA damage.</p>
<p>To confirm that the phenomena observed <italic>in vitro</italic> were due to <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutations, an <italic>MCPH1</italic>-expressing lentiviral vector was established and introduced into <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey DFs to generate <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>rescue</sup> DFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S3A</xref>). As a control, <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey DFs were transduced with a mock vector (encoding eGFP alone) to generate <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mock</sup> DFs. After viral infection, &gt; 90% of the DFs were infected, as reflected by GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Western blot revealed that microcephalin expression was significantly upregulated in <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>rescue</sup> DFs compared with the low level observed in <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mock</sup> DFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S3B</xref>). An analysis of chromosome morphology revealed that the proportion of PLCs in <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>rescue</sup> DFs (mean ± SEM: 1.8% ± 0.2%) was reduced markedly compared with <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mock</sup> DFs (mean ± SEM: 11.1% ± 1.0%) to a level similar to that observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>). The TRAP test also revealed that <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>rescue</sup> DFs could inhibit TERT expression to the same degree as in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These data indicate that ectopic expression of <italic>MCPH1</italic> could reverse the mutant phenotypes of <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey DFs, suggesting that the mutations in <italic>MCPH1</italic> but no other potential OTS are primarily responsible for the phenotype observed in the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we used TALEN technology to successfully generate the first <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant cynomolgus monkey. In monkey embryos, our TALEN pairs exhibited high targeting efficiency with low toxicity as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup>. Using these TALEN pairs, we obtained one live female monkey harboring biallelic <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutations without detectable off-target effect. Our study suggest that TALEN technology can be successfully adopted to develop rapid, efficient and precise mutagenesis in cynomolgus monkeys.</p>
<p>The human <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene is a recessive gene located on chromosome 8p23. The <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene of the cynomolgus monkey is similarly mapped to chromosome 8. Our target sites are located in exon 2 or 3, and nearly all of the missense mutations shown to cause primary microcephaly are located in exon 2 or 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup>. These exons encode the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal BRCT1 domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup>. Genotype analysis revealed that the TALEN-generated <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant cynomolgus monkey has two types of mutations. One is predicted to generate a truncated protein (75 aa) with impaired function, whereas the other a protein missing one amino acid (p.57QST&gt;HL). The p.57QST&gt;HL mutation is likely to have a functional consequence, as QST is highly conserved among different species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S4A</xref>). Structure modeling of the N-terminal domain of microcephalin suggests the QST to HL mutation may reduce the original three turns of α-helix to two turns of α-helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S4B</xref>), thus affecting the protein stability or interaction with other proteins. Richards <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the α2 region containing QST residues (from p.57 to p.66; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S4A</xref>) is one of the important sites for <italic>MCPH1</italic> function in preventing abnormal metaphase chromosome condensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup>. Taken together, p.57QST&gt;HL mutation may significantly disrupt microcephalin structure and function.</p>
<p>Small head circumference is an important clinical index used to evaluate patients with <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup>. The head circumference of patients is in the range of −3 to −11 SD below the means. The head circumference of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey was remarkably smaller (approximately −5 SD) than that of the wild-type controls until 12 months of age. Previous studies have reported that <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant patients always exhibit short stature, but the brain size is always significantly more reduced than height<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>. The <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey also exhibited a slower growth trajectory, and we then calculated the ratio of OFC to body length of the <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant monkey and control animals. The ratio was 68.2% in the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey, but 73.1% ± 3.0% in the controls at 12 months of age (mean ± SD, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test), suggesting the brain size is also significantly more reduced than the length in <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant monkey. MRI revealed that the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey had a thin and hypoplastic corpus callosum but no other apparent cerebral malformation. Similarly, MRI scans of some <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant patients have identified malformations of the brain, such as hypoplasia of the frontal lobe and corpus callosum, reduction of the cerebral cortex, and a primitive, coarsened gyral pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup>. In contrast, in most <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant mice, MRI analyses did not reveal any obvious malformation in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup>. Only Gruber and Zhou <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the cerebral cortex was reduced in their <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup>. These results indicate that <italic>MCPH1</italic> is likely to have a more important role in the brain development of primates than that of mice.</p>
<p>As some <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant patients were reported to display spasticity and delayed motor skills, we hypothesized that the dysmyotonia and body cramping observed in the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey were related to the gene mutation. Spasticity has been connected with a thin corpus callosum in various other diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup>. In a previous report, a <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant patient exhibited agenesis of the genu of the corpus callosum with other cerebral malformations, and she also showed slow developmental progress combined with profound mental retardation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>. Because brain development continues after birth in primates and the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey is in the early stage of life, the etiology of these symptoms remains unknown. To our knowledge, no neurological symptom has been reported in a <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant mouse. These prior and present observations provide additional support for our belief that <italic>MCPH1</italic> has a more critical role during brain development in primates than in mice.</p>
<p>At the cellular level, PCC is a key discriminating feature presented in human <italic>MCPH1</italic> patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup>, and the percentage of PLCs reportedly ranges from 3.3% to 18%. Here we show that ∼11.5% of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup>DFs were PLCs, which is significantly higher than in the control. Consistent with the report of Gavvovidis <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup>, we observed that the DFs of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey did not decondense their chromatin following DNA damage (which normally occurs to allow repair). Moreover, cytological studies also verified that <italic>MCPH1</italic> acts as a BRCT-repeat-containing inhibitor of TERT expression. The PCC phenotype is reportedly caused by the lack of a functional N-terminal BRCT domain of microcephalin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup>. Some patients have no significant increase in the fraction of prophase stage chromosomes; their mutations have been mapped in exons 4 and 5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup>. In our study, the western blot analysis revealed an intermediate level of microcephalin protein expression. Because the antigen used to develop this antibody is located between amino acid 400 and 500 of the canonical sequence according to Uniprot data for microcephalin, a truncated protein (75 aa) cannot be detected, but a protein missing one amino acid (p.57QST&gt;HL) can be detected by the antibody. As we did not observe any wild-type <italic>MCPH1</italic> allele and we could observe PCC in this monkey, we presume that the observed protein may be translated from the deletion/missense mutant allele. To further confirm that the observed cellular phenomena were due to the mutation of <italic>MCPH1</italic>, we ectopically expressed <italic>MCPH1</italic> in <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey DFs and found that this strategy could reverse the mutant phenotypes. Taken together, the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings demonstrate that the <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant monkey cells possess most of the features of <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant patient cells.</p>
<p>In summary, we have successfully established a <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant cynomolgus monkey model using TALENs. The phenotype of the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey closely resembles that of <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant microcephaly in humans, indicating this animal model may provide a new strategy for studying the pathogenesis of microcephaly and the role microcephalin in the evolution of the brain size in primates.</p>

Six healthy female cynomolgus monkeys were intramuscularly injected with rhFSH (recombinant human follitropin alfa; GONAL-F, Merck Serono) daily for 8 days, followed by rhCG (recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin alfa; OVIDREL, Merck Serono) on day 9. Oocytes were collected by laparoscopy 33-36 h after rhCG administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup>. Metaphase II (MII, first polar body is present) oocytes were cultured in CMRL-1066 medium containing 0.1% Na-lactate (Sigma, L1375) and subjected to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). At 8∼10 h after ICSI, the zygotes were injected with TALEN mRNAs at 20 or 50 ng/μl. The zygotes were transferred into surrogate females at the pronuclear stage or cultured in embryo culture medium-9 (HECM-9) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone Laboratories, SH30088.02) at 37 °C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Early pregnancy diagnosis was performed by ultrasonography ∼ 30 days after embryo transfer.

<p>Genomic DNA was isolated from cultured embryos using a GenomePlex Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genomic DNA was isolated from tissues using a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplicons, including nuclease target sites or OTSs, were generated using ExTaq polymerase (Takara) and the primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Table S2</xref>. The obtained PCR products ranged in the size from 300 to 600 bp and were purified with a PCR purification kit. Briefly, the T7EN1 assay was performed as follows. Using a thermocycler, we denatured and annealed the PCR products in 1× NEBuffer 2 (NEB) to form heteroduplex DNA, which was then digested with T7EN1 (NEB) for 15∼25 min at 37 °C and analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Physical measurements, including OFC, body weight, body length, tail length and chest circumference, were obtained monthly. Here we present data representing ∼ 2-month intervals.</p>

<sec>
<title>MRI measurements and calculation of brain volume</title>
<p>Brain images of monkeys were acquired using a GE Discovery MR750 3.0T scanner (GE, Milwaukee, USA) with an HD wrist array coil. Monkeys were initially anesthetized with 3∼5 mg/kg of Telazol, and then intubated and maintained under anesthesia using 1.0%∼1.5% isoflurane mixed with O<sub>2</sub>. All major physiological parameters were monitored continuously and maintained within normal ranges. With respect to the detailed sequence parameters of the MRI scans, we obtained the following: SAG T2 Propeller FRFSE-weighted images (FRFSE, TE = 98 ms, TR = 9 578 ms, FOV = 120 mm, matrix = 384 × 384, thickness = 2 mm, spacing = 0.2 mm, FA = 142, BW = 83.3 KHz, ETL = 32, NEX = 1.5); Ax T2 Propeller FSE-weighted images (FSE, TE = 89 ms, TR = 10 219 ms, FOV = 120 mm, matrix = 320 × 320, thickness = 2 mm, spacing = 0.2 mm, FA = 142, BW = 62.5 KHz, ETL = 32, NEX = 2); and Ax 3D T1 BRAVO-weighted images (BRAVO, TE = 3.7 ms, TR = 8.7 ms, TI = 450, FOV = 128 mm, matrix = 256 × 256, thickness = 0.5 mm, FA = 12, BW = 31.25 KHz, NEX = 1). Regional and TBVs were calculated using the FSL Brain Extraction Tool (FSL5.0) and DPABI_V1.2_141101 software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>X-ray</title>
<p>A dual-detector X-ray unit (DiDiEleva01; Philips, Holland) was used to acquire radiographs at 10 mA with 60 kV, using a grid and an exposure time of 0.2 s. An SRO 33100 ROT 360 X-ray tube (Philips) was used. The focal spot was 0.7 × 0.7 mm, and the focal distance for all images was 110 mm. The DigitalDiagnost (2.1.4 V22.13.567 2012) software program was used for radiology.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Behavioral assessment</title>
<p>For behavioral assessments, the <italic>MCPH1</italic><sup>mt/mt</sup> monkey was caged with each of four wild-type monkeys in turn and recorded by a camera at a regular daily time when the monkeys were 8-month old. Videos were collected and divided into a period of 30 min and six random videos were selected for each monkey. They were next analyzed by two raters in a blinded manner. The following types of behavioral movements were scored: the times of each monkey jump (jump from the bottom to the top using only its legs) and success, as well as the times of each monkey hang upside down in 30 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Ultrasound elastography</title>
<p>The forearm of each anesthetized monkey was placed in a 90° flexed position, and ultrasound and shear-wave ultrasound elastographic measurements of the biceps brachii were performed using an Aixplorer ultrasound scanner (Supersonic Imagine; Aix-en-Provence, France) coupled with a linear transducer array (4-15 MHz, SuperLinear 15-4; Vermon, Tours, France). The biceps brachii tendon elasticity values were measured within a defined region of interest at the thickest point. All measurements were performed by two ultrasound specialist radiologists and reported in kilopascals.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Chromosome preparation and PLC assay</title>
<p>Metaphase spreads of DFs were performed using standard diagnostic laboratory procedures. Slides were stained with fresh 10% Giemsa stain for 10 min. Approximately 1 000 nuclei per experiment were counted in three independent experiments for each group, and the percentage of prophase-like nuclei was determined with respect to total nuclei.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Total proteins were extracted from DFs and PBMCs, and analyzed as previously described. Equal amounts of soluble protein were separated via sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% Tris-glycine mini-gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Rabbit anti-BRIT1 (1:1 000, #4120; Cell Signaling) and rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:5 000, #2118; Cell Signaling) were used as the primary antibodies. Chemiluminescence (Amersham) was used to visualise the protein bands on X-ray films (Kodak). All of the western blot exposures were within the linear detection range.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Telomeric repeat amplification assay</title>
<p>Cellular telomerase activity was measured by telomerase repeat sequence amplification-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay using the TeloTAGGGTelomerase PCR ELISA kit (11854666910; Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sample absorbance was measured with a Model 550 Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad, USA) at 450/690 nm within 30 min after addition of the stop reagent.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>IR and immunofluorescence staining</title>
<p>Logarithmically proliferating DFs were irradiated using an X-ray source (Ua = 160 kV; I = 25 mA; dose rate, 1.02 Gy/min; Rs2000; Rad Source). For immunofluorescence, DFs grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and blocked using 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-lamin B (sc-6216; Santa Cruz) in 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The cells were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488/Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse/anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma). The results were analyzed by direct observation under laser confocal microscopy (LSM 780; Carl Zeiss) and using ZEN 2009 Light Edition software (Carl Zeiss).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 17.0; SPSS Institute). Significant differences between means were assessed by Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way ANOVA. Statistical significance was assumed at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, and all <italic>P</italic>-values are presented as two-tailed results.</p>
