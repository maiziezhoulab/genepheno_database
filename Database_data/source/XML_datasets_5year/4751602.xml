<p>A novel posttranscriptional mechanism for regulating the neuronal protein GAP-43 is reported. The mRNA-binding protein hnRNP-Q1 represses <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA translation by a mechanism involving a 5′ untranslated region G-quadruplex structure, which affects GAP-43 function, as demonstrated by a GAP-43–dependent increase in neurite length and number with hnRNP-Q1 knockdown.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by mRNA-binding proteins is critical for neuronal development and function. hnRNP-Q1 is an mRNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA processing events, including translational repression. hnRNP-Q1 is highly expressed in brain tissue, suggesting a function in regulating genes critical for neuronal development. In this study, we have identified <italic>Growth-associated protein 43</italic> (<italic>Gap-43</italic>) mRNA as a novel target of hnRNP-Q1 and have demonstrated that hnRNP-Q1 represses <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA translation and consequently GAP-43 function. GAP-43 is a neuronal protein that regulates actin dynamics in growth cones and facilitates axonal growth. Previous studies have identified factors that regulate <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA stability and localization, but it remains unclear whether <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA translation is also regulated. Our results reveal that hnRNP-Q1 knockdown increased nascent axon length, total neurite length, and neurite number in mouse embryonic cortical neurons and enhanced Neuro2a cell process extension; these phenotypes were rescued by GAP-43 knockdown. Additionally, we have identified a G-quadruplex structure in the 5′ untranslated region of <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA that directly interacts with hnRNP-Q1 as a means to inhibit <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA translation. Therefore hnRNP-Q1–mediated repression of <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA translation provides an additional mechanism for regulating GAP-43 expression and function and may be critical for neuronal development.</p>

It contains two different RNA-binding domains, three RNA recognition motifs, and a single arginine- and glycine-rich region (RGG box) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Mourelatos <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). hnRNP-Q1 participates in several mRNA processing events, including splicing, editing, transport, translation, and decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Wigington <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Unlike other hnRNP-Q isoforms, hnRNP-Q1 is mainly localized to the cytoplasm, suggesting that functions in mRNA translation, localization, and/or decay regulation are of higher importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Mourelatos <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Supporting this, hnRNP-Q1 has recently been demonstrated to repress <italic>RhoA</italic> mRNA translation and regulate <italic>Cdc42</italic> mRNA localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Xing <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Given the high expression of hnRNP-Q1 in brain, we predict that hnRNP-Q1 posttranscriptionally regulates the expression of many mRNA targets, which are potentially involved in neuronal development and function.</p><p>GAP-43 is a neuronal-specific protein that regulates multiple aspects of neuronal development, plasticity, and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Denny, 2006</xref>). GAP-43 is enriched in axonal growth cones after polarity is established and also accumulates along nascent axons in cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting an important early role for GAP-43 in axon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Goslin <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>). GAP-43 regulates actin dynamics by at least two distinct mechanisms: actin polymerization/depolymerization and sequestering the lipid modulator phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">He <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Laux <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). GAP-43 overexpression is generally associated with increased growth in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aigner <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Donnelly <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Leu <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), and the importance of GAP-43 is demonstrated by impaired neuronal development and axon guidance in GAP-43–deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Donovan <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Shen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">McIlvain <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Strittmatter <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). GAP-43 also plays an important role in neuronal regeneration, with increased GAP-43 expression observed during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Erzurumlu <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Van der Zee <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>) and increased GAP-43 protein levels promoting axon sprouting and regeneration after injury and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Campbell <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Schreyer and Skene, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Andersen and Schreyer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Grasselli <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Allegra Mascaro <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Additionally, GAP-43 is required for proper learning and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Rekart <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Holahan and Routtenberg, 2008</xref>), and altered expression of GAP-43 is linked to brain disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">de la Monte <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Bogdanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Tian <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Zaccaria <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). These critical functions of GAP-43 motivate a better understanding of how the expression of this protein is regulated.</p><p>Precise spatial and temporal control of GAP-43 protein levels is achieved through multiple mechanisms and is critical for GAP-43 function. The <italic>Gap-43</italic> gene is transcribed exclusively in neuronal cells due to a repressive element in its promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Weber and Skene, 1997</xref>) and specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Chiaramello <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Diolaiti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Tedeschi <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA stability is increased by HuD, a neuronal ELAV family mRNA-binding protein, binding the 3′-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Chung <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) and decreased by KSRP, a KH-type splicing regulatory protein, competing with HuD for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Bird <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Also, <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA localization to dorsal root ganglia axons is regulated by the mRNA-binding protein IMP1/ZBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Donnelly <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA translation is also likely regulated as an additional mechanism to control GAP-43 expression, but the factors involved have not been identified. In this paper, we show that hnRNP-Q1 inhibits primary cortical neuron nascent axon length, total neurite length and neurite number, and Neuro2a (N2a) cell process extension by repressing GAP-43 expression. hnRNP-Q1 specifically represses <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA translation, and a G-quadruplex (GQ) structure in the 5′-UTR of the mRNA is involved in the mechanism. Therefore our findings reveal a novel posttranscriptional mechanism for regulating GAP-43 expression that may contribute to the precise control of GAP-43 expression during neuronal development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Two model systems were used for our experiments, the mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2a and primary mouse cortical neurons, as a means to assess multiple aspects of hnRNP-Q1–mediated repression of <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA translation. N2a cells are an ideal neuronal model system, because they are highly amenable to biochemical experiments and can be differentiated into neuron-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Klebe and Ruddle, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Munoz <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Primary cortical neurons were used due to high expression of hnRNP-Q1 in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Mizutani <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Rossoll <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Xing <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Cultured primary cortical neurons differentiate axons and dendrites and undergo neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Kosik and Finch, 1987</xref>), and we have used them previously to examine early stages of axon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Welshhans and Bassell, 2011</xref>).</p><sec><title>Elevated GAP-43 expression in hnRNP-Q1–deficient N2a cells and cortical neurons</title><p>We first sought to determine whether GAP-43 protein levels were affected by hnRNP-Q1 knockdown, because GAP-43 is an important neuronal protein and hnRNP-Q1 is highly expressed in the brain. N2a cells were transfected with hnRNP-Q1 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting sequences in the 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) that are not present in other hnRNP-Q isoforms. Scrambled (Scr) siRNA was used as a control. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates 72 h after transfection revealed that hnRNP-Q1 can be efficiently depleted (siRNA 1 = 0.31-fold, siRNA 2 = 0.44-fold, and siRNA 3 = 0.67-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, GAP-43 protein levels were increased according to the degree of hnRNP-Q1 depletion (siRNA 1 = 2.99-fold, siRNA 2 = 2.30-fold, and siRNA 3 = 1.72-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The levels of the highly homologous proteins hnRNP-R and hnRNP-Q3 and γ-actin protein were not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). hnRNP-Q1 siRNA 1 was used for the remainder of the experiments, because it demonstrated the greatest knockdown. Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine whether hnRNP-Q1 knockdown affects <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA levels. We found that neither <italic>Gap-43</italic> nor <italic>γ-actin</italic> mRNA levels were significantly altered upon hnRNP-Q1 knockdown (1.02-fold and 1.05-fold, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) suggesting that hnRNP-Q1 may regulate GAP-43 expression through a translational mechanism.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Increased GAP-43 protein expression upon hnRNP-Q1 knockdown.

Neurons were electroporated with hnRNP-Q1 #1 or Scr siRNA and Lifeact–green fluorescent protein (GFP) immediately following the dissection and were fixed after 28.5 h in culture. siRNA was used instead of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) due to higher transfection efficiencies and quicker knockdown times, which are required to assess incipient neuron phenotypes. The neurons were then processed for immunofluorescence with GAP-43 and hnRNP-Q1 antibodies, and transfected cells were selected by GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, C and D</xref>). The specificity of the hnRNP-Q1 antibody was verified by immunoblotting N2a cell lysates after overexpressing EGFP-tagged hnRNP-Q1 for ∼16 h (Supplemental Figure 1A). Because GAP-43 is enriched in axonal growth cones after polarity is established, we quantified GAP-43 protein levels in both the cell bodies and nascent axons of these incipient neurons. hnRNP-Q1 knockdown increased GAP-43 protein levels on average by 1.36-fold in cells bodies and by 1.56-fold in nascent axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, E and F</xref>). Plotting hnRNP-Q1 protein levels against GAP-43 protein levels for each cell supports an inverse correlation between hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43 protein levels (Supplemental Figure 1B). hnRNP-Q1 knockdown also did not reduce the ratio of GAP-43 levels in nascent axon/cell body, suggesting that hnRNP-Q1 is not required for GAP-43 protein enrichment in the nascent axon and growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). In fact, the nascent axon/cell body ratio was actually significantly increased upon hnRNP-Q1 knockdown (0.73–0.83, 1.14-fold) suggesting that hnRNP-Q1 negatively regulates GAP-43 levels within the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>An inverse correlation between hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43 protein levels would support our model that hnRNP-Q1 negatively regulates GAP-43 protein expression. Thus we investigated the expression profiles of hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43 in cultured neurons. High-density primary cortical neurons were cultured for 0–21 d, and cell lysates were collected every third day and immunoblotted for hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43. The expression profiles from the time course suggest that hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43 are both developmentally regulated in primary cortical neurons and that these proteins have opposite patterns. hnRNP-Q1 protein levels decreased over time, while GAP-43 protein levels increased, suggesting that the decreasing levels of hnRNP-Q1 may contribute to the increasing levels of GAP-43 in primary cortical neurons (Supplemental Figure 1C). Additionally, GAP-43 and the mRNA-binding protein HuD, a positive regulator of GAP-43 expression, have previously been demonstrated to be enriched in Ammon’s horn as compared with the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Clayton <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Namgung and Routtenberg, 2000</xref>). Therefore we assessed whether hnRNP-Q1, a proposed negative regulator of GAP-43 expression, demonstrated the opposite pattern of expression. The two regions of the hippocampus were dissected from P30 wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Hagihara <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), and the levels of <italic>HuD</italic>, <italic>Gap-43</italic>, and <italic>hnRNP-Q1</italic> mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR due to an inadequate amount of tissue for immunoblotting. As expected, <italic>HuD</italic> and <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNAs were enriched in Ammon’s horn (2.54-fold and 1.65-fold, respectively; Supplemental Figure 1D). However, <italic>hnRNP-Q1</italic> mRNA was not enriched in the Ammon’s horn and is potentially more enriched in the dentate gyrus, suggesting that hnRNP-Q1 expression may contribute to GAP-43 protein expression in vivo in the hippocampus (0.72-fold; Supplemental Figure 1D).</p></sec><sec><title>Elevated GAP-43 expression in hnRNP-Q1–deficient cortical neurons increased neurite length and number</title><p>The role of GAP-43 in promoting axon growth has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aigner <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Donnelly <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Leu <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Therefore we next determined whether elevated GAP-43 protein levels due to hnRNP-Q1 knockdown affect neurite length and number. To investigate whether hnRNP-Q1 knockdown phenotypes were due to increased GAP-43 protein levels, we performed rescue experiments by knocking down GAP-43. GAP-43 knockdown efficiency was tested by transfecting N2a cells with GAP-43 or Scr siRNA and performing an immunoblot analysis of cell lysates after 72 h. GAP-43 protein levels were efficiently knocked down (91% reduction; Supplemental Figure 2A). Therefore, neurons were electroporated with hnRNP-Q1 #1 or Scr siRNA and Lifeact-GFP but also with GAP-43 or Scr siRNA to specifically link any phenotypes to increased GAP-43 protein levels. The neurons were fixed after 28.5 h in culture and processed for immunofluorescence with GAP-43 and hnRNP-Q1 antibodies, and transfected cells were selected by GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Double knockdown of hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43.

The threshold between low and high protein levels for both hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43 was set at 12,500 A.U. (arbitrary units) based the expression plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Analysis of the percent of cells showing each of the three expression patterns illustrates an inverse relationship between hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In control cells, the majority (51.4%) of neurons had low hnRNP-Q1 and low GAP-43 protein levels, presumably due to multiple factors regulating each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). For example, GAP-43 protein turnover may be dynamically regulated, which is supported by the finding that GAP-43 protein is degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">De Moliner <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Therefore steady-state GAP-43 protein levels may not increase in some cells upon hnRNP-Q1 knockdown due to high levels of GAP-43 protein turnover, despite the increased <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA translation rate. Additionally, cells may be lacking sufficient levels of other factors that are required to result in increased GAP-43 protein levels (e.g., HuD to stabilize <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA). Nonetheless, a substantial percentage of cells (35.8%) showed high hnRNP-Q1 and low GAP-43 protein levels under control conditions, consistent with the proposed role of hnRNP-Q1 as a negative regulator of GAP-43 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Depletion of hnRNP-Q1 revealed a marked decrease in cells showing high hnRNP-Q1 and low GAP-43 protein levels (from 35.8 to 4.1%), suggesting removal of GAP-43 repression by hnRNP-Q1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely, knockdown of hnRNP-Q1 resulted in a marked increase in cells with low hnRNP-Q1 and high GAP-43 protein levels (from 4.6 to 27.6%), further suggesting that the elevation in GAP-43 protein levels was directly ­attributed to loss of hnRNP-Q1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The phenotype of high GAP-43 protein levels in hnRNP-Q1–depleted cells (27.6%) was abolished by simultaneous knockdown of GAP-43 (1.6%), demonstrating that GAP-43 can be efficiently depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, knockdown of GAP-43 by itself did not change the negative correlation between hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43 protein levels, wherein a substantial percentage of cells (32.6%) still showed high hnRNP-Q1 and low GAP-43 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, a very small percentage of cells had high hnRNP-Q1 and high GAP-43 protein levels (control: 8.1%; GAP-43: 0.6%; hnRNP-Q1: 7.6%; and hnRNP-Q1 &amp; GAP-43: 3.3%).</p><p>To determine whether elevated GAP-43 protein levels due to hnRNP-Q1 knockdown affect neurite length and number, we specifically analyzed the cells within the population that exhibited the characteristic expression pattern for each condition (highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; the average hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43 protein levels of selected cells are displayed in Supplemental Figure 2B). Shortly after being plated (∼6 h), cultured neurons develop lamellipodia that transform into distinct processes after ∼12 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Dotti <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>). One of these minor processes is specified to become the axon and begins to grow at an accelerated rate as compared with the remaining processes after ∼1–2 d in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Dotti <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>). Therefore the longest neurite after 28.5 h in culture will likely develop into the axon and was called the “nascent axon” in our studies. The total length and number of all neurites was also quantified. Cells with low levels of GAP-43 protein and high levels of hnRNP-Q1 protein were selected in the control conditions (Scr siRNA + Scr siRNA: 35.8% of cells; Scr siRNA + GAP-43 siRNA: 32.6% of cells); cells with low levels of hnRNP-Q1 protein and high levels of GAP-43 protein were selected in the Q1 siRNA + Scr siRNA condition (27.6% of cells; red outline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>); and cells with low levels of both proteins were selected in the Q1 siRNA + GAP-43 siRNA condition (78.8% of cells). Neurons with elevated GAP-43 protein levels following hnRNP-Q1 knockdown correlated with an increased length of the nascent axon by 1.44-fold (31.00 to 44.76 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, A and D</xref>), total length of all the neurites by 1.66-fold (86.11 to 143.12 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, B and E</xref>), and number of neurites per cell by 1.44-fold (4.84 to 6.96 neurites, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, C and F</xref>). Additionally, simultaneously knocking down GAP-43 rescued all three phenotypes back to control levels, which demonstrates that increased GAP-43 protein levels are responsible for the neuritic and axonal phenotypes in hnRNP-Q1–deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, A–F</xref>). The nascent axon length, total neurite length, and neurite number of Q1 siRNA + Scr siRNA cells with low levels of hnRNP-Q1 protein and low levels of GAP-43 protein (60.6% of cells) were also quantified to confirm that GAP-43 is driving the increased neurite growth. The average nascent axon length (1.03-fold, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.9745), total neurite length (0.91-fold, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.8029), and neurite number (0.83-fold, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.3102) were not significantly altered as compared with control Scr siRNA + Scr siRNA cells (unpublished data). These results support our model that increased axon growth in hnRNP-Q1–depleted cells is attributed to elevated GAP-43 expression.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3:</label><caption><p>Increased cortical neuron nascent axon length, total neurite length, and neurite number due to increased GAP-43 protein expression upon hnRNP-Q1 knockdown.

The intensity of these resonances increased upon the addition of KCl, demonstrating that the structure is stabilized by K<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). A mutant <italic>Gap-43</italic> 5′GQ probe (with a linker, 5′-GCGAGCGAGCGAGCGA+GAGC-3′) was also synthesized, in which guanine nucleotides predicted to be engaged in GQ formation were replaced with cytosine nucleotides, and the secondary structure was analyzed by 1D <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy. As expected, the GQ imino proton resonances are no longer present in the 10–12 ppm region in the absence and presence of 150 mM KCl (Supplemental Figure 5C). However, resonances are present in the 12.6–13.4 ppm region that correspond to imino protons involved in G-C Watson-Crick base pairs, consistent with the predicted hairpin structure of the <italic>Gap-43</italic> 5′GQ mutant RNA probe (Supplemental Figure 5, C and D).

The beginning of a second transition is visible above 90°C at high RNA concentrations, likely due to the formation of an alternate intermolecular conformation promoted by high RNA concentrations.

These findings contribute to the growing literature about the role of hnRNP-Q1 in regulating translation. hnRNP-Q1 has previously been demonstrated to repress cap-dependent translation of <italic>RhoA</italic> and <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Xing <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Lyabin <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). However, the specific mechanism of hnRNP-Q1 binding and translation regulation has yet to be uncovered. Here we further identified a predicted GQ sequence in the 5′-UTR of <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA and determined that it folds into a stable, parallel, intramolecular GQ structure. Additionally, this sequence is involved in hnRNP-Q1–mediated translation repression of <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA as demonstrated by AHA pulse labeling and luciferase assays. Furthermore, hnRNP-Q1 appears to bind the 5′GQ with higher affinity than poly(A) sequences, and luciferase assays reveal that the poly(A) tail represses expression to a lesser extent than the 5′GQ, suggesting a novel mechanism. In support of this, we have previously demonstrated that hnRNP-Q1 represses RhoA mRNA translation by binding non-poly(A) sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Xing <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). We have also demonstrated that, as in other GQ mRNA-binding proteins, the hnRNP-Q1 RGG box domain is sufficient for the recognition of the <italic>Gap-43</italic> 5′GQ. Taken together, these results suggest that hnRNP-Q1 is a novel GQ-binding protein and point to a potential mechanism for hnRNP-Q1–mediated translational regulation. GQs proximal to the 5′ cap have previously been shown to inhibit translation by blocking ribosome assembly or scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Bugaut and Balasubramanian, 2012</xref>). Therefore hnRNP-Q1 may bind to the 5′GQ of <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA and prevent ribosome assembly or scanning. hnRNP-Q1 may repress the translation of <italic>YB-1</italic> by a similar mechanism. <italic>YB-1</italic> mRNA is predicted to contain a GQ with a moderately high G-Score in its 5′-UTR region (G-Score = 20, QGRS Mapper [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Kikin <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>]). In contrast, <italic>RhoA</italic> mRNA translation appears to be regulated in a slightly different manner, because the 3′-UTR is sufficient for hnRNP-Q1–mediated translation repression. However, the 3′-UTR of <italic>RhoA</italic> mRNA also contains a predicted GQ with a high G-Score (G-Score = 41, QGRS Mapper [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Kikin <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>]), and 3′-UTR GQs have also been demonstrated to regulate translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Arora and Suess, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Stefanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2015a</xref>). These findings suggest that GQ structures may be the primary interacting motifs for hnRNP-Q1–mediated translational inhibition. Future studies may address this mechanism in more detail, including identifying the steps needed to repress translation. hnRNP-Q1 may modulate translation through a mechanism similar to FMRP, which interacts with mRNA target GQs when it is phosphorylated at a serine residue near the RGG box domain and is dephosphorylated in order to facilitate translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Ceman <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Muddashetty <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our results further reveal a novel function for hnRNP-Q1 to control nascent axon and neurite growth in incipient neurons by repressing <italic>Gap-43</italic> translation. At 28.5 h, in vitro neurons are beginning to polarize but do not demonstrate the stereotypical axonal Tau enrichment and dendritic MAP2 enrichment. These results suggest that hnRNP-Q1 plays an important role in regulating nascent axon outgrowth by modulating GAP-43 expression. Similar phenotypes have been reported upon hnRNP-Q knockdown in primary cortical neurons that have undergone Tau and MAP2 expression polarization (3 and 7 d in vitro) suggesting that hnRNP-Q1 functions to regulate neuron morphology at later stages of neuronal development as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Additionally, we demonstrated that hnRNP-Q1–mediated repression of GAP-43 expression inhibits N2a cell process extension. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chen <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> also reported similar N2a phenotypes upon hnRNP-Q1 knockdown but demonstrated that their N2a and neuron phenotypes were due to reduced Cdc42 and associated-factor mRNA localization. However, GAP-43 has been demonstrated to work upstream of both Cdc42 and RhoA to regulate cell morphology, suggesting that hnRNP-Q1 may affect actin cytoskeleton dynamics through the coordinated posttranscriptional regulation of GAP-43, Cdc42, and RhoA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aarts <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gauthier-Campbell <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). These findings suggest that hnRNP-Q1 likely regulates neuron morphology and function by modulating multiple mRNA targets. In support of this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chen <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> performed a microarray analysis for hnRNP-Q1–interacting mRNAs and determined that hnRNP-Q1 interacts with ∼10% of the mRNAs that were interrogated (2250 mRNAs). Additionally, gene ontology analysis reveals that several of the mRNA targets encode proteins involved in neuron and synapse function, protein synthesis, and cytoskeletal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). These results suggest that hnRNP-Q1 interacts with and potentially regulates the mRNA localization and/or translation of a specific subset of mRNA targets involved in neuronal development and function. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chen <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> identified two six-nucleotide hnRNP-Q1 consensus sequences, which expands the list of hnRNP-Q1 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. hnRNP-Q1 has previously been demonstrated to bind poly(A) RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Mizutani <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Svitkin <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), and our findings demonstrate that it can bind GQ structures. More research is needed to determine whether these different <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements work cooperatively or allow hnRNP-Q1 to perform different functions. For example, mouse <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA also contains multiple consensus sequences and two poly(A) stretches that may potentially bind hnRNP-Q1. Also, whether hnRNP-Q1 regulates different mRNA targets during specific stages of neuronal development has yet to be determined.</p><p>hnRNP-Q1 has also been identified as a component of transport mRNP granules and is localized to both the axons and growth cones of primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bannai <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Kanai <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA has been detected in the axons and growth cones of differentiated PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). These findings suggest that <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA may be locally translated within axonal growth cones to synthesize new GAP-43 protein in response to axon guidance signals. In support of this, GAP-43 knockdown reduces axon length in dorsal root ganglia neurons, and this phenotype can only be rescued by GAP-43 that is locally translated in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Donnelly <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the AU-rich HuD-binding element is also necessary and sufficient to localize <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA to axons, suggesting that HuD and IMP1/ZBP1 work cooperatively to stabilize and localize <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Yoo <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Our results identify a new factor that regulates GAP-43 expression and suggest that HuD, IMP1/ZBP1, and hnRNP-Q1 may form a complex with <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA, enabling the precise control of GAP-43 expression. GAP-43 is also required for netrin-1–induced outgrowth and guidance of neocortical callosal axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Shen and Meiri, 2013</xref>), suggesting that netrin-1 modulates GAP-43 function and may increase GAP-43 expression. Interestingly, netrin-1 induces local translation of <italic>β-actin</italic> mRNA in an IMP1/ZBP1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Welshhans and Bassell, 2011</xref>), implying that netrin-1 may also play a role in regulating the <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA, HuD, IMP1/ZBP1, and hnRNP-Q1 complex. Future studies may address the interplay between HuD, IMP1/ZBP1, and hnRNP-Q1; determine whether these factors regulate GAP-43 expression locally in axonal growth cones; and investigate the role of netrin-1 on this complex. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for regulating GAP-43 expression and further support the idea that a complex of proteins functions to spatially and temporally regulate GAP-43 expression, enabling the growth cone to respond to specific cues during development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and siRNA</title><p>Three siRNAs targeting the 3′-UTR of mouse <italic>hnRNP-Q1</italic> mRNA, one targeting the 3′-UTR of mouse <italic>Gap-43</italic> mRNA, and two Scr sequences were purchased from Eurofins (Huntsville, AL) and annealed according to the manufacturer’s directions.

where <italic>A</italic><italic><sub>U</sub></italic> and <italic>A</italic><italic><sub>F</sub></italic> represent the absorbance of the unfolded and native GQ RNA structure, respectively, and <italic>R</italic> is the universal gas constant.</p></sec><sec><title>AHA pulse labeling</title><p>Cells were transfected with 40 pmol hnRNP-Q1 #1 or Scr siRNA 72 h before being labeled. The cells were washed with room temperature 1× PBS and incubated with DMEM without methionine (DMEM-Met; Life Technologies) for 1 h at 37°C; this was followed by incubation with 100 μg AHA (Life Technologies) or 100 μg AHA + 40 μM anisomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM-Met for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were then washed with cold 1× PBS and lysed in 200 μl of Click-iT lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS) with 1× protease inhibitor on ice. The lysates were sonicated, and 30 μg protein from each condition was used in the Click-iT reaction. The Click-iT protein reaction buffer kit (Life Technologies) and 40 μM biotin alkyne (Life Technologies) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the Click-iT reaction. After the Click-iT reaction, 180 μl of each condition was diluted with 820 μl RIPA buffer with 1× protease inhibitor (IP buffer) to stop the Click-iT reaction. GAP-43 antibody (1:50; Abcam) was added to each sample, and the tubes were ­rotated at 4°C for 2 h. Protein G agarose beads (Roche) were resuspended in IP buffer and added to each tube, and tubes were rotated at 4°C for 1 h. After washing, the pellet, a 1% input sample, and a 5% input sample were prepared for immunoblotting for each condition. Newly translated proteins and total GAP-43 protein were detected with IRDye 680LT streptavidin (1:1000; Li-Cor), anti-GAP-43 (1:5000; Abcam), and IRDye 800CW donkey anti-mouse (1:20,000; Li-Cor). α-Tubulin (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich) was also detected as a loading control.</p><p>FL mouse <italic>Gap-43</italic> cDNA with and without the 5′GQ sequence was subcloned into 3×Flag-mCherry in the following order: <italic>Gap-43</italic> 5′-UTR–3×Flag-mCherry–<italic>Gap-43</italic> coding region–<italic>Gap-43</italic> 3′-UTR. AHA-labeling experiments were performed as above except for the following. Samples of 2 μg of the 3×Flag-mCherry-GAP-43 constructs were transfected ∼56 h after siRNA transfection and ∼16 h before AHA labeling, and 100 μg protein from each condition was used in the Click-iT reaction. Anti-Flag agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were resuspended in IP buffer and added to each condition, and the tubes were rotated at 4°C for 2 h. Newly translated proteins and total 3×Flag-mCherry-GAP-43 protein were detected with IRDye 680LT streptavidin (1:1000; Li-Cor), anti-Flag (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich), and IRDye 800CW donkey anti-mouse (1:20,000; Li-Cor). α-Tubulin (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich) was also detected as a loading control. N2a cells were transfected with 500 ng of the 3×Flag-mCherry-GAP-43 constructs for ∼16 h to determine whether deleting the 5′GQ sequence causes GAP-43 to have increased expression as detected by immunoblot with anti-Flag (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec><title>Proximity ligation</title><p>Cells were transfected with 40 pmol hnRNP-Q1 #1 or Scr siRNA 72 h before labeling. The cells were washed with warm DMEM and incubated with DMEM with or without 91 μM puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 37°C. Excess puromycin was removed by incubating with cold extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM KCl, 0.015% digitonin) for 2 min followed by wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM KCl) for 2 min. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1× PBS for 10 min, washed with 1× PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS, and washed with Tris-glycine buffer. Cells were blocked in 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature (1:1000 GAP-43 [Abcam] + 1:200 puromycin [Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA] or 1:6000 α-tubulin [Abcam] + 1:300 puromycin [Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank]). Cells were then washed with 1× PBS, and Duolink proximity ligations were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were analyzed with Imaris (Bitplane). Cell volume was measured by creating a contour surface, and puncta were selected, and their volume and intensity were measured by setting a threshold.</p></sec><sec><title>Luciferase assays</title><p>The mouse <italic>Gap-43</italic> 5′-UTR with and without the 5′GQ sequence or the just 5′GQ sequence (by annealing primers, forward: 5′-AGCTTT​C​A​A​T​C​T​TGGGAGGGAGGGAGGGA​T​C​A​A​T​C​T​TC-3′ and reverse: 5′-CATGGAAGATTGATCCCTCCCTCCCTCCCAAGATTGAA-3′) were subcloned into pGL3 (Promega) upstream of the firefly luciferase coding region with the <italic>Hin</italic>dIII and <italic>Nco</italic>I sites. Cells were transfected with 40 pmol hnRNP-Q1 #1 or Scr siRNA, 500 ng firefly luciferase construct, and 25 ng <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase construct (pRL-CMV; Promega). After 72 h, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in fresh DMEM. A measure of 50 μl of cell lysate in triplicate was processed for luciferase activity with the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and a Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner BioSystems/Promega). <italic>Renilla</italic> luminescence was used as an internal control.</p></sec><sec><title>Normalization and statistics</title><p>hnRNP-Q1 and GAP-43 knockdown immunoblot data were normalized to the internal control α-tubulin and graphed relative to the control condition. hnRNP-Q1 knockdown qRT-PCR data were run in duplicate, and average values were graphed relative to the control condition. Hippocampal qRT-PCR data were normalized to the internal control <italic>β-actin</italic> and graphed relative to the control conditions. hnRNP-Q1 knockdown immunofluorescence and neurite length and number data were normalized to the average control value. The 3×Flag-mCherry-hu hnRNP-Q1 immunoprecipitation qRT-PCR data were first normalized to the input and graphed relative to <italic>γ-actin</italic> mRNA levels. AHA pulse-labeling data were normalized to the internal control α-tubulin and graphed relative to the control condition. Proximity ligation data were normalized to the average control value. Firefly luminescence values were normalized to the internal control <italic>Renilla</italic> luminescence and graphed relative to the control condition. Bar graphs represent the mean ± the SEM.
