<abstract>
<p>The pH-dependent partitioning of chemotherapeutic drugs is a fundamental yet understudied drug distribution mechanism that may underlie the low success rates of current approaches to counter multidrug resistance (MDR). This mechanism is influenced by the hypoxic tumour microenvironment and results in selective trapping of weakly basic drugs into acidified compartments such as the extracellular environment. Here we report that hypoxia not only leads to acidification of the tumour microenvironment but also induces endosome hyperacidification. The acidity of the vesicular lumen, together with the alkaline pH of the cytoplasm, gives rise to a strong intracellular pH gradient that drives intravesicular drug trapping and chemoresistance. Endosome hyperacidification is due to the relocalization of the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger isoform 6 (NHE6) from endosomes to the plasma membrane, an event that involves binding of NHE6 to the activated protein kinase C–receptor for activated C kinase 1 complex. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of hypoxia-induced MDR that involves the aberrant intracellular distribution of NHE6.</p>

<body>
<p>A major challenge in treating cancer is resistance to therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. A mainstay of therapy for the management of many cancers includes chemotherapy regimens based on anthracyclines or anthracycline analogues (doxorubicin (Dox), daunorubicin (Dnr) or mitoxantrone (Mtx))<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Yet, the response rates are suboptimal and very few effective therapeutic options are currently available to treat patients who failed to respond to anthracycline treatments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
<p>The success of chemotherapy depends on the ability of the drug to accumulate in the cellular compartment where its target is located (e.g. nucleus). Hence, tumours use various mechanisms to escape the deleterious effect of cytotoxic drugs. Among these, primary or acquired multidrug resistance (MDR) remains the primary hurdle to curative cancer therapy. Although drug resistance is most often attributed to genetic alterations, one major factor contributing to drug resistance is the physical tumour microenvironment (pO<sub>2</sub> and pH) that has consistently been shown to impede drug accumulation in cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. MDR is a complex and multifactorial process with upregulation of cell-surface efflux pumps (such as ATP-binding cassette transporter family of p-glycoprotein and MDR-associated proteins) being the most studied and clinically tested aspect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Cells adapted to a hypoxic and acidic microenvironment <italic>in vitro</italic> display upregulated activity of p-glycoprotein, which is thought to contribute to drug resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, results from clinical trials targeting these transporters have been so far rather disappointing and it is clear that more detailed knowledge about the causes and mechanisms of drug resistance are needed to find new ways to counter MDR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates that sequestration of anticancer drugs in intracellular vesicles outside their targeted compartments contributes significantly to the MDR phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. One mechanism involved in this process is the pH-dependent drug partitioning within cells caused by a direct effect of pH gradients on drug distribution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. This model predicts that weakly basic chemotherapeutic drugs, that include anthracyclines, will concentrate in acidic compartments such as intracellular vesicles where they will be trapped in their protonated, membrane-impermeant, form<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Given that most commonly used anticancer drugs have nuclear targets, such sequestration into vesicles will not only result in insufficient drug accumulation at the target site but will also increase drug extrusion through exocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Therefore, pH-dependent alterations in intracellular drug distribution is an important fundamental mechanism associated with drug resistance, but surprisingly little is known about the molecular regulators of this process.</p>
<p>To maintain pH homeostasis, cells utilize an array of acid–base modulators, such as the sodium/proton exchangers (NHEs) that are critical regulators of pH within the cell and the extracellular microenvironment. Nine NHE isoforms have been described in human<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 1–5 (NHE1–5) are located at the plasma membrane, whereas Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 6 (NHE6) and isoform 9 (NHE9) are associated with sorting and recycling endosomes, and NHE7 and NHE8 with the trans- and mid-trans-Golgi stacks, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. By facilitating proton efflux, organellar NHEs are thought to counteract the acidity generated by vacuolar (V)-ATPase, thereby limiting luminal acidification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Altered expression or mutations in the SLC9A6 or SLC9A9 genes encoding NHE6 and NHE9, respectively, have been associated with neurological diseases in human such as the X-linked Christianson syndrome, familial autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Upregulation of NHE9 has been recently linked to tyrosine kinase inhibitors resistance in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and glioblastomas as well as tumour growth and chemoresistance in glioblastomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Although these findings highlight the role of NHE9 in various cancers, the potential involvement of NHE6 in cancer progression or treatment, in particular pH-mediated chemoresistance, remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia promotes therapy resistance to weak base chemotherapeutics through pH disturbance of intravesicular compartments. We have previously reported that hypoxia promoted NHE1 exchanger activity, resulting in a reversal of pH gradient across the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Herein, we present evidence that hypoxia also triggers acidification of the endosomal compartments that leads to exacerbation of the vesicular pH gradient. Mechanistically, hypoxia-induced acidification in endosomal pH is due to mislocalization of the NHE6 exchanger because of its enhanced binding to receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) through a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent mechanism. We further show that a peptide encompassing the RACK1–NHE6 interface reverses alterations in endosomal pH and sensitizes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> cancer cells to weak base chemotherapeutics. We thereby propose a novel mechanism of MDR that involves translocation of NHE6 from endosomes to the plasma membrane with the consequence of pH-dependent resistance to weak base chemotherapeutic drugs.</p>

<title>Hypoxia induces pH-dependent Dox resistance</title>
<p>To assess the role of pH in hypoxia-induced resistance to anthracyclines, the human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cell lines were incubated in the presence or absence of the commonly used anthracycline drugs, Dox, Dau and the anthracycline analogue drug, Mtx, under hypoxic (1% O<sub>2</sub>) or normoxic (21% O<sub>2</sub>) conditions for 72 h. Cell viability was then assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In MDA-MB-231 cells, hypoxia increased resistance towards the chemotherapeutic drugs by 5.5-, 5.0- and 4.7-fold for Dox, Mtx and Dau, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Similar changes in cell viability were observed in HT-1080 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). By their biochemical properties, anthracyclines and their analogues are sensitive to pH and are preferentially localized in acidic environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. To assess whether pH alterations would affect hypoxia-induced resistance, the vacuolar pH-alkalizing drug chloroquine (Cq) and the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (Baf) were used in the presence of the model anthracycline drug, Dox, in viability assays. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 and HT-1080 cells with vacuolar pH-neutralizing agents prevented drug resistance induced by hypoxia with effective concentration values similar to those observed under normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c,e,f</xref>). These results were confirmed using direct cell counting of viable cells using the Trypan blue exclusion method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g–j</xref>). Therefore, hypoxia promotes cell resistance to anthracycline drugs that can be prevented by pH neutralization.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Hypoxia promotes Dox sequestration within endosomes</title>
<p>Given the resensitizing impact of pH neutralizers on hypoxia-induced Dox resistance and the fact that intracellular anthracycline distribution was shown to depend on pH gradients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, we assessed whether the cellular distribution of Dox was influenced by hypoxia. We took advantage of the native red fluorescence property of Dox that allows monitoring of drug partitioning by fluorescence confocal microscopy in living cells. Consistent with the fact that anthracyclines target topoisomerase II, we observed a predominant accumulation of Dox in the nucleus of normoxic MDA-MB-231 or HT-1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). When cells were incubated under hypoxic conditions, Dox localization in the nucleus was significantly decreased, whereas fluorescence was increased within perinuclear vesicles. Costaining with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated transferrin (Tfn) indicated that a large proportion of these vesicles corresponded to early and recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a–d</xref>). The increase in intravesicular Dox localization was not associated with an increase in total number of endosomes or lysosomes per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Incubation of the cells in the presence of the pH-neutralizing agents (Cq and Baf) abolished hypoxia-induced Dox sequestration within endosomes and restored the preferential accumulation of the drug in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g–j</xref>). We concluded that hypoxia-induced resistance to Dox is related to drug sequestration within endosomal/recycling vesicles in a pH-dependent manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Dox sequestration is linked to endosome hyperacidification</title>
<p>The finding that the increased endosomal sequestration of Dox was pH dependent led us to investigate the influence of hypoxia on the pH of endosomal compartments. To do so, we designed an optimized dual ratiometric approach that uses the pH-sensing probes 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (HPTS) and seminaphtharhodafluor-1 (SNARF-1) to measure endosomal–lysosomal pH (pH<sub>e/l</sub>) and cytosolic pH (pH<sub>c</sub>), respectively, in living cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. After a 16 h incubation of MDA-MB-231 or HT-1080 cells with HPTS, the dye was taken up by pinocytosis, and compartmentalized inside endosomal and lysosomal vesicles with a preferential localization within endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). This was shown by the percentage of colocalization with the endosome marker Tfn (∼60–70%) compared to the lysosomal dye lysotracker (∼20–30%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). To assess the role of hypoxia in pH<sub>e/l</sub>, we performed a time-course study of pH<sub>e/l</sub> measurement in cells incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Data showed that under normoxic conditions, the pH<sub>e/l</sub> in MDA-MB-231 and HT-1080 cells were mildly acidic with pH values of 6.38±0.17 and 6.62±0.30, respectively. Hypoxia induced a hyperacidification of the vesicles with a decrease in pH<sub>e/l</sub> reaching 5.77±0.15 for MDA-MB-231 cells and 5.80±0.10 for HT-1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). To further detail the effects of hypoxia on endosomal pH, cells were colabelled with fluorophore-conjugated Tfn and the pH of early and recycling endosomes was determined. Interestingly, Tfn-positive endosomes were significantly more acidic under hypoxic conditions as compared to normoxia, with a pH change of 0.4 and 0.6 pH units for MDA-MB-231 and HT-1080 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g,h</xref>). Conversely, and as expected, hypoxia led to an increase in pH<sub>c</sub>, which was prevented by the NHE1 inhibitor, EIPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i,j</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Cytosol alkalinization and endosome acidification resulted in an exacerbation of the pH gradient across the endosomal membranes (ΔpH) with a difference of 0.73 and 1.03 pH units for MDA-MB-231 and HT-1080 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). As expected, hypoxia-induced intravesicular acidification was prevented by the use of the pH-neutralizing agents Cq or Baf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2k,l</xref>). Taken together, the data indicate that hypoxia leads to alterations in intracellular pH homeostasis resulting in an increase of the pH gradient across the endosomal membranes, a finding that is related to the observed Dox compartmentalization within acidified endosomes and Dox resistance.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>NHE6 delocalization triggers endosome hyperacidification</title>
<p>We next investigated the mechanisms that could account for endosome acidification in hypoxia. A few proteins have been reported to be involved in maintaining endosomal pH homeostasis. These include the V-ATPase, chloride channels and the newly described organellar NHE6, which is predominantly located at early endosomes, and NHE-9, which is associated at recycling and late endosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Given that these NHE isoforms are thought to be responsible for removing protons from the endosome lumen, thereby preventing excess acidification due to V-ATPase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, we sought to evaluate their potential contribution to hypoxia-induced endosome acidification. Silencing of NHE6 in HT-1080 or MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in hyperacidification of the intravesicular compartment to a level similar to that induced by hypoxia, whereas depletion of the NHE9 isoform had no significant impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a–e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,c</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of NHE6 increased the pH of intracellular vesicles and blocked the acidification induced by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). NHE6 knockdown in normoxic cells was also associated with increased sequestration of Dox within endosomes in HT-1080 (∼20%, shScrambled versus ∼45%, shNHE6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>) or MDA-MB-231 cells (∼10%, shScrambled versus ∼74%, shNHE6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>), an event that correlated with a 2.4-fold increase in cell resistance to Dox reaching half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values similar to the ones observed under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). In contrast, NHE9 silencing did not significantly affect Dox sequestration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>) or cell sensitivity to Dox (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). These findings indicate that among the two endosome-located NHE isoforms, only depletion of NHE6 influences Dox sequestration in the endosomal compartment, an observation associated with drug resistance.</p>
<p>Because NHE6 is known to recycle between intravesicular compartments and the plasma membrane and interference with NHE6 trafficking or loss of the protein resulted in hyperacidification of the endosomal compartment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, we sought to determine whether NHE6 compartmentalization was altered by hypoxia. In normoxic cells, NHE6 strongly colocalized with the early endosomal markers EEA1 (∼62%) and early and recycling endosomal marker Tfn (∼76%), but not with the late endosomal–lysosomal marker Rab7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Using biotinylated cells to assess levels of NHE6 associated with the plasma membrane, we also observed that a small percentage of NHE6 (∼10% in MDA-MB-231 cells; ∼9% in HT-1080 cells) was located at the plasma membrane under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a–c</xref>). These results confirm that under normoxia, NHE6 is mainly localized at early and recycling endosomes with low levels also found at the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, following a 4 h incubation period under hypoxic conditions, the proportion of NHE6 at the plasma membrane was increased threefold in MDA-MB-231 cells and fourfold in HT-1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a–c</xref>). This increase was not associated with induction of NHE6 mRNA or protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d–g</xref>). In addition, incubation of HT-1080 cells under hypoxic conditions for 24 h resulted in a similar increase in NHE6 distribution to the plasma membrane as compared to the shorter (4 h) incubation time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Re-exposure of the cells to ambient oxygen levels reduced plasma membrane NHE6 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>), suggesting that the mobilization of NHE6 to the plasma membrane is a reversible event.</p>
<p>Costaining with EEA1 indicated that the increased localization of NHE6 at the plasma membrane was associated with a 1.8- and 2.3-fold reduction in its localization at the EEA1<sup>+</sup>-endosomal compartment in MDA-MB-231 and HT-1080 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h–j</xref>). These data suggest that the effects of hypoxia on Dox sequestration and cell resistance were related to the redistribution of NHE6 from endosomes to the plasma membrane, a mechanism that leads to hyperacidification of the endosomal lumen.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>RACK1–PKC–NHE6 axis regulates Dox resistance in hypoxia</title>
<p>RACK1 is a scaffold protein that regulates plasma-membrane expression of various receptors and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers and RACK1 has also been reported to be associated with chemoresistance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. These reports prompted us to explore the potential involvement of RACK1 in the plasma membrane accumulation of NHE6. Co-immunoprecipitation assays consistently showed that incubation of HT-1080 cells under hypoxia increased the interaction of RACK1 with NHE6 as early as 1 h after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). To address the potential link between RACK1–NHE6 binding and NHE6 accumulation at the plasma membrane, we used biotin-labelled RACK1-depleted (short interfering RNA (siRNA)) cells. RACK1 knockdown resulted in a complete blockade of hypoxia-induced NHE6 relocalization from EEA1<sup>+</sup> endosomes to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b–d</xref>). Interestingly, RACK1 depletion also restored normal endosomal pH and prevented the sequestration of Dox within the endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e–g</xref>).</p>
<p>RACK1 was initially characterized as an intracellular receptor for activated PKC and PKC association has been shown to promote the interaction with transmembrane receptors such as CFTR, AR and PDE4D5 resulting in modulation of their stability and activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. We thus investigated whether PKC was involved in hypoxia-induced NHE6–RACK1 interaction.</p>
<p>To first show that PKC is activated by hypoxia, we used a phospho-(Ser) PKC substrate Ab in western blotting of total cell lysates from cells incubated under hypoxic conditions for various time points. Results indicated that hypoxia rapidly increases the phosphorylation of intracellular PKC substrates in HT-1080 and MDA-MB-231 cells with maximal effects observed at 1 and 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation assays using HT-1080 cells resulted in detection of PKC in the RACK1 immunoprecipitate only in cells treated with the PKC activator phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) or cells incubated under hypoxic conditions, suggesting that RACK1 interacts with activated PKC in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Treatment of the cells with PDBu promoted the association of NHE6 with RACK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>) and the relocalization of NHE6 from endosomes to the plasma membrane under normoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). In contrast, inhibition of PKC with GF109203X<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> blocked hypoxia-induced NHE6 relocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>), indicating that the plasma membrane mobilization of NHE6 in hypoxia is associated with PKC activation. Consistent with this interpretation, PKC inhibition allowed partial recovery of normal pH values under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>) and promoted the accumulation of Dox in the nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h</xref>). These results suggest that the increased binding of NHE6 to RACK1 occurs through a PKC-dependent mechanism and that this event regulates the delocalization of NHE6 under hypoxia resulting in changes in endosomal pH and drug sequestration.</p>

<title>NHE6–RACK1 blockade partially restores Dox sensitivity</title>
<p>The middle portion (positions 527–588) of the NHE6 cytoplasmic tail has previously been reported to interact with RACK1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Based on this information, we generated stable HT-1080 cells expressing the NHE6<sup>527–588</sup> fragment or a scrambled counterpart. Results from co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that ectopic expression of the NHE6<sup>527–588</sup> sequence, but not the control peptide sequence, prevented hypoxia-induced interaction of NHE6 with RACK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Furthermore, expression of NHE6<sup>527–588</sup> in cells greatly impaired hypoxia-induced NHE6 relocalization from endosomes to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), intravesicular hyperacidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>), and Dox accumulation within endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). In addition, results from cell viability assays indicated that overexpression of the NHE6<sup>527–588</sup> fragment did not change the sensitivity of the cells to Dox under normoxic conditions but a 2.8-fold increase in drug sensitivity was observed in cells exposed to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate the usefulness of the NHE6<sup>527–588</sup> sequence in blocking hypoxia-induced NHE6–RACK1 interaction and the ensuing molecular events. They also provide further evidence to support the role of NHE6–RACK1 interactions in hypoxia-regulated Dox resistance in cancer cells.</p>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicated that the interaction between RACK1 and NHE6 contributes to intrinsic Dox resistance in hypoxic cancer cells. To determine whether these observations were of relevance to tumour therapy <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used an <italic>ex ovo</italic> chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) xenograft model in live chicken embryos<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. MDA-MB-231 or HT-1080 cells, or cells expressing either the NHE6<sup>527–588</sup> competing fragment or its scrambled counterpart, were inoculated onto the CAM of 9-day-old chick embryos. After allowing 3 days for cells to engraft, tumours were treated with Dox or PBS. After 6 days, chick embryos were killed and tumours were removed for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). To first ascertain that tumours implanted in CAM developed hypoxia, total mRNA was extracted from tumours generated by untransfected HT-1080 cells and gene expression of the hypoxic markers CA9, GLUT1 and MCT4 was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Compared to HT-1080 cells cultured under normoxic conditions, tumour xenografts showed a 5.6-, 3.9- and 4.2-fold increase in CA9, GLUT1 and MCT4 gene expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). In addition, CA9 immunostaining in frozen tumour sections generally colocated with regions of binding of the hypoxic marker, pimonidazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>), indicating the presence of hypoxic areas in xenograft tumours developed in the CAM assay. Of note, CA9 displayed greater areas of staining, consistent with earlier reports showing differences between the pO2 dependency of 2-nitroimidazole binding and CA9 protein expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Dose–response Dox treatment indicated that tumour growth was significantly reduced in HT-1080 and MDA-MB-231 cells using 2 and 5 μM of Dox, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d,e</xref>). At lower concentrations (0.5 μM for HT-1080 cells and 1 μM for MDA-MB-231 cells), tumour growth was unaffected. Treatment of NHE6<sup>527–588</sup><bold>-</bold>overexpressing HT-1080 or MDA-MB-231 tumour xenografts with these suboptimal concentrations of Dox lead to a small but significant decrease in tumour volume compared to xenografts overexpressing a control peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8f–h</xref>). These observations indicate that blockade of NHE6–RACK1 interaction improved sensitivity of solid tumours to Dox treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ability of hypoxic tumour cells to escape chemotherapy through a mechanism that involves pH-dependent drug partitioning within the acidified extracellular microenvironment has been known for several decades and various inhibitors of plasma membrane proton pumps and exchangers are currently being evaluated to sensitize human solid tumours to anticancer drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Our results uncovered a novel and complementary mechanism through which hypoxia induces drug resistance in cancer cells by regulating pH-dependent drug partitioning within intracellular compartments. We showed that the endosomal NHE6 exchanger induced weak base chemotherapeutic drug resistance when it is relocated to the plasma membrane of hypoxic cancer cells. Using a blocking peptide approach, we were able to prevent the plasma membrane mobilization of NHE6, by reducing its binding to the scaffold RACK1, leading to the reversal of endosome hyperacidification and cancer cell sensitization to Dox.</p>
<p>A predominant hallmark of hypoxic tumours is the acidification of the extracellular microenvironment and the alkalinization of the tumour cells because of the pathological regulation of ion dynamic across the plasma membrane. This resulted in an acid-outside plasmalemmal pH gradient (reversed pH gradient) mostly driven by the increased expression and/or activation of plasma-membrane ion exchangers and transporters such as the NHE1, carbonic anhydrase-9 and monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Such plasmalemmal pH gradient is widely known to act as a physical barrier for cellular uptake of the most currently used weak base chemotherapeutics such as anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids. Herein, incubation of HT-1080 cells in media of different pHs indicates that extracellular acidification indeed reduces the uptake of the anthracycline drug Dox as observed by the decrease in Dox fluorescence intensity of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Several strategies are now being developed to exploit this pH difference for the treatment of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Among these, the use of proton transport inhibitors such as cariporide and other potent NHE1 inhibitors of the amiloride or non-amiloride series, alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy, have been proposed to be a promising avenue for improving cancer treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Some efficacy has been demonstrated with these inhibitors in cellular and preclinical models, although with mixed results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Herein, we provide evidence that in addition to acidification of the extracellular microenvironment, a brief exposure of cancer cells to hypoxic conditions triggered hyperacidification of the endosomal compartment. The acidity of the endosomal lumen, together with alkalinization of the cytosol, triggered by proton efflux across the plasma membrane, resulted in a strong vesicular pH gradient that promoted intravesicular accumulation of weakly basic drugs and cell resistance. From the standpoint of the pH-dependent drug partitioning model, our findings mean that current therapies aimed at blocking proton efflux across the plasma membrane of hypoxic cancer cells should increase the intracellular levels of weak base drugs, which will be readily trapped and sequestered into acidified endosomal compartments, hence compromising therapeutic efficiency.</p>
<p>Another therapeutic strategy that could lead to similar intracellular drug accumulation and trapping is the blockade of MDR protein activity. Various inhibitors of MDR proteins are currently being evaluated to circumvent drug resistance. Third-generation p-glycoprotein inhibitors such as tariquidar have high potency and specificity, over the first class inhibitors. However, results from clinical trials have shown limited success in restoring Dox sensitivity in women with stage III–IV breast carcinomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Here we show that among the cell lines used, only HT-1080 cells express detectable levels of p-glycoprotein. Confocal microscopy analysis of p-glycoprotein staining in HT-1080 cell line indicates that the protein does not colocalize with EEA1<sup>+</sup> endosomes or LAMP1<sup>+</sup> lysosomes under normoxic or hypoxic conditions data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a–e</xref>), suggesting that this transporter is not a key component of endosomal Dox sequestration under acute hypoxia. Of note, a small but significant increases in <italic>MDR1</italic> mRNA expression was observed after 8 h incubation in low O<sub>2</sub>, which is consistent with a recent report showing that hypoxia can rapidly promote p-glycoprotein expression in laryngeal cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. Even though p-glycoprotein is unlikely to play a direct role in endosomal–lysosomal Dox distribution in acute hypoxia, we cannot exclude the potential contribution of p-glycoprotein in Dox distribution under sustained hypoxia as it is the case in solid tumours. Based on data reported here, it would be of interest to investigate whether inhibition of MDR proteins or restoration of plasmalemmal pH gradient, concomitant with manipulation of the endosomal pH gradient, would improve distribution and efficacy of weak base drugs by depriving hypoxic tumours of both drug resistance strategies. In this context, various ways to disrupt or neutralize intravesicular pH gradients have been proposed. These include photoacoustic disruption or alkalinization of intracellular acidic vesicles with Cq or V-ATPase inhibitors and such strategies have been shown to reverse Dox resistance <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. Even though the toxicity of V-ATPase inhibitor used in this study (Baf) prohibits its <italic>in vivo</italic> and clinical applications, our ability to partially reverse drug resistance induced by hypoxia <italic>in vitro</italic> and in the context of solid tumours using blocking peptides that specifically interfere with the molecular events involved in endosome acidification indicates that such mechanism of drug sequestration can be tested therapeutically through precise intervention.</p>
<p>Another important observation of our study is the finding that the mobilization of NHE6 to the plasma membrane is a critical step in the promotion of Dox resistance in hypoxic cells. Although the overexpression of NHE9 in glioblastoma and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma has previously been shown to be involved in chemoresistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, in this study knockdown of NHE9 had no significant impact on endosome pH homeostasis, intracellular Dox partitioning or Dox resistance. The discrepancy between our data and those reported previously may include differences in the physicochemical properties of the chemotherapeutic drugs tested and the possibility that NHE9 expression is restricted to a small endosome population, so it may negligibly be involved in pH homeostasis of cells that do not overexpress this isoform.</p>
<p>Whereas the majority of NHE6 is normally distributed in recycling compartments, only a small amount of NHE6 is found at the plasma membrane under basal conditions (∼10%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. NHE6 has been shown to be translocated to the plasma membrane in adipocytes upon insulin stimulation, or in osteoblasts during bone mineralization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. However, the detailed mechanisms responsible for the trafficking of NHE6 are not yet understood. Unlike NHE1, little is known about NHE6-interacting proteins. Two proteins, the AT2 receptor and RACK1, have been identified as direct NHE6-binding partners<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. Changes in cellular levels of RACK1 have been shown to affect the plasma membrane localization of NHE6 as well as endosomal pH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In this report, we observed that the interaction of NHE6 with RACK1 and PKC was markedly increased by hypoxia. Such interaction explains the raise of NHE6 at the plasma membrane since RACK1 knockdown, modulation of PKC activity, or interference with RACK1–NHE6 binding greatly affected hypoxia-induced NHE6 plasma membrane mobilization. Modulation of either PKC activity or RACK1–NHE6 interaction also recovered normal endosomal pH, and restored weak base drug sensitivity in hypoxic cells indicating that plasma-membrane NHE6 mobilization represents an important mechanism by which hypoxia drives drug resistance.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings uncovered a mechanism by which hypoxia induced pH-dependent drug partitioning within hyperacidified endosomal compartments that involves a RACK–PKC-dependent enhanced sequestration of NHE6 at the plasma membrane. Although future studies are required to determine whether this mechanism operates in patient’s tumours, our <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis showing weak base drug sensitization using the RACK1–NHE6 competing peptide suggests that the increased endosomal pH gradient occurs in the context of hypoxic solid tumours. Therapies directed against such a tumour microenvironment-driven mechanism may have interesting clinical potential since they should enhance drug toxicity in hypoxic cells, which are the ones related to metastasis and cancer recurrence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>, while sparing normal tissues.</p>
