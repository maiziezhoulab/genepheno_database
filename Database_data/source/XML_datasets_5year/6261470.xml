<p id="P3">Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multi-system developmental disorder caused by mutations in the <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> genes, whose protein products are negative regulators of mTOR complex 1 signaling. Hallmark pathologies of TSC are cortical tubers; regions of dysmorphic, disorganized neurons and glia in the cortex that are linked to epileptogenesis. To determine the developmental origin of tuber cells, we established human cellular models of TSC by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing of <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Using heterozygous <italic>TSC2</italic> hPSCs with a conditional mutation in the functional allele, we show that mosaic biallelic inactivation during neural progenitor expansion is necessary for the formation of dysplastic cells and increased glia production in three-dimensional cortical spheroids. Our findings provide support for the second-hit model of cortical tuber formation and suggest that variable developmental timing of somatic mutations could contribute to the heterogeneity in the neurological presentation of TSC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a developmental disorder caused by mutations in the <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. TSC affects multiple systems causing non-malignant hamartomas that can affect the skin, heart, kidney, lung, and brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Among the most debilitating aspects of TSC are the neurological symptoms. Approximately 90% of TSC patients have epilepsy that begins in infancy and early childhood and in many cases becomes intractable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder occur in about half of TSC patients, with other psychiatric conditions prevalent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The origins of the neurological aspects of TSC are not well understood; however, patients present with characteristic pathologies, called cortical tubers, which are macroscopic regions of disorganized and dysmorphic cells in the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Tubers and perituberal cortex often become epileptic foci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and increased tuber load is correlated with more severe epilepsy and cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Work from mouse models indicates that loss of Tsc1 or Tsc2 from cortical progenitor cells results in altered neuronal differentiation, morphology, and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, consistent with histological observations in patient tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, bona fide tubers are not found in rodent models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This may be a result of differences between mouse and human cortical development. Human cortical neurogenesis occurs over a longer time period (about 140 days in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> compared with 8 days in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>), requires many more cell divisions, and exhibits unique proliferative zones and progenitor cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, an experimental system that recapitulates early human cortical development is needed to understand the molecular and cellular origins of tubers.</p>
<p id="P6">At the biochemical level, the protein products of <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> form a heterodimeric protein complex that is an essential negative regulator of mTOR complex 1 signaling (mTORC1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. mTORC1 is a kinase that controls key cellular processes including nutrient sensing, protein synthesis, and autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Two primary effectors of mTORC1 signaling are p70S6 kinase, which phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6, and 4E-BP1 that controls formation of the translation initiation complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. TSC2 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase Rheb, which is a direct activator of mTORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. TSC1 is required to stabilize TSC2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and loss of either protein disrupts TSC1/2 complex function. In the absence of the TSC1/2 complex, mTORC1 signaling is constitutively active, leading to alterations in cell growth, metabolism, and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">The proposed model of cortical tuber formation is that somatic “second-hit” mutations in patients with heterozygous germline mutations result in loss of function of the TSC1/2 complex and hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in a subset of cortical progenitor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In line with this, there is clear evidence that loss of heterozygosity of <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>2</italic> causes TSC-associated hamartomas including those in the brain, lung, and kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. However, second-hit mutations have only been observed in a minority of surgically resected cortical tubers from TSC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, giving rise to the idea that haploinsufficiency may contribute to the neurological and cognitive aspects of TSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Here we investigated the developmental origins of tuber cells using two- and three-dimensional human neuronal cultures with engineered mutations in the <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> genes. We find that homozygous, but not heterozygous, loss of <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> profoundly affects the development of human cortical neurons and glia, giving rise to dysplastic cells resembling those found in tubers.</p>

<title>Gene editing TSC1 and TSC2 in hESCs</title>
<p id="P8">To establish a genetically controlled platform for assessing the impact of loss-of-function mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic> on human neural development, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete either exon 17 of <italic>TSC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) or exon 5 of <italic>TSC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We chose these exons for targeted deletion based on their small size and expected introduction of a frameshift and premature stop codon. Mutations were engineered in the same hESC line, and cell lines were generated with heterozygous or homozygous mutations for each gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). All hESC lines expressed pluripotency markers, exhibited normal morphology, and had no major chromosomal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1c-g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We verified by western blotting that homozygous mutant hESCs exhibited complete loss of TSC1 or TSC2 protein and heterozygous cells exhibited partial loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We observed a significant reduction in TSC2 protein in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells and TSC1 protein in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, consistent with prior data showing that the TSC1 and 2 proteins stabilize each other and that in the absence of one protein, the other is degraded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We examined the phosphorylation state of the mTORC1 pathway targets ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1 and found significant elevations in p-S6 in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells and p-4E-BP1 in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,f,h</xref>). Total levels of S6 protein were also significantly increased in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c &amp; g</xref>), consistent with mTORC1’s role in promoting the synthesis of ribosomal proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Notably, hESCs with heterozygous mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>2</italic> did not display activation of mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,f-i</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">AKT is an upstream activator of mTORC1 that controls its activity through phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. AKT and other upstream regulators of mTORC1 are subject to potent negative feedback regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Consistent with engagement of a negative feedback pathway, we observed significantly reduced phosphorylation of AKT at serine 473 in both <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> hESCs, and a small but significant decrease in <italic>TSC1<sup>+/−</sup></italic> hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, j</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed increased total AKT protein in <italic>TSC1<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> hESCs, which was not observed in hESCs with <italic>TSC2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,k</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that homozygous, but not heterozygous, disruption of <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> increases mTORC1 signaling and decreases AKT phosphorylation in hESCs.</p>

<title>Phenotypes of neural progenitor cells lacking TSC1 or TSC2</title>
<p id="P11">To investigate how mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>2</italic> affect early human neural development, we differentiated our panel of hESCs into two-dimensional (2D) cultures of forebrain neural progenitor cells (NPCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. We found that nestin-positive NPCs could be generated from hESCs of all genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). However, <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> NPCs were hypertrophic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3a-b</xref>), consistent with observations in other cell types exhibiting high mTORC1 signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We observed a large increase in p-S6 in both <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> NPCs, with <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> NPCs exhibiting significantly higher p-S6 levels than <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3c-f</xref>). <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> NPCs displayed increased 4E-BP1 phosphorylation as well as total levels of S6 and 4E-BP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3c,g-i</xref>). We observed strongly reduced S473 AKT phosphorylation in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> NPCs, and to a more variable extent in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> NPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3c,j</xref>). In contrast to hESCs, total levels of AKT were reduced in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> NPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3c,k</xref>).</p>

<title>3D cortical spheroid differentiation</title>
<p id="P12">The human cortex develops from neuroepithelial cell precursors that generate radial glia progenitors, which divide asymmetrically to produce excitatory neurons followed by astrocytes, a type of glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. To investigate how mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>2</italic> affect neural development in a three-dimensional (3D) tissue context that recapitulates this progression, we differentiated our panel of hESCs into cortical spheroids using an established protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). At 20 days post-differentiation, rosette structures resembling cortical ventricular zones could be observed in spheroids of all genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). These structures contained cells that expressed the neural progenitor markers PAX6 and SOX2. There were no significant differences in the percentage of PAX6 or SOX2-positive cells in spheroids derived from hESCs with mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>), indicating that TSC mutations do not strongly affect differentiation into forebrain progenitors. We performed staining for the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 and found that 49.7% +/− 5.5% of cells in wild-type (WT) spheroids were proliferating at day 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c,f</xref>). We did not find significant differences in the proportion of Ki-67-positive cells in spheroids with mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">In WT spheroids, expression of neuronal markers including NeuN and MAP2 began around day 30-50 post-differentiation and increased through day 150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Markers of glial-lineage cells, which include astrocytes, emerged later with expression of GFAP and S100B beginning around day 100 and increasing through day 150, consistent with <italic>in vivo</italic> human cortical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g,i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). While spheroids with heterozygous mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> showed a normal profile of neuron and glia development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g-m</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4a-f</xref>), <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids exhibited reduced or delayed expression of neuronal markers and increased expression of glial-lineage markers. This was demonstrated by significantly reduced MAP2 and increased GFAP protein expression from days 100-150 in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids and on day 100 and 150, respectively, in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g-i</xref>). mRNA levels showed a similar pattern with decreased <italic>RBFOX3</italic> (NeuN) and increased <italic>S100B</italic> expression in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids on day 100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j,k</xref>). <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids also exhibited consistently reduced neuron:glia ratios on day 100, assessed by immunostaining for NeuN and S100B, although this did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2l</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). This may reflect biased differentiation into glial-lineage cells as opposed to enhanced proliferation as we did not find significantly increased numbers of Ki-67/S100B double-positive cells in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4d,e</xref>). The neurons and glia that were generated in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids were enlarged, dysmorphic and had high levels of p-S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2l,m</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4e,f</xref>), similar to those observed in TSC patient tubers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P14">We verified that these phenotypes were not specific to the hESC line used for gene editing by using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a homozygous deletion of <italic>TSC2</italic> in an independent human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line that we generated from BJ fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1i,j</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). BJ;<italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids exhibited enlarged, dysplastic neurons and glia that had high levels of p-S6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4g,h</xref>).</p>

<title>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup> and TSC2<sup>−/−</sup> spheroids fail to suppress mTORC1 during neurogenesis</title>
<p id="P15">To determine how TSC1/2 complex loss might alter neuron and glia development, we monitored mTORC1 signaling in WT and <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cortical spheroids over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-g</xref>). We found that both the total levels and phosphorylation of S6 were strongly reduced in WT spheroids as they transitioned from proliferating to differentiating, with the highest levels at day 0, when cells were still pluripotent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-c</xref>). A similar pattern was observed for 4E-BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,d,e</xref>) suggesting that two downstream targets of mTORC1 signaling involved in translational control are strongly suppressed during human neural differentiation. Notably, although total levels of 4E-BP1 and S6 decreased between days 20 and 100 in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,e</xref>), likely reflecting changes in cell type composition of the spheroids, the ratio of phosphorylated to total protein remained as high as in stem cells throughout spheroid development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,d</xref>). This indicates that <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were unable to suppress mTORC1 signaling during neuronal differentiation. The hyperphosphorylation of mTORC1 pathway targets in <italic>TSC2</italic> mutant spheroids was in contrast to AKT phosphorylation, which was strongly reduced throughout development in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">Given the dynamic regulation of mTORC1 signaling we observed during cortical spheroid development, we quantitatively compared mTORC1 signaling across all genotypes at multiple developmental time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5a-g</xref>). Homozygous loss of <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> produced overall similar changes in mTORC1 signaling. However, <italic>TSC2</italic> loss increased S6 phosphorylation to a greater extent than <italic>TSC1</italic> deletion on days 20-100 post-differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was significantly increased over WT levels in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids on days 20-100 and in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids on days 30 and 50 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). By contrast, AKT phosphorylation was strongly reduced in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids at all time points and on days 20-100 in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5f</xref>). Heterozygous spheroids exhibited a normal developmental pattern of mTORC1 signaling, with no significant differences in S6, 4E-BP1, or AKT phosphorylation at any time point compared to WT spheroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5a-g</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">In addition to TSC1 and TSC2, the TSC complex contains a third requisite protein, TBC1D7, which binds to TSC1 and is required for complex stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. We measured protein levels of TBC1D7 in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids over time and found that TBC1D7 was strongly reduced in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids from day 20 onwards, likely due to degradation in the absence of TSC1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5h,i</xref>). We also observed smaller but significant reductions in TBC1D7 in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids compared to wild-type on days 20, 50 and 150 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5h,i</xref>), which may reflect the approximately 60% loss of TSC1 protein in these cells.</p>
<p id="P18">Taken together, these data demonstrate that mTORC1 signaling is strongly suppressed during human neuronal differentiation and that homozygous mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> prevent this developmental regulation.</p>

<title>Rescue of neuronal differentiation and morphology with rapamycin treatment</title>
<p id="P27">To test whether the formation of dysplastic cells in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/c;LSL-tdTom</sup></italic> cortical spheroids could be prevented or rescued by blocking mTORC1 signaling, we treated spheroids with rapamycin at different time points during development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). For all conditions, sub-saturating amounts of Cre and GFP virus were added on day 12 and spheroids were harvested on day 110.</p>
<p id="P28">We found that chronic rapamycin starting on day 12 strongly reduced mTORC1 signaling in both heterozygous and homozygous <italic>TSC2</italic> mutant cells and prevented cellular hypertrophy induced by biallelic <italic>TSC2</italic> inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8b,c</xref>). To assess neuronal differentiation, we calculated the percentage of tdTomato (Cre) or GFP-positive <italic>TSC2<sup>−/c</sup></italic> cells that expressed the neuronal marker HuC/D or the glial protein S100B on day 110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-g</xref>). For GFP-labeled <italic>TSC2</italic> heterozygous cells, 15.8% of cells expressed HuC/D, 34.2% expressed S100B, and 50% were not labeled by either marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). The unlabeled cells likely represent neural progenitors or immature neurons and glia. Consistent with findings in the constitutive <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids, tdTomato-positive <italic>TSC2</italic> homozygous mutant cells preferentially generated glial-lineage cells over neurons at a ratio of 7.3 to 1 (72.6% S100B positive vs. 9.9% HuC/D positive, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). We confirmed that the majority of tdTomato-positive cells were likely astrocytes by immunostaining with additional astrocyte markers including EAAT1 and CD44 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8f,g</xref>). Chronic rapamycin starting on day 12 completely reversed the glial differentiation bias, causing tdTomato-positive <italic>TSC2<sup>−/c</sup></italic> cells to generate neurons at the expense of astrocytes (9.9% S100B positive vs. 70.4% HuC/D positive, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). Chronic rapamycin also nearly tripled the percentage of neurons generated by GFP-positive cells (from 15.8% to 46.5% HuC/D positive, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). These findings are consistent with our western blot results with rapamycin-treated <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spheroids (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5j</xref>), indicating that suppression of mTOR signaling acts downstream of the TSC1/2 complex to promote neuronal differentiation and inhibit or delay glial-lineage cell production.</p>
<p id="P29">To test whether rapamycin treatment could reverse the phenotypes of <italic>TSC2</italic> loss, we treated spheroids with rapamycin starting on day 80. Chronic rapamycin from day 80-110 strongly reduced mTORC1 signaling and reversed cellular hypertrophy to a similar extent as day 12-110 rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8b-d</xref>). Rapamycin from day 80-110 also improved the neuronal differentiation of tdTomato-positive <italic>TSC2<sup>−/c</sup></italic> cells (from 9.9% to 22.3% HuC/D positive, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>); however, the effect was more modest compared to day 12-110 treatment. Rapamcyin from day 80-110 had little effect on neuronal differentiation in GFP-positive cells (15.8% vs. 22.1% HuC/D positive, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). These results suggest that 1) the majority of neuronal cell fate decisions are made prior to day 80 in the cortical spheroid model and 2) rapamycin treatment cannot reverse this decision.</p>
<p id="P30">Based on these findings, we tested whether rapamycin treatment during the primary period of neuronal differentiation (from day 12 to 80) could prevent phenotypes due to homozygous loss of <italic>TSC2</italic>. We found that rapamycin treatment from day 12-80 improved neuronal differentiation in tdTomato-positive <italic>TSC2<sup>−/c</sup></italic> cells (from 9.9% to 30.3% HuC/D positive), albeit to a lesser degree than in spheroids continuously treated with rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). Despite improvements in neuronal differentiation, upon rapamycin withdrawal at day 80, tdTomato-positive <italic>TSC2<sup>−/c</sup></italic> cells reactivated mTORC1 signaling to a similar level as vehicle treated mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P31">Taken together, these results suggest that there is a developmental window for pharmacologic mTORC1 suppression to prevent neuronal differentiation defects caused by loss of <italic>TSC2</italic>. Later rapamycin treatment cannot reverse cell fate decisions that have already been made, but can rescue mTORC1 hyperactivation and reduce neuron and glia hypertrophy. Sustained mTORC1 inhibition is required to prevent the reemergence of mTORC1 hyperactivity in differentiated cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P32">In this study, we generated a panel of human pluripotent stem cell lines with targeted loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic> genes and used this genetically controlled system to investigate the contributions of TSC-mTOR signaling to human cortical development. We found that mTORC1 signaling is strongly suppressed during human neuronal differentiation and that this is required for normal neuro- and gliogenesis. Homozygous, but not heterozygous, loss of <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> disrupts the developmental suppression of mTORC1 signaling resulting in abnormal differentiation and hypertrophy of human neurons and glia. We provide direct support for the second-hit hypothesis of cortical tuber formation, as biallelic inactivation of <italic>TSC2</italic> in NPCs was necessary and sufficient to cause the formation of dysplastic cells in human cortical spheroids. Lastly, we demonstrate that mTOR inhibition during a critical developmental period prevents the formation of dysplastic cells by promoting neuronal differentiation and preventing cellular hypertrophy.</p>
<p id="P33">A major finding of our study is that bidirectional changes in mTORC1 signaling profoundly affect the balance of neurons and glia in developing human cortical spheroids. Specifically, mTORC1 hyperactivation resulted in greater production of glial-lineage cells, which include astrocytes, at the expense of neurons. By contrast, mTORC1 suppression strongly promoted neurogenesis and impaired gliogenesis. These effects were observed both in cortical spheroids with constitutive mutations in <italic>TSC2</italic> and in cells with a second-hit <italic>TSC2</italic> mutation, which generated seven times more glia than neurons. The latter result suggests a cell autonomous change in cell fate decision, as neighboring <italic>TSC2</italic> heterozygous cells produced higher neuron to glia ratios. These findings are consistent with histological observations of large numbers of astrocytes in cortical tubers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, mouse studies demonstrating increased GFAP expression following loss of <italic>Tsc1</italic> or <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and recent studies showing reduced neuronal and increased glial markers in 2D human <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neural cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P34">In the developing human cortex, early neuroepithelial progenitors give rise to radial glia, which can divide symmetrically to produce more radial glia, or asymmetrically to produce a neuron or an astrocyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The mechanisms underlying neuron-astrocyte cell fate decisions in human cortex are not well understood, however studies in mice have identified a cascade of intrinsic and extrinsic signaling events that govern time-dependent shifts from progenitor self-renewal to neurogenesis to gliogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Our findings demonstrate that suppression of mTORC1 signaling during the transition from proliferation to neuronal differentiation (between day 25 and 43 in the cortical spheroid model) is required for normal neurogenesis.</p>
<p id="P35">Mechanistically, mTORC1 could be inhibiting neurogenic gene expression programs, activating gliogenic signaling pathways, or increasing glial proliferation. In contrast to a study using 2D neural cultures derived from a TSC patient hiPSC line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, we did not find significant increases in the proportion of Ki-67-positive glia in cortical spheroids with TSC mutations. Instead, we found that Y705 phosphorylation of the gliogenic transcription factor STAT3 was significantly elevated in <italic>TSC1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cortical spheroids in a rapamycin-sensitive manner, consistent with previous observations in 2D mouse and human neural cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Importantly, we found that p-STAT3 levels were increased prior to the onset of neurogenesis in TSC mutant spheroids. Since neurogenic and gliogenic signals suppress one another, the activation of STAT3 may directly promote gliogenesis, while at the same time interfering with or delaying neurogenesis. In addition to increased glial cell production, it is also possible that high mTORC1 signaling may impair the survival of newborn neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, further contributing to altered neuron:glia ratio.</p>
<p id="P36">Our finding that rapamycin treatment early in cortical spheroid development alters cell fate decisions, even in <italic>TSC2<sup>+/−</sup></italic> cells, has important clinical implications. Rapamycin derivatives called rapalogues are used clinically to treat TSC and related disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and it has been suggested that prenatal rapalogue treatment could be beneficial to prevent developmental abnormalities in TSC. We find that strong mTORC1 suppression alters the normal pattern of cortical differentiation. This suggests that prenatal rapamycin, while effective at preventing cellular phenotypes caused by mTORC1 hyperactivation, may be detrimental to the developing brain, consistent with behavioral studies in mice exposed to rapamycin <italic>in utero</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Our models will facilitate further testing of therapeutics for TSC and allow the definition of critical windows for treatment to have the most impact without causing detrimental outcomes.</p>
<p id="P37">Here we provide causal evidence that second-hit mutations are necessary and sufficient to generate dysplastic cells in developing human cortical tissue. While this has been proposed to occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, second-hit mutations have only been detected in a subset of cortical tubers examined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. This is in contrast to TSC-related hamartomas including subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, in which second-hit events are frequently observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Using conditional <italic>TSC2</italic> knock-out hESCs and patient-derived hiPSCs, we show that a sporadic second-hit mutation in <italic>TSC2<sup>−/c</sup></italic> NPCs causes the formation of dysplastic cells in human cortical spheroids. These cells are strikingly similar to those observed in TSC patient tubers. Specifically, we find cell types resembling dysmorphic neurons, dysplastic glia, and giant cells that are hypertrophic and have high levels of mTORC1 signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. These cells express many of the same markers that have been observed in patient tubers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Importantly, we did not observe tuber cell features in heterozygous <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> cells, or in <italic>TSC2<sup>+/c</sup></italic> cells treated with Cre, demonstrating that biallelic inactivation is necessary for the generation of dysplastic cells.</p>
<p id="P38">One possible reason that second-hit mutations have not been consistently identified in TSC patient brain tissue is that tubers comprise a mixture of cell types of different origin. Tubers contain dysmorphic cells with high mTORC1 activity as well as normal-appearing neurons and glia. Additionally, immune cells infiltrate the tubers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, further diluting the numbers of cells with biallelic inactivation. Thus, low allelic frequency may have hindered the identification of somatic mutations. Indeed, in a recently reported focal cortical dysplasia case with a second-hit mutation in <italic>TSC2</italic>, the somatic mutation was present in only ~7% of brain cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Alternatively, mutations may occur in introns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, promoters, or other regulatory regions, or could be large copy number variants, which are not detectable by exome sequencing.</p>
<p id="P39">Taken together, our findings support the model that second-hit somatic mutations in small populations of NPCs give rise to the dysplastic cells that comprise cortical tubers. Such a stochastic mechanism can explain the large heterogeneity in tuber number and size among TSC patients. Since higher tuber load is linked to increased severity of epilepsy and intellectual disability, somatic mosaicism may be a key factor underlying the significant heterogeneity in the presentation of neurological phenotypes in TSC patients.</p>

Genotyping primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. The same guide RNAs and genotyping strategy used to create <italic>TSC2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> WIBR3 hESCs were used create homozygous deletion of <italic>TSC2</italic> exon 5 in the BJ hiPSC line.</p>
<p id="P44">To generate a conditional allele of <italic>TSC2</italic>, we inserted an exon 5 cassette that was flanked by loxP sites into <italic>TSC2<sup>+/−</sup></italic> hESCs. To do this we cloned a new guide RNA targeting the NHEJ junction into px330. A repair plasmid consisting of 500 bp long homology arms, exon 5 surrounded by loxP sites, and a puromycin resistance cassette flanked by FRT sites was created. 15 μg of the px330 and 35 μg of the repair plasmid were electroporated into the desired cells and re-plated onto DR4 MEFs. After 72 hours, puromycin (0.5 μg/mL, ThermoFisher: A11138-02) was added to hESC medium for the next 7 days. Surviving single cell-derived colonies were manually picked and re-plated. Genotyping was repeated as above to confirm the insertion of the puromycin cassette and the re-insertion of the exon through homology directed repair (HDR). The puromycin resistance cassette was then removed through transfection of Flp recombinase mRNA (Miltenyi Biotec: 130-106-769) with a Stemfect RNA transfection kit (Stemgent: 00-0069) and subsequent single-cell derived colony isolation and genotyping. To create the <italic>TSC2<sup>−/c</sup></italic> cell line, the WT exon 5 was excised using the same CRISPR/Cas9 strategy as above. 4520<sup>c/−</sup> hiPSCs were generated using the same approach.</p>
<p id="P45">The tdTomato Cre-reporter cassette was based on the Ai9 construct generated by Dr. Hongkui Zeng<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> (Addgene plasmid #22799). The reporter cassette was inserted into the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, after exon 1 of the PPP1R12C gene, using the same HDR genome editing methods described above. The STOP cassette (3× STOP-SV40 PA) is excised in the presence of Cre recombinase allowing expression of tdTomato from the CAGGS promoter. tdTomato is expressed in all of the progeny of cells initially infected with Cre lentivirus. All gene-edited hPSC lines were validated by expression of pluripotency markers and aCGH analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p id="P58">Images were taken on either an FV1000 Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope with 10× or 20× objectives or a Zeiss LSM 719 AxioObserver with 20× or 40× objectives. For experiments where two or more conditions were quantitatively compared, the same exposure and acquisition settings were used for each image. All images were processed using ImageJ. Only healthy regions of the spheroids, defined by intact DAPI nuclei, were used for quantification and analysis. To assess cell body size, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around each cell in Image J. ROIs were saved and applied to the p-S6 images where mean fluorescence units averaged across the ROI were used as the p-S6 value for that cell. For images analyzed for the presence or absence of cellular markers, a threshold was set based on the background fluorescence level and applied to all ROIs. If the mean fluorescence units averaged across the ROI were above the threshold, the cell was considered positive for the marker.

<title>Statistics summary</title>
<p id="P59">Sample sizes were chosen based on previous studies. All samples were included in the analysis. Spheroids were randomly assigned to rapamycin or vehicle treatment groups. The investigator was blind to genotype for image analysis of constitutive spheroids. Other quantifications were not performed blindly. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software and the specific test for each experiment is noted in the figure legend and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. To compare the means of two normally distributed groups, an unpaired two-tailed t-test was used. To compare the distributions between two groups, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. To compare the means of three or more groups, a one-way ANOVA was used followed by Bonferroni’s or Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. For data sets with three or more groups with non-normal distributions or different numbers of samples per condition, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. To compare two independent variables a two-way ANOVA was used with Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.
