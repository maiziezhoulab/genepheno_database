<abstract>
<p>Data mining and pattern recognition methods reveal interesting findings in genetic studies, especially on how the genetic makeup is associated with inherited diseases. Although researchers have proposed various data mining models for biomedical approaches, there remains a challenge in accurately prioritizing the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with the disease. In this commentary, we review the state-of-art data mining and pattern recognition models for identifying inherited diseases and deliberate the need of binary classification- and scoring-based prioritization methods in determining causal variants. While we discuss the pros and cons associated with these methods known, we argue that the gene prioritization methods and the protein interaction (PPI) methods in conjunction with the K nearest neighbors' could be used in accurately categorizing the genetic factors in disease causation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many human diseases that have a causative association with genetic components are called as inherited diseases. Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding on diseases and inherited factors that play an important role in the disease paradigm (Schrodi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2014</xref>). While it is a challenging task to identify the variants associated with inherited diseases through wet-lab based techniques, there is a need to find the causal effects of genetic changes associated with inherited diseases such as Autism, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, etc. However, due to the complexity of the human genome, information from traditional methods such as human pedigree analysis has been in demand. In humans, as crosses cannot be performed due to ethical reasons, genealogical records need to be scrutinized to distinguish autosomal diseases from other forms of inherited diseases like X-linked diseases. Conversely, animals have been employed as models to ascertain factors linking to such diseases and causal mutations. From these studies, the pedigree or genealogy trees are interpreted to understand concurrent pairs of phenotypes for the diseasome studies. Such phenotypic studies would further allow us to understand the inheritance patterns of a disease associated with genetic polymorphism.</p>
<p>In the recent-past, there is a great deal of information outlying the genes associated with polymorphisms in relation to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), genetic variants, multi nucleotide polymorphisms (MNP), quantitative trait loci (QTL), gene ontology (GO), and protein-protein interactions (PPI) or association and transcriptomic datasets coming from RNA-Seq data (Costa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2013</xref>; Schrodi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the genetic variation can be best seen with the intragenic/intronic regions or those that are non-coding or non-regulatory in nature. As most of the sequences associated with non-coding or non-regulatory regions, especially miRNAs, are highly conserved, it would be difficult to find the SNPs associated with them and their principal component part of diseasome studies is debated. Although the root cause for such genetic models could be studied by patterns associated with these polymorphisms, there remains a challenge on how these models are essential for understanding different data types.</p>

<title>Performance of the SNP based approaches for identifying inherited diseases</title>
<p>With the SNPs as genetic variants (Jiaxin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2010</xref>), traditional classification methods and novel data mining techniques were explored to show effectiveness of different algorithms in identifying the disease association (Jiang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2007</xref>). The SNPs located within protein coding regions can be further categorized into synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs). A synonymous SNP does not alter the protein sequence, whereas the non-synonymous substitutions potentially affect protein function that may result in diseases (Yates and Sternberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2013</xref>). In methods used for classification and machine learning, the nsSNPs have been known to serve as better candidates, for example in studies involving binary classification with ensemble learning approach (Breiman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1999</xref>). The methods such as AdaBoost (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), Random forest, L2boosting, stochastic gradient regression are known to fall short of classification methods such as decision tree and support vector machines (Jiaxin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2010</xref>; Benso et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2013</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The five ensemble learning approaches and two classification methods are briefly tabulated in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Essentially, the following three categories of data are integrated to identify disease-causing SNPs of statistical significance: (a) annotations of nsSNPs extracted from the Swiss-Prot database (Consortium, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2010</xref>), (b) annotation of the protein families and structural domains extracted from Pfam database (Finn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2006</xref>), and (c) a domain-domain interaction network obtained from the DOMINE (Raghavachari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2008</xref>) and the InterDom database (Ng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2003</xref>). From our preliminary observations, when we test all the classifiers against the above data, they seem to perform well in disease causing nsSNPs against regular nsSNPs. However, when comparing only four pre-set evaluation criteria, we find them to have significant differences from the random situations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The performance of approaches in identifying SNPs associated with diseases is measured by accuracy of the prediction (ACC), proportion of correctly classified cases (Horn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2003</xref>), the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (also called AUC), understating the prediction power of a given classification method, the balanced error rate (BER), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) which represents the prediction power under a certain decision threshold considering the biased and unbiased samples. Generally, smaller the BER, larger are the ACC and MCC. These methods have been reviewed elsewhere and are in agreement with the datum that Logit boost algorithm is the best method (Jiaxin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2010</xref>). Results of the decision tree are distinguished more from other ensemble classifiers; BER of the decision tree is higher than other classifiers. The performance wise arrangement of the classifiers are L2boosting &lt; stochastic gradient regression &lt; SVM &lt; Adaboost &lt; random forest tree &lt; logitboosts (Jiaxin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2010</xref>). These methods for prioritizing candidates are based on the integrated use of two-sequence conservation features and methods such as domain-domain interaction networks. The bioinformatics based methods such as PolyPhen (Ramensky et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2002</xref>), SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2003</xref>), KBAC (Liu and Leal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2010</xref>), and MSRV (Jiang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2007</xref>) along with binary classification methods provide limited information in prioritizing disease-associated nsSNPs when compared to multiple sequence alignment (MSA) methods (Rui and Jiaxin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2011</xref>) which extracts conserved protein sequences underlying the mutation.</p>

In addition, Random forests have a built-in method to estimate the importance of features.

<td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">The idea behind the support vector network has been extensively implemented in biology with some method for the restricted case where training data can be separated without errors, further extending this result to non-separable training data (Cortes and Vapnik, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1995</xref>).</td>

A tree here is composed of decision nodes and terminal leaves. The trees can be of various types like univariate trees, classification trees, regression trees etc. When making a decision, a lot of different factors are taken as inputs, the decision tree uses its own feature selection strategy to select only those useful for classification (Breiman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1999</xref>; Alpaydin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2014</xref>).</td>

<p>To overcome this limitation, we introduced methods that integrate conservation properties of amino acids and domains harbored calculated association score (Rui and Jiaxin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2011</xref>). A brief description is given below.</p>
<sec>
<title>Calculation of similarity scores between nsSNPs</title>
<p>The purpose of using following equations is to measure the similarity scores between a single pair of nsSNPs, first getting an nsSNP and the corresponding amino acid substitution occurring at a certain position. The probability of occurrence of the original amino acid (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>org</italic></sub>) is calculated at a similar position of the protein super family. For this purpose, the Pfam database is used to extract the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the query protein to find the number of occurrences of the original amino acid at the corresponding position of the alignment and then to divide the number of occurrences by the number of proteins in the alignment (Rui and Jiaxin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2011</xref>).</p>

<p>We argue that there are certain limitations in this approach, as it is a choice for extracting conserved protein domains using the Pfam database. To overcome the problem of identifying the variants, few other sequence alignment tools such as BLAST or PSIBLAST can be used to extract sequence conservation features (Altschul et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1997</xref>) which highlight the mutations in genome regions such as transcriptional-factor binding sites or promoter regions (Jiaxin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2010</xref>; Rui and Jiaxin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2011</xref>). While a binary classification solution such as Logitboost is found to be a more accurate classification algorithm, it is fully dependent on the multiple sequence alignment. However, combining the multiple sequence analysis and domain-domain interaction method is a better method to identify nsSNPs associated with diseases. Further enhancement of domain-domain interaction models would allow us to evaluate the functional similarity between two genes and their products. These data sources contain gene expression profile, gene ontology annotations, PPI.</p>

<title>Combination of SNP methods attributing to inherited diseases</title>
<p>With SNPs and other clinical conditions contributing to a wide range of inherited diseases (Fiaschi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2009</xref>), a general framework has been proposed to find variants for pre-eclampsia, a progressive disorder that occurs during pregnancy and soon after the birth, affecting both the mother and the baby (Roberts et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">1989</xref>). Mutated risk genes, genetic, and environmental factors are thought to be of key importance in such diseases (Risch and Merikangas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">1996</xref>; Liangcai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2008</xref>). Further methods have been proposed to analyze risk pathway of the bipolar disorder (BD; Hirschfeld et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2003</xref>). Keeping in view of the fact that detection of associations between human genetic variant and their phenotypic involvement is a significant challenge in understanding genetic basis of inherited diseases in humans (Wu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2014</xref>), various methods, viz. ID3 (Breiman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1999</xref>), ADTree (Freund and Mason, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1999</xref>), and C4.5 (Quinlan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">1993</xref>) have been recognized. Most of the current systems, however, predict associations between nsSNPs and diseases based on features obtained from only protein sequences and/or structure information, and do not provide details about which specific disease is associated with nsSNPs. Further, to evaluate combination of methodologies, analysis of the disease association of the SNPs and environmental factors in the KEGG pathways can be done through which we could represent the SNP networks of molecular wiring diagrams, in addition to mapping genes to the reaction and interactions (Kanehisa and Goto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2000</xref>; Liangcai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2008</xref>). There are few major steps of calculating disease risks which focus on genetic factors involved in the relationship between multiple genes and the diseases, but also the metabolic environment factors between genes and pathways. This can be further achieved by calculating the two RS scores and by prioritizing the pathways. The RS measures are integrated according to condition-dependent theory, and the association between the biological pathways and the complex disease is established through sorts of genes. The measurements algorithm, viz. a SNP Pathway based Association Method (SPAM) is briefed as follows (also see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) (Liangcai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2008</xref>).</p>

<p>While comparing our method (SNPs analysis) with earlier stated methods, we argue that other methods are effective only in detecting partially known genetic or unknown genetic bases and are used for analyzing queried protein sequences. To overcome this limitation, PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1997</xref>) or COBALT (Papadopoulos and Agarwala, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2007</xref>) enables feature selection methods. Family history related data can additionally be used to infer performance of the proposed solution (Fiaschi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2009</xref>), in addition to feature selection entities such as transcriptional and promoter regions (Liangcai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2008</xref>; Wu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2014</xref>). Whereas the combination methods explain more originality of how SNPs specific to diseases can be analyzed, KEGG pathways are useful to scrutinize other environment factors with SNP data. The phenotype data associated with diseases and its threshold values are used to transform categorical data into Boolean ones (Fiaschi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2009</xref>) which helps in machine learning. However, it must be done judiciously as selection may significantly affect the accuracy of the solution. Wu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2014</xref>) argue that Canberra distance (Emran and Ye, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2001</xref>) algorithm is the best to calculate distance between pairwise nsSNPs but in some cases, the same distance may be inferred between two similar pairs in the dataset as it is hard to classify or to associate with the particular diseases.</p>
<p>Given the numbers of diseased gene prioritization generated by wet lab techniques serve as a major impediment in human genetics, bringing a multi-faceted approach for diagnostics and treatment (Arrais and Oliveira, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2010</xref>) for diseases such as autism (Kim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2000</xref>), schizophrenia (Jingchun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2008</xref>) and diabetes should be strategically prioritized. That said, the similarity between all strategies is the use of “guilt-by-association” concept where the most relevant candidates will be the ones that are similar to the genes already known to be linked to the biological process of interest. Graph based models for gene-disease prioritization consider biomedical terms such as genes, pathways, homologies, ontologies, gene expression data and literature in ascertaining the model (Arrais and Oliveira, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2010</xref>). The previous gene-disease prioritization models have been built using gene related concepts to construct the questions over biomedical databases and to create ranked list of genes. Following this, from MeSH (Xu and Li, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2006</xref>), the statistical and knowledge based combining data from gene ontology and MeSH (Raghavachari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2008</xref>) apart from probabilistic methods, viz. Hyper-Induced Topic Search (HITS; Kleinberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">1999</xref>) and PageRank (Page et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1999</xref>) have been very useful. However, the above methods lagged by annotation coverage and tend for large biases.</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>PPI networks and inherited diseases</title>
<p>The availability of human genome-wide PPI data has opened a wide outlook for discovering inherited disease genes by studying topological features in PPI networks (Xu and Li, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2006</xref>). Keeping in view of the fact that studies on proteins and their interactions are important to understand their dynamic roles for identification of inherited, and to a certain extent rare immunological disorders, mapping the disease specific genes (for example genes related to schizophrenia) into the whole human interaction network and then the extraction of related sub networks can throw light on the cellular mechanisms and biological processes related to the inherited disease (Jingchun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2008</xref>). The sequence based features have previously been exploited and found that in many cases there are significant differences between genes responsible for human hereditary disease and those not known to be involved in diseases (Xu and Li, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2006</xref>). Genes associated with a human disease preferentially interacted with other disease-causing genes, suggesting that heritable disease-genes might share some topological features in the PPIs network when compared to the non-diseased genes (Gandhi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2006</xref>). We further argue that similar genes are obtained with human PPI datasets from Online Predicted Human Integration Database (OPID; Brown and Jurisica, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2005</xref>) employing K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm for classification. The KNN algorithm is a simple and yet a powerful non parametric classification algorithm (Franke et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2006</xref>) with an effective performance. With rapid enhancement in quantity and quality of human interaction and phenotypic data, the performance and utility of this approach to detect novel disease-genes should improve further as we come to the end of the post-genomic era. We have earlier proposed a classification scoring method to validate the interaction mapping between such proteins and calculated the total reliability score (TRS) using machine learning algorithms (Suravajhala and Sundararajan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2012</xref>). The accuracy of six point classification model was found to be 81.08% on multilayer perception of neural network which, if used based on such approaches, could have identified causal SNPs toward development of molecular markers. In the recent-past, the PPI database is also used as a knowledge base with a set of known disease-related genes that is utilized with linkage analysis in prioritizing the best candidates. From our previous discussions, we argue that the main advantage of the probabilistic knowledge model is that it reduces the prioritization error by 6% when compared to already published methods. These studies based on the relatedness to known diseases or closely related disease processes, however, remain a challenge in prioritizing loner or isolated genes with no known relationships between two nodes in the network. The solution for prioritizing loosely connected disease genes with other genes has previously been proposed by Fang et al. (Fang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2014</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) which uses network diffusion and rank concordance (NDRC). In addition, they found that genes related to complex diseases are divided into several modules associated with different disease phenotypes. First, they built the network without removing the insignificant genes from the network, while the second one was based on the Diffusion Rank (DR) algorithm (Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2007</xref>). The NDRC simulates the heat diffusion process where information flows from the known disease genes of related disease and propagates over the PPI network with noisy data as a problem to prioritize disease genes (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2009</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2009</xref>; Fang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2014</xref>). Multiple kernels learning (KML) and N dimensional order statistic (NDOS) methods were found to be handling noisy data effectively. Two strategies are relatively known, one to search for a kernel that would best represent all the information available using a convex optimization method, known as semi-definite programming (SDP; Lanckriet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2004</xref>; De Bie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2007</xref>) which simultaneously optimizes parameters for one-class SVM and tests genes ranked by the one-class SVM. In the second strategy, all test genes were first ranked using one-class SVM with an individual data source and then, N-dimensional order statistics was used to combine these rank lists into one rank list (Lanckriet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2004</xref>). For gene ontology and sequence data, we argue that the kernel with higher weight may not have much influence in discerning the SNPs. Different machine learning algorithms as described are used for prioritizing SNPs and proven to be effective especially SVMs with higher performance than the random forest. A comparative study was carried out by Tranchevent et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>) on prioritizing tools. The authors recommended genes to diseases (G2D) as a good tool for providing an ordered list of candidate genes in the peak regions (Perez-Iratxeta et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2002</xref>). In conclusion, SVM can be applied to the gene prioritizing process with ontology association as it encompasses enrichment based feature selection processes in identification of inherited diseases (He and Jiang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2012</xref>; Xie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2012</xref>). Nevertheless, feature selection method and integrating more data sources like semantic and phenotype similarity profiling between diseases and genes could build better prediction ability.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Most of the inherited diseases are caused by SNP variants and research findings on causal SNPs are becoming prominent. During the last few years, the multitude of research showcasing SNPs and other methodologies has come up in identifying the candidates for inherited diseases. From this commentary, we reason out that identification of SNPs has generally been considered as a binary classification problem, although, there are a host of methods, viz. support vector machine tools, random forest methods, gene prioritization methods that are used for scoring and calculating genes truly associated with the inherited diseases. Among the classifiers, KNN is known to be the most best performing algorithm for the analysis of inherited diseases based on PPI network. As human PPIs grow in post-genomic era, a promising source for discovering such disease genes could herald a need to understand the rigorous algorithms behind such approaches. As researchers use different cross validation methods to prove accuracy, efficiency, and the appropriation, a conceptualized framework for identification of inherited diseases would be promising. With deluge of human genomic data containing SNPs and PPI, there remains this challenge.</p>
