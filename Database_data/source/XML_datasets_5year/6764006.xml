<abstract>
<p>Compound screening in biological assays and subsequent optimization of hits is
indispensable for the development of new molecular research tools and drug
candidates. To facilitate such discoveries, the European Research Infrastructure
EU-OPENSCREEN was founded recently with the support of its member countries and
the European Commission. Its distributed character harnesses complementary
knowledge, expertise, and instrumentation in the discipline of chemical biology
from 20 European partners, and its open working model ensures that academia and
industry can readily access EU-OPENSCREEN’s compound collection, equipment, and
generated data. To demonstrate the power of this collaborative approach, this
perspective article highlights recent projects from EU-OPENSCREEN partner
institutions. These studies yielded (1)
2-aminoquinazolin-4(3<italic>H</italic>)-ones as potential lead structures for
new antimalarial drugs, (2) a novel lipodepsipeptide specifically inducing
apoptosis in cells deficient for the pVHL tumor suppressor, (3)
small-molecule-based ROCK inhibitors that induce definitive endoderm formation
and can potentially be used for regenerative medicine, (4) potential
pharmacological chaperones for inborn errors of metabolism and a familiar form
of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and (5) novel tankyrase inhibitors that entered
a lead-to-candidate program. Collectively, these findings highlight the benefits
of small-molecule screening, the plethora of assay designs, and the close
connection between screening and medicinal chemistry within EU-OPENSCREEN.</p>

<title>Scientific Concept and Operational Model of EU-OPENSCREEN</title>
<p>Chemical biology is an interdisciplinary research field that has emerged in the past
decade from classical pharmacology and cell biology, and it studies the effects of
chemical compounds on biological systems. In parallel, postgenome biology, with its
powerful technologies of genome sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics,
metabolomics, and genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9, as well as new model systems such
as microphysiological systems, has provided a rapidly expanding range of information
on new cellular targets for basic research and early drug discovery. However, the
availability of selective “tools or probes” for systematic biochemical investigation
of target function still remains a limiting factor in many investigations. Reviews
on the use of chemical compounds that elicit a well-defined biological effect
highlight the opportunities (and also the limitations) of these tool compounds for
the modulation of functions of biological targets and for studying the underlying
molecular mechanisms at the biochemical, cellular, tissue, and organismal levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2472555218816276">1</xref></sup> Chemical biology as a discipline is well represented in, but not restricted
to, academia, and increasingly, the drug discovery workflows in pharmaceutical
companies feature chemical biology studies. The discovery and optimization of probe
compounds form important parts of industrial tractability and “go versus no-go”
decision-making on novel targets, as well as the study of target translatability as
part of the early design of subsequent clinical phases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2472555218816276">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>EU-OPENSCREEN is a research infrastructure (RI) of screening and medicinal chemistry
platforms that was established by seven European member states and one observer
state in 2018, under the legal framework of a European Research Infrastructure
Consortium (ERIC), in order to enable chemical biology in an open-access setting
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eu-openscreen.eu">www.eu-openscreen.eu</ext-link>). The RI will provide scientists access to a
chemical library, assay development and screening facilities, medicinal chemistry
and informatics platforms, and associated supporting facilities for protein
production, cell line generation (e.g., 2D and 3D models and patient-derived cells),
computational and structural biology, and structure-based drug design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 1</bold>
</xref>). As it begins the operational phase of its work, EU-OPENSCREEN anticipates
that a high demand exists from users to access its platforms. In the year before
initiation of EU-OPENSCREEN, the partner sites that came together to form the
EU-OPENSCREEN network participated in more than 135 screening and medicinal
chemistry projects, involving academic, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME), and
large industry users coming from 22 European and non-European countries.
Historically, the partner sites of EU-OPENSCREEN have been involved in multiple
projects, which reached clinical and/or preclinical stages for indications including
leukemia, epilepsy, autism, myotonic dystrophy, Parkinson’s disease, and colon
cancer.</p>

<p>Working model of the EU-OPENSCREEN ERIC. Three categories of users are
envisioned (assay provider, compound provider, and database user). The
compound collection comprising academic and commercial compounds is stored
centrally at the headquarters. Bioprofiling of academic and commercial
compounds occurs at the bioprofiling sites. Compound screening and medicinal
chemistry are carried out at the individual EU-OPENSCREEN partner sites.
Data are stored at the database site and can be accessed via the
EU-OPENSCREEN database.</p>

</fig>
<p>The central office of the EU-OPENSCREEN ERIC acts as a single point of contact for
users, assists in identifying the appropriate partner site, and helps to formulate
the project design. Herein, the central office receives the project requests from
users and contacts potential partners with appropriate technologies and expertise.
Together with the partner sites, the technical feasibility, the scientific novelty
of the proposed project, and the most suitable partner site are evaluated, and if
deemed feasible and novel, the project will be initiated in collaboration with the
most suitable EU-OPENSCREEN partner. Depending on the individual needs of the users,
projects take place at 1 of 15 specialized and high-capacity screening partner sites
or 6 medicinal chemistry sites. The assay development phase preceding the actual
screening campaign emphasizes the quality, integrity, robustness, and
pharmacological relevance of the readouts. Projects have access to the EU-OPENSCREEN
compound collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2472555218816276">3</xref></sup> containing 100,000 commercially available as well as 40,000 academic
compounds crowdsourced through a network of national chemical biology networks. A
5000-compound subset—carefully selected to represent the diversity of the entire
collection and also containing 2500 known bioactive compounds—is available for the
process of assay validation in pilot studies. Notably, during the selection process
for commercial compounds pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2472555218816276">4</xref></sup> are partially selected against. Furthermore, access to a wider range of
chemical diversity will be provided through the isolation and characterization of
natural products by some of the EU-OPENSCREEN partner sites, and moreover, a
fragment library for fragment-based screening will be acquired. These two additions
are currently the only expansions envisioned for the EU-OPENSCREEN compound
collection, and future expansions will depend on the funding situation. The compound
collection is stored and managed at the headquarters located in Berlin, and copies
of the screening collection, as well as library updates, are distributed to the
EU-OPENSCREEN partner sites. Results from the primary screens will be made available
globally in an open-access database. To allow for publication of data or securing
intellectual property, a grace period of up to 3 years is provided between
completion of the primary screen and data presentation in the EU-OPENSCREEN
database. After the official start of EU-OPENSCREEN in 2018, the database is
currently still under construction. A link will be provided on the EU-OPENSCREEN
website as soon as the database development has been completed.</p>
<p>While EU-OPENSCREEN just started its operational phase, its 20 partner institutions
are already operational as stand-alone institutes. Hence, in the following sections
recent successful chemical biology projects at selected partner institutes are
presented to give an overview of the capacities and expertise present within the
EU-OPENSCREEN network, as well as an outlook as to how EU-OPENSCREEN can facilitate
academic and applied science in the future.</p>

<title>Project A: 2-Aminoquinazolin-4(3<italic>H</italic>)-ones as Potential New
Nonpeptidomimetic Lead Structures for Antimalarial Agents</title>
<p>Emerging drug resistance of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites against approved
antimalarial drugs represents a major threat for preventing and treating malaria,
one of the most detrimental infectious diseases, in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2472555218816276">5</xref></sup> Hence, substantial efforts are currently being made to identify novel drug
candidates that interrupt the life cycle of the parasite by yet unknown mechanisms
of action. In this context, the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis (LIOS), a
medicinal chemistry partner site of EU-OPENSCREEN, recently spearheaded a study that
identified 2-aminoquinazolin-4(3<italic>H</italic>)-ones as potent inhibitors of
three digestive aspartic proteases (i.e., digestive plasmepsins), namely, Plm I, II,
and IV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2472555218816276">6</xref></sup> Digestive plasmepsins (i.e., Plm I, II, and IV and HAP), localized in the
digestive vacuole of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite, contribute toward the
metabolism of hemoglobin into amino acids, and represent a subgroup of the
extensively studied family of aspartic plasmepsin proteases, which have been
considered potential drug targets against malaria parasites for more than 10
years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2472555218816276">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2472555218816276"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2472555218816276">9</xref></sup> Due to their high potential as
drug targets, numerous inhibitors have been developed against plasmepsins over the
past years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2472555218816276">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2472555218816276"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2472555218816276">12</xref></sup> Nonpeptidomimetic compounds
show better selectivity against human aspartic proteases and tend to bind to the
open-flap form of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> plasmepsins, whereas peptidomimetic
compounds preferably bind to the closed-flap form of the proteases. Herein, opening
of the flap results in accessibility of a protein subpocket, which can subsequently
be occupied by parts of the nonpeptidomimetic inhibitor. In close collaboration with
the Biomedical Research and Study Centre in Riga and the Francis Crick Institute in
London, a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based fragment screening
approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2472555218816276">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2472555218816276">14</xref></sup> was used to identify
2-aminoquinazolin-4(3<italic>H</italic>)-ones as nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors of
digestive plasmepsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 2A</bold>
</xref>). To this end, a diversity subset comprising 976 Astex “rule of 3”-compliant
compounds of the ChemBridge fragment collection (ChemBridge, San Diego, CA) was
screened against binding to the digestive plasmepsin Plm II. STD,
T1<italic>p</italic>, and Water-LOGSY NMR spectra were taken in both the
presence and absence of the Plm II target, and specificity was assessed by
competition experiments with the potent aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2472555218816276">15</xref></sup> Binding to Plm II detected by at least two of the three NMR techniques, as
well as competition with pepstatin A, was set as a hit criterion and yielded a total
of 49 fragment hits. Subsequent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based
enzymatic assays identified fragment <bold>1</bold>, which is based on the
2-aminoquinazolin-4(3<italic>H</italic>)-one scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 2A</bold>
</xref>), as the most potent hit with one of the highest ligand efficiencies
(IC<sub>50</sub>(Plm II) = 24.3 µM, LE = 0.35). Subsequent chemical optimization
experiments were thus performed using this scaffold as a starting point. An initial
hint for the medicinal chemistry optimization strategy came from NMR competition
experiments using fragment <bold>1</bold> in combination with fragment
<bold>2</bold>: the two fragments did not bind to the same binding site, and an
observed interligand NOE between H-7 of fragment <bold>1</bold> and H-5 of fragment
<bold>2</bold> indicated close proximity of the two fragments—thus implying an
additional binding pocket around H-7 of fragment <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 2B</bold>
</xref>). Following this hint, the addition of a phenyl group at position 7 of
fragment <bold>1</bold> yielded the more potent inhibitor
<italic>rac</italic>-<bold>3a</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub>(Plm II) = 2.3 µM, LE =
0.32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 2B</bold>
</xref>). Subsequent docking experiments with <italic>rac</italic>-<bold>3a</bold>
using Schrödinger Glide software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2472555218816276">16</xref></sup> (Schrödinger, New York, NY) suggested high-quality binding to the open-flap
conformation of Plm II with hydrogen bonding interactions between the N1 and 2-amino
group of fragment <bold>1</bold> and catalytic Asp34-Asp214 dyad and indicated an
extension of the added phenyl residue toward the deep flap pocket, while the
tetrahydrofuran (THF) moiety of fragment <bold>1</bold> resided in the S1′ pocket of
Plm II. Moreover, docking experiments suggested additional space in S1′, and indeed,
adding a lipophilic <italic>cis</italic>-phenyl group to the 5-position of the THF
group yielded <italic>rac</italic>-<bold>3b</bold> as the more potent inhibitor of
Plm II (IC<sub>50</sub>(Plm II) = 0.57 µM, LE = 0.28) with a more than 10-fold
selectivity for Plm II when compared with human Cat D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 2B</bold>
</xref>). A co-crystal of <italic>rac</italic>-<bold>3b</bold> and Plm II was
obtained, and the x-ray structure (2.7 Å) confirmed binding of the inhibitor to the
open-flap conformation previously suggested by the docking experiments and thus
provided a better understanding of the binding of the inhibitor to Plm II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 2C</bold>
</xref>). Importantly, the x-ray structure also showed that the flap pocket is for
the most part unoccupied by <italic>rac-</italic>
<bold>3b</bold>, and thus suggested that adding hydrophobic groups to the 7-phenyl
substituent could help target the flap pocket; indeed, literature-informed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2472555218816276">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2472555218816276">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2472555218816276">17</xref></sup> addition of
the <italic>n</italic>-pentyl group to the para position of the phenyl group yielded
the even more potent inhibitor <italic>rac</italic>-<bold>4a</bold>
(IC<sub>50</sub>(Plm II) = 0.15 µM, LE = 0.27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 2D</bold>
</xref>). Notably, adding a 3-phenylpropyl group to the <italic>para</italic>
position of the phenyl group yielded the Plm IV specific inhibitor
<italic>rac</italic>-<bold>4b</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub>(Plm IV) = 0.13 µM, LE =
0.17) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 2D</bold>
</xref>), whereas <italic>rac-</italic>
<bold>4a</bold> inhibited the three digestive plasmepsins Plm I, II, and IV to
similar extents. Selectivity over human Cat D was comparable to previous reports on
nonpeptidomimetic Plm inhibitors for both <italic>rac-</italic>
<bold>4a</bold> and <italic>rac-</italic>
<bold>4b</bold>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2472555218816276">10</xref></sup> Interestingly, homology modeling of Plm IV using Plm II as a template
suggested that the flap pocket of Plm IV is slightly more spacious. Both structure
models could accommodate the smaller <italic>n</italic>-pentyl group of
<italic>rac-</italic>
<bold>4a</bold> well, while the bulkier 3-phenylpropyl group of
<italic>rac-</italic>
<bold>4b</bold> could only fit into the more spacious flap pocket of Plm IV. This
suggests that specifically targeting the flap pockets of digestive plasmepsins could
yield additional subtype-specific inhibitors. Both <italic>rac-</italic>
<bold>4a</bold> and <italic>rac-</italic>
<bold>4b</bold> were tested in an in vitro growth assay using the <italic>Plasmodium
falciparum</italic> clone 3D7 and showed growth inhibition at levels close to 1
µM (<italic>rac-</italic>
<bold>4a</bold>: 1.1 ± 0.2 µM; <italic>rac-</italic>
<bold>4b</bold>: 1.2 ± 0.2 µM), which is considered as a criterion for promising
leads for potential new antimalarial drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2472555218816276">10</xref></sup></p>

<p>This study nicely demonstrates several aspects that are also relevant in the context
of the EU-OPENSCREEN network. First, the EU-OPENSCREEN compound collection will
include a fragment-based subset of compounds, and the LIOS will be involved in the
design and setup of this library subset. Second, the expertise in fragment-based
drug discovery present at LIOS represents an important addition to the EU-OPENSCREEN
capabilities, and future EU-OPENSCREEN users designing similar experimental setups
will find LIOS to be a competent collaboration partner for running their
experiments. Lastly, the study shows that EU-OPENSCREEN covers expertise regarding
assay systems, screening as well as subsequent chemical optimization of hit
compounds. This will allow prospective users to identify promising hits and develop
them into lead structures for further drug discovery. Here, the complementary
expertise of currently 20 partner institutions ensures that prospective users will
be directed to the collaborator who best matches their individual experimental
needs.</p>

<title>Project B: Discovery of the Novel Lipodepsipeptide MDN-0066, a Natural Product
That Specifically Induces Apoptosis in Cells That Do Not Express the Functional pVHL
Tumor Suppressor</title>
<p>Inactivation of the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor gene (pVHL) occurs in many
renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) as well as in other cancers. In clear cell renal cell
carcinomas (CC-RCCs), for instance, either genetic or epigenetic inactivation of
pVHL function is observed in 70%–80% of reported cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2472555218816276">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2472555218816276">19</xref></sup> pVHL is ubiquitously expressed
throughout human tissues, and its loss of expression is thus restricted to the tumor
tissue. Inactivation is usually accompanied by high levels of tumor vascularization
and poor prognosis for the patient. Moreover, it has been shown that reintroduction
of functional pVHL into RCC cells restores tumor suppression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2472555218816276">20</xref></sup> Collectively, its high rate of inactivation in RCCs, the local restriction of
pVHL inactivation to the tumor tissue, and its important role for malignancy make
pVHL an ideal target for novel drug candidates, which will possibly have only few
side effects in unaffected tissues due to the differential expression of functional
pVHL in healthy and diseased cells. To identify novel chemical agents that exhibit
cell toxicity only in the context of pVHL inactivation, the EU-OPENSCREEN partner
site Fundación MEDINA used a quantitative whole-cell assay—previously
developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2472555218816276">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2472555218816276"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2472555218816276">23</xref></sup>—on site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2472555218816276">24</xref></sup> to screen pVHL-deficient human renal carcinoma cells (RCC4 cell line)
transformed either with an empty vector (RCC4-VA) or with a vector expressing a
functional rescue copy of pVHL (RCC4-VHL) against a collection of microbial extracts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2472555218816276">25</xref></sup> Herein, the decision to use natural products for the screen was informed by
the fact that microorganisms are capable of producing a vast variety of diverse
chemical structures, which makes them highly interesting for drug discovery, and
explains why natural products keep showing desirable bioactivities in various
therapeutic areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2472555218816276">26</xref></sup> A total of 1040 microbial acetone extracts were isolated from 117 unicellular
microbial species grown in a set of different growth conditions. Microbial extracts
that induced cell death in RCC4-VA but not in RCC4-VHL cells were subsequently
fractionated, fractions were rescreened, and the ones recapitulating the
RCC4-VA-specific induction of cell death were further analyzed by liquid
chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC/HRMS) and NMR to identify the
active natural product and assess its novelty by chemical dereplication. These
dereplication experiments allowed rapid focusing on active fractions of the
promising strain F 278,770<sup>T</sup>, which eventually turned out to be a
previously not described <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species, now named <italic>P.
granadensis</italic> sp. nov.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2472555218816276">27</xref></sup> Subsequent large-scale fermentation, assay-guided compound isolation, and
structural elucidation eventually yielded the natural product MDN-0066, a
lipodepsipeptide, which was not described previously in the literature and, due to
its unique structure, established a novel class of lipodepsipeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2472555218816276">

was more sensitive to purified MDN-0066 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 24.4 µM) than the pVHL
rescue cell line RCC4-VHL (IC<sub>50</sub> = 69.23 µM), and demonstrated that
MDN-0066 already induced cell death in RCC4-VA cells at concentrations that did not
show an effect in the rescue cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 3B</bold>
</xref>). Importantly, it could be shown that MDN-0066 is capable of inducing
apoptosis specifically in pVHL-deficient cells as judged by PARP cleavage detection.
This was confirmed by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining, which demonstrated
specific induction of apoptosis in pVHL-deficient cells upon MDN-0066 treatment
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 3C</bold>

pVHL-deficient cells have previously been described as being resistant to apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2472555218816276">20</xref></sup> Moreover, flow cytometric DNA content analysis of pVHL-deficient RCC4-VA and
RCC4-VHS cells upon 48 h exposure to MDN-0066 revealed an S-phase arrest unique to
RCC4-VA cells (6.0 ± 2.1 to 18.5% ± 5.2; p = 0.005), which was correlated with a
G0/G1 decrease (75.5 ± 4.2 to 37.5% ± 4.6; p = 0.001) and a G2/M increase (10 ± 0.5
to 26.2% ± 3.1; p &lt; 0.0005) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/2472555218816276"><bold>Suppl. Fig. S1</bold></ext-link>). These results suggest that MDN-0066 is critical for the S-phase arrest
in RCC4-VA cells, but can also be involved in G2/M arrest in the absence of pVHL.
Loss of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) causes an increased progression into
the S phase, rather than a growth arrest, and pVHL is associated with cell cycle
arrest upon serum withdrawal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2472555218816276">28</xref></sup> Collectively, these results suggest that MDN-0066 has an effect on the
VHL/HIF pathway, which is involved in cell cycle regulation. Ongoing research tries
to establish the link between the cell cycle arrest and the induction of
apoptosis.</p>

the competency of the EU-OPENSCREEN network to develop novel assays that can be

natural products represented just a starting point, and future screening campaigns
using larger collections of natural products, including both pure compounds and

<title>Project C: High-Content Screening to Enable Regenerative Medicine Strategies in
Diabetes Mellitus</title>
<p>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are pluripotent and hence are able to generate
cell and tissue types of the three germ layers endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. In
this project, the EU-OPENSCREEN high-capacity screening site Fraunhofer IME
Screening Port Hamburg worked closely with colleagues in HMGU Munich to identify
small molecules able to direct efficient generation of definitive endoderm and serve
as a platform to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of endodermal differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2472555218816276">29</xref></sup> Access to such endodermal cell lineages in turn gives hope to treat diseases
such as diabetes mellitus by means of transplantation therapies. As the main
challenge in pancreatic transplantation therapy is the shortage of donor islets, the
generation and expansion of functional β-cells from hESCs and human induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could represent a promising approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2472555218816276">30</xref></sup> Current differentiation protocols act by mimicking the developmental steps in
vitro and have facilitated generation and upscaling of pancreatic β-cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2472555218816276">31</xref></sup> However, a major drawback of these protocols is the generation of immature
β-cells compared with human β-cells found in islets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2472555218816276">32</xref></sup> One tactic to increase the efficiency of β-cell generation is to target
specific pathways that are directly linked to insulin production in cultured
cells.</p>
<p>Previous data indicate that the transcription factor FoxA2 is highly expressed in
mesendoderm and definitive endoderm at the early stages of differentiation and is
also expressed in all the endoderm-derived organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2472555218816276">33</xref></sup> To facilitate high-throughput screening of novel compounds that might induce
definitive endoderm, a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line was used for primary
screening. The mESC cell line was selected because it was relatively straightforward
to perform large-scale cell culture needed to support screening and the line was
previously well characterized with respect to signaling pathways involved in
controlling endodermal differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2472555218816276">33</xref></sup> The endoderm differentiation protocol used in the screen was based on
previously published protocols with some modifications to the basal medium to
achieve higher levels of FoxA2 expression in the mESCs in order to meet the needs of
high-throughput assays. Under the influence of TGF-β pathway factors such as activin
A, the cells differentiate successfully into FoxA2-positive cells while the
undifferentiated stem cells show strong expression of the pluripotency marker Oct4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2472555218816276">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The initial high-throughput screen was performed in 384-well format with 23,406 small
molecules (Enamine, Monmouth Junction, NJ), which were selected on the basis of
chemical diversity and which excluded structural features associated with
well-described interference effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2472555218816276">4</xref></sup> The compounds were lead-like with a cLogP of &lt;4.2 and a molecular weight
between 180 and 460 Da. In addition, an FDA-approved drug set from Enzo (Lörrach,
Germany) was also screened both with the aim to identify possible targets for active
compounds and, in the longer term, for the possibility of drug repurposing.</p>
<p>For the primary assay, PerkinElmer Cell Carrier assay plates (Waltham, MA) were
coated with autoclaved 0.1% gelatin, and compounds as well as controls were spotted
by an Echo liquid handling system (Labcyte Echo 550, Labcyte, San Jose, CA) into
coated 384-well plates (source compounds at 2 mM in 100% DMSO). Wells with the
differentiation control contained activin A and added Wnt3a (final concentrations of
12.5 ng/mL [activin A, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN] and 2 ng/mL [Wnt3a, R&amp;D
Systems]). For the pluripotency control, a GSK3β inhibitor (CT 99021, Axon Medchem,
Reston, VA) was added to a final concentration of 3 µM. Negative controls were
generated by adding only DMSO. Seeding of mESCs involved the addition of 50 µL of
mESC suspension to give between 11,000 and 14,000 cells per well. Medium change with
readdition of fresh compound and control solutions occurred on day 2 postseeding,
and cells were then fixed and prepared for imaging at day 5 after seeding. Cells
were permeabilized and blocked and primary (anti-FoxA2 goat polyclonal antibody
[sc-6554, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX] and anti-Oct-3/4 mouse monoclonal
antibody [sc-5279, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)] and secondary (Alexa-Fluor 555
anti-mouse IgG and Alexa-Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat) antibodies (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) were added under automated screening conditions. The image
acquisition procedure used a PerkinElmer Opera Imaging System with DNA-DAPI
staining. Image analysis used the features of the Columbus suite three Columbus
Image Data Storage and Analysis System (PerkinElmer), which is a tool to access,
store, and explore images. A multiple-step image analysis sequence was developed

<p>For each phenotype, compounds that gave a minimum of 20% elevation in mean FoxA2
signal intensity relative to solvent control-treated cells were selected as
“differentiation-inducing hits.” A total of 400 primary differentiation-inducing
hits from the primary screen were then tested in triplicates, and from these 67
compounds were identified for follow-up in dose response experiments. In addition, a
further hit expansion was performed by selecting analogs of the 67 compounds from a
set of 200,000 Enamine compounds, which were available as liquid stocks. Around
three members of each cluster were selected to give 351 compounds for analysis in a
seven-point dose response with serial compound dilutions and cell viability
assessment to account for cytotoxicity using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Assay
(Promega, Madison, WI). Based on the differentiation controls as well as cell
viability, the ROCK inhibitor fasudil was selected for further studies to induce
definitive endoderm in vitro in an analog-by-catalog approach. Out of the 16 analogs
of fasudil tested, two analogs gave rise to endoderm differentiation (with 27% and
31% of FoxA2+ cells, respectively), which were comparable to the induction of FoxA2
by fasudil (25.5%) and Wnt3a/activin A (23%). In further profiling studies using the
human ESC line H9, the capacity of fasudil to induce definitive endoderm expression
was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and qPCR analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2472555218816276">29</xref></sup></p>

inhibition can play an important role in early lineage formation of stem cells.
Together with low batch-to-batch variation compared with the recombinant proteins
normally used for definitive endoderm induction, the ROCK inhibitor fasudil could
prove to be a very useful small-molecule tool to promote differentiation of ESCs
toward definitive endoderm, and therefore in the longer term act as a contributor to
regenerative medicine approaches based on pancreatic transplantation therapy.
Interestingly, at the CIPF EU-OPENSCREEN partner site in Spain, it was recently also
demonstrated that ROCK inhibitors could have an impact not only on pancreatic cell
transplantation therapies but also on transplantation of ependymal stem/progenitor
cells (epSPCs) of the spinal cord in acute as well as chronic in vivo models of
spinal cord injury (SCI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2472555218816276">37</xref></sup> In the context of EU-OPENSCREEN, the expertise in stem cell-based assays in

<title>Project D: Pharmacological Chaperones to Correct the Instability of Mutants
Associated with Inborn Errors of Metabolism and Rare Forms of Cancer</title>
<p>Many inherited disorders are associated with defective anabolic or catabolic pathways
in cell metabolism, affecting the synthesis, degradation, and storage of
biomolecules. These disorders, collectively known as inborn errors of metabolism
(IEMs), are typically caused by mutations in enzyme-coding genes, and although each
of these disorders is rare, the combined incidence of IEM is approximately 1 in 2000
births worldwide, and new diseases continue to be recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2472555218816276">38</xref></sup> Nevertheless, only few IEMs can be treated effectively, and developing new
therapies has proven to be challenging. Increasing knowledge on the pathogenic
mechanisms has revealed that many IEM-associated mutations cause destabilization and
misfolding of the coded variants. This link between mutation-associated
destabilization and loss of function has been largely demonstrated for
phenylketonuria (PKU),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2472555218816276">39</xref></sup> which is the most prevalent IEM, caused by mutations in phenylalanine
hydroxylase (PAH) that lead to neurotoxic levels of phenylalanine. Despite complex
quality control systems, the folding of unstable mutant proteins is not properly
achieved, and the consequent misfolding may cause increased protein degradation,
aggregation, and/or mislocalization in the cell. This understanding points to
pharmacological chaperones (PCs) as promising therapeutic strategies for IEM
correction, earlier shown as a proof of concept for PKU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2472555218816276">40</xref></sup> PCs are low-molecular-weight compounds that stabilize and rescue variant
proteins by stimulating their renaturation and preventing their misfolding in vitro
and in vivo. The EU-OPENSCREEN partner site at the University of Bergen, Norway, is
specialized in target-based biophysical screens and has developed concepts and a
protocol for the discovery and development of PCs.</p>
<p>This protocol includes a primary screening of chemical libraries, searching for
stabilizing binders of target proteins by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2472555218816276">41</xref></sup> Customarily, DSF is performed in a real-time PCR instrument with 384-well
microplates and a total assay volume of 25 μL in each well consisting of the protein
sample at concentrations in the range 0.05–0.15 mg/mL in an optimal buffer, and the
extrinsic dye SYPRO Orange that emits fluorescence when interacting with hydrophobic
areas of denatured proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 5A</bold>
</xref>). The compounds are added to the assay solution to a final concentration of
80 μg/mL and 4% DMSO. Negative controls with only 4% DMSO are routinely included on
each plate. The unfolding curves are then registered from 20 to 95 °C at a 2 °C/min
scan rate, and the midpoint melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) and the
corresponding shift relative to the reference (ΔT<sub>m</sub>) are calculated for
each compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 5A</bold>
</xref>). Thus, compounds with significant increases in ΔT<sub>m</sub> are selected
using in-house software and those showing adequate follow-up concentration-dependent
DSF curves are considered primary stabilizing hits. Further selection requires
secondary assays to corroborate binding and protein-target stabilization by several
methods, preferentially surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which also provides the
dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for the primary hits. Additional secondary
assays include enzymatic activity measurements to eliminate inhibitory compounds.
Finally, the efficacy of the best compounds is validated in tests measuring the
increased activity and steady-state levels of the target protein in eukaryotic cells
and animal models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2472555218816276">

potential PCs were discovered from the MyriaScreen Diversity Collection from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), of which compound V
(<italic>N</italic>-{[(4-chlorophenyl)carbamothioyl]amino}-2-phenylacetamide) was

7.4 ± 0.4 μM, showing a relative high affinity for a primary hit. Molecular docking
for compound V identified a probable binding site surrounded by residues 228–240 and

compounds that improve the conformational defect of mutant nucleophosmin (NPM). This
is a multifunctional nucleolar protein where deletion mutations at Trp288 and
Trp290, located in the C-terminal domain, lead to cytoplasmic localization and
aggregation, features that are associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2472555218816276">47</xref></sup> NPM is an established target in cancer, and as such has been the subject of

stabilizing hit compounds that bind to a hydrophobic pocket in NPM and show
chaperoning potential. The phenyl ring of the best and novel NPM hit

of the AMOT family of proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2472555218816276">53</xref></sup> The inhibition of tankyrases produces elevated AXIN protein levels and
reduced levels of cellular β-catenin even in the absence of a dysfunctional and
truncated form of APC protein. The inhibition of tankyrases also stabilizes the AMOT
family proteins, thereby suppressing YAP oncogenic functions.</p>
<p>The work presented here is a close collaboration between the FMP, which is an
EU-OPENSCREEN medicinal chemistry partner site; the Department of Immunology and
Transfusion Medicine, Oslo University Hospital; and the Faculty of Biochemistry and
Molecular Medicine, Biocenter Oulu, University of Oulu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2472555218816276">54</xref></sup> The project started off with an initial screening campaign at the FMP
Screening Unit—an EU-OPENSCREEN screening partner site—and yielded a
1,2,4-triazole-based selective tankyrase inhibitor JW74 with reasonable biochemical
affinity (TNKS2: IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.46 µM) but only moderate cellular activity
(HEK293: IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.01 µM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2472555218816276">55</xref></sup> While other reports on screening approaches in the context of tankyrase
inhibitors have been published previously as well,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2472555218816276">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2472555218816276"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2472555218816276"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2472555218816276">59</xref></sup> a subsequent optimization by a
classical analoging strategy led to a first lead structure <bold>6</bold> (G007-LK)
(HEK293: IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.05 µM; TNKS2: IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.025 µM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2472555218816276">60</xref></sup>), which was highly potent and showed outstanding selectivity toward the other
members of the ARTD family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2472555218816276">61</xref></sup> Crystal structures of tankyrase had revealed that the early inhibitors
compete with the substrate NAD<sup>+</sup> through binding to the conserved nicotinamide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2472555218816276">62</xref></sup> or to the adenosine subpocket.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2472555218816276">63</xref></sup> Analysis of the co-crystal structure of <bold>6</bold> showed that it binds
to the adenosine subpocket, explaining the high selectivity toward tankyrases over
other ARTDs. However, albeit showing an excellent oral bioavailability in mice,
further development of <bold>6</bold> was hampered by poor pharmacokinetics in rats
and concerns regarding solubility and photostability. Structurally, this was
attributed to the extended, highly conjugated, aromatic system incorporating a
vinylic bond in combination with the intrinsically high lipophilicity, low Fsp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2472555218816276">3</xref></sup> content, and a critically high molecular weight for some derivatives.
Collectively, this suggested that incremental structural changes by further
classical optimization may not solve these issues. It was therefore reasoned that a
structure-guided hybridization approach aiming to partially deconstruct the
structure of <bold>6</bold> to a virtual fragment and merge/join it with a new
privileged tankyrase binding motif would provide the necessary significant
structural change while still preserving the binding mode and distinct interaction
pattern for affinity and selectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2472555218816276">54</xref></sup> After analyzing several available tankyrase inhibitor co-crystal structures,
it was hypothesized based on the co-crystal structures of TNKS2-<bold>6</bold> (PDB:
4HYF) and TNKS1-<bold>7</bold> (PDB: 4K4E)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2472555218816276">64</xref></sup> that joining the diaryl substituted 1,2,4-triazole of <bold>6</bold> and the
benzimidazolone of <bold>7</bold> with an appropriate linker would yield a suitable
hybrid inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 6A,B</bold>
</xref>). Three different linker types, phenyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclobutyl, were
chosen as replacements of the vinylic bond to provide the appropriate distance and
conformational adaptability within this new class of tankyrase inhibitors. Docking
was used to check compatibility with the binding pocket, and synthesis of the three
designed inhibitors was accomplished in a nine-step synthesis. Initial testing for
TNKS1 and TNKS2 affinity in a biochemical assay and activity in human embryonic
kidney HEK293 as well as in the human colon SW480 cell lines as functional assays of
the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway revealed compound <bold>8</bold> as the most
potent hybrid tankyrase inhibitor for which activity was observed (HEK293:
IC<sub>50</sub> = 19 nM; SW480: IC<sub>50</sub> = 70 nM), accompanied by a
favorable biochemical IC<sub>50</sub> (TNKS1: IC<sub>50</sub> = 29 nM; TNKS2:
IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.3 nM). Inspection of the co-crystal structure confirmed that
the hybrid inhibitor recapitulated the binding mode of both parent inhibitors (PDB:
5NOB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2472555218816276">
<bold>Fig. 6C</bold>
</xref>). All essential contacts of the used fragments were preserved and addressed
in the protein ligand complex TNKS-<bold>8</bold>. Selectivity profiling showed an
exceptional selectivity over the other ARTD enzymes, and none of the other tested
ARTD enzymes were inhibited at 100 or 10 µM, respectively. This confirmed the
hypothesis that the selectivity characteristics of the parent inhibitors would also
be inherited by the newly designed hybrid compound <bold>8</bold>. In addition,
compound <bold>8</bold> showed no relevant inhibition in an extended kinase
selectivity profiling (320 kinases with &gt;50% inhibition at 10 μM: 4/320; CLK2:
73%; MELK: 70%; PRKG1: 66%; and TSF1: 52%). In line with the favorable calculated
physicochemical properties and Lipinski rule-of-5 compliance, <bold>8</bold> showed
good in vitro ADME properties, proved to be metabolically stable in human liver
fractions across species and in human hepatocytes, and also showed good predicted
absorption properties acceptable for in vivo studies. An overall good
bioavailability in mouse (<italic>F</italic> = 47%), rat (<italic>F</italic> = 35%),
and dog (<italic>F</italic> = 91%) upon oral administration, including a
surprisingly low compound excretion in urine and feces in rat, underscored the
suitability of <bold>8</bold> as a chemical tool for a subsequent pharmacological in
vivo evaluation.</p>

collaboration with Mercachem, Nijmegen, Netherlands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2472555218816276">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>This example shows how essential subsequent medicinal chemistry approaches are for
optimizing initial screening hits to obtain high-quality probes with cellular and
biochemical IC<sub>50</sub> values in the nanomolar range. Moreover, it illustrates
how nonclassical medicinal chemistry approaches can capitalize from available
structural biology information and how a highly interdisciplinary project
environment will favorably impact future chemical tool compound development within
the EU-OPENSCREEN network.</p>

<title>Summary and Outlook</title>
<p>The case studies described above represent only a small subset of the EU-OPENSCREEN
network capabilities. The infrastructure will provide the enabling framework and
resources for fostering discoveries and multinational, multidisciplinary
collaborations in research and development in the field of chemical biology. For
example, a chemical compound discovered or synthesized in Spain will be included in
the EU-OPENSCREEN compound collection, will subsequently meet a biological target
from Finland in a screening experiment conducted at a facility in Germany, and as a
consequence of these collaborative efforts, will trigger a new research and
development program. Moreover, the integration of diverse scientific disciplines is
also demonstrated by the inclusion of the entire natural product drug discovery
pipeline in EU-OPENSCREEN, starting with the isolation of microorganisms from
extreme environments, through fermentation, extraction, and screening, to isolation
and chemical characterization of the bioactive natural products. In a further
extension of EU-OPENSCREEN’s capabilities, a fragment collection of 1000 compounds
will be established in cooperation with the structural biology infrastructure,
INSTRUCT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.instruct-eric.eu">https://www.instruct-eric.eu</ext-link>), and used to support structure-based
discovery efforts on isolated targets. EU-OPENSCREEN will provide users access to
the fragment collection for their screening campaigns and also to medicinal
chemistry expertise to further optimize the identified fragment hits into leads and
tool compounds. Other additions to the library, such as DNA-encoded libraries or
large-molecular-weight compounds other than natural products, are currently not
envisioned, and further library expansions will depend on the funding situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, EU-OPENSCREEN is building synergies as it will cooperate with a number
of other initiatives in Europe (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures
[ESFRI], Joint Programming Initiatives [JPIs], European Research Area Networks
[ERA-NETs], and Innovative Medicines Initiatives [IMIs]), which promote innovation
in the health and environment sectors. In this way, chemical biology research in
Europe can reach a scale competitive to that of other similar large communities in
the United States, Asia, and elsewhere. Common quality and operating standards,
which have been defined in the frame of EU-OPENSCREEN by all participating research
groups, will for the first time allow screening results of different European
platforms to be collected and comparatively analyzed in a joint database. Such data
(e.g., screening results, assay protocols, and chemical information about the
substances and their biological activities), which are generated in expensive
research projects, are currently published only in a limited and restricted manner
(e.g., only selected positive data supporting a hypothesis). The EU-OPENSCREEN
working model will link its database to other life sciences databases and
informatics resources, and actively promote interoperability of produced data.</p>
<p>In the example projects, the wide range of methodological approaches used illustrates
the broad expertise available within the EU-OPENSCREEN partner site network and the
ability to meet the future demands from users. In the malarial target-based drug
discovery project from the Latvian Institute for Organic Synthesis, the original
fragment screen, NMR analyses, and medicinal chemistry design and synthesis allowed
for a structure-informed optimization taking hits with potencies in the range of 25
µM to selective compounds with nanomolar potency and a well-defined
structure–activity relationship (SAR) for the target protein. In the RCC project
from Fundación MEDINA, a natural product workflow was described that identified a
novel lipodepsipeptide, not previously reported in the literature. The compound
MDN-0066 was shown to have an effect on cell cycle regulation via the VHL/HIF
pathway, inducing apoptosis specifically in pVHL-deficient cells. In the ESC
differentiation project from Fraunhofer IME, a high-content phenotypic screening
approach was implemented with assays extending up to 5 days with complex multistep
media replacement, fixation, staining, and imaging protocols. These analyses
revealed pathway-specific inhibitors, which were further elucidated using a
cost-effective analog-by-catalog method, which confirmed the role of ROCK inhibition
in the initiation of ESC differentiation into definitive endoderm. The elaborate
DSF-based biophysical assay system developed at the University of Bergen yielded PCs
with the potential to correct IEMs and rare forms of cancer, based on conformational
stabilization of target proteins in a therapeutic setting. The nonclassical
medicinal chemistry approaches based on available structural biology information, in
conjunction with iterative screening at the FMP medicinal chemistry and screening
partner sites of EU-OPENSCREEN, led to the discovery of novel tankyrase inhibitors,
which recently entered a lead-to-candidate program.</p>
<p>EU-OPENSCREEN will ensure that it also meets the users’ demand for exciting new
technologies and innovative assay designs in the future by regularly updating
existing and/or adding new partner institutions and member countries. Central to
this will be the establishment of a new category of EU-OPENSCREEN partner sites
focused on offering access to chemical proteomic technologies, including
affinity-based and biophysical readouts such as cellular thermal shift assay
platforms. The newly planned sites will allow for the identification of the
underlying targets of compounds identified in phenotypic screens, as well as
off-target and liability-associated activities. These new platforms will be piloted
in the next 3 years as part of the recently established Horizon2020 EU-OPENSCREEN
DRIVE project. Altogether, the result of the work of the EU-OPENSCREEN
infrastructure and its associated community of screening, medicinal chemistry, and
disease biology expert teams will be high-quality chemical probes and bioactivity
data sets for use by the wider life science as well as drug discovery
communities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2472555218816276">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2472555218816276">67</xref></sup></p>
