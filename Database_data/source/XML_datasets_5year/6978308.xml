<p id="Par1">The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene, <italic>MECP2</italic>, is an X chromosome-linked gene encoding the MeCP2 protein, and mutations of <italic>MECP2</italic> cause Rett syndrome (RTT). Previous study has shown that re-expression of SUMO-modified MeCP2 in <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null neurons rescues synaptic and behavioral deficits in <italic>Mecp2</italic> conditional knockout mice, whereas about 12-fold decrease in <italic>Wnt6</italic> mRNA level was found in MeCP2K412R sumo-mutant mice. Here, we examined the role of Wnt6 in MeCP2 T158A mouse model of RTT. Results show that lentiviral delivery of Wnt6 to the amygdala ameliorates locomotor impairment and social behavioral deficits in these animals. MeCP2 T158A mice show decreased level of GSK-3β phosphorylation and increased level of β-catenin phosphorylation. They also show reduced level of MeCP2 SUMOylation. These alterations were also restored by lenti-Wnt6 transduction. Further, both BDNF and IGF-1 expressions are decreased in MeCP2 T158A mice. Overexpression of Wnt6 increases <italic>Bdnf</italic> and <italic>Igf-1</italic> promoter activity in HEK293T cells in a dose-dependent manner. Lenti-Wnt6 transduction to the amygdala similarly increases the mRNA level and protein expression of BDNF and IGF-1 in MeCP2 T158A mice. Moreover, environmental enrichment (EE) similarly ameliorates the locomotor and social behavioral deficits in MeCP2 T158A mice. One of the mechanisms underlying EE is mediated through enhanced MeCP2 SUMOylation and increased Wnt6 expression in these animals by EE.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (<italic>MECP2</italic>) is an X chromosome-linked gene that encodes the MeCP2 protein. MeCP2 contains two major domains, the methyl-DNA binding domain and the transcriptional repression domain, which are both structurally conserved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. MeCP2 was first found to function as a transcriptional repressor. It binds to the CpG island of methylated DNA and recruits co-repressors, such as the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex, for transcriptional repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. But a later study has indicated that MeCP2 could also function as a transcriptional activator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">MeCP2 plays an important role in a few neuro-developmental disorders, and one of them is the Rett syndrome (RTT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. RTT is a rare neurological and developmental disorder and it shares some common features with autism spectrum disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The RTT patients usually develop normally at their infant stage, but regression develops afterwards. The abnormal behaviors usually include motor function deficits, cognitive impairment and other symptoms associated with mental retardation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. RTT is caused by mutations of the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene. So far, more than 200 mutations have been identified that are associated with RTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Some of these mutations are rare, but there are several most commonly seen mutations including T158M, R168X (X represents a premature stop codon), R133C, R106W, P152A, R306C and P376R, and the first three mutations account for approximately 32% of total RTT patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Our previous study reveals that six out of these seven <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations, except MECP2R168X as it lacks the C-terminal domain, show significantly decreased MeCP2 SUMOylation at Lys-412 compared with wild-type (WT) MECP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, re-expression of WT or the sumoylated form of MeCP2 in <italic>Mecp2</italic> conditional knockout mice rescues behavioral and synaptic deficits in these animals. Further cDNA microarray analyses indicate that the mRNA level of <italic>Wnt6</italic> is decreased for approximately 12-fold in the MeCP2K412R sumo-mutant group of animals compared with MeCP2 WT group of animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Wnt proteins and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway play a critical role during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and in adult brain function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Also, it has been highlighted to be a signaling hub for autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Because all the <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations associated with RTT show decreased MeCP2 SUMOylation level and because <italic>Wnt6</italic> mRNA level is dramatically reduced in MeCP2K412R sumo-mutant animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, these observations suggest that deficiency in Wnt6 signaling and its downstream effectors may play a role in the pathogenesis of RTT. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether restoration of Wnt6 signaling rescues the behavioral deficits in <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant mice. We also studied the molecular mechanism of the rescuing effect of Wnt6 and how Wnt6 expression is regulated in the context of RTT. For this purpose, we have adopted the MeCP2 T158A mutant mice as an animal model of RTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Overexpression of Wnt6 in the amygdala reduces locomotor impairment and social behavior deficits in MeCP2 T158A mutant mice</title>
<p id="Par4">Wnt signaling is mediated by the canonical pathway involving GSK-3β and β-catenin and the non-canonical pathway which is β-catenin-independent in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In this experiment, we examined the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway because this pathway was shown to regulate gene transcription, synaptic plasticity, neuronal function and mental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Animals were divided to the following three groups: WT mice received lenti-vector transduction, MeCP2 T158A mice received lenti-vector transduction and MeCP2 T158A mice received lenti-Wnt6 transduction. Because locomotor deficit is often seen in animal models of RTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, we first examined their locomotor activity 12 days after lentiviral transductions. Results revealed that the MeCP2 T158A mutant mice showed significantly decreased number of crossovers in the activity chamber compared with WT mice, but this impairment was significantly rescued by lenti-Wnt6 transduction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). The MeCP2 T158A mice also made less travelling in the activity chamber, but lenti-Wnt6 transduction similarly rescued this motor impairment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>). Immunohistochemical result showed the location of lenti-Wnt6 transduction and expression in the amygdala (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C</xref>). Social behavior deficit is another symptom seen in RTT patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and in mouse models of RTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We also examined whether the MeCP2 T158A mutant mice exhibit social behavior deficits and whether these deficits could be rescued by Wnt6 overexpression. The same animals were subjected to social interaction measures one week after locomotor activity test. Results revealed that the WT mice spent more time sniffing to stranger 1 compared to the empty compartment during the social ability test, but this measure was dramatically decreased in MeCP2 T158A mice. However, this behavioral deficit was significantly, although partially, rescued in MeCP2 T158A mice receiving lenti-Wnt6 transduction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1D</xref>). Similar results were obtained for the social novelty test. The WT mice spent more time sniffing to stranger 2 compared to stranger 1. This measure was dramatically decreased in MeCP2 T158A mice, but it was partially, yet significantly, rescued by lenti-Wnt6 transduction to MeCP2 T158A mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1E</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overexpression of Wnt6 to the amygdala reduces locomotor impairment and social behavior deficits in MeCP2 T158A mutant mice.

<p id="Par5">Animals were sacrificed after the social novelty test and their amygdala tissue was dissected out for various western blot analyses. Results indicated that the phosphorylation level of Ser-9 GSK-3β was significantly decreased in MeCP2 T158A mice compared with WT mice, but this phenomenon was restored by lenti-Wnt6 transduction to MeCP2 T158A mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1F</xref>). On the other hand, the phosphorylation level of β-catenin at Ser33/37/Thr41 was significantly increased in MeCP2 T158A mice compared with WT mice, but lenti-Wnt6 transduction similarly reversed β-catenin phosphorylation to the control level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1F</xref>). The GSK-3β and β-catenin expression level remains similar among these three groups of animals. The quantified results are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1G</xref>. Because transduction of lenti-Wnt6 successfully rescued the deficiency of GSK-3β phosphorylation and the increased level of β-catenin phosphorylation in MeCP2 T158A mice and these mice also have a reduced level of MeCP2 SUMOylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, we next examined whether lenti-Wnt6 transduction also rescues the deficiency of MeCP2 SUMOylation in these animals. Results revealed that there is a consistent and dramatic decrease in the level of MeCP2 SUMOylation in MeCP2 T158A mice, but lenti-Wnt6 transduction successfully rescued this deficit (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1H</xref>).

<p id="Par7">Next, we examined whether overexpression of Wnt6 actually restores <italic>Bdnf</italic> and <italic>Igf-1</italic> mRNA level in MeCP2 T158A mice. Lenti-Wnt6 vector (or lentivector) was transducted to the amygdala of MeCP2 T158A mice. WT animals received lentivector transduction and served as the control group. Results revealed that <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA level was significantly decreased in the amygdala of MeCP2 T158A mice, but lenti-Wnt6 transduction to MeCP2 T158A mice restored the <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA level to that of WT animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2E</xref>, left panel).

<title>Environmental enrichment (EE) upregulates MeCP2 SUMOylation and Wnt6, BDNF as well as IGF-1 expression and alleviates behavioral deficits in MeCP2 T158A mice</title>
<p id="Par8">Animal behavior is regulated by both genetic and environmental factors.

The MeCP2 T158A mice were either housed in their home cage or subjected to EE (1 h per day with 30 min in the morning and 30 min in the afternoon for 14 days consecutively). The WT mice housed in the home cage served as the control group. At the end of EE, they were subjected to locomotor activity measure and social interaction measure. Results revealed that MeCP2 T158A mice showed significant impairment in their locomotor activity, but EE significantly restored this impairment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>). The same animals were subjected to social interaction measure one week later. Results revealed that WT mice spent more time sniffing to stranger 1 than to the empty compartment for the social ability test.

<p id="Par9">Animals were sacrificed after social behavior measures and their amygdala tissue was dissected out for determination of MeCP2 SUMOylation and Wnt6 expression. Results revealed that MeCP2 SUMOylation level was dramatically decreased in MeCP2 T158A mice, but this deficiency was significantly rescued by EE treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3D</xref>). Similarly, Wnt6 expression was markedly decreased in MeCP2 T158A mice, but this reduction was completely restored by EE treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3E</xref>). Because overexpression of Wnt6 restored BDNF and IGF-1 expression in MeCP2 T158A mice and EE restored Wnt6 level in MeCP2 T158A mice, it is expected that EE should also restore BDNF and IGF-1 level in MeCP2 T158A mice. This speculation was examined here. Results revealed that the expression level of BDNF and IGF-1 was consistently decreased in MeCP2 T158A mice, but EE markedly restored both BDNF and IGF-1 expression in these animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3E</xref>). The quantified results are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3F</xref>. Further, EE was suggested to increase neuronal plasticity, at least in part, through the mediation of NMDA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Because EE rescues Wnt6 expression in MeCP2 T158A mice, it is likely that NMDA receptor activation may also upregulate Wnt6 expression. We examined this hypothesis here.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par10">Previous study has shown that decreased MeCP2 SUMOylation is found in several <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations associated with RTT and nearly 12-fold reduction of <italic>Wnt6</italic> mRNA level is observed in MeCP2 sumo-mutant animals compared with MeCP2 WT animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addressing the role of Wnt6, we have presently found that restoration of Wnt6/β-catenin signaling partially, but significantly, rescued locomotor activity impairment and social behavioral deficits in MeCP2 T158A mice. One of the underlying mechanisms is due to increased expression of BDNF and IGF-1 by Wnt6 overexpression. These results are consistent with the observations that activation of TrkB receptor restores memory in RTT mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and that recombinant human IGF-1 treatment recovers behavioral impairment in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. They are also congruent with the literature that deregulation of Wnt signaling is associated with some mental and mood disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. It would be ideal to also measure the nuclear β-catenin level in MeCP2 T158A mice and in MeCP2 T158A mice transducted with lenti-Wnt6; however, the amygdala tissue lysate obtained from each animal is not enough to do co-immunoprecipitation for nuclear β-catenin, various western blotting and MeCP2 SUMOylation shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1F</xref>. Yet, the phosphorylation level of β-catenin is more important than the nuclear level of β-catenin in terms of Wnt6/β-catenin signaling. In addition, previous report shows that MeCP2 SUMOylation regulates Wnt6 expression and that BDNF and IGF-1 treatments both enhance MeCP2 SUMOylation. We have presently found that overexpression of Wnt6 rescued downregulation of BDNF and IGF-1 in MeCP2 T158A mice. These results implicate that Wnt6 may upregulate MeCP2 SUMOylation through increased BDNF and IGF-1 expression. These results together also suggest that there may exist a positive loop of regulation between MeCP2 SUMOylation and Wnt6 expression that is beneficial to RTT. This explanation is supported by our observation that overexpression of Wnt6 rescued MeCP2 SUMOylation deficit in MeCP2 T158A mice. But the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation requires further investigation. Further, the present result from ChIP assay suggests that BDNF and IGF-1 expression is regulated by CREB directly, and the <italic>MeCP2T158M</italic> mutant, which manifests a significant decrease in MeCP2 SUMOylation level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, also showed significant reduction in CREB binding to the <italic>Bdnf</italic> and <italic>Igf-1</italic> promoters. These deficits could be rescued by Wnt6 overexpression. On the other hand, although overexpression of Wnt6 effectively ameliorated these behavioral deficits, it did not completely rescue these deficits. One possible explanation is that genes other than <italic>Wnt6</italic> also play important roles in alleviating RTT. This explanation is supported by our earlier finding that many genes show several-fold downregulation in their mRNA levels in MeCP2 sumo-mutant animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Besides, complicated molecular mechanisms underlie the pathology of RTT, and MeCP2 T158M mutation is the most severe mutation in RTT patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, it is conceivable that restoration of Wnt6/β-catenin signaling is not sufficient to completely rescue these behavioral deficits. Moreover, lenti-Wnt6 vector transduction was made only to a limited area in the amygdala. Neuronal activation in this area may not be sufficient for full behavioral recovery.</p>
<p id="Par11">Previous studies have shown that EE at pre-weaning period improves motor function in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and EE ameliorates motor coordination deficit in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutant mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In the present study, we have found that EE significantly improved locomotor activity in MeCP2 T158A mice. Extended from this result, we have found that EE also improved the social interaction behavior in MeCP2 T158A mice. In examination of the underlying mechanism, we found that EE enhanced the level of MeCP2 SUMOylation and the expression level of Wnt6, BDNF and IGF-1 in the amygdala of these animals. These results are consistent with our earlier finding that <italic>Wnt6</italic> mRNA expression is strongly regulated by MeCP2 SUMOylation and enhanced MeCP2 SUMOylation rescues the behavioral deficits in <italic>Mecp2</italic> conditional knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, we have provided novel molecular mechanisms of EE in the context of RTT. These results are also congruent with another report showing that EE improves memory function in vascular dementia rats associated with activation of Wnt3a signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. It is conceivable that EE activates many more genes other than <italic>Wnt6</italic>, yet EE could not completely rescue the behavioral deficits of MeCP2 T158A mice. These results suggest that certain defects in MeCP2 T158A mice are not able to be modulated by enhanced neuronal plasticity.</p>
<p id="Par12">In this study, we found that EE and NMDA administration both increased the expression of Wnt6. We have earlier found that NMDA treatment enhances MeCP2 SUMOylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Because NMDA receptor activation mediates, in part, the effect of EE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, these results together suggest that EE may increase MeCP2 SUMOylation and upregulate Wnt6 expression through the mediation of NMDA receptors. Moreover, <italic>Mecp2T158M</italic> mutation shows decreased methyl-DNA binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, but we have presently found that EE enhanced Wnt6 expression in MeCP2 T158A mice. Whether EE alters MeCP2 methyl-DNA binding of these mice or that EE increases Wnt6 expression in these animals through other mechanisms, such as decreased association between MeCP2T158A and HDAC1, requires further investigation.</p>
<p id="Par13">In the present study, the MeCP2 T158A mice showed both locomotor activity impairment and social behavior deficits. The result of locomotor activity impairment is consistent with the finding that locomotor deficit is often seen in animal models of RTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It is possible that the observed social behavior deficits are partly contributed by the motor function impairment in these animals. However, the extent of social behavior impairment is greater than that of motor activity impairment comparing the MeCP2 T158A mice to WT mice (approximately 90% vs. 70%). This result suggests that <italic>Mecp2T158A</italic> mutation indeed affects social behavior <italic>per se</italic>. However, the amygdala is not primarily involved in motor control and there is little literature linking dysfunction of emotion control regulated by the amygdala and motor behavior, yet we have found that overexpression of Wnt6 in the amygdala partially rescued locomotor activity impairment in MeCP2 T158A mice. Because the amygdala is known to regulate dopamine release from the nucleus accumbens, an area regulates motor behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, it is possible that overexpressed Wnt6 regulates the projection from the amygdala to the nucleus accumbens and dopamine release from this area, that consequently regulates locomotor activity. But it is possible that other amygdala pathways are also involved in motor regulation. For example, anatomical tracing study reveals a major projection from the basolateral amygdala to the rostral cingulate motor cortex and a light projection from the basolateral amygdala to the caudal cingulate motor cortex in the rhesus monkey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. These projections may regulate certain emotion-related motor functions. To further elaborate the underlying mechanism, it would be helpful to directly transduct the Wnt6 vector to the nucleus accumbens or the motor cortex of MeCP2 T158A mice and examine their motor behaviors.</p>
<p id="Par14">Wnt proteins play important roles in development, synapse formation, neuronal circuitry, cognitive function and certain neurological disorders.

During the social ability test, a stranger 1 mouse was placed inside the cylinder in the left compartment with the cylinder on the right compartment empty. The test subject was placed in the middle chamber for 10 min and its sniffing time toward stranger 1 and the empty chamber was recorded. At the end of the test, the test subject and stranger 1 were taken out and the chambers were cleaned. Ten minutes later, the test subject and stranger 1 were placed back to their original chambers, respectively. Meanwhile, a stranger 2 mouse was placed in the cylinder on the right compartment. The sniffing time of the test subject to stranger 1 and stranger 2 was recorded during the 10 min observation period and it is regarded as the social novelty measure.</p>
