<p id="Par1">Platelets are highly sensitive blood cells, which play central role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Platelet dense granules carry considerable amount of neurotransmitter glutamate that is exocytosed upon cell activation. As platelets also express glutamate receptors on their surface, it is pertinent to ask whether exposure to glutamate would affect their signalling within a growing thrombus. In this study we demonstrate that, glutamate <italic>per se</italic> induced synthesis of thrombogenic peptides, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and hypoxia-inducible factor-2α, from pre-existing mRNAs in enucleate platelets, stimulated cytosolic calcium entry, upregulated RhoA-ROCK-myosin light chain/myosin light chain phosphatase axis, and elicited extensive shedding of extracellular vesicles from platelets. Glutamate, too, incited platelet spreading and adhesion on to immobilized matrix under arterial shear, raised mitochondrial transmembrane potential associated with generation of reactive oxygen species and induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in platelets. Taken together, glutamate switches human platelets to pro-activation phenotype mediated mostly through AMPA receptors and thus targeting glutamate receptors may be a promising anti-platelet strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Platelets, sub-cellular fragments derived from megakaryocytes, circulate in blood as tiny discs of 2–4 µm diameters. During vascular injury platelets quickly adhere to exposed subendothelial proteins as well as to each other to form macroscopic aggregates that seal breach in endothelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, pathological activation of platelets can lead to formation of occlusive thrombi accompanied with serious consequences like acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Platelets have considerable presence of glutamate in their dense granules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> coexistent with thrombogenic mediators like adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin and Ca<sup>2+ </sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, all of whom are exocytosed upon platelet activation. Secreted ADP, serotonin and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) bind to respective receptors on platelet surface and establish positive feedback loops to potentiate platelet stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Pharmacological inhibitors of ADP receptors and cyclooxygenase are among the first line of anti-platelet medications employed against cardiovascular disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. As platelets express glutamate receptors (see below) and serum glutamate rises locally between 400–800 µM during thrombus formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, it is pertinent to ask whether glutamate can, too, behave in autocrine/paracrine manner similar to ADP and TXA2 to augment platelet stimulation and recruit fresh platelets in thrombus.</p>
<p id="Par3">Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian cortex that plays critical role in functioning of brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Platelets are considered as peripheral model of neurons as both cell types share morphological and functional similarities attributable to their common ectodermic origin. Platelet membrane possesses two broadly classified glutamate receptors - metabotropic and ionotropic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The former is the G protein-coupled receptor that recruits diacylglycerol and cAMP for signal amplification. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels permitting non-specific entry of cations, and are categorized into 3 subfamilies, N-methy-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and kainate receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Although glutamate has been reported to potentiate agonist-induced platelet activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, its effect on platelet signalling <italic>per se</italic> remains unclear.</p>
<p id="Par4">We have recently reported pro-thrombotic attributes of amyloidogenic neurotoxic peptides like amyloid beta and prion protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In the present study we demonstrate that, glutamate switches human platelets to pro-activation phenotype as reflected from synthesis of thrombogenic peptides from pre-existing mRNAs, activation of RhoA-Rho kinase-myosin light chain (MLC) signalling axis, extensive shedding of extracellular vesicles (EVs), augmented spreading on immobilized matrix, and formation of large platelet microthrombi under arterial shear. Strikingly, AMPA receptor antagonist mitigates the thrombogenic effect of glutamate on platelets. Thus, targeting glutamate receptors combined with inhibition of cyclooxygenase and purinergic ADP receptors can be a potential anti-platelet therapeutic strategy.</p>

<p id="Par5">Cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a critical regulator of platelet activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Incubation of platelets with increasing doses (100, 200 and 500 μM) of glutamate in presence of 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> led to significant rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (from basal 78.21 ± 4.77 nM to 113.85 ± 4.91, 137.44 ± 5.31 and 172.27 ± 27.40 nM, respectively) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>), which dropped significantly following prior exposure to 100 µM L-Glutamic acid, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), antagonist of AMPAR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A,C</xref>). In order to examine the source of raised intracellular calcium, we chelated external calcium with 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) followed by addition of 500 μM glutamate.

<title>Glutamate induces shedding of EVs from platelets</title>

Exposure of platelets to 100 µM glutamate evoked release of 2.28 × 10<sup>8</sup> ± 0.85 EVs/ml (in size range 100–250 nm, 90% of population being between 150–200 nm) from platelets, which was increased by 1.36- and 1.55-folds in presence of 200 and 500 µM glutamate, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>). Remarkably, EVs released from glutamate-treated platelets bound Alexa fluor 488-labeled fibrinogen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2C,D</xref>), suggestive of thrombogenic milieu prompted by glutamate.

<title>Glutamate induces RhoA activity in human platelets</title>
<p id="Par10">We next studied the effect of glutamate on activation of RhoA-ROCK-MLC/MLC phosphatase (MYPT1) pathway, which regulates remodelling of platelet cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Exposure of platelets to 500 µM glutamate for 5 min did not elicit any significant change in phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1. However, following 10 min exposure, of glutmate induced phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1 by 87.79% ± 2.34 and 21.31% ± 3.38, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A–C</xref>), which was reversed by 10 µM Y27632, a pharmacological inhibitor of ROCK (by 31.13% ± 2.04 and 21.5% ± 3.29, respectively), as well as by AMPA receptor inhibitor CNQX (by 22.72% ± 2.28 and 20.56% ± 3.12, respectively) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A–C</xref>). As RhoA regulates phosphoryaltion of MLC/MYPT1 through effector kinase ROCK, we subsequently evaluated RhoA activity in glutamate-treated platelets by pulldown assay. Glutamate elicited significant rise in expression of RhoA-GTP (by 53.21% ± 0.79) in platelets, which was abrogated upon pre-treatment with either Y27632 or CNQX (by 36.16% ± 0.63 and 45.38% ± 0.61, respectively) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4D,E</xref>).

<title>Glutamate induces synthesis of hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in human platelets</title>
<p id="Par11">We have earlier demonstrated that, platelets synthesize HIF-2α through an oxygen-independent non-canonical path when challenged with physiological agonists like thrombin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We asked now whether glutamate, too, can stimulate synthesis of HIF-2α from pre-existing mRNA in enucleate platelets. Glutamate (500 µM) increased expression of HIF-2α in platelets by 70.28% ± 0.11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5A,B</xref>). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which stabilizes fibrin-rich thrombus, is a target gene of HIF-2α in renal carcinoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated that, platelets synthesize PAI-1 when stimulated with agonists including thrombin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Remarkably, we found that glutamate was able to induce translation of PAI-1 by 49.03% ± 0.63 in platelets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5A,C</xref>) in parallel with expression of HIF-2α. Both synthesis of HIF-2α and PAI-1 were inhibited by 10 mM puromycin, pharmacological inhibitor of protein translation, by 32.76% ± 0.16 and 19.48% ± 0.70, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5A–C</xref>).

<title>Glutamate affects mitochondrial function</title>
<p id="Par12">Glutamate has been reported to modulate mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) and basal cellular respiration in murine hippocampal HT22 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In the present study glutamate significantly enhanced ΔΨ in MitoTracker Red-treated platelets by 30.43% ± 3.89 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6A,B</xref>). Glutamate also enhanced ROS yield in platelets by 55.66% ± 6.57 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6C,D</xref>), which can be attributed to mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization. CNQX normalized glutamate-induced rise in ΔΨ by 44.33% ± 12.1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6A,B</xref>). As expected, protonophore 100 µM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP) used as control dissipated mitochondrial transmembrane potential. To evaluate the effect of glutamate on mitochondrial respiratory function, we measured mitochondria oxygen comsumption rate using Clark amperometric electrode at high resolution (sampling at 2 s intervals). Glutamate, however, had no stimulatory effect on platelet oxygen consumption (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6F</xref>), which was consistent with hyperpolarized state of mitochondrial membrane in a coupled system.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Glutamate affects platelet mitochondrial function.

Keeping with this, glutamate was found to significantly increase phosphorylation of AMPK (by 67.50% ± 1.03) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7A</xref>, upper panel), suggestive of enhanced activity of the enzyme in platelets, which was inhibited by CNQX (by 28.66% ± 1.43). In consistence, glutamate also significantly enhanced phosphorylation (by 65.11% ± 1.34) of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), an AMPK substrate, following 10 min incubation with platelets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7A</xref>, lower panel). As a positive control 1 mM 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), an AMP analog, was employed to stimulate AMPK. These results were supportive of state of relative ATP depletion in glutamate-treated platelets consistent with hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Glutamate stimulates AMPK and ACC in platelets.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par14">In the present study we have demonstrated that, neurotransmitter glutamate can modulate platelet signalling <italic>per se</italic> in the absence of physiological agonists. Glutamate elicited extensive shedding of EVs from platelets, induced platelet adhesion on to immobilized collagen under arterial shear and cell spreading, provoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry from external medium and stimulated synthesis of thrombogenic peptides, PAI-1 (that stabilizes fibrin-rich thrombus) and HIF-2α, all being hallmarks of pro-activation phenotype. Although PAI-1 is a target gene of HIF-2α in renal cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, platelets lack genomic DNA and have limited capacity to synthesize peptides. Glutamate has been shown to stimulate HIF translation in TNBC cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We have recently demonstrated that, platelets express HIF-2α when challenged with thrombin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Strikingly, present observation adds glutamate to the existing list of agonists that induce protein synthesis in enucleate platelets.</p>
<p id="Par15">As small GTPase RhoA is a critical regulator cytoskeletal reorganization in activated platelets, we probed RhoA-mediated signalling in cells challenged with glutamate. Pre-treatment with glutamate-stimulated phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1, which were reversed by antagonists of ROCK (Rho effector kinase) as well as AMPAR. Consistent with this, glutamate potentiated GTP-loading of RhoA in platelets that validated activation of RhoA-ROCK-MLC/MYPT1 axis downstream of glutamate-AMPAR interaction. As glutamate was not found to stimulate mitochondrial oxygen flux, we predicted relative ATP depletion in glutamate-treated platelets. In agreement with this, activity of AMPK was found to be upregulated in platelets by glutamate.</p>
<p id="Par16">Thrombin is known to activate RhoA-MLC axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, release EVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, induce synthesis of PAI-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>/HIF-2α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and activate AMPK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> in platelets. Glutamate has earlier been shown to potentiate agonist-induced platelet activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Here we demonstrate that, glutamate <italic>per se</italic> at concentrations up to 500 µM brought about synthesis of thrombogenic peptides and extensive modulation in platelet signalling, mediated mostly through AMPA receptors, thus switching cells to pro-thrombotic phenotype. Glutamate, however, was neither able to induce platelet aggregation nor binding of PAC-1 (that specifically identifies the active conformation of platelet membrane integrins α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>) at above concentrations (Supplementary Figs <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>, respectively). Thus, we infer that glutamate did not incite inside-out signalling mediated through platelet integrins that would have led to fibrinogen binding and aggregation.</p>
<p id="Par17">Plasma glutamate is elevated under neurological pathologies like blood-brain barrier breakdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and ischemic stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Glutamate is also released from platelets in excess of 400 µM (in the concentration range 400–800 µM) into plasma during thrombus formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. As glutamate could establish positive feedback loops to potentiate platelet stimulation in autocrine/paracrine manner similar to ADP and TXA2, targeting glutamate signalling in combination with established anti-platelet regimens may be a plausible therapeutic option.</p>
