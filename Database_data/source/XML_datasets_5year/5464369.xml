<abstract>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Background</title>
<p id="P1">The 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion (Burnside-Butler susceptibility locus) is an emerging condition with over 200 individuals reported in the literature. <italic>TUBGCP5</italic>, <italic>CFYIP1</italic>, <italic>NIPA1</italic> and <italic>NIPA2</italic> genes are located in this chromosome 15 region and when disturbed individually are known to cause neurological, cognitive or behavioural problems as well as playing a role in both Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. These syndromes were the first examples in humans of genomic imprinting and typically caused by a deletion but involving the distal chromosome 15q11-q13 breakpoint BP3 and proximally placed breakpoints BP1 or BP2 of different parental origin. The typical 15q11-q13 deletion involves BP1 and BP3 and the typical type II deletion at BP2 and BP3. Several studies have shown that individuals with the larger type I deletion found in both Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes are reported with more severe neurodevelopmental symptoms compared to those individuals with the smaller type II deletion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="P2">The literature was reviewed and clinical and cytogenetic findings summarised in 200 individuals with this microdeletion along with the role of deleted genes in diagnosis, medical care and counseling of those affected and their family members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Results</title>
<p id="P3">Reported findings in this condition include developmental delays (73% of cases) and language impairment (67%) followed by motor delay (42%), ADD/ADHD (35%) and autism spectrum disorder (27%). The de novo frequency has been estimated at 5 to 22% with low penetrance possibly related to subclinical manifestation or incomplete clinical information on family members. A prevalence of 0.6 to 1.3% has been identified in one study for patients with neurological or behavioural problems presenting for genetic services and chromosomal microarray analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P4">The summarised results indicate that chromosome 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion is emerging as one of the most common cytogenetic abnormalities seen in individuals with intellectual impairment, autism spectrum disorder and other related behavioural or clinical findings but more research is needed.</p>
