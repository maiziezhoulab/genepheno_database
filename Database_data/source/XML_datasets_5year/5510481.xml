<sec id="S1">
<title>Purpose of review</title>
<p id="P1">Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) is a complex musculoskeletal pediatric disorder characterized by osteochondromas that form next to the growth plates of many skeletal elements, including long bones, ribs and vertebrae. Due to its intricacies and unresolved issues, HME continues to pose major challenges to both clinicians and biomedical researchers. The purpose of this review is to describe and analyze recent advances in this field and point to possible targets and strategies for future biologically-based therapeutic intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Recent findings</title>
<p id="P2">Most HME cases are linked to loss-of-function mutations in <italic>EXT1</italic> or <italic>EXT2</italic> that encode glycosyltrasferases responsible for heparan sulfate (HS) synthesis, leading to HS deficiency. Recent genomic inquires have extended those findings, but have yet to provide a definitive genotype-phenotype correlation. Clinical studies emphasize that in addition to the well-known skeletal problems caused by the osteochondromas; HME patients can experience, and suffer from, other symptoms and health complications such as chronic pain and nerve impingement. Laboratory work has produced novel insights into alterations in cellular and molecular mechanisms instigated by HS deficiency and subtending onset and growth of osteochondroma and how such changes could be targeted toward therapeutic ends.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Summary</title>
<p id="P3">HME is a rare and orphan disease and as such, is being studied only by a handful of clinical and basic investigators. Despite this limitation, significant advances have been made in the last few years, and the future bodes well for deciphering more thoroughly its pathogenesis and in turn, identifying a most effective treatment for osteochondroma prevention.</p>
