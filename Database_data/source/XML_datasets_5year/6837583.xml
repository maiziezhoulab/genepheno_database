<abstract>
<p>The pre- and postsynaptic membranes comprising the synaptic junction differ in protein composition. The membrane trafficking mechanisms by which neurons control surface polarization of synaptic receptors remain poorly understood. The sorting receptor Sortilin-related CNS expressed 1 (SorCS1) is a critical regulator of trafficking of neuronal receptors, including the presynaptic adhesion molecule neurexin (Nrxn), an essential synaptic organizer. Here, we show that SorCS1 maintains a balance between axonal and dendritic Nrxn surface levels in the same neuron. Newly synthesized Nrxn1α traffics to the dendritic surface, where it is endocytosed. Endosomal SorCS1 interacts with the Rab11 GTPase effector Rab11 family-interacting protein 5 (Rab11FIP5)/Rab11 interacting protein (Rip11) to facilitate the transition of internalized Nrxn1α from early to recycling endosomes and bias Nrxn1α surface polarization towards the axon. In the absence of SorCS1, Nrxn1α accumulates in early endosomes and mispolarizes to the dendritic surface, impairing presynaptic differentiation and function. Thus, SorCS1-mediated sorting in dendritic endosomes controls Nrxn axonal surface polarization required for proper synapse development and function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurons are highly compartmentalized cells that need to maintain distinct membrane identities. This is especially clear at the synapse, where pre- and postsynaptic membranes differ dramatically in their protein composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref001">1</xref>]. Membrane trafficking mechanisms that organize and maintain the polarized distribution of receptor proteins during the formation, maturation, and plasticity of synapses are of key importance for the proper function of neural circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Neurexins (Nrxns), expressed from 3 genes as α-, β-, and γ-Nrxns, are essential presynaptic adhesion molecules that engage in a network of interactions with multiple pre- and postsynaptic extracellular ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref004">4</xref>] and act in a cell-type–specific manner to regulate synapse number, function, and plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref009">9</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>NRXNs</italic> have been associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, especially schizophrenia and autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref012">12</xref>], underscoring the importance of Nrxns for circuit function. Despite their essential role, the molecular mechanisms that control presynaptic polarization and abundance of Nrxns are largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref013">13</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that surface trafficking of Nrxns requires the C-terminal PSD-95/discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref015">15</xref>] and that surface mobility depends on synaptic activity and interaction with extracellular ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The vertebrate Sortilin-related CNS expressed 1–3 (SorCS1-3) proteins are sorting receptors belonging to the vacuolar protein sorting 10 (VPS10P) family receptors that have emerged as major regulators of intracellular protein trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref019">19</xref>]. SorCS proteins are required for the surface expression of glutamate receptors, neurotrophin receptors, transporters, and adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref024">24</xref>]. These sorting receptors are thus essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity, but the mechanisms by which SorCS proteins sort their cargo are poorly understood. Using quantitative proteomics analysis, we recently established a critical role for SorCS1 in Nrxn surface trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref020">20</xref>]. Although our previous observations suggested that SorCS1 might regulate endosomal trafficking of Nrxn, the intracellular pathway via which Nrxn is trafficked to synapses, the regulation thereof by SorCS1, and the relevance of SorCS1-mediated sorting of Nrxn and other axonal cargo proteins for synaptic development and function remained elusive.</p>
<p>Here, we use epitope-tagging to elucidate the subcellular localization of endogenous SorCS1 and Nrxn1α. We show that SorCS1 acts in dendritic endosomes to control a balance between the axonal and dendritic surface distribution of Nrxn1α in the same neuron. Although predominantly considered to be a presynaptic molecule, we find that newly synthesized Nrxn1α first traffics to dendrites, where it is endocytosed, followed by transcytosis to the axon. SorCS1 controls Nrxn axonal surface polarization by facilitating the transition of endocytosed Nrxn from early to recycling endosomes and does so by interacting with Rab11 family-interacting protein 5 (Rab11FIP5)/Rab11 interacting protein (Rip11), a novel SorCS1 cytoplasmic binding partner we identify. In the absence of SorCS1, Nrxn1α accumulates in early endosomes and mispolarizes to the dendritic surface, impairing presynaptic differentiation induced by the postsynaptic Nrxn ligand Neuroligin (Nlgn). This defect can be rescued by a Nrxn1α mutant that bypasses SorCS1-mediated sorting and transcytosis to polarize to the axonal surface, but not by wild type (WT) Nrxn1α. Finally, we show that SorCS1 is required for presynaptic function. Together, our observations indicate that SorCS1-mediated sorting in dendritic endosomes controls Nrxn axonal surface polarization required for proper synapse development and function.</p>

<p>We first determined the subcellular distribution of endogenous SorCS1, which has been difficult to assess because of a lack of suitable antibodies.

<p>To begin to elucidate how SorCS1 regulates membrane trafficking of its cargo Nrxn, we electroporated cortical <italic>Sorcs1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> mouse neurons with Cre recombinase (Cre) to remove SorCS1 (<italic>Sorcs1</italic> knock out [KO]). We transfected neurons with HA-Nrxn1α, one of the most abundant Nrxn isoforms in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref026">26</xref>], and live-labeled them with an HA antibody to detect surface Nrxn1α, followed by Ankyrin-G (AnkG) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) immunodetection to label the axonal and dendritic compartment, respectively. Loss of SorCS1 decreased Nrxn1α axonal surface levels and concomitantly increased dendritic surface levels in the same cell, changing Nrxn1α surface polarization from axonal to dendritic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>).

In contrast, rescue with an endocytosis-defective mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref027">27</xref>] of SorCS1 (SorCS1<sup>Y1132A</sup>), which remains on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s007">S1C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s007">S1D Fig</xref>), did not rescue Nrxn1α surface polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). To determine whether SorCS1 controls the subcellular distribution of endogenous Nrxn, we immunostained <italic>Sorcs1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> neurons electroporated with Cre or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with a pan-Nrxn antibody directed against the conserved cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s007">S1E Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s007">S1F Fig</xref>), which specifically labels endogenous Nrxn (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s007">S1G Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s007">S1H Fig</xref>). Similar to the observations with transfected HA-Nrxn1α in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons, loss of SorCS1 reduced axonal intensity of endogenous Nrxn and decreased the axonal–dendritic ratio compared with control neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s007">S1E Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s007">S1F Fig</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of SorCS1<sup>WT</sup> in hippocampal neurons, which express very low levels of <italic>Sorcs1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref029">29</xref>], increased Nrxn1α axonal surface polarization and concurrently decreased dendritic surface levels, whereas overexpression of SorCS1<sup>Y1132A</sup> did not alter Nrxn1α surface polarization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s007">S1I Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s007">S1J Fig</xref>). Together, these results indicate that somatodendritic SorCS1 controls an axonal–dendritic surface balance of Nrxn1α. Our findings suggest that SorCS1 is either required for endocytosis of Nrxn1α or acts in endosomes to bias Nrxn1α surface polarization toward the axon.</p>

<p>To determine how Nrxn1α is trafficked in cortical neurons, we employed the retention using selective hooks (RUSH) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref034">34</xref>] to retain Nrxn1α in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induced synchronous release and transport through the secretory pathway by applying biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). We performed live-cell imaging in 8 through 10 DIV rat cortical neurons co-expressing streptavidin-binding protein (SBP)-EGFP-Nrxn1α (reporter) and streptavidin-ER retention signal KDEL (KDEL) (ER hook), which were live-labeled with an antibody against the axon initial segment (AIS) protein Neurofascin to visualize the axonal compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s009">S3A Fig</xref>). At t = 0, we observed diffuse SBP-EGFP-Nrxn1α fluorescence in soma and dendrites, in a pattern resembling the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Following application of biotin, Nrxn1α fluorescence coalesced into punctate structures that started trafficking abundantly in the somatodendritic compartment, followed by Nrxn1α trafficking in the axon after a marked delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s001">S1 Movie</xref>).

Kymograph analysis showed a small increase in the mean number of motile vesicles present in dendrites at late (1–2 h) compared with early (20–34 min) time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s002">S2 Movie</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s003">S3 Movie</xref>). Shortly after ER release, the majority of vesicles in dendrites moved in the anterograde direction, shifting to a retrograde movement at the later time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s009">S3C Fig</xref>). Strikingly, motile Nrxn1α vesicles were absent in axons shortly after ER release but increased dramatically at late time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g002">Fig 2H and 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s002">S2 Movie</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s003">S3 Movie</xref>).

<p>We performed several controls to verify that the delayed axonal trafficking of Nrxn1α is not an artefact of prolonged retention in the ER and synchronized release, which might overwhelm the trafficking machinery. Trafficking of the somatodendritic cargo protein transferrin receptor (TfR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref035">35</xref>] was detected only in the somatodendritic compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s009">S3E Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s009">S3F Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s004">S4 Movie</xref>). In the absence of biotin, dendritic SBP-EGFP-Nrxn1α-positive structures were not motile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s005">S5 Movie</xref>), indicating that the delayed trafficking of Nrxn1α to axons is not simply caused by prolonged ER retention. Moreover, immature DIV3 neurons displayed Nrxn1α trafficking to the axonal compartment shortly after biotin application (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s009">S3G Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s009">S3H Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s006">S6 Movie</xref>), further indicating that the delayed axonal trafficking of Nrxn1α in mature neurons does not result from prolonged retention in the ER but correlates with the maturation state of the neuron.

<title>Nrxn1α is transcytosed from the dendritic surface to axons</title>
<p>Our observations suggest a dendrite-to-axon transcytotic pathway for axonal surface polarization of Nrxn1α.

To determine whether Nrxn1α is internalized from the dendritic plasma membrane, we followed the fate of Nrxn1α throughout the endosomal pathway.

Expression of GTP binding-deficient mutants of Rab5 (S34N) and Rab11 (S25N) to interfere with transport to EEs and REs, respectively, mimicked the effect of blocking endocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s011">S5E–S5H Fig</xref>). However, expression of Rab7 (T22N) to interfere with transport to late endosomes did not affect the axonal surface polarization of Nrxn1α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s011">S5I Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s011">S5J Fig</xref>). Thus, endocytosis, EE and RE transport, but not late endosomal transport, are required for accumulation of Nrxn1α on the axonal plasma membrane, indicating transcytotic trafficking of Nrxn1α.</p>

Colocalization of internalized Nrxn1α with Rab11-positive REs in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons was decreased in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>) and even more strongly reduced in the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>). Thus, endocytosed Nrxn1α accumulates in EEs and is missorted to Rab4-fast REs in the absence of SorCS1-mediated sorting. These observations are consistent with our finding that dendritic surface levels of Nrxn1α are increased in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>), which is likely due to increased recycling of Nrxn1α via Rab4-fast REs back to the dendritic plasma membrane. Similarly, the reduced axonal surface levels of Nrxn1α in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>) likely result from decreased sorting of Nrxn1α to Rab11-REs. Together, these results demonstrate that SorCS1 controls axonal surface polarization of Nrxn1α by facilitating the transition from EEs to Rab11-REs.</p>

<p>We reasoned that SorCS1 might interact with additional proteins to facilitate Nrxn1α sorting from early to REs. Rab11FIP5 or Rip11 is prominently present in the raw mass spectrometry (MS) data set we obtained after affinity purification (AP) of SorCS1 complexes from rat brain extracts with 2 independent antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref020">20</xref>] (AP-MS data available online). Rip11, which belongs to the family of Rab11-interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref037">37</xref>], localizes to REs and regulates transcytosis of proteins from the basolateral to the apical plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref039">39</xref>]. Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated HA-SorCS1 from postnatal <italic>Sorcs1</italic><sup><italic>HA</italic></sup> KI cortical extracts showed a robust Rip11 band coprecipitating with SorCS1 but not with control mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). Rip11 displayed a punctate distribution in dendrites and colocalized with SorCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g003">Fig 3J and 3K</xref>). Expression of a DN form of Rip11 that inhibits the transport from early to REs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref040">40</xref>] reduced axonal surface levels of HA-Nrxn1α and increased dendritic surface levels, shifting Nrxn1α surface polarization from axonal to dendritic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g003">Fig 3L and 3M</xref>), similar to loss of SorCS1. Expression of WT Rip11, on the other hand, increased axonal surface polarization of HA-Nrxn1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g003">Fig 3L and 3M</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that a SorCS1-Rip11 interaction facilitates Nrxn1α sorting from EEs to REs, preventing missorting to fast REs and late endosomes and biasing trafficking to the axonal surface.</p>

<title>Selective missorting of transcytotic cargo in the absence of SorCS1</title>
<p>We next asked whether the surface polarization of other axonal membrane proteins was affected in the absence of SorCS1. The cell adhesion molecules neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1/NgCAM) and contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2) are both targeted to the axonal surface but via distinct trafficking routes. L1/NgCAM is transcytosed from dendrites to axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref042">42</xref>], whereas Caspr2 undergoes nonpolarized delivery followed by selective endocytosis from the somatodendritic surface resulting in axonal polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref043">43</xref>]. L1/NgCAM levels are down-regulated in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO synaptosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref020">20</xref>]. <italic>Sorcs1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> cortical neurons electroporated with Cre or EGFP were transfected with myc-L1 or HA-Caspr2 and immunostained for surface myc or HA. Consistent with a role for SorCS1 in regulating transcytosed axonal cargo, surface polarization of L1/NgCAM, but not of Caspr2, was perturbed in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s012">S6C–S6E Fig</xref>). The polarity index of 2 somatodendritic proteins (glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 2 [GluA2-EGFP] and MAP2) was unchanged in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s013">S7 Fig</xref>), indicating that loss of SorCS1 does not generally perturb the polarized distribution of neuronal proteins. Thus, loss of SorCS1 selectively impairs transcytotic trafficking of axonal membrane proteins, while keeping other neuronal polarity mechanisms intact.</p>

<title>Loss of SorCS1 impairs Nrxn-mediated presynaptic differentiation</title>
<p>We next sought to determine motifs in the Nrxn1α protein sequence that contain signals necessary for its membrane trafficking, with the goal of identifying a Nrxn1α mutant that can bypass SorCS1-mediated sorting and transcytotic trafficking. We systematically tested the effect of a series of Nrxn1α cytoplasmic deletions on surface polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s014">S8A–S8C Fig</xref>) and found that removing the 4.1-binding motif in the cytoplasmic domain (Nrxn1α Δ4.1) was the only deletion that dramatically increased Nrxn1α axonal surface polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s014">S8A–S8C Fig</xref>). Remarkably, axonal surface polarization of Nrxn1α Δ4.1 was unaffected by loss of SorCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). Moreover, Dynasore treatment to block endocytosis did not impair axonal surface polarization of Nrxn1α Δ4.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>), indicating that the Nrxn1α Δ4.1 mutant bypasses dendritic endocytosis and sorting by SorCS1 to polarize to the axonal surface.</p>

<p>Nrxn missorting to the dendritic surface and its concomitant loss from the axonal surface in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons would be expected to impair synapse formation on heterologous cells expressing a postsynaptic ligand for Nrxn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref044">44</xref>]. To test this, we infected <italic>Sorcs1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> cortical neurons with lentivirus (LV) to express Cre-T2A-mCherry or mCherry as control and co-cultured these with HEK293T cells expressing the Nrxn ligand FLAG-Neuroligin 1 (Nlgn1). Nlgn1-induced clustering of the presynaptic marker Synapsin 1 was reduced in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO axons compared with control axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). This defect was specific, because presynaptic differentiation induced by Netrin-G Ligand 3 (NGL-3), which requires presynaptic leukocyte common antigen-related protein (LAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref045">45</xref>], was not affected in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g004">Fig 4I and 4J</xref>). Infection with a lentiviral vector expressing short hairpin ribonucleic acids (shRNAs) against all Nrxns (Nrxn triple knock down [TKD]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref046">46</xref>] mimicked the defect in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>), suggesting that Nlgn1-induced presynaptic differentiation is impaired in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons because of decreased axonal surface levels of Nrxn. To test this, we overexpressed HA-Nrxn1α in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons using LV. As expected, WT Nrxn1α did not rescue the impaired Nlgn1-mediated synaptogenic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>) because of Nrxn1α mispolarization to the dendritic surface in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons. In contrast, expression of the Nrxn1α Δ4.1 mutant, which bypasses SorCS1-mediated sorting and the transcytotic route to polarize to the axonal surface, rescued the synaptogenic defect caused by SorCS1 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). Together, these results show that SorCS1-mediated sorting of Nrxns, by promoting Nrxn accumulation on the axonal surface, is required for normal synaptogenesis onto Nlgn1-expressing cells.</p>

<p>Missorting of Nrxns, which regulate neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref007">7</xref>], would also be expected to impair presynaptic function. To assess the consequences of loss of SorCS1 on synaptic function, we recorded spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) from <italic>Sorcs1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> autaptic cortical cultures electroporated with Cre or EGFP. SorCS1 loss strongly decreased mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Decay kinetics and amplitude of mEPSCs were not altered by loss of SorCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>), suggesting that the amount of neurotransmitter release per vesicle and postsynaptic receptor properties and/or receptor density were not affected. The amplitude and total charge transfer of single evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) were reduced in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). The mEPSC frequency and eEPSC amplitude defects can be attributed to a decrease in the readily releasable pool (RRP) size, in the vesicular release probability (Pves), or in active synapse number. Indeed, we previously found an increase in the number of silent excitatory synapses after loss of SorCS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref020">20</xref>]. To assess RRP size, we applied a hyperosmotic sucrose stimulus. The amplitude and total charge transfer of synaptic responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>) and RRP size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g005">Fig 5G</xref>) induced by single application of 0.5 M sucrose were strongly decreased in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons, in line with a reduction in active synapse number. Because eEPSC amplitude and RRP size were proportionally reduced in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO cells, the Pves (eEPSC charge/initial sucrose charge) was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). To further examine potential presynaptic release defects in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons, we performed train stimulations at different frequencies to probe for short-term plasticity defects that cannot be detected by induction of single EPSC and single sucrose application. Repeated stimulation at 10 Hz produced a more pronounced rundown of normalized evoked responses (synaptic depression) in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g005">Fig 5I and 5J</xref>), suggesting a presynaptic defect during sustained periods of activity. Other stimulation frequencies and paired-pulse stimulations also showed increased synaptic depression in <italic>SorCS1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g005">Fig 5K</xref>). Calculating the RRP size by back-extrapolation of cumulative synchronous charge during 10 Hz train stimulation confirmed a reduction in RRP size in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000466.g005">Fig 5L</xref>), indicating a presynaptic defect independent of the silent synapses phenotype that we described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref020">20</xref>]. Together, these observations indicate that loss of SorCS1 impairs neurotransmitter release, reminiscent of Nrxn loss-of-function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref007">7</xref>], indicating that SorCS1-mediated sorting of Nrxns in dendrites is required for normal presynaptic function.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The membrane trafficking mechanisms by which neurons control the polarized distribution and abundance of synaptic receptors are poorly understood. Here, we show that SorCS1-mediated sorting in dendritic endosomes controls a balance between axonal and dendritic surface levels of Nrxn and maintains Nrxn axonal surface polarization required for presynaptic differentiation and function.</p>

<title>A SorCS1-Rab11FIP5/Rip11 interaction sorts axonal cargo from EEs to REs</title>
<p>The mechanism by which SorCS1 regulates trafficking of neuronal receptors has remained unclear. We find that SorCS1 controls a balance between axonal and dendritic surface polarization of its cargo Nrxn. In mature neurons, newly synthesized Nrxn1α traffics to the somatodendritic surface, followed by endocytosis and transcytosis to the axon. Accordingly, blocking endocytosis, EE-, and RE-mediated transport all result in accumulation of Nrxn1α on the dendritic surface. These effects are mimicked by <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO. We find that endosomal SorCS1 controls the transition of endocytosed Nrxn1α from EEs to REs and identify the Rab11-interacting protein Rab11FIP5/Rip11 as a novel SorCS1 cytoplasmic interactor. Interference with Rip11 function alters the axonal–dendritic surface balance of Nrxn1α in the same way that <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO does. Rab11FIPs function as linkers between Rab11 and motor proteins to promote sorting of cargo from EEs to REs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref047">47</xref>] and transcytosis in polarized epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref039">39</xref>], but their function in neuronal transcytosis has not been explored. Our data suggest that SorCS1/Rip11 form a protein complex that localizes to dendritic endosomes and sorts internalized Nrxn1α from early to recycling endosomes, thereby biasing the trafficking of Nrxn1α-containing REs to the axon while preventing Nrxn1α missorting to the dendritic surface and lysosomes.</p>
<p>SorCS1-mediated sorting of Nrxn1α in dendrites can be circumvented by deleting the 4.1-binding motif in the cytoplasmic tail of Nrxn1α, which results in strong polarization of Nrxn1α to the axonal surface. Surface polarization of Nrxn1α Δ4.1 is unaffected by blocking endocytosis or removing <italic>Sorcs1</italic>. It remains to be determined whether Nrxn1α’s 4.1-binding motif, which lacks canonical YXXØ and (D/E)<italic>XXX</italic>L(L/I) dendritic sorting motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref048">48</xref>] but contains several tyrosine residues, is required for initial sorting to dendrites or for insertion in the dendritic membrane. Binding of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic-type receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1 to the 4.1N protein is required for GluA1 membrane insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref049">49</xref>]. We find that the extracellular domain of Nrxn1α is required for somatodendritic sorting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s014">S8D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000466.s014">S8E Fig</xref>), suggesting that deletion of the 4.1-binding motif in Nrxn1α impairs dendritic insertion but not initial sorting to this compartment.</p>
<p>Our results show that loss of SorCS1 impairs transcytotic trafficking of Nrxn and L1/NgCAM, but not of Caspr2, which traffics via the selective endocytosis/retention pathway, supporting a role for SorCS1 in regulating transcytotic trafficking of axonal cargo proteins. It is unlikely that all membrane proteins that have been identified using surface proteome analysis to depend on SorCS1-3 for their surface trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref024">24</xref>] undergo transcytosis. The SorCS1 cargo amyloid precursor protein (APP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref052">52</xref>], however, is transcytosed in human neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref053">53</xref>]. SorCS1 likely interacts with additional proteins, such as the retromer complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref050">50</xref>], to regulate the surface trafficking of a diverse set of cargoes.</p>

<title>SorCS1-mediated surface polarization of Nrxn is required for presynaptic differentiation and function</title>
<p>The selective impairment in Nlgn1-induced presynaptic differentiation in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons and rescue thereof by Nrxn1α Δ4.1, but not by WT Nrxn1α, indicates that this defect is due to a decrease in the abundance of axonal surface Nrxns. Nrxns play key roles in neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref007">7</xref>]. Alpha-Nrxn KO in neocortical cultured slices reduces mEPSC/miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) frequency and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic current (eIPSC) amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref007">7</xref>]. β-Nrxn KO in cortical neurons decreases mEPSC frequency and eEPSC amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref005">5</xref>]. Our results show that loss of SorCS1 in autaptic cortical neurons decreases mEPSC frequency, eEPSC amplitude, and sucrose-evoked responses, in line with the reported decreased fraction of active synapses in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref020">20</xref>]. Whether this decrease in the fraction of active synapses is also happening in autaptic cultured neurons requires further experimental testing. Furthermore, we found an increase in synaptic depression of normalized eEPCSs during stimulus trains, similar to α-Nrxn KO neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref007">7</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that mistrafficking of Nrxn is a major contributor to the defects in presynaptic function in <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO neurons. These defects are likely attributed to a decrease in active synapse number and a presynaptic defect in neurotransmitter release, rather than a decrease in excitatory synapse density, which is unaffected in cultured <italic>Sorcs1</italic> KO cortical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref020">20</xref>] and in Nrxn TKD hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>The axonal–dendritic balance of Nrxn1α is developmentally regulated. Early in neuronal development, endogenous Nrxn1α is enriched on the axonal surface and traffics directly to the axon after trans-Golgi network (TGN) exit. As neurons mature, Nrxn1α follows an indirect trafficking pathway after TGN exit via SorCS1-mediated sorting in dendritic endosomes and transcytosis to the axonal surface. It will be interesting to determine whether expression of <italic>Sorcs1</italic> and <italic>Rip11</italic> is developmentally regulated in these neurons. The biological function of this developmental regulation and circuitous trafficking route is not clear. Transcytosis could provide an efficient way of delivering receptors from a reservoir of readily synthesized proteins. Similar to other transcytosed axonal cargo, a dendritic pool of Nrxn may supply the demand for receptors along the axonal surface, either constitutively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref055">55</xref>] or in response to ligand-receptor interactions and signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>Dendritically localized Nrxns might have a function in this compartment. Postsynaptically expressed Nrxn1 decreases Nlgn1’s synaptogenic effect in hippocampal neurons, likely by <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition of Nlgn1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref032">32</xref>]. In retinal ganglion cells, a shift in Nrxn localization away from dendrites has been proposed to allow dendritic innervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref030">30</xref>]. In cortical neurons, however, we observe the opposite: Nrxn surface expression in dendrites increases with maturation. Dendritic Nrxns might modulate the function of postsynaptic Nrxn ligands, such as Nlgns, which control postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref057">57</xref>], or leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal protein 1 (LRRTM1), which shapes presynaptic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref058">58</xref>]. At the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neuromuscular junction, the ectodomain of postsynaptic Nrxn is proteolytically cleaved and binds to the presynaptic α2δ calcium channel subunit to inhibit presynaptic release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, impaired trafficking of critical cargo proteins in the absence of SorCS1 and resulting defects in synaptic function might contribute to the pathophysiology of the neurodevelopmental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref063">63</xref>] and neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref064">64</xref>] with which <italic>SORCS1</italic> has been associated. These observations underscore the notion that intracellular sorting is a key contributor to the proper maintenance of synaptic protein composition and function.</p>

Briefly, DNA plasmids were diluted in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl and 2.5 mM EDTA [pH 7.3]), followed by dropwise addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution (2.5 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> in 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.2]) to the plasmid DNA-containing solution to give a final concentration of 250 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. This solution was subsequently added to an equal volume of HEPES-buffered solution (274 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 42 mM HEPES [pH 7.2]) and vortexed gently for 3 s. This mixture, containing precipitated DNA, was then added dropwise to the coverslips in a 12-well plate, containing 250 μL of conditioned neuronal culture medium with kynurenic acid (2 mM), followed by 2 h incubation in a 37°C, 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub>/95% (vol/vol) air incubator. After 2 h, the transfection solution was removed, after which 1 mL of conditioned neuronal culture medium with kynurenic acid (2 mM) slightly acidified with HCl (approximately 5 mM final concentration) was added to each coverslip, and the plate was returned to a 37°C, 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub>/95% (vol/vol) air incubator for 20 min. Finally, coverslips were then transferred to the original dish containing the conditioned culture medium in the 37°C, 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub>/95% (vol/vol) air incubator to allow expression of the transfected constructs. Protein expression was typically for 24 h (live-cell imaging) or 48 h (immunocytochemistry).</p>

<title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Cells were fixed for 10 to 15 min in 4% (wt/vol) sucrose and 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS (PBS: 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> [pH 7.4]) at room temperature and permeabilized with PBS + 0.25% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4°C. Neurons were then incubated in 10% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific staining and incubated in appropriate primary antibodies diluted in 3% (wt/vol) BSA in PBS (overnight, 4°C). After washing 3 times in PBS, cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies diluted in 3% (wt/vol) BSA in PBS (1 h, room temperature). The coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat #P36930).</p>
<p>In all immunocytochemistry experiments performed to determine the subcellular distribution of proteins of interest (Nrxns, SorCS1, Caspr2, L1) the axonal compartment was labeled using antibodies against Ankyrin-G, a marker of the AIS (NeuroMab, Davis, CA, Cat #73–146 or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, Cat #sc-31778), and the somatodendritic compartment was labeled using an anti-MAP2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, England, Cat #ab5392).

<title>Surface immunostaining of extracellular myc-tagged L1</title>
<p>To allow surface immunostaining of myc-L1 (live-labeling proved to be impossible), neurons were fixed first, followed by several washes and blocking, and then incubated with mouse anti-myc (1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, Cat #sc-40) diluted in 3% (wt/vol) BSA in PBS overnight at 4°C.

<sec id="sec025">
<title>Antibody pulse-chase experiments</title>
<p>Cultured living neurons were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the presence of a high concentration (1:250) of mouse anti-HA antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ, Cat #MMS-101P) against extracellular HA-tagged Nrxn1α and SorCS1, diluted in conditioned medium. Neurons were then washed with prewarmed PBS at 37°C to remove the unbound antibody and were further incubated in antibody free conditioned medium in a 37°C, 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub>/95% (vol/vol) air incubator (for different periods) to allow the internalization of antibody-bound receptors. After this incubation, neurons were fixed in 4% (wt/vol) sucrose and 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Next, neurons were either exposed to a supersaturating concentration (1:300) of the first of 2 secondary antibodies, to label the primary antibody-bound surface pool of protein, and/or incubated overnight with anti-mouse Fab fragments (0.25 mg/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, Cat #715-007-003) in 5% (wt/vol) BSA in PBS to block all primary antibody-bound receptors that were not internalized and/or not labeled by the first secondary antibody. After permeabilization, cells were processed for immunocytochemistry as described above, and the pool of internalized receptors was labeled by incubation with the second secondary antibody (1:1,000) for 1 h at room temperature. This strategy allows differential labeling of cell surface and internalized pools of protein.</p>

<title>Image analysis and quantification</title>
<p>All images obtained from immunocytochemistry experiments in fixed cells were captured on a Leica SP8 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica Micro-systems, Wetzlar, Germany). The same confocal acquisition settings were applied to all images taken from a single experiment. Parameters were adjusted so that the pixel intensities were below saturation. Fiji analysis software was used for quantitative imaging analysis. Z-stacked images were converted to maximal intensity projections and thresholded using constant settings per experiment.</p>
<sec id="sec028">
<title>Quantification of axonal and dendritic immunofluorescence intensity and ratio of axonal–dendritic immunofluorescence intensity</title>
<p>Fluorescence intensity was measured as the sum of integrated intensity in representative portions of axons and dendrites using Ankyrin-G and MAP2 as guides, respectively. Axonal and dendritic intensities were divided by neuritic length and total intensity (axonal + dendritic) (‘Relative Axonal Intensity’ and ‘Relative Dendritic Intensity’) to adjust measurements across cells with varying expression levels (exogenous expression). The A–D ratio was then calculated by dividing the values of axonal and dendritic intensities obtained for every cell (‘Axonal/Dendritic Intensity’). A uniformly distributed protein yields an A–D ratio of around 1. A preferentially dendritically localized protein yields an A–D ratio &lt; 1, whereas a preferentially axonally localized protein yields an A–D ratio &gt; 1. To quantify the fluorescence intensity of endogenous Nrxns, axonal and dendritic intensities were not normalized to the total intensity (‘Axonal Intensity’ and ‘Dendritic Intensity’).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec029">
<title>Polarity index</title>
<p>In some cases, polarization of cargo was determined by using the classical polarity index originally described by Sampo and colleagues and Wisco and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref069">69</xref>]. This index does not provide a direct measurement of the axonal and dendritic fluorescent intensities, but it allows a quick estimation of the compartmentalized polarization of proteins of interest. One-pixel-wide lines were traced along 3 dendrites and representative portions of the axon, using MAP2 and Ankyrin-G as guides, in nonthresholded images. The mean intensities (dendritic was averaged from 3 dendrites) were used to calculate the dendrite:axon (D:A) ‘Polarity Index’. D:A = 1, uniform staining; D:A &lt; 1, preferential axonal staining; D:A &gt; 1, preferential dendritic staining.</p>

<sec id="sec030">
<title>Long-term live-cell imaging</title>
<p>Fluorescence intensity was measured as the sum of integrated intensity in representative portions of axons and dendrites (using Ankyrin-G and MAP2 as guides) and cell bodies.

<sec id="sec031">
<title>Antibody pulse-chase experiments</title>
<p>Fluorescence intensity was measured as the sum of integrated intensity in representative portions of axons and dendrites using Ankyrin-G and MAP2 as guides, respectively.

Intensities of surface SorCS1 were also divided by neuritic length and by the total intensity (surface + internal) (‘Relative Intensity of Surface SorCS1’).</p>

<title>Colocalization of internalized Nrxn with endosomal markers in Sorcs1 KO cells</title>
<p>The colocalization of internalized Nrxn with endosomal markers was evaluated by measuring the density of double-positive puncta for internalized Nrxn and endosomes and by measuring the intensity of Nrxn present in these puncta. Fluorescence intensity was measured as the sum of mean intensity of internalized Nrxn puncta (defined as 0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>-infinite) in representative portions of axons and dendrites (using Ankyrin-G and MAP2 as guides), colocalizing with endosomal markers. Intensities of internalized Nrxn were divided by neuritic length (‘Nrxn Intensity in Double Positive Puncta’). Density of internalized Nrxn puncta (defined as 0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>-infinite), colocalizing with endosomal markers, was also divided by neuritic length (‘Double Positive Puncta Density’).</p>

<title>Live-cell imaging</title>
<p>For live-cell imaging of fluorescently tagged Nrxn1α- and TfR-positive vesicles, neurons were transfected with a bicistronic expression plasmid encoding Streptavidin-KDEL and SBP-EGFP-Nrxn1α or Streptavidin-KDEL and TfR-SBP-EGFP, respectively, using the RUSH system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000466.ref034">34</xref>]. After transfection, neurons were maintained in Neurobasal medium without B27 supplement, because the presence of D-biotin in B27 interferes with the RUSH system, or in Neurobasal medium supplemented with N-2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat #P36930), which lacks D-biotin. Live-cell imaging was performed at room temperature (approximately 20°C) in imaging medium (119 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 30 mM glucose, and 10 mM Hepes [pH 7.4]). For long-term live-cell imaging experiments DIV8 to DIV10 or DIV3 rat cortical neurons, after 24 to 31 h or 25 to 29 h of protein expression, respectively, were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti A1R confocal microscope (Minato, Japan). Images were collected with a 40× oil objective (1.3 NA; Nikon, Minato, Japan). Focal drift during the experiment was avoided by using the perfect focus system feature of the Nikon system. Laser intensities were kept as low as possible. Time lapses lasted for 2.5 h and frames were acquired as z-stacks every 5 min. Synchronous release of Nrxn1α or TfR was induced by application of 40 μM D-biotin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, Cat #B4501) 10 min after the beginning of the imaging session. Protein synthesis was inhibited by including 20 μg/mL cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, Cat #C4859) in the imaging medium. For short-term live-cell imaging experiments, DIV8 to DIV10 rat cortical neurons expressing Streptavidin-KDEL and SBP-EGFP-Nrxn1α, 21 to 30 h after protein expression, were imaged on a Nikon spinning-disk confocal microscope equipped with a 60× oil objective (1.4 NA; Nikon). Time-lapses were performed by sequential capture of 200 ms images of SBP-EGFP-Nrxn1α every second for 60 to 120 s. Focal drift during the experiment was corrected automatically using the autofocus feature of the Nikon system. Neurons were imaged either for 20 to 34 min or 1 to 2 h after exposure to 40 μM D-biotin. In both experiments, a single image of live-stained pan-Neurofascin was taken at the beginning of every imaging session.</p>
<sec id="sec035">
<title>Live-labeling of the AIS</title>
<p>Before every live-cell imaging experiment, primary rat cortical cultured neurons were live-labeled with an anti-pan-Neurofascin antibody (NeuroMab, Davis, CA, Cat #75–172) to distinguish the axon from the dendrites. Live-cell imaging experiments were performed with rat cortical neurons because live-labeling of the AIS with the anti-pan-Neurofascin antibody did not work in mouse cultured neurons in our hands. Briefly, coverslips with neurons were quickly rinsed in prewarmed neuronal culture medium. Neurons were incubated with anti-pan-Neurofascin antibody (1/500) diluted in conditioned neuronal culture medium for 10 min in a 37°C, 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub>/95% (vol/vol) air incubator. Coverslips were then quickly washed twice with prewarmed neuronal culture medium. Finally, neurons were incubated with an Alexa-555 anti-mouse (1/400; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat #A31570) secondary antibody diluted in conditioned neuronal culture medium and incubated for 10 min in a 37°C, 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub>/95% (vol/vol) air incubator. Neurons were quickly rinsed twice with prewarmed neuronal culture medium and used for live-cell imaging experiments.</p>

<title>Analysis of Nrxn1α- and TfR-positive vesicle transport</title>
<p>Dendrites and axon were imaged from the same neuron using spinning-disk confocal microscopy. Time lapses were performed by sequential capture of 200 ms images every second for 60 to 120 s. Acquisitions were analyzed using an Igor-based software developed by Pieter Vanden Berghe and Valérie Van Steenbergen (Lab. for Enteric NeuroScience and Cell Imaging Core, KU Leuven). Kymographs were created using a segmented line along the axon/dendrite (1 dendrite was analyzed per cell) from the soma towards the neurite tip, so that anterograde movement occurred from left to right. On the kymographs, single vesicle movement episodes were distinguished as tilted straight lines. Single vesicle pauses were distinguished as straight lines. The number of moving anterograde/retrograde particles in the dendrite and axon was determined manually by drawing lines on top of the trajectories of single particles obtained from the kymographs. Vesicles were defined as motile when showing net displacement of ≥ 2 μm.</p>

Cells were whole-cell voltage clamped at −70 mV with a double EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) under control of Patchmaster v2x32 software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Currents were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz and stored at 20 kHz. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass using a multistep puller (P-1000; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Pipette resistance ranged from 3 to 5 MΩ. The series resistance was compensated to approximately 75%. Only cells with series resistances below 15 MΩ were included for analysis. All recordings were made at room temperature. Spontaneous glutamatergic release (sEPSC) was recorded at −70 mV. Evoked release was induced using brief depolarization of the cell soma (from 70 to 0 mV for 1 ms) to initiate action potential-dependent glutamatergic release (eEPSCs). A fast local multibarrel perfusion system (Warner SF-77B, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) was used to determine the RRP size using external recording solution containing 500 mM sucrose. A custom analysis procedure in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) was used for offline analysis of evoked and sucrose responses.

<p>==================</p>
<p>INFORMATION REGARDING THE REPORTING CHECKLIST:</p>
<p>PLOS Biology is pleased to support the "minimum reporting standards in the life sciences" initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/9sm4x/">https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/9sm4x/</ext-link>). This effort brings together a number of leading journals and reproducibility experts to develop minimum expectations for reporting information about Materials (including data and code), Design, Analysis and Reporting (MDAR) in published papers. We believe broad alignment on these standards will be to the benefit of authors, reviewers, journals and the wider research community and will help drive better practise in publishing reproducible research. </p>
<p>We are therefore participating in a community pilot involving a small number of life science journals to test the MDAR checklist. The checklist is intended to help authors, reviewers and editors adopt and implement the minimum reporting framework. </p>
<p>IMPORTANT: We have chosen your manuscript to participate in this trial. The relevant documents can be located here:</p>
<p>MDAR reporting checklist (to be filled in by you): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plos.io/MDARChecklist">https://plos.io/MDARChecklist</ext-link></p>
<p>**We strongly encourage you to complete the MDAR reporting checklist and return it to us with your full submission, as described above. We would also be very grateful if you could complete this author survey:</p>

</p>
<p>Please note that your completed checklist and survey will be shared with the minimum reporting standards working group. However, the working group will not be provided with access to the manuscript or any other confidential information including author identities, manuscript titles or abstracts. Feedback from this process will be used to consider next steps, which might include revisions to the content of the checklist. Data and materials from this initial trial will be publicly shared in September 2019. Data will only be provided in aggregate form and will not be parsed by individual article or by journal, so as to respect the confidentiality of responses. </p>
<p>Please treat the checklist and elaboration as confidential as public release is planned for September 2019.</p>
<p>We would be grateful for any feedback you may have.</p>

<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>DATA POLICY:</p>
<p>You may be aware of the PLOS Data Policy, which requires that all data be made available without restriction: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability</ext-link>. For more information, please also see this editorial: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001797">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001797</ext-link></p>
<p>Note that we do not require all raw data. Rather, we ask for all individual quantitative observations that underlie the data summarized in the figures and results of your paper. For an example see here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5">http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5</ext-link></p>
<p>These data can be made available in one of the following forms:</p>
<p>1) Supplementary files (e.g., excel). Please ensure that all data files are uploaded as 'Supporting Information' and are invariably referred to (in the manuscript, figure legends, and the Description field when uploading your files) using the following format verbatim: S1 Data, S2 Data, etc. Multiple panels of a single or even several figures can be included as multiple sheets in one excel file that is saved using exactly the following convention: S1_Data.xlsx (using an underscore).</p>
<p>2) Deposition in a publicly available repository. Please also provide the accession code or a reviewer link so that we may view your data before publication. </p>
<p>Regardless of the method selected, please ensure that you provide the individual numerical values that underlie the summary data displayed in the following figure panels: Figures 1CE, 2BGI, 3BDFHM, 4BDFHJ, 5BDFGHJK, S1DFHJ, S2F, S3ABCDG, S4BDFHJL, S5BE</p>
<p>Please also note that PLOS does not permit references to “data not shown.” You should provide the relevant data within the manuscript, the Supporting Information files, or in a public repository. If the data are not a core part of the research study being presented, we ask that you remove any references to these data. In this case, some of the data not shown seem relevant to your conclusions, including:</p>
<p>“The polarity index of two somatodendritic proteins (GluA2-GFP and MAP2), was unchanged in Sorcs1 KO neurons (data not shown), indicating that loss of SorCS1 does not generally perturb the polarized distribution of neuronal proteins.”</p>
<p>“We systematically tested the effect of a series of Nrxn1a cytoplasmic deletions on surface polarization (data not shown) and found that removing the 4.1-binding motif in the cytoplasmic domain (Nrxn1a �4.1) was the only deletion that dramatically increased Nrxn1a axonal surface polarization (Figure 4A, B).”</p>
<p>“We find that the extracellular domain of Nrxn1a is required for somatodendritic sorting (data not shown), suggesting that deletion of the 4.1-binding motif in Nrxn1a impairs dendritic insertion but not initial sorting to this compartment.”</p>
<p>Thus, please include these data.</p>
<p>The references to antibodies not shown in the figure legends possibly can be omitted. </p>
<p>Please ensure that the figure legends in your manuscript include information on where the underlying data can be found.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your Data Statement in the submission system accurately describes where your data can be found.</p>

<p>Reviewer remarks:</p>
<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Ribeiro et al. describe a role for SorCS1 in the transcytosis of neurexin from the dendrite to the axon. The idea of transcytosis for axonal polarization is not new, but the molecular details required for this process are presently unknown. This study provides great mechanistic insight and follows the life journey of an important neuronal receptor. The authors show how an axonal cargo first transits to the dendrite where it is endocytosed and then resorted via SorCS1 and Rip11 from early to recycling endosomes to be polarized toward the axon. This is a very comprehensive study that using cutting edge techniques such as CRISPR knockins and dynamic imaging. The detailed cell biological studies and data analysis provide a rigorous and thorough understanding of the described transcytosis mechanism.</p>
<p>This manuscript represents a conceptual advance and significantly advances our knowledge of polarity neuronal membrane trafficking processes. There are no major technical concerns and only one question and a few minor points. </p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Can the authors describe the localization of Neurexin relative to other endosomal markers (as shown in Fig. 3) for additional time points than those shown? I am not proposing to show all the time points for all the RABs. But it seems that they should mention whether the time point shown are the only ones a particular RAB showed SorCS1 dependent behavior.</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>1. There is a type on Figure 2 (RE lumen instead of ER lumen)</p>
<p>2. The text and Figure S3 refer to neurofascin as the axonal marker, but the corresponding main figure (Fig 2D) shows AnkG.</p>
<p>3. The first two sentences of the ‘Nrxn1α is transcytosed’ section are confusing based on how it is presently written. The previous section showing the RUSH data seems to answer the question asked in these two sentences.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Ribeiro et al. report a detailed analysis of alpha-Neurexin-1 (aNrxn1) trafficking and the regulation by SOR-CS1 in cortical neurons. Based on previous work identifying the function of SOR-CS1 protein as sorting receptor for AMPARs and Nrxn1 and Nrxn2 (Savas et al. 2015) the authors here report the specific regulation of the axonal sorting of aNrxn1 by SOR-CS1 and new identified interaction partners as Rip11. </p>
<p>Probing the function of SOR-CS1 at different developmental time points allowed to identify the impact of SOR-CS1 in the recycling of aNrxn-1 on the dendritic membrane and sorting in recycling endosomes for axonal trafficking. A long standing issue in analysing the surface distribution and sorting of adhesion molecules in neurons, particular aNrxns, is the lack of specific antibodies against their extracellular domains. The authors overcome this by the use of a newly generated knock-in mouse of HA-tagged aNrxn-1. In combination with a second knock-in mouse for HA-tagged SOR-CS1 the core results of the work are very convincing, supporting the function of SOR-CS1 for the regulation of the dendritic expression of aNrxn1 and retargeting to the axon, as well as the functional impact of this sorting process on neurotransmission and short-term synaptic plasticity. The paper and the here introduced tools are well suited to explore the discussed function of dendritic expressed aNrxn1 as regulator of adhesion contacts and synapse formation as well as the presynaptic actions of aNrxn1. </p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>In respect to the previous work, the transcytosis of aNrxn1 in cortical neurons seem to be the major process in synapse formation and function and does only little affect postsynaptic AMPAR-density and function. The formation and function of synapses depend on the here investigated trafficking of aNrxn1 but seem not being affected by postsynaptic changes in AMPAR trafficking, as proposed by Savas et al. 2015. Indeed, the probed parameters indicate a strong effect of SOR-CS1 KO on presynaptic functions, but are their remaining increased numbers of postsynaptic silent synapses, as discussed? May the autaptic cultures bias the effect on AMPARs by homeostatic upregulation of receptor density? Are their data for the surface population of AMPARs in these autaptic cultures, which could support the idea of postsynaptic AMPAR-silent synapses. </p>
<p>The mentioned dendritic sorting motives in page 13, second paragraph are probably wrong spelled (“YxxO and [D/E]xxx[L/I] dendritic sorting motifs [48] but….”)</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: In this manuscript, Ribeiro et al examined the role of a VPS 10 family member sorting receptor SorCS1 in trafficking Nrxn, a presynaptic adhesion molecule and in synaptic transmission. Previously they have shown an interaction between these two proteins and a role of SorCS1 in Nrxn trafficking. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, they generated two knock-in mouse line with endogenous tagged Nrxn or SorCS1 in order to study the localization and trafficking of these proteins at endogenous levels. Furthermore, they used RUSH system to visualize the trafficking of engineered Nrxn in a synchronized manner using live imaging. They also identified Rip11 as a binding partner for SorCS1 on endosome and showed that Rip11 is required for SorCS1 mediated transition of internalized Nrxn1α from early to recycling endosomes and facilitates Nrxn1α surface polarization toward the axon. Overall, this manuscript is well written. The authors have done tremendous amount of work and the experiments are well designed. The data is analyzed carefully and presented beautifully. I only have a few minor comments:</p>
<p>1. Fig. 3E, why the number of Nrxn punta is so few compared to Fig. 3A and 3C in the Cre expressing conditions? In Fig. 3G, is the number of Nrxn punta decreased in Cre expressing conditions in axons? </p>
<p>2. Is the expression of SorCS1 or Rip11 developmentally regulated?</p>

<p>Dear Dr De Wit,</p>
<p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Franck Polleux, I am pleased to inform you that we will be delighted to publish your Research Article in PLOS Biology. </p>
<p>The files will now enter our production system. You will receive a copyedited version of the manuscript, along with your figures for a final review. You will be given two business days to review and approve the copyedit. Then, within a week, you will receive a PDF proof of your typeset article. You will have two days to review the PDF and make any final corrections. If there is a chance that you'll be unavailable during the copy editing/proof review period, please provide us with contact details of one of the other authors whom you nominate to handle these stages on your behalf. This will ensure that any requested corrections reach the production department in time for publication.</p>
<p>Early Version</p>
<p>The version of your manuscript submitted at the copyedit stage will be posted online ahead of the final proof version, unless you have already opted out of the process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p>
<p>PRESS </p>
<p>We frequently collaborate with press offices. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. If the press office is planning to promote your findings, we would be grateful if they could coordinate with <email>biologypress@plos.org</email>. If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p>
<p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS. As your manuscript is not yet published, it is bound by the conditions of our Embargo Policy. Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Thank you again for submitting your manuscript to PLOS Biology and for your support of Open Access publishing. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any assistance during the production process.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
