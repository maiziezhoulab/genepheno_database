<p id="P3">Identifying the mechanisms through which genetic risk causes dementia is an imperative for new therapeutic development. Here, we apply a multi-stage, systems biology approach to elucidate disease mechanisms in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We identify two gene co-expression modules that are preserved in mice harboring mutations in MAPT, GRN, and other dementia mutations on diverse genetic backgrounds. We bridge the species divide via integration with proteomic and transcriptomic data from human brain to identify evolutionarily conserved, disease-relevant networks. We find that overexpression of miR-203, a hub of a putative regulatory miRNA module, re-capitulates mRNA co-expression patterns associated with disease state and induces neuronal cell death, establishing this miRNA as a regulator of neurodegeneration. Using a database of drug-mediated gene expression changes, we identify small molecules that can normalize the disease-associated modules and validate this experimentally. Our results highlight the utility of an integrative, cross-species, network approach to drug discovery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a highly heritable common cause of presenile dementia often caused by dominantly-acting mutations in the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT; tau), and in two other genes, GRN and C9orf72<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Tau pathology is also a core feature of numerous other neurodegenerative syndromes, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), and is associated with the pattern of cognitive decline in AD (PSP; for a review see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>). Thus, identifying the mechanisms by which tau and other dementia-causing mutations lead to neurodegeneration is of foremost importance in developing new therapies for dementia.</p>
<p id="P5">Translating mechanistic studies in mouse models of dementia to human clinical trials has proven challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. We reasoned that one contributing factor, aside from the evolutionary distance between mouse and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, is that common laboratory mouse strains are highly inbred. Although genetic background profoundly impacts the biochemical and behavioral repertoires of mouse models of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, virtually all studies of neurodegeneration in mice rely on a single inbred strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">Here, we take a multi-step, systems biology approach to identify robust, human disease-relevant gene networks. To minimize the likelihood that findings were dependent on a single genetic background, we crossed transgenic mice harboring the FTD-causing P301S mutation onto three distinct backgrounds and identified early transcriptomic changes observed across mutant F1 progeny, comparing vulnerable regions, such as the cortex and brainstem, to regions less affected in the human tauopathies, such as the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Through gene network analysis, we identify two major co-expression modules that are conserved across genetic backgrounds and in humans. These modules delineate key pathways deregulated in disease and are differentially enriched for genetic drivers of human FTD, AD and PSP. Using an unbiased integrative genomics approach, we uncover genome-wide relationships between miRNAs and their biological targets, and experimentally validate these relationships by demonstrating that overexpression of a predicted driver, miR-203, recapitulates the mRNA expression patterns observed with disease and promotes neurodegenerative pathways. As a proof of principle, we also show that one can leverage these highly conserved co-expression modules to identify tool compounds that mitigate neurodegeneration induced by miR-203.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p id="P7">We analyzed F1 offspring resulting from crosses of TPR50 mice expressing the human Tau<sup>P301S</sup> transgene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, onto FVB, DBA and parent C57BL6 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). All three F1 crosses share key features of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, including decreased survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and body weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">b</xref>), progressive accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus (AT8 staining; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), and prominent astrogliosis and microgliosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">f</xref>). Consistent with previous reports that FVB mice can be more vulnerable to neurodegeneration, we observed that F1 Tau<sup>P301S</sup> transgenics on the FVB/C57 (TPR50xFVB/NJ) background had decreased survival and increased pathological tau as compared to the C57/C57 (TPR50xC57BL/6J) and DBA/C57 (TPR50xDBA/2J) progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">h</xref>). Importantly, no significant decrease in the weight of any of the affected brain areas was detected in transgenic animals at six months (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1i</xref>), consistent with previous data showing no cell loss at this stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">We next investigated whether we could identify a robust, disease-specific transcriptional signature by sampling brain regions varying in disease vulnerability, reasoning that key disease-related gene expression patterns would overlap across affected areas (cortex, hippocampus, brainstem), but be absent in cerebellum, which is unaffected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of four brain regions and two-time points across the three genetic backgrounds (36 samples per region, per time point; total of 288 RNA-seq samples; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Online Methods</xref>). The differentially expressed genes from transgenic and wild type mice clearly separate tau mutant from wild type genotypes within affected brain regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">c</xref>), but not in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), and are consistent are across strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">e</xref>). There was significant overlap in differential expression (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Online Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>) between the cortex and hippocampus, and significant correlation between fold changes in differentially expressed genes (Rank-rank hypergeometric test; p&lt;0.05) from these two regions (R<sup>2</sup>=0.76, slope=0.92, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). We find lesser, but significant correlation in gene expression between the cortex and brain stem (R<sup>2</sup>=0.33, slope=0.82, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Consistent with the absence of significant cell loss at six months in this model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, positive regulators of apoptosis (GO ID:0043065) do not show significant changes across all 3 strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">e</xref>) and negative regulators of apoptosis (GO ID :0043066) show modest, more significant changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">i</xref>).We note that although we do not observe frank apoptosis, we do see evidence for initial activation of cellular pathways associated with inflammation in cerebral cortex by six months, including increases in GFAP and Iba-1 immunoreactivity in cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We observed no significant overlap in gene expression between the cortex and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3j</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">k</xref>) and no correlation between differentially expressed genes in cortex and cerebellum (R<sup>2</sup>=0.01, slope=0.14, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Even more striking is that the expression changes of the top upregulated genes in the cerebellum are reversed in the cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3l</xref>), implying that protective changes may potentially occur in the cerebellum, as has been previously suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Identification of disease-relevant mRNA modules</title>
<p id="P10">To place gene expression changes in a systems level framework, we performed consensus Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (cWGCNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>) across all three heterozygous F1 mouse strains to identify relationships not observed in only a single background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We identified four mRNA modules significantly correlated with the transgenic condition in cortex – which we initially labeled the salmon, turquoise magenta and pink modules per WGCNA conventions (Bonferroni-corrected p &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Three of these modules are downregulated (salmon, magenta and pink), while one module is upregulated in transgenic mice (turquoise) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Cell-type enrichment analysis demonstrated that the salmon module is enriched in neuronal markers, the magenta module for oligodendrocyte markers, and the turquoise module for microglial, astrocyte and endothelial markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) across multiple different cell type specific gene expression datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analyses is consistent with the cell type enrichments, showing that the salmon module is enriched for synaptic pathways, magenta for DNA repair and transcription, while the turquoise module is enriched for immune and inflammatory categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">We next calculated the correlation between expression changes and an established early disease marker, the burden of hyperphosphorylated tau, which has been shown to correlate with disease progression in human FTD and AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Genes correlated highly with phospho-tau levels (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.6; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Online Methods</xref>) were found to be significantly enriched in the salmon (42-fold) and turquoise modules (9.5-fold), but not in the magenta and pink modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>). We therefore focused our subsequent analysis on the salmon and turquoise modules. Given the consistent cell type enrichments and strong gene ontology enrichments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, d-g; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig 4b</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">d</xref>) we relabel the salmon module, the Neurodegeneration-Associated Synaptic (NAS) module, and the turquoise module, the Neurodegeneration-Associated Inflammatory (NAI) module, so as to provide more intuitive names for these core disease-associated modules.</p>
<p id="P12">To investigate further if the expression changes were dependent on changes in cell type composition, or reflected cell intrinsic signaling changes, we applied a multivariate linear regression model using the top one hundred cell-type specific marker genes for five major cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Online Methods</xref>). Both modules retained their significant association with the transgenic condition (salmon, r= −0.73, p= 8.6e-07; turquoise, r= 0.71, p=3e-06), indicating that they are independent of changes in cell-type composition caused by neuronal loss or gliosis. Moreover, both the NAI and NAS module eigengenes show changes across affected brain regions (cortex, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">h</xref>; hippocampus, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">g</xref>; brain stem, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4h</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">i</xref>) but not cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">j</xref>), prior to decreases in brain weight that would be indicative of cell loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1i</xref>). This is further supported by analysis of expression profiles from sorted neurons and glia from the Tg4510 and PS2APP AD model which show cell intrinsic changes in the NAI and NAS module trajectories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">d</xref>). The NAI module is highly preserved in both microglia and astrocytes and significantly upregulated in these populations in transgenics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">d</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">l</xref>), while the neuronal NAS module is highly preserved in sorted neurons and downregulated in transgenics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">e</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">l</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">We next used experimentally derived databases of human protein-protein interactions (PPI) from Inweb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and Biogrid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> to create an integrated co-expression-PPI network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> to functionally annotate network edges and provide independent validation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">One of the hubs of the NAS module, <italic>Stx6</italic>, a SNARE protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, is also one of the few known genetic risk factors for tauopathy, having been previously implicated by GWAS and eQTL analyses in PSP. Other hubs, such as <italic>Syt4</italic>, <italic>Nlgn1</italic>, <italic>Nrgn</italic> also play important roles in synaptic maintenance and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Functional annotation of the NAS module with GO and KEGG terms, confirms its broader relationship to synaptic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). In contrast, functional annotation of the NAI module highlights pathways associated with astrogliosis and inflammatory changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, including T cell activation and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). Among the most central hub genes of the NAI module are <italic>Tnip1</italic> and <italic>Malt1</italic>, important inflammatory signaling genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

Comparison of the NAS and NAI modules in mice harboring 4 different AD and FTD risk mutations (PS2APP, CRND8, APP/PS1 and GRN - see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Online Methods</xref>) was also performed to assess to what extend these modules represent convergent pathways across models harboring different pathological proteins. The NAS and NAI models are highly preserved and their disease associations are maintained and both the NAI and NAS module expression changes occur with similar temporal profiles across each of these models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">i</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">l</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">Considering this cross-mouse model conservation, we next assessed module preservation in human disease models and post mortem tissue samples to validate their human relevance (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Online Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2a</xref> for list and characteristics of all human datasets, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2b</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">c</xref>). The NAS and NAI modules are dysregulated in patient cortex, but not in cerebellum, both in the previously published microarray-based data and in our newly generated RNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">m</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">n</xref>) consisting of both tau-positive and tau-negative FTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).

<title>Identification of potential miRNA drivers</title>

Consistent with its potential regulatory role, miR-203 is robustly upregulated in transgenic mice at six months in disease-affected areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6i</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">k</xref>), and in the frontal cortex in both tau-positive and tau-negative FTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">h</xref>). Protein levels of its targets are also significantly decreased in both granulin positive and negative FTD (p&lt;0.005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>).

<title>miR-203 regulates the neuronal mRNA module and causes cell death</title>
<p id="P21">To test the predicted causal relationship between miR-203 expression and NAS module down-regulation, we acutely over-expressed miR-203 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>) in primary cortical mouse neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Online Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>), observing downregulation of its predicted targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) and the NAS module more broadly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4a</xref>). We also observed increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>), peaking at DIV8 (1.85-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>), concurrent with peak NAS module downregulation. We further experimentally validated several predicted direct targets of miR-203 (<italic>Bcl2l2</italic>, <italic>Dgkb</italic>, <italic>Mapk10</italic>, <italic>Vsnl1</italic>) by luciferase reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>) and western blot (BCL2L2 and VSNL1l; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig 9</xref> for uncropped blots).</p>
<p id="P22">To control for potential confounding by supra-physiological over-expression in vitro, we moderately overexpressed miR-203 (approximately 2-fold; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">Online Methods</xref>) or a scrambled miRNA control (sc-miRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>) targeting neurons in wild-type mice in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">f</xref>). The NAS module is highly preserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4a</xref>) and down-regulated in neurons overexpressing miR-203 after six weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). Strikingly, the level of miR-203 expression correlates remarkably well with downregulation of both miR-203 predicted targets (R<sup>2</sup>=0.81, slope=−2.3; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7h</xref>) and NAS module genes (R<sup>2</sup>=0.81, slope=−2.2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7i</xref>).

<title>Pharmacological manipulation of NAS module genes</title>
<p id="P24">We reasoned that if the patterns of gene expression robustly associated with disease state across mice and humans represented causal phenomena as suggested by the GWAS enrichment, then their reversal should ameliorate the miR-203 mediated cell death phenotype. To test this, we screened the Connectivity Map (CMAP), a public compendium of cell line gene expression responses to drugs, to identify small molecules predicted to reverse NAS or NAI module changes observed across pathological conditions, albeit in non-neuronal cells. Four of the top 10 hits were histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4c</xref>), which was significant (permutated p&lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>).</p>
<p id="P25">We chose two of the predicted molecules, scriptaid, which was the top hit in CMAP (enrichment score = −0.969, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>) and SAHA (vorinostat; enrichment score = −0.846), which is in human clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. As predicted, addition of scriptaid to miR-203-overexpressing neurons decreases neuronal death caused by miR-203 overexpression to levels equivalent to controls (unpaired t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">c</xref>). We also found that 0.5μM SAHA decreases miR-203 induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">e</xref>). SAHA upregulated NAS module genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6f</xref>); however, SAHA showed toxicity at 1μM even in control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>). Next, we treated human iPSC-derived neurons from control and FTD patients with SAHA, observing that SAHA upregulates NAS module genes in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>). We therefore conclude that miR-203 directly regulates many NAS module hub genes and that the HDAC inhibitors scriptaid and SAHA, by targeting the NAS and NAI module genes and normalizing their expression, can ameliorate miR-203-induced pro-neurodegenerative changes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P26">The mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases are still poorly understood, a factor that impedes the design of therapeutic interventions to treat these disorders. Rather than focusing on <italic>a priori</italic> candidate genes, we pursued a systematic, genome-wide, functional genomics approach. Such studies have not been realized in the study of most neurodegenerative diseases, with a few notable exceptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. By taking genetic background into consideration, representing diverse causal mutations in transcriptomic network analyses, and validation in a dozen independent data sets, we identify disease-relevant gene networks representing specific molecular pathways. It is noteworthy that modules identified in the initial individual F1 crosses that are not conserved and dysregulated across all three strains, are also not conserved in other mouse models, or human brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig 10a</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">c</xref>), supporting the approach that we have taken.</p>
<p id="P27">In functional genomic studies, each experimental system on its own, whether post mortem human tissue, <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse models, has significant limitations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Here we show how a multi-stage systems biology analysis coupled with substantial <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental validation, provides a framework for discovery of new disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. We leverage the benefits of animal models of human disease, which permit temporal assessment of changes prior to substantial atrophy and cell loss, while mitigating the potential bias introduced by a single genetic background. We also consider the principles of regional vulnerability and disease trajectories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and find that gene networks associated with transgenic status are altered in brain areas that show signs of neurodegeneration. Conversely, in the cerebellum, a brain region that is spared in AD and FTD, the expression of the NAS and NAI modules, as well as miR-203, do not change significantly.</p>
<p id="P28">A key issue in any analysis of gene expression in disease is that changes in gene expression may be either a cause or consequence of the disorder. To advance our work towards identifying causal drivers, we experimentally validate a putative miRNA driver of the altered transcriptional networks, miR-203, which has previously not been implicated in neurodegeneration, and we show reversal by gene network-predicted pharmacological regulators. We also find significant enrichment of common genetic risk for FTD and PSP in the neuronal NAS module, and enrichment for AD GWAS signals in the NAI module, which is enriched in glial and immune genes. These data further support the potential causal role of these modules, and suggest different causal pathways in AD versus FTD and PSP, the latter of which are considered primary tauopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup></p>
<p id="P29">It is important to note that both expression changes in the disease associated gene modules NAS and NAI as well as the upregulation of miR-203, though clearly a point of convergence, are most likely downstream of initial pathological insults, whether dysfunction of tau or other major risk genes. From this perspective, these modules represent robust, highly conserved biological processes that provide a crucial link in the chain between an initial causal genetic insult and neuronal death and inflammation. As we show, long-term inhibition of miR-203 in the Tg4510 model, while upregulating anti-apoptotic pathways, downregulating pro-apoptotic pathways and increasing neuronal activity as measured by c-fos activation, does not reduce the phospho-tau burden (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8q</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">r</xref>). Though pharmacologically targeting these gene networks, or miR-203 itself, may not reverse tau aggregation or Aβ plaque formation, it may provide a means to uncouple dysfunction of aggregation prone proteins from inflammation, neurodegeneration and their behavioral outcomes – dementia. Supporting this possibility is the fact that neither the NAS nor the NAI modules are dysregulated in patients that show pathological aging, in which significant amyloid plaque density, but no dementia, is observed. Therefore, developing therapies that reverse the changes in the disease associated gene co-expression modules may be an opportunity to impede neurodegeneration across a broad spectrum of dementias without having to target unique upstream pathological events. We hypothesize that regulators of these highly conserved transcriptional programs, such as miR-203, may therefore be new therapeutic targets. Efforts to target miRNAs to treat diseases are already underway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and traditional anti-sense oligo based targets have reached clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, while small molecule modulators represent a new frontier in miRNA-based therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In this regard, identifying regulators of the NAI module is also likely to be a fertile avenue for future studies aimed at therapeutic development.</p>

Craniotomy was performed according to approved procedures (animal protocol number#2000–159): Eyes were covered with artificial tear drops, the scalp was bisected and the exposed area sterilized on a stereotactic frame (Model 900, David Kopf Instruments). The skull was thinned using a dremel drill and 1μl of AAV 2/9 (1 × 10<sup>13</sup> vector genomes (Vg)/ml of hSyn-miR203-hSyn-eGFP; 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> Vg/ml of hSyn-scrambled:miRNA-hSyn-eGFP (Signagen Labs, Rockville, USA)) was injected bilaterally into the frontal cortex (anterior/posterior: +2.1mm; mediolateral: ±1.5mm; dorsal/ventral: −2.5mm) at a rate of 100nl/min rate using Hamilton 5ul syringe (87930 Hamilton , Reno, USA. Before each injection the pipette was lowered 0.1mm beyond intended target depth and held in place for 3 minutes to create space for injected solution, while after each injection the pipette was held in place for 7 min before retraction to prevent leakage. The incision was sterilized, glued and post-operative antibiotics (Amoxil, 50mg/ml) were administered for 7 days following surgery.</p>

<title>Sample Collection and RNA Isolation</title>
<p id="P38">TPR50 mouse at 3- and 6-months-of-age were sacrificed using cervical dislocation. Cortex, hippocampus, brain stem and cerebellum were dissected on ice-cold PBS and flash frozen to minimize RNA degradation. RNA was isolated from different brain regions of interest from each sample using the miRNeasy kit with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen) using a QIAcube automated system. For each RNA sample, RNA concentration was determined using Ribogreen assay (Invitrogen) and RNA integrity was quantified using the RNA Integrity Number (RIN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">1</xref></sup> on an Agilent 2200 TapeStation.</p>
<p id="P39">Frozen human brain samples obtained from Emory brain bank were dissected on dry ice in a dehydrated dissection chamber to reduce degradation effects from sample thawing or humidity. 50–100mg tissue samples were used to isolate RNA using miRNeasy kit with on-column DNase digestion and samples with RIN &gt; 2 were further used.</p>

<title>RNA-seq Library Preparation</title>
<p id="P43">For TPR50 mouse data, 1μg of total RNA was used to obtain poly-A selected mRNAs, which were processed for unstranded libraries using TruSeq RNA Sample preparation (v2) kit. Briefly, poly-A tail containing mRNA was isolated using oligo-dT attached magnetic beads. mRNA is fragmented, and first strand cDNA is generated using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase followed by second strand cDNA generation. Barcodes and adapters were added and subsequent steps followed the TruSeq protocol to generate fragment sizes (150–500bp, mean 250bp). The libraries were quantified with the Quant-iT PicoGreen assay (Life Technologies) and validated on an Agilent 2200 TapeStation system. Libraries were multiplexed 24 samples per lane and each lane was sequenced several times to get an average read-depth of 40–50 million reads per sample on a HiSeq2500 instrument using high output mode with standard chemistry and protocols for 50bp paired end reads.</p>
<p id="P44">For postmortem human data, 1μg of total RNA was used for rRNA depletion with the RiboZero Gold kit (Illumina). Remaining RNA was size selected using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and standard libraries were prepared following Illumina’s TruSeq protocols for 50bp paired end reads. Libraries were sequenced at an average read-depth of 60–70 million reads per sample on a HiSeq2500 instrument using rapid mode.</p>
<p id="P45">We used SMART-Seq v4 ultra low input RNA kit (Clontech) for the library preparation of FACS sorted adult mouse neurons. RNA from FAC sorted cells (~1000 cells) were isolated using Nucleospin RNA XS kit (Clontech) with on-column DNase digestion following the manufacture’s protocol and the RNA was eluted in 10μl of RNase-free water. rRNA was depleted from the eluted total RNA and cDNA was synthesized using Primescript Reverse transcriptase. Sequencing adapters were added and library was amplified using SeqAmp DNA polymerase. Strand-specific library was size selected using AMPure XP beads and validated for fragment sizes (200–1000bp, peaking at 300bp). Libraries were multiplexed 12 samples per lane and each library was sequenced several times to get an average read-depth of 30–40 million reads per sample on a HiSeq2500 instrument using rapid mode.</p>
<p id="P46">We used TruSeq Stranded RNA-seq (Illumina) for the library preparation of vorinostat-treated neurons. Briefly cell pellet was collected from 6-well plates and RNA isolated using miRNeasy kit with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen). 100ng of total RNA was used for downstream library preparation using manufacture’s recommended protocol.

<title>mRNA-seq Read Alignment and Processing</title>
<p id="P47">To analyze TPR50 mouse mRNA-seq data, the paired-end raw reads were mapped to the reference mouse NCBIM37 genome using Ensembl release 67 (May 2012 data freeze) annotations with Tophat2 (v2.0.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">13</xref></sup> with novel junction option turned off. Aligned reads were sorted and alignments mapped to different chromosomes were removed from the BAM file using samtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">14</xref></sup>. Gene expression levels were quantified for all the samples using union gene models with HTSeq-Counts (v0.5.4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">15</xref></sup> which uses uniquely aligned reads. Genes were included in the analysis if they were expressed in 80% of the samples with &gt;10 reads. It is a common practice in RNA-seq experiments to filter low expressed gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">17</xref></sup>. There are a few reasons for this: 1) the low expressed genes are not reliably quantified and thus vary a lot between biological replicates. 2) None of the models such as the negative binomial distribution from DESeq2 (or edgeR) or log2 transformation followed by linear regression (which we used) can effectively model such highly variable genes. Due to these reasons, we remove these genes mainly to reduce noise in gene-expression from RNA-seq experiments.</p>
<p id="P48">The resulting read counts were normalized for library size using <italic>cpm</italic> function of egdeR package in R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">18</xref></sup> to get fragments per kilobase million mapped reads (FPKM) values. Log2 transformed FPKM values were quantile normalized using <italic>betweenLaneNormalization</italic> function of EDAseq package in R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">19</xref></sup>.</p>

Count level data were quantified using union gene and union exon models with HTSeq-Counts (v0.6.1) and genes were kept if they were expressed in 80% of the samples with &gt;10 reads with HTSeq union exon and union gene quantifications. Read counts were log<sub>2</sub> transformed and GC content, gene length, and library size normalized FPKM values using the cqn package in R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P50">FACS sorted neuronal RNA-seq data were processed similar to the human RNA-seq data except the paired-end reads were mapped to the reference mouse NCBIM37 genome using Ensembl release 67 annotations using rna-STAR aligner (v2.4.2a).</p>

<p id="P51">Mouse and human miRNA-seq read alignments and quantifications were performed using miRDeep2 package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">22</xref></sup>. We used mapper.pl script to map the 50bp single end reads to the reference genome – NCBIM37 for mouse and GRCh37 for human. We then used quantifier.pl script of the package to map the reads to annotated miRNAs, which were downloaded from miRbase (v20 for mouse data and miRbase v21 for human data) website.

Microarray data analysis was performed using R and Bioconductor packages. Raw expression data were log2 transformed and normalized by quantile normalization. Probes were considered robustly expressed if the detection P value was 0.05 for at least half of the samples in the data set.

<title>Differential Gene Expression</title>
<p id="P53">We used principal component (PC) analysis of the normalized gene-expression data to understand the biological and technical covariates effecting the data. For TPR50 dataset, we found that none of the first five gene-expression PCs correlated significantly with batch or sequencing PCs, and thus we only performed differential expression within a brain region and separately for each age-group using the normalized FPKM values in the linear regression model in R as follows:

<p id="P54">For all other mouse datasets, RIN, first two sequencing PCs, batch, experimental batch were used as covariates in the linear regression model. For human data, additional traits like age, sex and PMI were also used for the analysis. We also performed DGE for TPR50 dataset using DESeq2 R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">23</xref></sup> using raw counts data from HTSeq-Counts following the default parameters and taking Transgenic Condition, Mouse Strain, Sequencing Lane Batch and RIN as covariates for DESeq2 regression.</p>

<title>mRNA Weighted Co-expression Network Analysis</title>
<p id="P55">Co-expression network analysis was performed using a user-friendly R WGCNA library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">24</xref></sup>. We wanted to investigate mouse brain co-expression networks that are disease-specific but are independent of genetic backgrounds (C57BL6/J, DBA and FVB). We thus used consensus network analysis approach, which provided us with groups of co-expressed genes (or modules) that are not affected by mouse genetic background. TPR50 mouse were generated using a BAC clone as transgene, which overexpressed P301S mutation in human MAPT gene (4R2N isoform). However, the BAC clone had 3 additional confounding genes – Prnd (ENSMUSG00000027338), Erv3 (ENSMUSG00000037482) and Rassf2 (ENSMUSG00000027339) in the construct, which were also overexpressed. To remove the effect of the confounding genes, we took the 1<sup>st</sup> principal component of the expression of the confounding genes and removed the genes, which are significantly correlated at FDR p&lt;0.05. This resulted in removal of about 1000 genes, which are highly correlated with the confounding genes. We only used the 6-month time-point to construct the initial network. The resulting expression data for each brain region, except cerebellum, at the 6-month time-point was used to create consensus network separately and <italic>matchLabels</italic> function of WGCNA package was used to have consistent network labeling between brain regions.</p>
<p id="P56">In short, biweighted mid-correlations were calculated for all pairs of genes, and then a signed similarity matrix was created. In the signed network, the similarity between genes reflects the sign of the correlation of their expression profiles. The signed similarity matrix was then raised to power β to emphasize strong correlations and reduce the emphasis of weak correlations on an exponential scale. The resulting adjacency matrix was then transformed into a topological overlap matrix as described here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P57">Since we are primarily interested in finding co-expression patterns conserved across different mouse genetic backgrounds, we created a consensus network to identify common co-expression patterns across strains, following published methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">26</xref></sup>. After scaling for each individual network (consensus scaling quantile=0.2) a thresholding power of 12 was chosen (as it was the smallest threshold that resulted in a scale-free R<sup>2</sup> fit of 0.8) and the consensus network was created by calculating the component-wise minimum values for topologic overlap (TO). Using 1 − TO (dissTOM) as the distance measure, genes were hierarchically clustered. Initial module assignments were determined by using a dynamic tree-cutting algorithm (cutreeHybrid, using default parameters except deepSplit = 4, cutHeight = 0.999, minModulesize = 100, dthresh=0.1 and pamStage = FALSE).</p>
<p id="P58">The resulting modules or groups of co-expressed genes were used to calculate module eigengenes (MEs; or the 1<sup>st</sup> principal component of the module). Modules annotated using the GOElite package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">27</xref></sup>. We performed module preservation analysis using mRNA module definitions. MEs were correlated with different biological and technical traits like transgenic condition, strain, RIN, etc. to find disease-specific modules. Module hubs were defined by calculating module membership (kME) values which are the Pearson correlations between each gene and each ME. Genes with kME &lt; 0.7 were removed from the module. Network visualization was done using iGraph package in R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">28</xref></sup>. Module definitions from the network analysis were used to create synthetic eigengene for the 3-month time point and were used to understand the trajectory of various modules across time-points. For the cerebellum a data synthetic module eigengene was calculated using cortex co-expression definitions and plotted.</p>

<title>Cell-type Specific Regression Analysis</title>
<p id="P59">To ensure that the changes in module expression identified were not solely a product of neurodegeneration and gliosis, we employed a multivariate linear regression model to regress gene expression levels against transgenic condition and the first principal component (PC1) of the top one hundred cell-type specific marker genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">29</xref></sup> for five major cell types: neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells.

<title>Isolation of infected adult mouse neurons using flow cytometry.</title>
<p id="P72">Frontal cortex of adult male mice was dissected in ice-cold Hibernate A-lacking calcium (BrainBits; HA-Ca). Tissue was roughly chopped in HA-Ca, moved to 15mL Falcon tube and incubated in 5ml of activated papain (Worthington; LK003178; resuspended in HA-Ca) in the presence of DNase I for 30min at 37°C with continuous agitation. Papain digested tissue was triturated and cell debris was removed using ovomucoid (Worthington; LK003182; resuspended in HA-Ca) discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1.8mL Hibernate A-low fluorescence (BrainBits; HA-LF) to create a mononuclear cell suspension. To further reduce the amount of debris, the Miltyne myelin removal kit was used. Briefly, 200uL myelin removal beads (Miltyne; 130–096-733) were added to the cell suspension, incubated at 4°C for 15 minutes, 2mL of HA-LF was added and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 300g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in 1mL of HA-LF and applied to prepared LS columns (Miltyne; 130–042-401). Flow-through, as well as two 1mL washes with Ha-LF, were collected, centrifuged at 600g for 5min at 4°C and resuspended in 750uL HA-LF. Myelin depleted samples were labeled with live cell marker DRAQ5 (Fisher; 6225; 1uL/1mL of cell suspension) and dead-cell marker NucBlue® (Invitrogen; R37606; 2 drops/mL of cell suspension). The cells were FAC sorted on BD FACS Aria cell sorter gating for DAPI-/DRAQ5+/GFP+ cells. For each sample a maximum of 1000 cells were isolated and directly collected in 100ul of RA1 buffer with 2ul tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and low mass RNA was isolated with on-column DNase digestion using Nucleospin RNA XS kit (Clontech) following the manufacture’s protocol.</p>
