<abstract>
<p>Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) is a core component of the hPrP19 complex that controls RNA splicing. Here, we performed an exon array assay and showed that β-catenin is a target of BCAS2 splicing regulation. The regulation of dendrite growth and morphology by β-catenin is well documented. Therefore, we generated conditional knockout (cKO) mice to eliminate the BCAS2 expression in the forebrain to investigate the role of BCAS2 in dendrite growth. BCAS2 cKO mice showed a microcephaly-like phenotype with a reduced volume in the dentate gyrus (DG) and low levels of learning and memory, as evaluated using Morris water maze analysis and passive avoidance, respectively. Golgi staining revealed shorter dendrites, less dendritic complexity and decreased spine density in the DG of BCAS2 cKO mice. Moreover, the cKO mice displayed a short dendrite length in newborn neurons labeled by DCX, a marker of immature neurons, and BrdU incorporation. To further examine the mechanism underlying BCAS2-mediated dendritic malformation, we overexpressed β-catenin in BCAS2-depleted primary neurons and found that the dendritic growth was restored. In summary, BCAS2 is an upstream regulator of β-catenin gene expression and plays a role in dendrite growth at least partly through β-catenin.</p>

<body>
<p>The breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) gene is mapped to the human chromosome 1p13.2 region encoding a 26-kD small nuclear protein. BCAS2 binds to the estrogen receptor (ER) to mediate ER gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. BCAS2 is also involved in prostate cancer through interactions with the androgen receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Recent studies demonstrated at least 2 BCAS2 mechanisms associated with carcinogenesis: (1) negative regulation of p53: depletion of BCAS2 leads to apoptosis in p53 wild-type cell lines but induces G2/M growth arrest in p53 null and p53 mutant cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>; and (2) binding to a single-stranded DNA-binding protein involved in the DNA repair function of the hPrp19 complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, which participates in the DNA damage response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
<p>BCAS2 is a core member of the Prp19 spliceosome complex to regulate RNA splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Knockdown of the BCAS2/spf27 subunit destabilizes the hPrp19 complex, which results in mitotic defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. BCAS2 was recently found to be an essential gene during the embryonic stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. We previously reported that wing-specific knockdown of BCAS2 causes <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing developmental defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>; due to BCAS2 participates in Delta pre-mRNA splicing and regulates the Delta-Notch signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Delta-Notch signaling is known to be important in neurogenesis. For example, mice deficient in <italic>Dlk1</italic> show defects in postnatal neurogenesis within the subventricular zone (SVZ), which results in a lack of mature neurons in the olfactory bulb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. To gain insight into BCAS2-targeted genes, we performed exon array analysis using BCAS2-depleted cells. From the functional catalogue of alternative splicing events, β-catenin was a candidate for BCAS2-targeted genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an important role in neuronal development and neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Disruption of β-catenin results in dendritic and brain malformation, leading to degenerative diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
<p>Neurons in the mammalian brain contain complicated dendritic trees. Dendrites are important for synaptic connections that are modified by the intensity and frequency of synaptic activity. Therefore, dendritic development is critical for neural circuit formation and synaptic input processing for cognitive processes such as learning and memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Global KO of BCAS2 is lethal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and this finding is consistent with current reports showing that depleting one member of the hPrp19 complex (e.g., PLGR1 or PSO4) leads to early embryonic lethality in a mouse model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To study the role of BCAS2 in dendritic development, we crossed our floxed-BCAS2 mice with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα)-iCre transgenic mice to conditionally knockout BCAS2 in the postnatal forebrain. Conditional knockout (cKO) of BCAS2 in the forebrain resulted in a microcephaly-like brain size. BCAS2 cKO mice exhibited impaired learning and memory and dendritic malformation in the hippocampus. Additionally, depletion of BCAS2 reduced the splicing efficiency of β-catenin pre-mRNA in cell lines and cKO mice. Moreover, exogenous expression of β-catenin could restore the reduced dendritic length in the primary neuronal cells. In summary, BCAS2 is an upstream regulator of β-catenin gene expression, and it plays a role in dendrite growth at least partly through β-catenin.</p>

<title>Expression of β-catenin is regulated by BCAS2 via pre-mRNA splicing</title>
<p>BCAS2 regulates pre-mRNA splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. To search for candidate BCAS2-targeted genes, we extracted RNA from BCAS2-knockdown MCF7 cells to perform exon array analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and found that β-catenin was a potential BCAS2-targeted gene. To confirm whether the efficiency of β-catenin splicing could be affected by BCAS2 depletion, we evaluated the expression of β-catenin mRNA and pre-mRNA. The results showed a significant reduction in the mRNA level of β-catenin and an accumulation of β-catenin pre-mRNA in BCAS2-depleted MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, right), indicating that the splicing efficiency was impaired in the absence of BCAS2. Moreover, we confirmed the decreased protein expression of β-catenin in BCAS2-depleted MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Previously, we found that the BCAS2 C-terminus containing the coiled-coil motifs is essential for RNA splicing. The full-length or C fragment of BCAS2 is functional for RNA splicing, but the deltaCC mutant (deleted coiled-coil motifs) cannot perform its splicing role<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. To further confirm whether BCAS2 can regulate β-catenin splicing, we transfected full-length BCAS2, the deltaCC mutant or the C fragment into β-catenin-silenced N2A cells and then measured the RNA and protein expression by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Because of the high β-catenin expression in N2A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, lane 1), the forced BCAS2 expression could not increase the β-catenin RNA and protein levels (data not shown). Therefore, we needed to generate a low β-catenin expression environment to analyze the effects of BCAS2 mutants on β-catenin splicing. We treated N2A cells with siβ-catenin to knock down the β-catenin RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, lane 2) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, lane 2). Overexpression of BCAS2 and the C fragment increased the β-catenin RNA and protein expression (lanes 3 and 5 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>,d) compared with that in the low-β-catenin level N2A cells treated with siβ-catenin (lane 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>,d); in contrast, the deltaCC mutant had no effect (lane 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>,d). Furthermore, <italic>nanog</italic>, a β-catenin-targeted gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, was still decreased in deltaCC-transfected β-catenin silenced cells, but overexpression of the full-length or C fragment of BCAS2 rescued the mRNA expression of <italic>nanog</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Taken together, these results show that BCAS2 can regulate β-catenin RNA splicing and expression.</p>

<title>BCAS2 distribution in brain</title>
<p>BCAS2 is involved in β-catenin splicing; thus, depletion of BCAS2 results in a reduction in β-catenin gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an important role in neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In this study, we investigated the role of BCAS2 in dendrite development in mice. Firstly, to examine the BCAS2 distribution in various tissues of wild-type mice (WT), western blot analysis was performed, and the results showed that BCAS2 was expressed in various tissues, such as the eye, kidney, lung, and brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1a</xref>). IHC analysis revealed BCAS2 expression in the entire forebrain, including the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and amygdala, of WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1b</xref>). We then used doublecortin (DCX) and NeuN as immature neuron and mature neuron markers, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, to examine the expression pattern of BCAS2 in different neuronal cell types. DCX was expressed in the cytoplasm of immature neurons in the inner cell layer of the DG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1c</xref>) and was co-expressed with BCAS2. NeuN was expressed in the nuclei of mature neurons in the GCL of the DG and was also co-expressed with BCAS2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1d</xref>). Thus, BCAS2 can be expressed in the forebrain in both immature and mature neurons.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Generation of forebrain-specific BCAS2 KO mice</title>
<p>BCAS2 was highly expressed in the brain of WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1a</xref>). Ubiquitous depletion of BCAS2 causes embryonic lethality in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. To investigate the role of BCAS2 in dendritic development, we used the Cre/loxP system to generate floxed-BCAS2 mice (BCAS2<sup>Flox/Flox</sup>), in which exons 3 and 4 of BCAS2 were flanked by loxP. Crossing floxed-BCAS2 mice with CaMKIIα-iCre transgenic mice generated a truncated BCAS2 gene with a frameshift mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). CaMKIIα-iCre is expressed in the forebrain beginning at postnatal day 3, with a peak level at day 15<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We then verified both the targeted gene deletion in the genotypes of the offspring by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, upper) and the presence of the <italic>Cre</italic> gene at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, lower). The ratio of the offspring genotypes (BCAS2<sup>+/+</sup>:BCAS2<sup>Flox/+</sup>:BCAS2<sup>Flox/Flox</sup>) was nearly 1:2:1 (data not shown). The BCAS2 mRNA expression in cKO mice (BCAS2<sup>Flox/Flox</sup>;CaMKIIα-iCre<sup>+</sup> mice) was greatly reduced, as shown by RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Western blot analysis showed a dramatic reduction in the BCAS2 protein in the cortex and hippocampus but not in the spleen, kidney or cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). However, in CaMKIIα-iCre transgenic mice, Cre recombinase is expressed predominantly in neurons but not in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>; thus, there was still detectable BCAS2 protein expression in the forebrains of cKO mice, as indicated by RT-PCR and western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>,d). IFA also showed that the expression of BCAS2 was reduced in the DG of cKO mice, but some BCAS2 expression was still detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>; white arrow). Hence, BCAS2 should be expressed in the astrocytes of cKO mice. To confirm this conclusion, IFA analysis was performed, and it revealed the presence of BCAS2 in the GFAP-expressing astrocytes from both cKO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>) as WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>) mice. Taken together, the results show that we successfully generated BCAS2 cKO mice and specifically deleted BCAS2 in neurons but not astrocytes in the forebrain.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>BCAS2 cKO in the mouse forebrain causes a microcephaly-like phenotype</title>
<p>We investigated the effect of eliminating BCAS2 in the adult mouse forebrain. Compared with the WT, BCAS2 cKO mice showed a reduced brain size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, left) but not in the cerebellum, which agrees with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> showing equal BCAS2 expression between cKO and WT. The weight of the forebrain of cKO mice was 20% less than that of WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, right), but the appearance and body weight was comparable to the WT (data not shown). Histology of the forebrain also revealed a smaller forebrain in cKO mice compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Hence, BCAS2 cKO in the forebrain resulted in a microcephaly-like phenotype.</p>
<p>Because the CaMKIIα-iCre transgene is widely expressed in projection neurons of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus (including CA1, CA2, CA3 and CA4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, the dentate gyrus (DG) is a critical entry point of the well-recognized hippocampal circuit, which conveys the neural signals from the performant pathway to the CA3 neurons that further project to CA1 neurons via the Schaffer collaterals. The activity of the hippocampal circuit is important for various cognitive functions and pathological conditions, and the circuit is gated at the main entrance, DG granule cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. To evaluate the function of the hippocampus, we first examined the structural properties of DG granule cells in our mutant mice. To investigate the effect of BCAS2 elimination on DG volume, 40-μm vibratome sections from the hippocampus of adult WT and cKO mice were stained with anti-NeuN antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The DG volume evaluated using <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> was calculated by a stereologic method with ImageJ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The DG volume of cKO mice was less than that of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>; 0.40 vs 0.49 mm<sup>3</sup>; <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.05), which is consistent with the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>. To further quantify the granule cell density in the DG, 4-μm coronal brain sections were incubated with anti-NeuN antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The granule cell density was greater in BCAS2 cKO than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>, left. 2,788,235 vs 2,487,332 NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.05). In addition, the estimated granule cell number was slightly decreased in cKO mice, but there was no significant difference in this number in the DG between WT and cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>, right). Therefore, the smaller DG volume in cKO mice may result from the reduced space within cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>BCAS2 cKO mice show impaired cognitive behaviors</title>
<p>Because BCAS2 cKO mice had small brains with significantly reduced DG volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) and previous studies reported that brain size is associated with learning and memory capacities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, we evaluated the cognitive capabilities of BCAS2 cKO mice. In the open field test, the WT and cKO mice did not differ in locomotor activities, with the two genotypes having comparable mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). To evaluate the hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory abilities, Morris water maze analysis was performed. On all 4 training days beginning with Day 1, BCAS2 cKO mice took a significantly longer time to find the platform than did WT. Thus, compared to WT mice, BCAS2 cKO mice showed reduced learning location ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). For the probe trial, the hidden platform was removed, and the memory consolidation after 4-day training trials was evaluated as the amount of time that the mice spent in the target quadrant (where the platform was placed). BCAS2 cKO mice showed a significant reduction in the retention latency in the target quadrant during the probe trial, which indicates impaired spatial memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Because cKO showed impaired performances in learning and memory, we performed a passive avoidance test to evaluate the fear memory. The mice of each genotype were exposed to comparable fear-related learning and memory tasks. The apparatus consisted of one light and one dark compartment separated by a vertical sliding door. On the training day, the mouse entered the dark chamber and received an electrical foot shock. On the test day (24 hours after training), the time until the mouse entered the dark compartment was recorded as the retention latency. The latency time of the BCAS2 cKO in the light compartment was lower than that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), which indicates impaired fear memory consolidation in the cKO mice. Collectively, BCAS2 has a role in spatial and fear memory and learning ability.</p>

<title>BCAS2 cKO in mice results in dendritic malformation</title>
<p>Brain neurons exhibit a complex dendritic distribution that plays a major role in forming neural circuits and process synaptic inputs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. To gain more insight into the defective hippocampus-related learning and memory in BCAS2 cKO mice, we used Golgi staining to examine the morphology of DG granule cells in the hippocampal region. We reconstructed 30 granule cells of each genotype for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) and found that the dendrite length was significant lower in cKO mice than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Furthermore, we also examined the dendritic complexity of granule cells. The number of dendritic segments was significantly lower at each dendritic order in cKO mice compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Sholl analysis also revealed a lower number of intersections per Sholl in cKO mice compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Moreover, in BCAS2 cKO mice, the dendritic spine density of granule cells was significantly lower in the distal region but not in the proximal region of the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>,f). The association between BCAS2 and β-catenin in the mouse hippocampus, IFA revealed that cKO mice showed lower expression of β-catenin in the DG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a,b</xref>). In BCAS2 cKO mice, the level of β-catenin was also decreased in the CA1 region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3c,d</xref>). Although we did not quantify the morphometric parameters of CA1 pyramidal neurons, immunostaining of microtubule-associated protein 2, a dendritic marker, showed impaired dendritic structures in CA1 neurons in BCAS2 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>). It too indicated a β-catenin-mediated dendritic malformation in CA1 neurons of BCAS2 cKO mice. Collectively, BCAS2 is involved in dendritic growth.</p>

<title>BCAS2 cKO mice have reduced dendrite growth in the newborn neurons of the adult DG</title>
<p>DCX is an immature neuron marker, and nucleus BCAS2 was co-expressed with cytoskeleton DCX within one cell in normal mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1c</xref>). We wondered whether BCAS2 could regulate dendritic development and growth of DG newborn neuron in Cre-expressing WT and cKO mice. Firstly, to test the specificity of the anti-Cre antibody, IFA was used and showed Cre expression in nucleus of CaMKIIα-iCre transgenic mice (WT); however, Cre was not detectable in the non-transgenic mice lacking Cre gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Next we examined whether Cre (CamKIIα-driven) could be expressed in immature neurons. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref> (upper), DCX and Cre were co-expressed in the immature neurons of CaMKIIα-iCre transgenic mice and the proportion of Cre expression neurons was around 20% among total DCX-positive neurons that was in agreement with the report by Arruda-Carvalho <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. We then used IFA analysis to compare dendrite morphology of DCX<sup>+</sup>Cre<sup>+</sup> using 40 μm sections for each genotype. To characterize dendrite morphology of DCX<sup>+</sup>Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons, neurons that had a short dendrite that could not extend past half of the granule cell layer were considered stage A, and neurons that featured a long dendrite morphology (dendrites extended to half of the granule cell layer) were considered stage B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. DCX<sup>+</sup>Cre<sup>+</sup> immature neurons in the DG of cKO mice had poor dendrite development compared with those of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Quantitation analysis revealed that in WT mice, 30.6% of DCX<sup>+</sup>Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons were in stage A, and 69.4% were in stage B. In cKO mice, 44.2% of DCX<sup>+</sup>Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons were in stage A, and 55.8% were in stage B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Moreover, to further examine the role of BCAS2 in the dendritic growth of newborn neurons, BrdU was administered, and IFA was performed after 28 days as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>, upper panel). Co-expression of BrdU with DCX<sup>+</sup>Cre<sup>+</sup> cells was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). In WT mice, 32.5% and 67.5% of BrdU<sup>+</sup>DCX<sup>+</sup>Cre<sup>+</sup> cells belonged to stage A and B, respectively; compared with 46.3% and 53.7%, respectively, in cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>).

<title>Expression of β-catenin is reduced in BCAS2 cKO mice</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, BCAS2 regulated β-catenin gene expression via pre-mRNA splicing. To further investigate the underlying mechanism of the abnormal cognitive behaviors and dendritic development of BCAS2 cKO mice; IFA revealed that cKO mice showed lower expression of β-catenin in the DG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a,b</xref>). We then evaluated the splicing efficiency of β-catenin by BCAS2 in cKO mice, RNAs from the hippocampal tissues of each genotype were analyzed. The results showed an accumulation of pre-RNA and a reduced mRNA level in BCAS2 cKO mice compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Moreover, RT-PCR and western blot analysis further confirmed the decreased β-catenin expression level in the forebrain of BCAS2 cKO mice compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>,c). Thus, BCAS2 regulates the β-catenin pre-mRNA splicing in the forebrain, which is consistent with the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we previously reported that <italic>Drosophila</italic> BCAS2 participates in <italic>Delta</italic> pre-mRNA splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Therefore, we also examined whether BCAS2 elimination resulted in impaired splicing efficiency of <italic>Delta</italic> pre-mRNA in mammalian cells. A splicing assay in MCF7 cells revealed that the <italic>Delta</italic> gene splicing was indeed regulated by BCAS2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>), in agreement with our previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, in the hippocampal tissues of cKO mice, the <italic>Delta</italic> mRNA and protein expression did not differ between WT and cKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4b,c</xref>). Therefore, the expression of Delta is not regulated by BCAS2 in the hippocampus of mice, and BCAS2-regulated dendritic development is independent of Delta-Notch signaling. Altogether, the results indicate that BCAS2 may regulate dendrite formation and growth via β-catenin.</p>

<title>Overexpression of β-catenin can rescue dendritic growth in BCAS2-knockdown primary neurons</title>
<p>Dendritic spines are small actin-rich protrusions from neuronal dendrites that contribute to the postsynaptic information processing of most excitatory synapses associated with learning and memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. BCAS2 cKO mice showed abnormal cognitive behavior, dendritic malformation and a low level of β-catenin expression in the forebrain. Here, to further confirm that BCAS2 regulates dendrite growth through β-catenin <italic>in vivo</italic>, we induced β-catenin expression in BCAS2-knockdown primary neurons. The shBCAS2 (shmB2#1) targeting the mouse BCAS2 gene was then generated, and it could efficiently diminish exogenous BCAS2 expression in N2A cells in which containing Flag-BCAS2(wt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8aa</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). To further test the specificity of shmB2#1, we generated BCAS2 mutant plasmid for a silent mutant resistant to shmB2#1; the sequence corresponding to the shmB2#1-targeted nucleotide sequence (position 277–293) and was named Flag-BCAS2(mt). When Flag-BCAS2(mt) and shmB2#1 were co-transfected into N2A cells, the results showed that Flag-BCAS2(mt) could express BCAS2 protein as Flag-BCAS2(wt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8aa</xref>, lanes 2 and 4) and shmB2#1 could not reduce exogenous BCAS2 expression in Flag-BCAS2(mt)-containing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8aa</xref>, lane 3). Quantitation analysis showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8ab</xref>. Additionally, BCAS2 silent mutant could rescue the reduced dendrite length in BCAS2-knockdown primary neurons those were isolated from the forebrains of E18.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8ac,ad</xref>). Collectively, shBCAS2 can specifically inhibit BCAS2 expression. To test whether β-catenin can rescue dendritic growth in BCAS2-knockdown primary neurons, we transfected the neurons with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-containing shBCAS2 plasmid alone or with exogenous V5-tagged β-catenin plasmids. We measured the dendrite length using the existence of MAP2 along with the overlapping GFP and V5 expression in the neuron. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref> and with the quantitative analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>, the overexpression of β-catenin alone significantly increased the dendrite growth compared with that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>, panel bb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>, lane 2). For the BCAS2 knockdown, reduced dendrite growth was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref> panels bc and be; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>, lanes 3 and 5). However, forced β-catenin expression in BCAS2-knockdown cells restored the decreased dendrite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref> panels bd and bf; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>, lanes 4 and 6). Collectively, the results indicate that β-catenin could restore the dendrite length in BCAS2-knockdown primary neurons. Moreover, each shRNA targeted to BCAS2 decreased the level of BCAS2 and decreased the endogenous β-catenin level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>, lanes 2 and 3), in agreement with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>. The exogenous V5-tagged β-catenin was detectable in BCAS2 knockdown cells and restored the decreased β-catenin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>, lanes 4–6). In summary, BCAS2 regulates neuron growth in a β-catenin-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we demonstrated that BCAS2 regulates β-catenin pre-RNA splicing. An exon array assay indicated that β-catenin was a candidate of BCAS2 splicing-target gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We confirmed that a lack of BCAS2 reduced the β-catenin pre-mRNA splicing, leading to reduced β-catenin expression in the hippocampal tissues of BCAS2 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Hence, BCAS2 is an upstream regulator of β-catenin gene expression. A lack of β-catenin leads to early embryonic death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. β-Catenin is highly expressed in the entire brain, especially the cortex and hippocampus, and it plays a critical role in dendritic arborization and dendritic complexity, including the dendritic branch tip number and the total dendritic branch length, during post-natal neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Loss of function or mutations at individual residues of β-catenin causes brain malformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. β-catenin cKO in postnatal newborn neurons in the hippocampal DG leads to defective dendritic morphology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Like β-catenin, BCAS2 is highly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), and global BCAS2 KO is embryonically lethal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. These findings imply a strong functional correlation between BCAS2 and β-catenin.</p>
<p>BCAS2 can regulate the expression level of β-catenin, which reportedly regulates dendrite growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In this study, BCAS2 cKO mice showed decreased dendrite elongation during dendritic development in the postnatal DG. Overexpression of β-catenin with BCAS2 knockdown in primary neurons restored dendritic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). These results are consistent with the increased dendritic arborization when β-catenin is expressed exogenously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Thus, BCAS2 cKO mice exhibit dendritic malformation, at least partially, via reduced β-catenin expression.</p>
<p>Here, we showed that BCAS2 knockout in the forebrain led to a reduced brain size and impaired learning and memory. In terms of brain morphology, BCAS2 cKO mice exhibited a microcephaly-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The reduced forebrain size may result from several factors, such as a lack of newborn neurons, cell death, or changes in dendrite length and complexity. However, the NeuN-positive cells in the DG were not significantly different between WT and BCAS2 cKO mice, and the NeuN-positive cell density in BCAS2 cKO mice was greater than that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). It is clear that β-catenin, a downstream effector of BCAS2, is expressed in hippocampal neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In the present study, IFA demonstrated the reduced level of β-catenin in the hippocampus of BCAS2 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). In cKO mice, shortened dendritic length and reduced dendritic complexity were evident in DG granule cells and DCX-positive immature neurons revealed by Golgi-impregnation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>) and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), respectively. Since β-catenin is known to play important roles in dendritic development in the hippocampal DG. Our results are in line with these findings; hence β-catenin may mediate the effect of BCAS2 on dendritic arbors of DG neurons.</p>
<p>BCAS2 cKO mice showed learning and memory defects in both the Morris water maze assay and the passive avoidance test. A small brain size is strongly associated with cognitive deficits. For example, chemical-induced rat microcephaly produces neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with congenital brain defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Patients with decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) protein levels show clinical microcephaly with learning disabilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, and ERK2-null mice show microcephaly associated with impaired proliferation of neural progenitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Moreover, aging can trigger mild cognitive impairment and dementia that can be diagnosed by hippocampal atrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In contrast, a large hippocampus is closely associated with good memory and cognitive function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. It is worthwhile to investigate the volume of various regions in the forebrain (such as the cerebral cortex) and the progenitor proliferation of BCAS2 cKO to obtain more insight into the BCAS2-null-induced microcephaly.</p>
<p>In general, neurogenesis involves neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation, axonal and dendritic specification, NSC maturation, and the synaptogenesis of newborn cells. Here, we used BrdU tracing showed that the loss of BCAS2 would impair the dendritic growth of newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>,e). Thus, the impaired dendritic development in cKO mice further suggests that a lack of BCAS2 may cause neurodegenerative diseases, which supports previous reports of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients showing low mRNA expression of BCAS2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Moreover, AD patients also show a reduced hippocampal volume<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Whether and how BCAS2 is involved in AD needs further investigation. Furthermore, neurodegenerative diseases are induced by a gradual loss of different neuron populations, and they often feature axonal and dendritic degeneration, which leads to synaptic transmission deficits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Apart from AD, several neuronal disorders, such as schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, major depression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> and temporal lobe epilepsy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, show reduced hippocampal volume<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. The shrinkage of the hippocampus in late adulthood leads to impaired memory and increased risk for dementia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Here, we found that BCAS2 cKO mice had a small brain size with impaired learning and memory, and they also exhibited markedly defective dendritic arborization of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref>). These findings are consistent with impaired dendritic development leading to hippocampal atrophy with effects on memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p>
<p>BCAS2 regulates RNA splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> BCAS2 reportedly participates in <italic>Delta</italic> pre-mRNA splicing and regulates Delta-Notch signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In both the neurogenic SGZ and subventricular zone (SVZ) regions, Delta-Notch signaling maintains the population of neuron stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> and is also involved in dendritic development in the hippocampal DG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. In MCF7 cells, BCAS2 regulates <italic>Delta</italic> RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>), as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, the mRNA and protein expression of <italic>Delta</italic> did not differ in the brain tissues of WT and BCAS2 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4b,c</xref>). Thus, BCAS2 may not regulate the dendritic development in the hippocampal region through Delta-Notch signaling. Similarly, the splicing of multiple tested RNAs, including critical cell cycle regulators, such as p53, cyclin D1, cyclin E1, and tubulin, in PLRG1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts was unaffected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Hence, various tissues may assemble different splicing factors for specific gene splicing to control the gene expression pattern.</p>
<p>Microarray analysis of AD patients revealed decreased expression of BCAS2 and β-catenin in; thus, these genes are categorized as AD-related genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the BCAS2 gene loci is associated with autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Children with autism can have mental disorders. Thus, decreased BCAS2 expression or a BCAS2 mutation may be involved in neuronal degenerative diseases. Current therapeutic approaches to elevate the β-catenin level (such as GSK-3β inhibitor) in neurodegenerative diseases are in development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. We found that BCAS2 could regulate the β-catenin level, which can regulate dendrite growth. Hence, BCAS2 may also be a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>In summary, BCAS2 is an upstream regulator of β-catenin gene expression, and it plays a role in dendrite growth, at least partially through β-catenin. Our data suggest that the BCAS2-null-induced small brain size may result from dendrite malformation, thus resulting in cognitive deficits.</p>

<p>BCAS2 conditional KO mice were generated by the Transgenic Mouse Core Facility in the National Taiwan University Center for Genomic Medicine. The water maze and passive avoidance assays were conducted in the Behavior Core Laboratory of the Neurobiology and Cognitive Science Center; the confocal image analysis at The Imaging Core at the First Core Lab; and the paraffin section preparation in the Animal Center, National Taiwan University. We also thank Dr. Shu-Wha Lin for advice on generating BCAS2 conditional knockout mice; Dr. Yi-Shuian Huang for critical discussions; and Nature Publishing Group Language Editing for editing English. This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (NSC102-2320-B-002-033-MY3; MOST 104-2320-B-002-053-MY3), the National Health Research Institute (NHRI-EX101-10148SI), and National Taiwan University (10R891903).</p>

<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the BCAS2 gene targeting strategy. The LoxP-floxed allele contains one LoxP inserted between exons 2 and 3 and the other LoxP inserted between exons 4 and 5 with two Flip recombinase targets (FRTs) flanking the Neo cassette. The Neo cassette was removed by Flip recombinase. Exons 3 and 4 were deleted by CaMKIIα-iCre recombinase. CU and FD are primers for genotyping. (<bold>b</bold>) Genotyping by PCR. BCAS2<sup>Flox/+</sup>;CaMKIIα-iCre<sup>+</sup> offspring were crossed with each other, which resulted in 6 different genotypes. Genomic DNA was extracted from tails of offspring. Upper: The sizes of the bands identified by CU and FD primers were 0.8 kb for BCAS2<sup>+/+</sup>, 0.8 and 0.7 kb for the heterozygous BCAS2-floxed allele (BCAS2<sup>Flox/+</sup>), and 0.7 kb for the homozygous BCAS2-floxed allele (BCAS2<sup>Flox/Flox</sup>). Lower: Cre gene. In this study, BCAS2<sup>Flox/Flox</sup>;CaMKIIα-iCre<sup>+</sup> mice were considered the forebrain-specific BCAS2 cKO mice and were named cKO; the WT mice were BCAS2<sup>+/+</sup> and contained the Cre gene.

<title>Reduced β-catenin gene expression in the BCAS2 cKO hippocampus.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) RNA was extracted from the hippocampus of WT and BCAS2 cKO mice. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that loss of BCAS2 caused increased β-catenin pre-mRNA and reduced β-catenin mRNA levels, as evaluated by three independent experiments, indicating the impaired splicing efficiency of β-catenin pre-mRNA (n = 3). (<bold>b</bold>) RT-PCR analysis of the β-catenin expression level. Left, representative result. Right, quantification of the left panel (n = 3). (<bold>c</bold>) Western blot analysis of the protein levels of BCAS2 and β-catenin in the cortex and hippocampus of each genotype. Left, representative western blot. Right, quantification of the left panel (n = 3). Results are shown as the mean ± S.D. and analyzed by a two-tailed Student’s test. Uncropped blots are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>.</p>

<title>Overexpression of β-catenin can rescue the impaired dendritic growth of the BCAS2 knockdown in a primary neuron culture.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Identification of shBCAS2 to target mouse BCAS2 gene. (aa) Western blot analysis. shmB2#1 could not reduced the exogenous BCAS2 expression while co-transfected with BCAS2 silent mutant (Flag-BCAS2(mt)). (ab) Quantification of three independent experiments analyzed by one-way ANOVA. (ac) BCAS2 silent mutant can rescue dendrite length in shRNA treated primary neuron cells. The primary neurons isolated from the forebrains of E18.5 embryos were seeded and then transfected with the following: the pLL3.7 (Mock), shRNAs targeting BCAS2 (shmB2#1) or Flag-tagged BCAS2(mt) alone, or shBCAS2 plasmid with Flag-tagged BCAS2(mt). IFA was performed 5 days after the plasmid transfection using anti-MAP-2 and anti-Flag antibodies. Dendritic length was measured from 30 merged EGFP/MAP-2 double positive (ac, left panels) and EGFP/MAP-2/Flag triple positive cells (ac, right). (ad) Quantification of dendrite length. (<bold>b</bold>) β-Catenin can restore the dendrite length of BCAS2-depleted primary neurons. Scale bar: 20 μm. The primary neurons were transfected with the following: the pLL3.7 backbone EGFP-containing vector (Mock) (panel ba), shRNAs targeting BCAS2 (shmB2#1 or shmB2#2) (panels bc and be) or V5-tagged β-catenin alone (panel bb), or shBCAS2 plasmids with exogenous V5-tagged β-catenin plasmids (panels bd, and bf). IFA was performed 5 days after the plasmid transfection using anti-MAP-2, anti-V5 antibodies (indicating exogenous β-catenin). Dendritic length was measured from 50 merged EGFP/MAP-2 double positive (panels ba, bc, and be) and EGFP/MAP-2/V5 triple positive cells (panels bb, bd, and bf). (<bold>c</bold>) Quantification of dendrite length measured from 50 EGFP-positive neurites of each group. The <italic>P</italic> value was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. The data are shown as the mean ± S.E.M. (<bold>d</bold>) Western blot analysis of BCAS2, V5 (exogenous β-catenin) or β-catenin (endogenous) in N2A cells transiently transfected with the plasmids described in panel b. Left: representative western blot. Right: quantification analysis. The results are shown as the mean ± S.D. and analyzed by one-way ANOVA (n = 3). Uncropped blots are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>.</p>
