<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder developed from exposure to severe traumatic events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Contextual fear conditioning is a well-known protocol used to understand context-dependent fear memory consolidation, reconsolidation and extinction processes in which the hippocampus is the core brain region involved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Extinction therapy has been widely used for the treatment of PTSD; however, not all populations of patients experience the beneficial effects of these therapies, and effective pharmacological interventions for PTSD patients are limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Fear memory retrieval renders the original memory labile, allowing a short time window for amnesic intervention. Then, reconsolidation restores the stability of the memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, the labile state has a very narrow time window after retrieval, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well known.</p>
<p id="Par3"><italic>De novo</italic> protein synthesis has been shown to be involved in extinction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and memory lability to trigger instability of the original memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A memory-labile state is rapidly established after retrieval and has a very narrow time window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Recently, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been widely accepted to be involved in local <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis, and its target proteins have been shown to play diverse roles in synaptic plasticity and activity-dependent synaptic transmission. The mTOR signaling pathway has been suggested to be involved in rapid modulation of memory susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, which molecules are rapidly expressed after fear memory retrieval and the roles of these newly synthesized proteins in memory susceptibility and extinction have not been studied.</p>
<p id="Par4">Neurobeachin (NBEA) is a large, cytosolic multidomain protein selectively expressed in neurons and endocrine cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. NBEA has been suggested to regulate postsynaptic neurotransmitter and ionotropic receptor trafficking to the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and act as a negative regulator of regulated secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. NBEA also regulates synaptic architecture through actin cytoskeleton remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In zebrafish, NBEA is essential for the maintenance of extensive dendritic branching in mature neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Further, NBEA was recently reported to regulate Notch-mediated gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. NBEA also directly interacts with protein kinase A (PKA) and regulates PKA-mediated phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Because <italic>Nbea</italic> is a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), <italic>Nbea</italic> heterozygous mice were generated using the gene-trap method, and 24-month-old female mice were phenotyped<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, there are insufficient studies to identify the link between the molecular role of NBEA and the resulting behavioral phenotypes, especially fear memory processes.</p>
<p id="Par5">Here, we performed unbiased proteomics to isolate the molecules involved in fear memory retrieval and found that NBEA was upregulated in the dorsal hippocampus. <italic>Nbea</italic> mRNA was enriched at the synapse, in which its expression was rapidly and transiently expressed immediately after retrieval. Suppression of NBEA expression by knockdown and knockout impaired extinction, suggesting that NBEA is necessary for either the induction of memory lability or the physiological process of memory extinction.</p>

<title>Isolation of NBEA from the proteomic analysis after contextual fear memory retrieval</title>
<p id="Par6">Memory retrieval renders the consolidated memory labile and that extinction training during the labile state can alter or erase fear memory (Fukushima <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the memory retrieval-mediated process are not well known. To identify candidate molecules involved in fear memory retrieval, we utilized unbiased proteomics analysis. To isolate candidate molecules specific to the retrieval process, both a control and retrieval group were exposed to a foot shock (0.5 mA, 1 s) for the contextual fear conditioning. The next day, mice in the control group were placed in a different context from the conditioned context, and the retrieval group was placed in the same context (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). Importantly, there was a significant difference in the freezing level between groups on the retrieval test (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>; t(18) = 5.398, ***p &lt; 0.0001, unpaired t-test, two-tailed). Then, proteins were isolated from the hippocampus 5 min after fear memory retrieval and further processed for proteomic analysis. The peptide mixture from 5 mice of each group (control and retrieval) was labeled with TMT reagents. These labeled peptides were analyzed with LC-MS/MS analysis using an LTQ Orbitrap XL. A summary of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) is presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>. Among the 14 regulated proteins identified in the proteomic analysis, we decided to focus on the role of NBEA in the fear memory process because NBEA is known to regulate synaptic transmission by modulating the trafficking of receptors, including AMPA receptors, at synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Recently, several studies have reported that AMPA receptor trafficking is significant for memory stabilization and destabilization after retrieval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We confirmed the increased expression of NBEA after contextual fear retrieval. Since we focused on the rapid induction of protein expression and given the major role of NBEA in trafficking neurotransmitter receptors, we isolated synaptosomes from the dorsal hippocampus to examine the specific role of NBEA at the synapse. Here, NBEA expression at the synapse was significantly increased 5 min after memory retrieval compared to expression in the control group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C,D</xref>, Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>; F(2, 6) = 7.916, *p = 0.0208, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparisons post hoc test, HC vs Retrieval, *p = 0.0327, Control vs Retrieval, *p = 0.0307). Home cage samples were used to observe the basal expression of NBEA. Next, we further examined whether the increase in NBEA expression is specific to fear retrieval. To that end, mice were exposed to the same context as the retrieval group without foot shock on day 1 and re-exposed to the same context on day 2, which we described as neutral context retrieval (NC-retrieval) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1E</xref>). Interestingly, compared to the home-cage group (HC), the NC-retrieval group expressed a similar amount of NBEA, but the retrieval group showed a significant induction in NBEA expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1G,H</xref>; F(2, 6) = 267, ****p &lt; 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparisons post hoc test, HC vs Retrieval, ****p &lt; 0.0001, NC-retrieval vs Retrieval, ****p &lt; 0.0001), indicating that the rapid increase in NBEA expression was fear-specific. The freezing level confirmed the delivery of foot shocks (0.7 mA, 1 s, 2 shocks) to retrieval group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1F</xref>; t(4) = 7.826, **p = 0.0014, unpaired t-test, two-tailed).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Proteomic analysis identified NBEA as one of the candidate molecules regulated by contextual fear retrieval in the hippocampus.

<title>Rapid and transient expression of NBEA after fear memory retrieval</title>
<p id="Par7">Next, we further examined the expression pattern of NBEA at the synapse at different time points after memory retrieval. Interestingly, the immediate induction of NBEA expression 5 min after retrieval lasted up to 4 h and dropped by 6 h after retrieval, correlating very well with the time course of the labile state of fear memory (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A,B,C</xref>; F(7, 39) = 2.793, *p = 0.0187, one-way ANOVA). Since, NBEA is a well-known AKAP protein, which binds to PKA and regulates PKA signaling pathways, we also examined the expression of another well-studied AKAP protein, AKAP150, to determine whether the dynamic expression of NBEA after retrieval was unique to NBEA. Western blot analysis showed that there were no significant changes in AKAP150 expression after retrieval compared to the expression in the no-retrieval samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2D,E</xref>; F(7, 28) = 2.021, p = 0.0877, one-way ANOVA), suggesting that the dynamic expression after retrieval was not shown in one of the major AKAP isoforms present in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In this experiment, the no-retrieval group, which was not exposed to any context after fear conditioning, was used as a control to examine NBEA expression 24 h after conditioning but immediately before retrieval. To determine whether this dynamic expression was specific to the retrieval process, we analyzed the time course of NBEA expression after fear conditioning. Interestingly, we did not find any significant changes in NBEA expression after fear conditioning, suggesting that the rapid induction of NBEA expression was specific to the fear retrieval process (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2F,G,H</xref>; F(7, 20) = 2.255, p = 0.0728, one-way ANOVA).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The increase in NBEA expression was rapid and transient after contextual fear retrieval at the synapse in the dorsal hippocampus.

Whether NBEA protein can be locally synthesized and expressed in an activity-dependent manner is unknown. To that end, rapamycin (1 μl of 50 μM in DMSO) or vehicle (DMSO) was administered into the CA1 of dorsal hippocampi 30 min before fear memory retrieval, followed by protein extraction 30 min after retrieval (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>). Rapamycin infusion 30 min before retrieval did not change the level of freezing during retrieval (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>; t(6) = 1.445, p = 0.1986, unpaired t-test, two-tailed) as shown in other reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

<title><italic>Nbea</italic> knockdown in the CA1 hippocampus impaired extinction</title>
<p id="Par9">Since NBEA expression was increased in the hippocampus after contextual fear memory retrieval, we injected AAV encoding a sequence to knockdown NBEA (sh<italic>Nbea</italic>) or a scrambled sequence into the CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus, known to be involved in contextual fear retrieval and extinction, in WT mice. Before we tested the efficiency of the shRNA virus, we analyzed the baseline expression of NBEA in control mouse brains. In the hippocampus, NBEA was expressed in dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1A</xref>). Double staining with parvalbumin showed weak or no expression of NBEA in parvalbumin-positive cells in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN; Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1B</xref>), cortex (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1C</xref>) and CA1 hippocampus (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1D</xref>). To further confirm that NBEA is more weakly expressed in inhibitory neurons than in pyramidal cells, we examined the expression of NBEA in hippocampal tissue double-labeled with an antibody targeting GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1E</xref>), and in tissue from glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67)-GFP transgenic mice to visualize GAD67-positive cells (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1F</xref>). We did not see NBEA expression in those inhibitory neuronal populations; therefore, we concluded that baseline NBEA expression in inhibitory neurons is minimal. The efficiency of sh<italic>Nbea</italic> knockdown (KD) and the scrambled shRNA was confirmed with immunoblotting of lysates from each of the virus-treated <italic>in vitro</italic> primary hippocampal cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A,B</xref>; t(6) = 7.038, ***p = 0.0004, unpaired t-test, two-tailed). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry data clearly showed a suppression of NBEA expression with sh<italic>Nbea</italic> KD in the CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus but not in the group treated with the scrambled control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). For the behavior analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4D</xref>), we first examined general locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior in the open field test. sh<italic>Nbea</italic> KD in the CA1 did not affect locomotion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4E</xref>; F (5, 150) = 0.2602, p = 0.9341, two-way ANOVA) or anxiety (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4F</xref>; t(25) = 0.3197, p = 0.7519, unpaired t-test, two-tailed). Fear conditioning showed that sh<italic>Nbea</italic> KD in the CA1 did not affect fear acquisition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4G</xref>; F (4, 100) = 0.8908, p = 0.4725, two-way ANOVA). Retrieval was tested with two sequential retrieval tests (RT1 and RT2) with a 24-h interval. To assess fear memory extinction within the group, we compared the freezing level between RT1 and RT2 of each group. As we observed from the <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutant data in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4D</xref>, th esh<italic>Nbea</italic> KD group also showed attenuated extinction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4H</xref>; sh<italic>Nbea</italic>, RT1-RT2: t(25) = 7.587, ****p &lt; 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, Sidak’s multiple comparisons test) compared to the scrambled control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4H</xref>; scramble, RT1-RT2: t(25) = 3.148, **p = 0.0084, two-way ANOVA, Sidak’s multiple comparisons test). Interestingly, we did not observe a significant effect of sh<italic>Nbea</italic> KD in RT1, the 24-h fear memory retrieval test performed 24 h after conditioning (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4H</xref> RT1; t(25) = 1.071, p = 0.2945, unpaired t-test, two-tailed), but we observed a significant difference in the behavior between the scrambled control and sh<italic>Nbea</italic> KD group in RT2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4H</xref>; F(1, 25) = 8.984, *p = 0.0061, two-way ANOVA, Sidak’s multiple comparisons test, RT1, p = 0.4475, RT2, ***p = 0.0007). These data indicate that the rapid induction of NBEA expression in pyramidal neurons in the CA1 hippocampus may play a role in either the inhibition of memory stability or the facilitation of memory instability after retrieval.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><italic>Nbea</italic> knockdown in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region resulted in impairments in extinction after contextual fear retrieval.

<title>Neurobeachin heterozygous mice showed impaired extinction</title>
<p id="Par10">Due to the limitation of poor contextual extinction of surgerized mice and the variable infection rate and efficiency of the knockdown virus, we decided to generate <italic>Nbea</italic> knockout mice. This approach allowed us to perform extensive behavior analysis to further validate the effect of <italic>Nbea</italic> deficiency in fear reconsolidation or extinction including within-session extinction. We generated <italic>Nbea</italic> null mutant mice utilizing TALEN technology. By targeting exon 22, we obtained a 17-bp out-of-frame deletion mutant as shown in Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1A</xref>. The 17-bp deletion created a premature stop codon immediately after the truncation in exon 22. Genomic deletion was validated by the analysis of tail DNA with PCR. The deletion created a new <italic>Bsl</italic>I enzyme target sequence in the genomic DNA of the mutant allele. Mice with a homozygous mutation were embryonic lethal; therefore, only heterozygotes (indicated as <italic>Nbea</italic>+/− from here on) were used for assays and behavior tests. First, we confirmed the genomic deletion with the <italic>Bsl</italic>I restriction enzyme, which generates two bands (294 bp and 90 bp) in the mutant allele (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1B</xref>). We also confirmed inhibition of the NBEA protein in <italic>Nbea</italic>+/− using Western blot analysis (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1C</xref>; t(6) = 5.149, *p = 0.0021, unpaired t-test, two-tailed). For the behavior analysis, we first recorded the body weight of these mice since gene-trap-mediated null mutant mice (GH240) have previously shown dwarfism, but there were no significant differences in body weight at 10 weeks (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1D</xref>; t(19) = 1.949, p = 0.0663, unpaired t-test, two-tailed) or 16 weeks (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1D</xref>; t(12) = 1.468, p = 0.1678, unpaired t-test, two-tailed). To detect any phenotypic differences in general behaviors such as locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior, the open field test was performed. <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> were hyperactive during the initial 5 min of the test, but their locomotor activity returned to normal levels for the rest of the exploration period (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1E</xref>; F(5, 215) = 2.719, *p = 0.0210, two-way ANOVA). We also analyzed the time spent in the center zone of the arena as a measure of the anxiety level but found no difference between WT and <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1F</xref>; t(43) = 1.31, p = 0.1970, unpaired t-test, two-tailed). We examined fear conditioning and extinction in these mutant mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5A</xref>). Since the mutant was generated in the C57BL/6J background, we increased the intensity of shocks (0.7 mA, 1 s) to achieve a certain level of recall memory for further investigation of the extinction process. Using this protocol, we did not detect any differences in acquisition or 24-h context memory recall (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5B</xref>; F(4, 60) = 2.19, p = 0.0809, two-way ANOVA). Since <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> did not show any impairments in fear acquisition or contextual fear memory at the behavioral level, and NBEA expression was increased immediately after retrieval at the molecular level, we first tested the <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> on the retrieval-extinction protocol. <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> showed no difference in retrieval (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5B</xref>; t(15) = 1.824, p = 0.0881, unpaired t-test, two-tailed) and showed normal extinction learning (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5B</xref>; Time × Group interaction: F (17, 255) = 1.087, p = 0.3666, two-way ANOVA). However, there were differences in the freezing level between genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5B</xref>; Group: F(1, 15) = 13.64, *p = 0.0022, two-way ANOVA), suggesting that extinction was attenuated in <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup>. The 24 h-extinction memory (t(15) = 2.944, *p = 0.0101, unpaired t-test, two-tailed) and spontaneous recall memory (t(15) = 2.255, *p = 0.0395, unpaired t-test, two-tailed) were significantly greater in <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> than in WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Nbea</italic> is critical for fear extinction. To validate the role of <italic>Nbea</italic> in fear extinction, we performed an extinction protocol without retrieval (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5C</xref>). As shown previously (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5B</xref>), we did not detect any differences in fear conditioning between the two genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5D</xref>; F(4, 68) = 0.6439, p = 0.6330). However, <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> showed normal extinction learning (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5D</xref>; Time × Group interaction: F(17, 289) = 0.9358, p = 0.5320) but attenuated extinction of the memory, indicated by higher freezing levels in <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> than in WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5D</xref>; Group: F(1, 17) = 12.69, **p = 0.0024).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par11">Here, we performed an unbiased proteomics analysis to identify molecules involved in fear memory retrieval. We found that NBEA is rapidly and transiently upregulated in the dorsal hippocampus after fear memory retrieval. We also found that NBEA is enriched at the synapse, and its expression is regulated by the mTOR signaling pathway. Suppression of NBEA expression, either in the whole body or locally in the hippocampal CA1 region, impaired extinction, suggesting that NBEA may play a role in regulating fear extinction processes.</p>
<p id="Par12">Exposure therapy is a behavior therapy used to treat anxiety disorders such as PTSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To overcome their distress, patients are exposed to a feared object or context without any danger present. Contextual information and the memory process is important for this form of therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; therefore, we utilized a contextual fear conditioning protocol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). Since the dorsal hippocampus is an integration center for context-dependent fear memory processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, we focused on identifying molecules within this structure in this study. The retrieval-mediated labile state of memories has been suggested to be an important factor in the permanent erasure of memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, but the specific molecules involved in these processes are not known. Through proteomic analysis, we identified NBEA as one of the most prominently upregulated proteins in the hippocampus after fear memory retrieval. Given that NBEA is a trafficking molecule that targets neurotransmitter receptors to synapses, and protein sampling was performed 5 min after a 5-min retrieval session, we questioned whether an increase in the expression of NBEA after fear retrieval could be detected at the synapse. Local synaptic protein synthesis is known to be very rapid (within 5 min)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Using synaptosomal fractionization, we clearly observed an increase in NBEA expression at 5 min after retrieval in the dorsal hippocampus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C,D</xref>). Thereafter, we only focused on NBEA expression at the synaptic level when examining the molecular dynamics of NBEA after retrieval. The time course of NBEA expression after retrieval (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B,C</xref>) was similar to that of other proteins regulated by local translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The mTOR signaling pathway, also called the local protein synthesis pathway, is the main pathway that regulates the rapid induction of protein synthesis from existing mRNA at the synapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Rapamycin clearly inhibited the rapid induction of NBEA expression after retrieval, suggesting that retrieval indeed activates the new synthesis of NBEA at the synapse (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). Therefore, the dynamic changes in NBEA expression appear to be necessary for the state-dependent modulation of fear memories, especially after fear memory retrieval. Interestingly, we did not observe any induction of NBEA after neutral-context retrieval, indicating that rapid NBEA protein induction at the synapse is closely related to fear retrieval (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1G,H</xref>). However, different sets of experiments may be necessary to test whether the relationship between NBEA expression and fear retrieval is generalizable to other types of retrieval learning that are not fear related.</p>
<p id="Par13">Previous studies have shown that the mTOR signaling pathway is critical for the consolidation of fear memory reconsolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and extinction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In these studies, treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, immediately before or after retrieval impaired memory reconsolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, which is not consistent with our data. Although NBEA expression was regulated by mTOR, we found either increased fear memory or impaired extinction in both <italic>Nbea</italic> knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>) and <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). However, several studies support our data as well. For example, ketamine treatment, which is known to activate mTOR, accelerated the extinction process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Another protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin, impaired extinction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, specific mTOR downstream pathways may play different roles in memory stabilization and destabilization. In support of this idea, a study reported that two distinct molecular mechanisms are involved in the destabilization and restabilization of reactivated spatial memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In other words, inhibition of all proteins regulated by mTOR may mask the effects of a sub-group of proteins, including NBEA, involved in memory destabilization.</p>
<p id="Par14">The mechanism by which the rapid induction of NBEA expression affects extinction is not clear since retrieval and extinction are known to be two distinct memory processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, several studies have suggested a molecular link between retrieval and extinction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. NBEA is a regulator of ionotropic receptor trafficking to synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and ionotropic glutamate receptor plasticity is required for memory consolidation and reconsolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The learning, consolidation and reconsolidation of long-term memory require stable postsynaptic potentiation that is modulated by an increase in postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. AMPARs are tetrameric glutamate receptors that have different properties depending on their subunit composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The majority of synaptic AMPARs are calcium-impermeable AMPARs (CI-AMPARs) that contain the GluA2 subunit and are stable at the synapse due to the interaction of the GluA2 subunits with synaptic molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Moreover, most basal synaptic transmission is regulated through CI-AMPARs. On the other hand, GluA2-lacking AMPARs, calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) are unstable at the synapse but involved in acute synaptic potentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. A recent study revealed the physiological roles of CI-AMPARs and CP-AMPARs in transforming a consolidated memory into an unstable memory and subsequently guiding extinction or reconsolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In their results, memory retrieval caused a transient replacement of CI-AMPARs with CP-AMPARs. Furthermore, blocking CI-AMPAR endocytosis prevented the insertion of CP-AMPARs, thereby preventing the transformation of a consolidated memory to a labile state and leading to increased fear memory. Here, most intriguingly of all, the temporal profile of CP-AMPARs was very similar to that of NBEA expression after retrieval. Since we found that mice with <italic>Nbea</italic> KD showed enhanced fear memory (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4F</xref>), and the temporal patterns of NBEA and CP-AMPARs after retrieval are very similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B,C</xref>), NBEA is speculated to regulate CP-AMPAR trafficking to the synapse. In support of this, NBEA interacts with protein kinase A (PKA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, which phosphorylates GluA1-S845. GluA1-S845 phosphorylation enhances the mean channel open probability and promotes synaptic trafficking of GluA1-containing AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), especially to extrasynaptic sites. Therefore, in extinction, NBEA may alter the subunit composition of perisynaptic AMPARs by providing stability to GluA1 homomers, making NBEA necessary for the maintenance of CP-AMPARs on the surface, which is required for the extinction process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In support of this idea, we found that NBEA interacts with PKA and GluA1 but not with GluA2 (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). Interestingly, AKAP150, which is one of major forms of PKA binding protein regulating synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, did not show dynamic changes in expression after retrieval, suggesting that NBEA might be an activity-dependent regulator that modulates PKA and AMPA receptor phosphorylation associated with contextual fear retrieval (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2D,E</xref>). Further analysis of the biochemical and electrophysiological role of NBEA in this process is required.</p>
<p id="Par15">We generated <italic>Nbea</italic> null mutant mice, but the mutation was embryonic lethal. Therefore, we only used heterozygotes for our behavior assays. <italic>Nbea</italic> mutant mice have been generated in two different labs using gene-trap methods. Both <italic>Nbea</italic> knockout mouse lines showed perinatal lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In the case of the GB140 line, several behavioral analyses have been performed. <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> showed enhanced conditioned fear memory and impaired spatial learning and memory as well as enhanced long-term potentiation in the CA1 area of the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, we did not see enhanced conditioned fear memory compared to that in WT littermates. The group cited above used 24-month-old female mice for the tests, whereas we used 10–16-week-old males. In addition, dwarfism of <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but we did not see any differences in body weight between <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and WT (Supple Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2D</xref>). However, we did observe hyperactivity in the open field test, which was not shown in the previous GB140 line. Therefore, we believe that the differences in the phenotypes between GB140 and this newly generated <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mouse line are due to several factors, such as the method used to generate the knockout mouse line (gene trapping for GB140 vs TALENs for our study), the dwarfism, the gender and age of the test groups.</p>
<p id="Par16">Taken together, this study demonstrated that NBEA plays a role in either the induction of memory lability or the physiological process of memory extinction. Our research showed activity-dependent activation of NBEA at the synapse after retrieval, and impaired extinction by the dysregulation of NBEA in either the hippocampal CA1 or the whole body. Therefore, we suggest NBEA as a novel target for research on how it may contribute to PTSD extinction deficits or the efficacy of exposure therapy. Furthermore, regarding the possible role of <italic>Nbea</italic> as an autism molecule, this study may also facilitate research to identify potential pathways connecting PTSD and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p>

F1 mice were obtained by mating the parental strains C57BL/6J (N20-23) and 129s4/svJ (N20-23). B6x129 F1 mice were used because we used this strain in most of our previous fear and extinction studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, and these mice were used for proteomics, western blot, immunoprecipitation and <italic>shNbea</italic> knockdown experiments. <italic>Nbea</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice were generated on the B6 background and were also included in the western blot analysis shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1E,F,G</xref>. All mice were housed with free access to food and water under controlled temperature and light conditions (23 °C, 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle). Experiments were performed during the light phase.

After the samples were diluted 10-fold with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:40 (w:w), followed by incubation overnight at 37 °C. Two peptide mixtures were applied to a C18 cartridge. Purified peptide samples were dried and stored at 4 °C until liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.</p>

<title>TMT-labeling proteomic analysis</title>
<p id="Par20">The peptide mixture of the two groups (control and retrieval group) was used for tandem mass tag (TMT) reagent labeling according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Each sample was then labeled with one of two different TMT reagents (TMT126 for control and TMT129 for retrieval) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. After the labeling, the TMT-labeled peptide pool was cleaned with a C18 cartridge. Then, an OFFGEL electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Desalted and dehydrated samples were reconstituted in OFFGEL solution. Isoelectric focusing was performed on an immobilized pH gradient (IPG) dry strip (13 cm, pH 3–10, linear; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) using a 12-well frame for 20 kVh with a maximum current of 50 μA and power of 200 mW. The collected fractions were desalted using C18 spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), then evaporated by a speed vacuum and stored at −20 °C. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an LTQ Orbitrap XL (San Jose, CA, USA). The spray voltage was set to 1.9 kV, and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 25 °C. The sample was subjected to reverse-phase chromatography using an Eksigent LC system (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). The mobile phases consisted of H<sub>2</sub>O (A) and acetonitrile (ACN) (B), where both phases contained 0.1% v/v formic acid. The flow rate was maintained at 300 nl/min. The peptides were eluted from the analytical column (C18) by a linear gradient running from 10% to 35% acetonitrile over 95 min to 80% B over the next 20 min and to 90% B over the final 15 min, followed by direct spray into the LTQ mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive mode with an m/z window of 300–2,000, and a maximum of 3 precursors were selected for higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) analysis in the Orbitrap (isolation width: 2; min. signal required: 1000; normalized collision energy: 45%) with dynamic exclusion. SEQUEST (XCorr Only) (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA; version v.1.3.0.339) searches were performed against tryptic peptides, allowing for two missed cleavages with 25 ppm (monoisotopic) precursor mass tolerance and 25 ppm (monoisotopic) fragment mass tolerance detected in the Orbitrap. The searches were conducted against a mouse database (IPI ver. 3.87) with the decoy option enabled, and the iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine and TMT multiplexed quantitation chemistry of lysine and the N-terminus were specified in SEQUEST as fixed modifications. Methionine oxidation (+15.9949) was specified in SEQUEST as a variable modification. Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.0.5, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at a probability greater than 0.9 by the peptide prophet algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at a probability greater than 0.9 and contained at least 2 identified unique peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the protein prophet algorithm. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. For the TMT quantification, the LIBRA (Trans-proteome pipeline, version 4.2.1) program was used to quantitate the label-based quantitation peptide and protein identifications.

Primary antibodies against the following antigens were used: synapsin I (1:1,000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95; 1:1,000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), histone H1 (1:1,000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), NBEA (K-20) (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotech., Dallas, TX, USA), A kinase anchor protein 150 (AKAP150; 1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, TX, USA) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 1:5,000, Cell signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse (1:5,000) or anti-rabbit (1:10,000) antibodies (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Norwalk, CT, USA). Signal detection was performed using the LAS 2000 system (LAS-2000, Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) with enhanced chemiluminescence (Western-CDP star, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Norwalk, CT, USA).
