<abstract>
<p>Ciliopathies are a group of human disorders caused by dysfunction of primary cilia, ubiquitous microtubule-based organelles involved in transduction of extra-cellular signals to the cell. This function requires the concentration of receptors and channels in the ciliary membrane, which is achieved by complex trafficking mechanisms, in part controlled by the small GTPase RAB8, and by sorting at the transition zone located at the entrance of the ciliary compartment. Mutations in the transition zone gene <italic>CC2D2A</italic> cause the related Joubert and Meckel syndromes, two typical ciliopathies characterized by central nervous system malformations, and result in loss of ciliary localization of multiple proteins in various models. The precise mechanisms by which CC2D2A and other transition zone proteins control protein entrance into the cilium and how they are linked to vesicular trafficking of incoming cargo remain largely unknown. In this work, we identify the centrosomal protein NINL as a physical interaction partner of CC2D2A. NINL partially co-localizes with CC2D2A at the base of cilia and <italic>ninl</italic> knockdown in zebrafish leads to photoreceptor outer segment loss, mislocalization of opsins and vesicle accumulation, similar to <italic>cc2d2a</italic>-/- phenotypes. Moreover, partial <italic>ninl</italic> knockdown in <italic>cc2d2a</italic>-/- embryos enhances the retinal phenotype of the mutants, indicating a genetic interaction in vivo, for which an illustration is found in patients from a Joubert Syndrome cohort. Similar to zebrafish <italic>cc2d2a</italic> mutants, <italic>ninl</italic> morphants display altered Rab8a localization. Further exploration of the NINL-associated interactome identifies MICAL3, a protein known to interact with Rab8 and to play an important role in vesicle docking and fusion. Together, these data support a model where CC2D2A associates with NINL to provide a docking point for cilia-directed cargo vesicles, suggesting a mechanism by which transition zone proteins can control the protein content of the ciliary compartment.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Ciliopathies are a group of disorders caused by dysfunction of primary cilia, ubiquitous organelles involved in signal transduction. Mutations in <italic>CC2D2A</italic> cause two ciliopathies, Joubert and Meckel syndromes, and result in loss of ciliary protein localization. The mechanism by which CC2D2A, located at the ciliary transition zone, controls ciliary protein composition and its link to vesicular trafficking of incoming cargo remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a series of physical interactions linking CC2D2A to vesicular trafficking controlled by the small GTPase RAB8, suggesting a new model, whereby CC2D2A provides a specific docking point for ciliary-bound vesicles at the entrance to the ciliary compartment. We first identify NINL as a physical and genetic interaction partner of CC2D2A, show that both proteins co-localize at the entrance to the cilium and demonstrate that absence of Ninl or Cc2d2a result in similar retinal phenotypes in zebrafish, including mislocalization of Rab8. We further identify MICAL3, a protein known to bind RAB8, as another NINL interaction partner, thus linking CC2D2A to RAB8A-controlled trafficking. Finally, we describe an individual with Joubert syndrome, in whom combined <italic>CC2D2A</italic> and <italic>NINL</italic> mutations result in an enhanced phenotype, illustrating the impact of the detected interaction on the disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles protruding from the apical surface of most differentiated vertebrate cell types where they play a crucial role in transduction of extra-cellular signals to the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref001">1</xref>]. Cilia achieve this function by concentrating and regulating receptors and channels that are required for sensing these signals in their membrane domain. Consequently, the ciliary membrane has a distinct composition from that of the adjacent plasma membrane, despite them being continuous with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref002">2</xref>]. The tight regulation required to maintain the specificity of the ciliary membrane composition is achieved by complex trafficking and sorting mechanisms at the entry point to the ciliary compartment, as well as by a diffusion barrier present at the base of the cilium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref004">4</xref>]. The transition zone, at the base of the ciliary axoneme, plays a crucial role in this sorting mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref006">6</xref>]. Indeed, dysfunction of proteins normally localized at the transition zone leads to both abnormal access to the ciliary compartment for proteins that should not localize there and loss of normal localization for ciliary proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref007">7</xref>]. The actual mechanism, by which these transition zone proteins contribute to this sorting of ciliary proteins, remains however largely unknown.</p>
<p>Mutations in transition zone proteins in humans lead to several ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome. Ciliopathies are a group of human disorders caused by dysfunction of primary cilia and characterized by overlapping genetics and phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref008">8</xref>]. As cilia are present on most vertebrate cells, their dysfunction can manifest as a wide array of phenotypic features affecting most organs systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref009">9</xref>]. Retinal dystrophy is a common finding in ciliopathies given that retinal photoreceptor outer segments, which are the site of the phototransduction cascade, are highly specialized primary cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref010">10</xref>]. Joubert syndrome (JBTS) (OMIM 213300) is a prototypical ciliopathy with a phenotypic spectrum that can encompass most of the typical ciliopathy phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref012">12</xref>]. It is characterized by a specific hindbrain malformation termed the molar tooth sign (MTS), in addition to which affected individuals may have retinal dystrophy, tubulo-interstitial kidney disease, liver fibrosis, skeletal dysplasia and polydactyly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref013">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref015">15</xref>]. To date, mutations in over 27 different genes have been reported as an underlying cause for JBTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref016">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref020">20</xref>]. Most of these genes encode proteins associated in multi-protein complexes localized at the transition zone of the primary cilium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Mutations in <italic>CC2D2A</italic> (Coiled-coil and C2-domains containing protein 2A) are the second most common genetic cause for JBTS, accounting for almost 9% of affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref022">22</xref>]. Moreover, mutations in <italic>CC2D2A</italic> can also result in the genetically related and more severe Meckel syndrome, which is a perinatal-lethal disorder characterized by encephalocele, polydactyly, cystic kidneys and liver fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref023">23</xref>]. CC2D2A is part of one of the ciliary transition zone complexes with several other JBTS proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref021">21</xref>]. Two <italic>Cc2d2a</italic> mouse mutants have been described, presenting with severe brain malformation (holoprosencephaly), microphthalmia, curved body axis and randomized left-right axis, all typical ciliopathy-associated phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref024">24</xref>]. Interestingly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from one of the reported <italic>Cc2d2a</italic>
<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice appear to lack cilia entirely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref024">24</xref>] whereas disruption of CC2D2A function in the other reported mutant does not compromise ciliogenesis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref007">7</xref>]. Instead, the ciliary localization of several proteins (including ARL13B, Adenylyl Cyclase III, Smoothened and Polycystin2) is lost, suggesting that presence of CC2D2A at the transition zone is required for appropriate targeting of proteins to the ciliary compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref007">7</xref>]. The zebrafish <italic>cc2d2a</italic> mutant <italic>sentinel</italic> demonstrates a curved body axis, pronephric cysts and a striking retinal phenotype with short and dysmorphic photoreceptor outer segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref025">25</xref>]. In addition, the photoreceptors of <italic>cc2d2a</italic> mutants also show mislocalization of opsins in the cell body and cytoplasmic accumulation of vesicles in the apical portion of the cells and around the connecting cilium (equivalent of the transition zone in photoreceptors), suggesting a defect in opsin trafficking. Opsins are the photosensitive pigment molecules concentrated at high levels in the outer segments and required for sensing the light signal. Trafficking of opsins from the cell body towards the ciliary compartment is (at least in part) controlled by the small GTPase Rab8, which coats rhodopsin-carrier vesicles allowing their docking and fusion at the ciliary base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref026">26</xref>]. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Rab8a leads to accumulation of rhodopsin-containing vesicles in photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref027">27</xref>]. In addition, RAB8A is also involved in ciliary membrane biogenesis in other cell types and thus appears to play a general role in orchestrating trafficking towards the ciliary compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref029">29</xref>]. The trafficking defect observed in <italic>cc2d2a</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> photoreceptors appears to be mediated by loss of normal Rab8 localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref025">25</xref>] but the precise mechanism by which loss of this transition zone protein affects the localization of Rab8 and the trafficking of ciliary-directed opsins remains unclear.</p>
<p>In the current work, we identify a chain of physical interactions linking CC2D2A to RAB8A through NINL and MICAL3. Using a zebrafish model, we demonstrate that loss of Ninl function leads to a similar retinal phenotype as loss of Cc2d2a, including short outer segments, mislocalization of opsins and accumulation of vesicles. Based on the physical and genetic interactions that we identify, we propose a model in which CC2D2A provides a docking point at the photoreceptor ciliary base, allowing RAB8A-positive vesicles to bind through a series of interactions involving CC2D2A-NINL-MICAL3-RAB8A.</p>

<title>CC2D2A associates with NINL</title>
<p>In order to shed light on the function of CC2D2A we performed a dedicated ciliary yeast two-hybrid assay with different fragments of CC2D2A against a panel of 164 proteins, containing most of the ciliopathy-associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref030">30</xref>]. A direct binary interaction between CC2D2A and both isoforms (A and B) of the centrosome- and basal body-associated protein NINL (Ninein-like protein) was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). NINL isoforms A and B are distinguished by the fact that isoform B is 349 amino acids shorter due to skipping of the large exon 17 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s001">S1a Fig</xref>). Both isoforms share predicted EF-hand domains in the N-terminal region as well as coiled-coil domains in the more C-terminal portion. Both isoforms display similar broad expression patterns, with the strongest expression patterns in cochlea, brain, testis, kidney and retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref031">31</xref>].</p>

<title>CC2D2A associates with NINL.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays were performed with different fragments of CC2D2A fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) and full length NINL isoform A and B, fused to the GAL4 activation domain (AD). Activation of the reporter genes, which indicates a physical interaction, was dependent on coiled-coil (CC) domains 1 and 2 of CC2D2A and either NINL isoform A or B. (<bold>b</bold>) The top panel of the immunoblot (IB) shows that FLAG-tagged CC2D2A, but not the FLAG-tagged LRRK2 that was included as a negative control, was co-precipitated with HA-tagged NINL isoform B using a rat monoclonal antibody directed against the HA-epitope. Protein input is shown in the lower panel; anti-HA precipitates are shown in the middle panel. (<bold>c</bold>) In a reciprocal experiment, HA-tagged NINL<sup>isoB</sup> was co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged CC2D2A, but not with FLAG-tagged LRRK2.

<p>By generating deletion constructs for CC2D2A and subsequent evaluation of the interaction with NINL, we could pinpoint the interaction to the two predicted coiled-coil domains (433-637aa) present in CC2D2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). Since CC2D2A and NINL isoform B demonstrated the strongest interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g001">Fig 1a</xref>), we focused on NINL isoform B (NINL<sup>isoB</sup>) for confirmation and further investigation of this interaction. Co-immunoprecipitation assays performed using full-length tagged-constructs for NINL<sup>isoB</sup> and CC2D2A, showed co-precipitation of the two proteins. FLAG-tagged LRRK2 that was used as a negative control did not co-precipitate with HA-tagged NINL<sup>isoB</sup>, which confirmed the specificity of the interaction between NINL<sup>isoB</sup> and CC2D2A in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g001">Fig 1b</xref>).

<p>To investigate the localization and function of endogenous Ninl, we turned to the zebrafish model. The zebrafish genome harbors a single <italic>ninl</italic> orthologue (Genbank NP_001268727) that has 45% similarity with human <italic>NINL</italic>. Conserved domains include the predicted EF-hand domains and multiple coiled-coil domains. Cloning of zebrafish <italic>ninl</italic> from whole embryo mRNA at 5dpf revealed that all identified zebrafish transcripts lack the large exon 17 which is present only in human NINL isoform A but not in isoform B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Therefore, zebrafish <italic>ninl</italic> is most similar to the shorter human NINL isoform B. RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with two different antisense probes derived from the 5â-end and the 3â-end of the zebrafish <italic>ninl</italic> transcript revealed broad expression at 14â18 somites in neural tube, inner ear, developing eye and pronephros. Expression persists in the retina at least up to 6 dpf (days post fertilization; last developmental stage assessed) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Antibody staining showed punctate localization of endogenous Ninl in zebrafish retina at the base of the cilium in 4dpf larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g002">Fig 2g</xref>). While co-staining with Cc2d2a antibodies was not possible due to different fixation conditions, co-staining of serial sections with anti-centrin and anti-Ninl or anti-Cc2d2a antibodies respectively revealed that both endogenous proteins partially co-localize at the base of the photoreceptor cilium of 4 dpf old zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g002">Fig 2f and 2g</xref>). We observed that Cc2d2a localizes slightly more apically with respect to Centrin than Ninl, consistent with Cc2d2a localization at the connecting cilium, while Ninl localization is overlapping more broadly with the basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g002">Fig 2f and 2g</xref>, schematized in j).</p>
<p>In order to determine whether Cc2d2a localization is dependent on the presence of Ninl, we performed morpholino-induced knockdown studies in zebrafish. Injection of 2 ng/nl of <italic>ninl</italic> translation-blocking morpholino (atgMO) led to efficient knockdown of Ninl, as demonstrated by substantially decreased antibody staining in cryosections through morphant retina (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s002">S2a and S2bâ Fig</xref>). On Western blots of whole 5dpf larval extracts, a single strong band of 80 kDa is present in wild-type fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s002">S2d Fig</xref>), which is consistent with results from immunoprecipitation from retinal bovine extracts with a previously published antibody against human <italic>NINL</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s002">S2e Fig</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref031">31</xref>]). This band is strongly reduced in <italic>ninl</italic> atgMO injected larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s002">S2d Fig</xref>), supporting the specificity of the morpholino and of the antibody.</p>
<p>Ninl knockdown led to typical ciliopathy-associated phenotypes, including curved body shape, enlarged brain ventricle and pronephric cysts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s003">S3aâS3g Fig</xref>). The specificity of the observed phenotype was confirmed by rescue experiments, in which co-injection of 2 ng/nl <italic>ninl</italic> MO with capped MO-resistant human <italic>NINL-</italic>mRNA reduced the prevalence of the curved body phenotype in a dose-dependent manner (curved body shape in 71% of <italic>ninl</italic> atgMO injected larvae (n = 207) versus 36% in <italic>ninl</italic> atgMO + <italic>ninl</italic> mRNA injected larvae (n = 203), data pooled from 2 biological replicates, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, two-tailed Fisherâs exact test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s004">S4aâS4d Fig</xref>). Finally, the specificity of the observed phenotypes was further confirmed by a second morpholino against <italic>ninl</italic> targeting the splice site at the intron14/exon15 junction and thus causing aberrant splicing with premature truncation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s005">S5c Fig</xref>). This splice morpholino led to similar phenotypes as the atgMO, including ventriculomegaly and abnormal photoreceptor outer segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s005">S5a and S5b Fig</xref>). The body curvature phenotype was absent in the splice morphants, which may be explained either by rescue of this early phenotype by maternal <italic>ninl</italic> mRNA, which remains unaffected by splice morpholinos (as seen in some ciliopathy zebrafish mutants such as <italic>talpid3</italic> where only the maternal zygotic mutants have a curved body shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref032">32</xref>]), or by less efficient gene knockdown with this morpholino, as normal transcript persists in addition to the aberrant transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s005">S5c Fig</xref>). Indeed, using the anti-NINL antibody, we observed a milder decrease of Ninl protein on Western blots and on immuno-histochemistry of retinal cryosections at 5dpf for the <italic>ninl</italic> ex15 spMO as compared to the atgMO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s002">S2c and S2d Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Localization of Cc2d2a at the connecting cilium, shown by anti-Cc2d2a immunostaining, was unaffected by Ninl knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g002">Fig 2h</xref>). Conversely, immunostainings using anti-Ninl antibodies revealed no clear mislocalization of Ninl in the retina of <italic>cc2d2a</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g002">Fig 2i</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that Cc2d2a and Ninl co-localize at the ciliary base independently of each other.</p>

<italic>Ninl</italic> genetically interacts with <italic>cc2d2a</italic> and may act as a genetic modifier for <italic>CC2D2A</italic>-associated Joubert Syndrome</title>
<p>To further delineate the relationship between <italic>cc2d2a</italic> and <italic>ninl</italic>, we tested whether a synergistic effect was detectable between the two genes by using partial <italic>ninl</italic> knockdown in the <italic>cc2d2a</italic> mutant background. We observed that injection of a sub-phenotypic dose of <italic>ninl</italic> MO (0.75 ng/nl), which causes no discernible phenotype in wild-type larvae, significantly increased the penetrance and severity of pronephric cysts in <italic>cc2d2a</italic> mutants: 89% of <italic>ninlMO-cc2d2a</italic>

In the retina, the opsin mislocalization phenotype in <italic>cc2d2a</italic>

These findings support a genetic interaction between <italic>cc2d2a</italic> and <italic>ninl</italic> and suggest that <italic>NINL</italic> could be a genetic modifier for <italic>CC2D2A</italic>-caused disorders or even contribute to the genetic spectrum underlying Joubert/Meckel syndrome. Following this rationale, we sequenced <italic>NINL</italic> in a cohort of 346 individuals with Joubert syndrome (from 291 families) using a molecular inversion probes (MIPs) capture method followed by next-generation sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref033">33</xref>] but did not identify any individuals carrying bi-allelic rare deleterious <italic>NINL</italic> variants. We did however find 3 individuals with heterozygous <italic>NINL</italic> mutations predicted to be deleterious. Individual UW48-3 carried the homozygous missense <italic>CC2D2A</italic> mutation c. 3364C&gt;T (p.P1122S), previously shown to be causal for Joubert syndrome, and a heterozygous <italic>NINL</italic> frameshift mutation leading to a stop codon after 43 amino acids (c.3020delC, p.P1007Lfs*43) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g004">Fig 4i</xref>) (and no other rare deleterious variant in any of the known JS genes). Phenotypically, this subject had a severe form of JBTS with retinal dystrophy, hearing loss, ventriculomegaly in addition to the MTS and renal failure leading to death at age 7 years. In comparison, subject UW 36â3 carried the same homozygous <italic>CC2D2A</italic> c.3364C&gt;T (p.P1122S) mutation but no additional <italic>NINL</italic> variants (or rare deleterious variants in other JBTS genes) and presented with the âpure JBTSâ phenotype, consisting only of the MTS with associated ataxia, developmental delay and respiratory rhythm disturbance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g004">Fig 4j</xref>). Subject UW07-3 carried a heterozygous <italic>NINL</italic> nonsense mutation (c.2446 G&gt;A, p.R816X) in addition to causal, compound heterozygous <italic>C5ORF42</italic> frameshift mutations (c.8726delG; p.A2909Qfs*4 and c.493delA, p.I165Yfs*17). This subject presented a classical Joubert phenotype without extra-neuronal manifestations, suggesting that the additional <italic>NINL</italic> frameshift had no effect on the clinical manifestations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g004">Fig 4k</xref>). Finally, subject UW57-3 carried a heterozygous <italic>NINL</italic> missense mutation (c.1631A&gt;T, p.E544V), predicted to be deleterious by Polyphen2, along with bi-allelic causal <italic>TMEM67</italic> mutations (c.2825T&gt;G, p.F942C and c.978+3 A&gt;G). This individual had Joubert syndrome with coloboma but no retinal, renal or hepatic involvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g004">Fig 4l</xref>). Given the known association between <italic>TMEM67</italic> mutations and coloboma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref034">34</xref>], this additional feature is most likely explained by the causal gene mutations, while the additional <italic>NINL</italic> variant appears to have no obvious effect on the phenotype in individual UW57-3.

<title>MICAL3 associates with NINL and is mislocalized in NINL and CC2D2A-depleted cells</title>
<p>In order to unravel the underlying molecular cause of the observed vesicle accumulation and to identify proteins that interact with NINL, we next generated N-terminal Strep/FLAG-tagged fusion proteins of NINL isoA and isoB. A single-step affinity purification combined with quantification by stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and tandem affinity purification (TAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref037">37</xref>] were applied to isolate the protein complexes in their native functional states from human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. The complexes were subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The identified interactome consisted of 174 unique proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g006">Fig 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005575.s006">S1 table</xref>). An important association was found with multiple subunits of the cytoplasmic dynein 1-dynactin motor complex (DYNC1H1, DYNC1LI1, DYNC1LI2, DYNCI2, DYNLRB1, DCTN1-4, and DCTN6) which is involved in minus endâdirected microtubule-associated transport. In addition, six actin-binding proteins (ARP1, ARP1B, ARP10, CAPZA1, CAPZA2 and CAPZB) and three subunits of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (CAMK2A, CAMK2D, and CAMK2G), involved in non-canonical Wnt5a signaling, synaptic plasticity and kidney development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref038">38</xref>], were found to associate with NINL. An additional relevant NINL interaction partner identified was MICAL3 (Microtubule-associated Monooxygenase, Calponin and LIM domain containing 3 protein), which is known to participate in a protein complex with RAB6 and RAB8 that is involved in the fusion of exocytotic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref039">39</xref>], a process that appears to be deficient in the retina of <italic>cc2d2a</italic> mutants and <italic>ninl</italic> morphants.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dysfunction of transition zone proteins causes several ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome, Meckel syndrome, nephronophthisis or Usher syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref040">40</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref043">43</xref>]. Previous work suggests that transition zone proteins in general, and CC2D2A in particular, are required for correct localization of transmembrane proteins to the ciliary membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref025">25</xref>],. The mechanism by which transition zone proteins exert this function and the link to upstream ciliary-directed vesicular trafficking mechanisms remain however largely unknown. In this work, we identify NINL as a novel physical interaction partner for the transition zone protein CC2D2A and propose a model linking CC2D2A to RAB8A-controlled vesicle trafficking through a dual role for NINL in microtubule-based vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The association of NINL with both the cytoplasmic dynein 1-dynactin motor complex (Dona et al, co-submitted manuscript) and MICAL3 supports a role for NINL in the initial transport of trans-Golgi network-derived RAB8A-MICAL3 coated vesicles towards the base of the photoreceptor cilium, while the association of NINL with CC2D2A provides a docking point for these incoming vesicles at the entrance of the ciliary compartment.</p>

<title>Proposed model for CC2D2A and NINL function in trafficking, docking and fusion of rhodopsin-carrier vesicles.</title>
<p>1) CC2D2A binds NINL and thus provides a docking point at the base of the connecting cilium for incoming vesicles. 2) NINL binds MICAL3 which in turn binds RAB8 that is coating the rhodopsin-carrier vesicles. Since NINL also associates with the cytoplasmic dynein1 motor complex, it provides a link between the carrier vesicles and the motor generating the movement along the microtubules. 3). MICAL3 subsequently interacts with ELKS and its redox activity promotes remodeling of the docking complex resulting in fusion of the vesicle at the periciliary region.</p>

</fig>
<p>Ciliary transmembrane proteins are synthesized in the cell body and travel from the Golgi towards the cilium in vesicles which move along microtubules using a cytoplasmic dynein motor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref044">44</xref>]. Once at the entrance of the ciliary compartment, these vesicles must dock and fuse with the periciliary membrane to deliver their cargo into the ciliary membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref045">45</xref>]. This path has been particularly well studied in photoreceptors, where large quantities of opsins and membrane continuously have to replenish the disks which constitute this photo-sensitive structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref035">35</xref>]. Opsin trafficking is severely affected in both zebrafish <italic>cc2d2a</italic> mutants and <italic>ninl</italic> morphants, suggesting that both proteins play an important role in this transport which is crucial for the correct morphogenesis and homeostasis of the outer segments. Their co-localization at the base of the photoreceptor cilium could suggest that Cc2d2a and Ninl play a similar or combined role in opsin transport or that one protein is required to localize the other. However, since we found that each protein localizes independently of the other, and that <italic>ninl</italic> knockdown enhances the <italic>cc2d2a</italic> null mutant phenotype, the relationship between them is likely more complex than a simple linear pathway. At the ultrastructural level, the loss of function phenotypes of these two proteins also slightly diverge from each other: although vesicles accumulate in both cases in the affected photoreceptors, small vesiculo-tubular structures accumulate mostly apically around the connecting cilium in <italic>cc2d2a</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref025">25</xref>], while this work shows that small vesicles and larger vacuoles are also present more basally and closer to an abnormal Golgi apparatus in <italic>ninl</italic> morphants. This suggests that both proteins are important for vesicular trafficking but play different roles in this process.</p>
<p>NINL has been previously shown to bind several other ciliopathy proteins present at the base of cilia, specifically LCA5 and USH2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref031">31</xref>], suggesting that it may play a more pivotal role in vesicular trafficking in photoreceptors than CC2D2A. Given that the zebrafish <italic>ninl</italic> morphant phenotype is more severe than the <italic>cc2d2a</italic> mutant phenotype, this further suggests a more central role for Ninl than for Cc2d2a in cilium-directed trafficking. This hypothesis is also supported by the lack of bi-allelic <italic>NINL</italic> mutations in a large human cohort of Joubert syndrome. Indeed, this may be interpreted as lack of tolerance to loss-of-function mutations in <italic>NINL</italic>, as these would lead to more severe phenotypes or early embryonic lethality. The direct interaction between NINL and the dynein 1-dynactin complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref047">47</xref>] which we confirmed and expanded in the associated study by Dona et al, suggests that NINL might be involved in minus endâdirected microtubule-associated transport of organelles and cargo towards the base of the cilium. An appealing model would thus propose that NINL functions both more upstream in ciliary-directed vesicular trafficking than CC2D2A as well as at the base of the cilium where it interacts with several different proteins including CC2D2A.</p>
<p>While no bi-allelic rare deleterious <italic>NINL</italic> variants were identified in our JBTS cohort, we did find heterozygous <italic>NINL</italic> mutations in individuals with Joubert syndrome. Interestingly, only the individual with causal bi-allelic <italic>CC2D2A</italic> mutations and a heterozygous truncating <italic>NINL</italic> mutation had a severe phenotype with retinal and terminal renal disease. In comparison, the individuals with causal mutations in other JBTS genes and a heterozygous deleterious <italic>NINL</italic> mutation (or with the same causal <italic>CC2D2A</italic> mutation alone) had the classical âpure Joubertâ phenotype without retinal or renal involvement. While bi-allelic <italic>CC2D2A</italic> mutations can result in a wide range of JBTS-associated phenotypes, the majority of individuals with causal <italic>CC2D2A</italic> mutations and JBTS display the âpure JBTSâ phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref022">22</xref>]. The more severe phenotype only of the individual carrying causal <italic>CC2D2A</italic> mutations and an additional <italic>NINL</italic> truncating variant suggests that deleterious variants in <italic>NINL</italic> may act as genetic modifiers specifically of <italic>CC2D2A</italic>-caused ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome. Unfortunately, the rarity of this disorder and its prominent genetic heterogeneity with over 27 associated genes prevent identification of multiple individuals sharing the same combination of causal and additional genetic variants, precluding identification of a statistically significant effect of rare variants as genetic modifiers using human genetics alone. Our findings from a large Joubert cohort therefore remain of anecdotal nature. However, the physical and genetic interaction in zebrafish identified in this work substantially strengthen the significance of this finding and suggest that deleterious variants in <italic>NINL</italic> may indeed enhance the retinal and renal phenotype in individuals with <italic>CC2D2A</italic>-associated Joubert syndrome. The effect on the retinal phenotype may be explained by the importance of NINL function in photoreceptors as highlighted in the present study. Enhancement of the renal phenotype by the additional <italic>NINL</italic> mutation may be explained by the association identified in this study between NINL and the PKD2-target CaMKII, which is important for renal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>The identification of MICAL3 as an interaction partner for NINL is of particular relevance in the context of vesicular trafficking given that MICAL3 binds RAB8A and plays a role in exocytotic vesicle fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref039">39</xref>]. MICAL3 is part of the MICAL family of flavoprotein monooxygenases which regulate the actin cytoskeleton by disassembling the actin filaments. The redox function of MICAL3 is required to promote vesicle fusion, possibly by destabilizing protein complexes and remodeling the docking-fusion complexes in which it is engaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref039">39</xref>]. The role of RAB8A in vesicle fusion at the ciliary base has been abundantly documented in various cell types including photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref028">28</xref>].

Our findings now provide a model explaining the link between CC2D2A and RAB8A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005575.g008">Fig 8</xref>): RAB8A-coated vesicles destined to the ciliary compartment are bound by MICAL3 which in turn binds NINL that is associated to the cytoplasmic dynein 1 motor complex (Dona et al, companion manuscript), allowing the movement along the microtubules. Once at the base of the cilium, NINL interacts with CC2D2A, providing the specificity of the docking point at the entrance to the ciliary compartment. Finally, the redox activity of MICAL3 promotes remodeling of the complex allowing fusion of the vesicle and release of cargo into the peri-ciliary membrane.</p>
<p>A role for CC2D2A in promoting the assembly of ciliary subdistal appendages was recently suggested whereby CC2D2A would be required for docking of transport vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005575.ref024">24</xref>]. This is compatible with our model which also provides a possible mechanism to explain how transition zone proteins may regulate ciliary protein composition by providing specific docking points at the entry to the ciliary compartment. Dysfunction of transition zone proteins can lead to a variety of ciliopathies and it is likely that abnormal ciliary protein composition is at least in part responsible for the observed disease phenotypes even in the absence of ciliogenesis defects. This provides an opportunity for the development of pathway-specific therapies aiming at modulating trafficking routes and restoring normal ciliary protein content. In this perspective, unraveling the cell biological function of disease genes such as <italic>CC2D2A</italic> as presented in the current study is a prerequisite for the future development of pharmacological treatments for patients with ciliopathies.</p>

<title>Recapitulation of phenotype by a <italic>ninl</italic> ex15 spMO (4 dpf).</title>
<p>(<bold>a-b</bold>) Injection of 4ng <italic>ninl</italic> ex15 spMO (n&gt;100) results in heart edema and small eyes. No defects in body curvature were observed in comparison to control MO-injected larvae. (<bold>aâ, bâ</bold>) Analyses of bodipy-stained retinas of <italic>ninl</italic> ex15 spMO-injected larvae (n = 10) revealed defects in photoreceptor outer segment formation (10 of 10) similar to those observed in <italic>ninl</italic> atgMO-treated larvae, whereas stained retinas of control MO-injected larvae (n = 10) appeared normal (10 of 10). Scale bars represent 500Î¼m (a-b) and 5Î¼m (aâ-bâ). (<bold>c</bold>) RT-PCR analysis on RNA isolated from 25 larvae that were either uninjected, injected with control MO (6ng) or injected with various amounts of <italic>ninl</italic> ex15 spMO (2, 4, 6ng), collected at two different time points after injection (2 dpf and 4 dpf). One PCR product of the expected length (~500bp) was obtained from RNA from uninjected and control MO-injected larvae. Sequence analysis revealed that this was the predicted transcript including exons 13â16. RT-PCR analysis on RNA obtained from the morphant larvae resulted in two products: Sequence analysis of both fragments revealed that the shorter product is the predicted wild-type transcript (ex13-16) and that the longer transcript in addition includes the entire intron 14 (85 bp), resulting in premature termination of translation already after two codons in intron 14. This aberrant splicing persists at 4dpf.</p>
