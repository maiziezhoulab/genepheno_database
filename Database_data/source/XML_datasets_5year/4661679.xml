<abstract>
<p>We sought to determine the potential effects of pooling on power, false positive rate (FPR), and bias of the estimated associations between hypothetical environmental exposures and dichotomous autism spectrum disorders (ASD) status. Simulated birth cohorts in which ASD outcome was assumed to have been ascertained with uncertainty were created. We investigated the impact on the power of the analysis (using logistic regression) to detect true associations with exposure (X<sub>1</sub>) and the FPR for a non-causal correlate of exposure (X<sub>2</sub>, r = 0.7) for a dichotomized ASD measure when the pool size, sample size, degree of measurement error variance in exposure, strength of the true association, and shape of the exposure-response curve varied. We found that there was minimal change (bias) in the measures of association for the main effect (X<sub>1</sub>). There is some loss of power but there is less chance of detecting a false positive result for pooled compared to individual level models. The number of pools had more effect on the power and FPR than the overall sample size. This study supports the use of pooling to reduce laboratory costs while maintaining statistical efficiency in scenarios similar to the simulated prospective risk-enriched ASD cohort.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In autism etiologic research, as in other areas of perinatal research and epidemiologic investigation, there is growing interest in analytic methods that maximize accuracy while minimizing costs. One of the methods under consideration to conserve scarce resources is pooling of bio-samples prior to laboratory analysis to conserve biological specimens, enable the study of more biomarkers (exposures), minimize problems related to the limits of detection, reduce the impact of measurement error in exposure variables, and include participants who contributed only a small quantity of bio-samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-ijerph-12-14780">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-ijerph-12-14780">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijerph-12-14780">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijerph-12-14780">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijerph-12-14780">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-ijerph-12-14780">6</xref>]. Pooling may also be used to screen batches of samples for an infectious agent or biomarker after which all specimens in a positive pool are tested individually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-ijerph-12-14780">7</xref>]. Pooling (combining bio-samples from multiple individuals and analyzing them as a single sample) was proposed for public health research and surveillance in 1943 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-ijerph-12-14780">8</xref>] and has been receiving increased attention in the epidemiology literature in the context of non-communicable diseases since 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijerph-12-14780">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-ijerph-12-14780">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-ijerph-12-14780">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-12-14780">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-ijerph-12-14780">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-ijerph-12-14780">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-ijerph-12-14780">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-ijerph-12-14780">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-ijerph-12-14780">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-ijerph-12-14780">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-ijerph-12-14780">18</xref>]. The use of pooling has been investigated in other areas of study, such as perinatal epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijerph-12-14780">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-ijerph-12-14780">19</xref>], infectious disease epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-ijerph-12-14780">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-ijerph-12-14780">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-ijerph-12-14780">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-ijerph-12-14780">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-ijerph-12-14780">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-ijerph-12-14780">24</xref>], environmental epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijerph-12-14780">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-ijerph-12-14780">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-ijerph-12-14780">25</xref>], cancer epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-ijerph-12-14780">12</xref>], and genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-ijerph-12-14780">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-ijerph-12-14780">12</xref>] but has only recently been studied in the context of research on autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-ijerph-12-14780">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-ijerph-12-14780">18</xref>]. An example of a current research area that may greatly benefit from pooling is the potential role of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the etiology of ASD because the levels of PCBs are low, laboratory analyses are very costly, and the blood volumes needed to achieve acceptable sensitivity of analysis are large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-ijerph-12-14780">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-ijerph-12-14780">27</xref>].</p>
<p>In applications of the pooling approach, earlier work suggests that a smaller pool size (number of participants per pool ~5) is ideal as it yields the most accurate study results but scarce resources may necessitate larger pools (e.g., with 10 or more individuals per pool), which have received less attention in the literature. Furthermore, a wide range of pooling strategies in the context of epidemiological analyses were presented by Saha-Chaudhuri <italic>et al.</italic>, highlighting that optimal allocation of the number of pools and number of subjects per pool should be informed by the specific confounders and effect modifiers under consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijerph-12-14780">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-ijerph-12-14780">28</xref>]. Little is known about the impact of pooling in the presence of misspecification of the disease risk function (e.g., when investigators assume that there is a monotonic gradient in log(risk) when in fact there is non-linearity), miss-measured covariates, and in the presence of outcome misclassification. Here we present results of a simulation analysis designed to shed light on the effects of pooling and measurement error that is informed by interim data from the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI). EARLI is an enriched-risk pregnancy cohort (mothers of a child affected by an ASD enrolled at the start of a subsequent pregnancy) intended to generate evidence on environmental exposures important in the etiology of ASD (<uri xlink:href="http://www.earlistudy.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.earlistudy.org/</uri>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-ijerph-12-14780">29</xref>]. Our previous work that was informed by the EARLI elucidated the potential impact of measurement errors in exposures and outcomes under different scenarios of study size, precision of exposure measurement and magnitude of the true association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-ijerph-12-14780">30</xref>]. We also evaluated the influence of categorization of a mismeasured exposure in this context with particular attention to non-linearity of the true association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-ijerph-12-14780">31</xref>]. Importantly, EARLI investigators plan to conduct analyses focused on continuous phenotypic measures as well as dichotomous outcomes. Quantitative phenotypes are being increasingly considered in autism etiologic research (such as in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-ijerph-12-14780">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33-ijerph-12-14780">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-ijerph-12-14780">34</xref>]) and may prove to be important in the study of environmental risk factors. Here we consider the same general scenarios involving both dichotomous outcomes based on categorization of a quantitative measure as in our previous paper as well as pools of different sizes and aim to determine the potential effects of pooling on power, false positives, and bias of the estimated associations between hypothetical environmental exposures and dichotomous ASD status. We also extend our previous work by considering the utility of pooling when the true shape of the exposure-response association is unknown and categorization of exposures is deemed undesirable.</p>

<title>2.1. Simulated Population</title>
<p>The population and sample parameters are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14780-t001">Table 1</xref> and are based on the synthetic population used in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-ijerph-12-14780">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-ijerph-12-14780">31</xref>]. Briefly, we generated a cohort of 1,000,000 children with observed sex (Z) and mismeasured gestational age (W<sub>ga</sub>) distributions similar to the general population in the US, accounting for shortened gestation, on average, among boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35-ijerph-12-14780">35</xref>]. We assumed that the cohort was also exposed to two agents: exposure (1), represented by X<sub>1</sub>, and exposure (2), represented by X<sub>2</sub>, that both follow standard normal distributions and are correlated (Pearson ρ = 0.7). We posited that only exposure (1) (with values of X<sub>1</sub>) exerts causal influence on ASD-related phenotype. We simulated true gestational age X<sub>ga</sub> (in weeks) in the cohort to follow a distribution that is (43 − χ<sup>2</sup>(3)), after which boys were assigned gestational age that was one week shorter for 5% of boys. The simulated population was created and all analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p>

<sec id="sec2dot2-ijerph-12-14780">
<title>2.2. Covariate Measurement Error</title>
<p>We assumed that the ith environmental exposure (here: i = 1 or 2) is observed with classical measurement error: W<sub>i</sub> = X<sub>i</sub> + ε<sub>i,</sub> where ε<sub>i</sub>~N(0,σ<sup>2</sup><sub>i</sub>). Error was added to the individual level values as opposed to after pool allocation, implying that errors arise not from the pooling procedure in the laboratory or laboratory testing errors but from factors such as variation in the etiologically relevant time window when exposure was ascertained and random day-to-day variability in dose. The extent of measurement error for exposure 1 (ME<sub>1</sub>) was selected to span the plausible range: from good precision of environmental measurements with error 6% of true exposure variability to poor precision with error variance equal to the true exposure variability. Gestational age was subject to two sources of error: (a) classical error in the observed continuous measure of the length of gestation, W<sub>ga</sub> = X<sub>ga</sub> + ε<sub>ga,</sub> where ε<sub>ga</sub>~N(0,σ<sup>2</sup><sub>ga</sub>) and (b) round-off error due to reporting gestational age in completed weeks between 23 and 43 weeks. All errors were conditionally independent of each other. Specific values used in the simulation studies are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14780-t001">Table 1</xref>. </p>

We verified that these yielded parameter estimates within the expected range. As the true shape of the exposure-response curve is unknown, the simulated disease was modeled using the following three forms:</p>
<p><bold>Linear Model</bold>:
<disp-formula>
Y<sub>L</sub> = β<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + β<sub>3</sub>Z + β<sub>4</sub>X<sub>ga</sub> + ε<sub>y</sub></disp-formula></p>
<p><bold>“Threshold” (Semi-Linear) Model</bold>:
<disp-formula>
If x<sub>1</sub> &lt; mean<sub>x1</sub>-standard deviation<sub>x1</sub> then Y<sub>T</sub> = 0 × β<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + β<sub>3</sub>Z + β<sub>4</sub>X<sub>ga</sub> + ε<sub>y</sub></disp-formula>
<disp-formula>
If x<sub>1</sub> ≥ mean<sub>x1</sub>-standard deviation<sub>x1</sub> then Y<sub>T</sub> = 1.5 × β<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + β<sub>3</sub>Z + β<sub>4</sub>X<sub>ga</sub> + ε<sub>y</sub></disp-formula></p>
<p><bold>“Saturation” (Semi-Linear) Model</bold>:
<disp-formula>
If x<sub>1</sub> &lt; mean<sub>x1</sub>-standard deviation<sub>x1</sub> then Y<sub>S</sub> = 1.5 × β<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + β<sub>3</sub>Z + β<sub>4</sub>X<sub>ga</sub> + ε<sub>y</sub></disp-formula>
<disp-formula>
If x<sub>1</sub> ≥ mean<sub>x1</sub>-standard deviation<sub>x1</sub> then Y<sub>S</sub>=0.5 × β<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + β<sub>3</sub>Z + β<sub>4</sub>X<sub>ga</sub> + ε<sub>y</sub>,
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The deviation from linearity is created here by altering the slope of the causal association with X<sub>1</sub> above and below the inflection point defined by (mean<sub>x1</sub>-standard deviation<sub>x1</sub>). Constant multipliers (here: 0.5, 1, and 1.5) are used. Thus, in the saturation model, the effect of X<sub>1</sub> is 3 times greater below than above the inflection point because 1.5 × β<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub>/ 0.5 × β<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> = 3. Likewise, in the threshold model, the effect of X<sub>1</sub> is 1.5 times greater above than below the inflection point because 1.5 × β<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub>/β<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> = 1.5. These multipliers were chosen arbitrarily and yet have numerical values that yield plausible “average” associations if the linear model was fitted to the data. For all models ε<sub>y</sub>~N(0,1) and β<sub>2</sub> was 0 since X<sub>2</sub> had no true effect on Y. The latent values of ASD-related phenotype (Y<sub>L, T, S</sub>) were computed for each of three β<sub>1 ∈</sub> {0.15, 0.25, 0.5} that correspond to weak, moderate and strong associations as judged by expected odds ratios (eOR<sub>1</sub>) that result if X<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>L</sub> are dichotomized at one standard deviation above their respective means, <italic>i.e.</italic> eOR<sub>1</sub> = 1.5, 2, and 4.</p>

<title>2.4. Case Definition and Outcome Misclassification</title>
<p>The outcome measure simulated for this particular work was the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI) score that takes on values of 0–18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-ijerph-12-14780">39</xref>]. Latent continuous ASD-related endophenotype, was subjected to rounding error and categorized using a cutoff suggested by prior work (Zwaigenbaum L., personal communications).

For all exposure-disease models, subjects with a high AOSI score (at least 7) were considered to be cases. It must be noted that we do not here equate high AOSI with clinical diagnosis of ASD but merely state that ASD is a collection of traits that naturally occur on a continuous scale and are segregated into binary disease and healthy groups based on some criteria. This is consistent with the current conceptualization of ASD as a “spectrum” of phenotypes, not a definitive state common to all cases, as would be true of another condition such as death from a cardiac event or acquisition of an infection. However, diagnostic thresholds are considered essential in clinical practice as well as epidemiology and the chosen cutoff of 7 has been suggested to have clinical and/or etiologic significance. One can argue that various AOSI sub-scales may be more related to environmental exposure than others but this is not our focus here and our argument applies to any measures of continuous traits that have AOSI-like properties.</p>

<p>Strata (based on sex and case status) and pool allocation are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-14780-f001">Figure 1</xref>. For each model, strength of the true association of X<sub>1</sub>, variance of ME<sub>1</sub>, and shape of the exposure-disease relationship, members of the population were divided into 4 strata based on the value of their dichotomous AOSI score (high <italic>versus</italic> low) and sex, similar to the pooling strategy suggested by Weinberg and Umbach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-ijerph-12-14780">6</xref>]. Each stratum was divided into pools. One thousand cohorts (<italic>i.e</italic>., study samples) each of size (n) 225, 450 and 675 were randomly selected with 5, 10 and 15 individuals per pool (g will be used to refer to the pool size), respectively. The pools were allocated as follows: 10 pools for male controls, 18 pools for female controls, 12 pools for male cases and five pools for female cases. Many pool allocation schemes are possible but this scheme reflects a plausible situation that would arise when stratifying on an established strong risk factor (e.g., sex) and maintaining pools of uniform size within a study. In this scheme, the overall cost of laboratory analyses, which is determined by the number of pools, is kept constant across simulations, <italic>i.e.</italic>, reflecting the reality of having to conduct a study on a fixed budget.</p>

<p>The proportion of the replicates for which there was a stable logistic regression model, which converged within 50 iterations and yielded an OR<sub>1</sub> and OR<sub>2</sub> between 0.1 and 10 (not inclusive), drastically decreased between the moderate effect (eOR = 2: when nearly all the replicates produced a stable regression model) and strong effect (eOR = 4) and decreased with increasing sample size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijerph-12-14780-s001">Table S1</xref>). There were a greater number of stable regression models for the semi-linear models than the linear models when the eOR was 4. Overall, the models with greater measurement error had a higher proportion of stable regression models. The characteristics of the unstable models for pool size 15, eOR = 4 and the smallest measurement error variance are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijerph-12-14780-s001">Table S2</xref>. (This scenario was chosen as it had the greatest number of unstable replicates.) Nearly all of these unstable replicates had OR<sub>1</sub> ≥ 10 and half of these also had OR<sub>2</sub> ≥ 10. </p>
<p>We next compared results of the pooled replicate analysis with the individual level population analysis and individual level replicate analysis. There was a loss of power for many of the pooled models: e.g., the power was 25%–50% for the cohort of size 450 and eOR of 2, but little difference in the OR<sub>1</sub> (all bias terms between 0.8 and 1.2 except in cases of strong true association or large variance in measurement error) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14780-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-14780-f003">Figure 3</xref>). For all combinations of pool size and strengths of the true association, except eOR = 4, there was an increase in power as the pool size (and sample size) increased. The FPR was relatively low for the pooled analysis: less than 15% unless there was a strong association (eOR = 4), or a moderate association (eOR = 2) and large variance in measurement error. Likewise, the mean OR<sub>2</sub> (<italic>i.e</italic>., bias in the estimate for the non-causal exposure) was low (1.0–1.1 in most of the scenarios) except in the models with large measurement error and strong true association (eOR = 4), when mean estimates of OR<sub>2</sub> were 1.4–1.6 (data not shown). In general, the power for detecting associations of X<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>1</sub> was slightly lower for the semi-linear models than the linear models but the bias in the estimate of the overall “average effect” was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-14780-f003">Figure 3</xref>). However, for the strong true association, large measurement error variance and, especially, bigger pool size, the semi-linear models had higher power than the linear models.</p>

<title>Comparison of Pool (g) and Sample Sizes (n)</title>
<p>When the pool and cohort size varied, a number of trends emerged (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14780-t002">Table 2</xref>). Larger cohort and pool sizes (n ≥ 450 with g ≥ 10) had more power to detect a relationship than smaller pool sizes for smaller true effects with the linear model (e.g., for moderate ME<sub>1</sub> and eOR = 2, power = 41%–44% for n = 450 or 675 and 29% for n = 225). </p>

<p>This was also true for the threshold and saturation models. However, for the stronger true effect (eOR = 4) and moderate–to-high measurement error variance the power was greatest for pool size 10 (n = 450) for the linear and semi-linear models. When there was no measurement error, power increased with increasing pool sample size for small and moderate true associations and decreased with increasing sample size when the true effect of X<sub>1</sub> was large. In general, larger sample size resulted in a slight increase in FPR for a moderate true effect (FPR = 4%, 5% and 6% for eOR = 2 and moderate ME<sub>1</sub>). For small and large eOR the relationship between FPR and pool and sample size was more complex.</p>
<p>A comparison of the linear model with cohort size of 675 analyzed at the individual level and using pools of size 5 and 15 is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14780-t003">Table 3</xref>. For more modest eORs (1.5 or 2), the results of the individual logistic regression and analysis of pools of size 5 were very similar. There was a dramatic drop in power and the FPR between pool sizes of 5 and 15. The bias was identical for the two pool sizes. However, for a stronger true association (eOR = 4) and smaller measurement error variance, the bias in OR<sub>1</sub> was in the opposite direction compared to the individual level models. The bias in the association of the miss-measured non-causal exposure (mean OR<sub>2</sub>) increased slightly when the pool size changed from 1 (individual level analysis) to 5 but there was no difference between pool sizes of 5 and 15 (data not shown). The number of replicates for which a logistic model was stable was the same for pool sizes 5 and 15. </p>

<title>4. Discussion</title>
<p>This study supports the use of pooling as an efficient means to reduce laboratory costs in scenarios similar to this specific prospective risk-enriched ASD cohort that aims to elucidate environmental associations (EARLI). The results of this series of simulations found that there is some loss of power for pooled compared to individual level models. We also quantified the resulting reduction in the false positive rate between pool sizes of 5 and 15 when the cohort size was held constant. In addition, there was minimal change in the measure of association for the main effect (X<sub>1</sub>). This was true for the linear as well as semi-linear models. Consistent with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-ijerph-12-14780">30</xref>], the models with measurement error had lower power than models without measurement error.</p>
<p>We looked at larger pool sizes than many of the previous articles about pooling methods and simulations (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijerph-12-14780">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-ijerph-12-14780">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-ijerph-12-14780">28</xref>]). Saha-Chaudhuri [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-ijerph-12-14780">28</xref>] and Weinberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijerph-12-14780">3</xref>] found that pooling had little effect on power with large sample sizes (but did not consider pool sizes larger than (6) and recommended smaller pool sizes. Small pool sizes are indeed ideal in many circumstances but as Dorfman observed in 1943, financial constraints may have an effect on the feasible pool sizes and number of pools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-ijerph-12-14780">8</xref>]. Pool size had little effect on bias but greatly affected the power and FPR in our simulations. In addition, we found that pool size 5 is best if it is suspected that the true association is weak and pool size of 10 may be better when a stronger true effect is hypothesized. A wide range of putative strengths of exposure-autism associations was included here to model the possibility of finding either a weak risk factor or a “smoking gun” (e.g., as exists for the four-fold increased risk of ASD for males).</p>
<p>We demonstrated that even pool sizes as large as 15 lead to fairly accurate results, albeit with considerable loss of power, even when measurement error is taken into consideration, in scenarios similar to those of EARLI. Furthermore, the larger pool size resulted in a much lower FPR, which may be desirable in circumstances where multiple exposures will be examined, such as research into the etiology of ASD where well-founded <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses are lacking. The number of pools has more of an effect on power than the overall number of subjects. Although the loss in power for pool size of 15 makes it hard to justify looking at larger pool sizes for the sample sizes and number of pools under consideration here, investigators with considerably larger samples should consider running this set of simulations with a larger pool size. Fortunately, the measures of association are not very biased for large pool sizes, so if small pool sizes are cost prohibitive, researchers should focus more on the magnitude of these associations than on significance testing. </p>
<p>It should also be noted that for these numbers of pools (and sample sizes) we were unable to stratify by more than two dichotomous variables (case status and sex). Knowledge of the determinants of exposure may help construct more efficient pooling schemes, as is done in group-based exposure assessment in occupational epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40-ijerph-12-14780">40</xref>]. However, it is not currently clear how pooling and exposure modeling or grouping can be used together.</p>
<p>There were a large number of replicates for which the logistic regression models did not yield a stable measure of association (OR between 0.1 and 10) when the pool size and true effect of the causal exposure were large. If a researcher has a sample such as this it should be obvious, based on the bivariate and stratified analyses, that a regression model is not appropriate. In fact, our inspection of the individual simulations revealed that in such cases, an investigator would have no doubt, based on descriptive analyses, that there is evidence to support the existence of an association (this presumed certainty of an association is the reason for their inclusion in the numerator of the power and FPR calculations). Pooling performs well even with a high degree of measurement error as long as the pool size is small and the strength of the true association is moderate. Measurement error was added to the individual values for exposure (X<sub>1</sub>) not to the analytical values that results after pooling of specimens. This was done based on the assumption that error occurs at the time of sampling measurement and that assay-based error is typically miniscule compared to the day-to-day variance in exposure. Weinberg and Umbach modeled both types of error and found that “if the measurement error is individual based, the dependence on g disappears and pooling has no effect on the bias in the β estimation” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-ijerph-12-14780">6</xref>]. We found that, except in cases of a strong true association, the change in bias resulting from increasing variance in measurement error was only slightly affected by pooling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14780-t003">Table 3</xref>). </p>
<p>Pooling may offer several advantages in scenarios similar to those in EARLI. In addition to the financial savings for analyzing fewer samples for an individual exposure, a limited amount of bio-samples can be analyzed for more environmental exposures than would be possible in an individual-level analysis. As pooling resulted in fewer spurious results (<italic>i.e</italic>., the FPR was lower), researchers may have more confidence in variables identified through pooled analysis. Power is important but false positives do not in any way help create useful interventions. When selecting a pooling strategy, researchers will need to balance this lower FPR against the relatively low power in some of the scenarios. Although a multitude of scenarios were studied here, we will provide our syntax upon request so that researchers who have data with other exposure distributions (including potentially skewed exposure data such as is likely with PCBs), exposure-response relationships and error distributions can investigate the ideal pool size for their study. </p>

<title>5. Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, our current work supports the use of pooling as a means to reduce laboratory costs while maintaining the statistical efficiency of studies that are similar to the simulated prospective cohort. Given its commendable track record under the realistic constraints of observational studies, pooling should be considered as an analytical strategy in any epidemiological study that faces constraints on the cost of analyses and availability of biological samples. </p>
