<abstract>
<p>In recent years the notion that malfunctioning of the immune system may result in developmental brain diseases has emerged. However, the role of immune molecules in the developing brain has not been well explored. The complement pathway converges to cleave C3. Here we show that key proteins in the lectin arm of this pathway, MASP1, MASP2 and C3, are expressed in the developing cortex and that neuronal migration is impaired in knockout and knockdown mice. Molecular mimics of C3 cleavage products rescue the migration defects that have been seen following knockdown of <italic>C3</italic> or <italic>Masp2</italic>. Pharmacological activation of the downstream receptors rescue <italic>Masp2</italic> and <italic>C3</italic> knockdown as well as <italic>C3</italic> knockout. Therefore, we propose that the complement pathway is functionally important in migrating neurons of the developing cortex.</p>

<p>The notion that malfunctioning of the immune system may contribute to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Immune signalling has been shown to participate in postnatal neural development and synaptic plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The innate immune complement pathway is composed of a cascade of proteases. Upon stimulation, an amplifying cascade of cleavages begins resulting in cell surface bound and receptor activating molecules, ultimately leading to cell destruction as a defence response to pathogens. In the postnatal brain, activity of the classical complement pathway has been implicated in developmental pruning of synapse refinement of the mouse visual system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In addition, it has been shown that the complement fragment C3a and its receptor are important for collective cell migration of neural crest cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>; however, the role of the complement system in the embryonic brain remains poorly understood. Mutations in members of the lectin arm of the complement pathway have been previously implicated in 3MC syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, in which intellectual impairment is part of the complex syndrome. Neuronal migration is impaired in cases of intellectual disabilities, autism and schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, and therefore, we postulated that the complement cascade might be involved in regulation of migrating neurons in the developing brain. Here we show that key proteins in the pathway, Complement C3, MASP1 and MASP2, are expressed in the developing mouse brain and that neuronal migration is impaired when their levels are reduced by either knockout or knockdown. Molecular mimics of C3 cleavage products rescued knockdown of <italic>C3</italic> or <italic>Masp2</italic>. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of the downstream receptors C3aR and C5aR rescued the migration defect caused by <italic>Masp2</italic> and <italic>C3</italic> knockdown as well as <italic>C3</italic> knockout. Collectively, our data suggest that complement activity is required for neuronal migration progression, and thus a beneficial intervention is possible.</p>

<title>Complement components in the brain affect neuronal migration</title>
<p>Complement C3 is a central molecule in the complement pathway and it is cleaved following the activation of either the classical-, or the lectin-, or the alternative arms of the complement pathway (the classical- and lectin-arms are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In the lectin-arm, the two key proteases that are activated are MASP1 and MASP2. Immunostaining demonstrated widespread immunoreactivity of C3, MASP1 and MASP2 in embryonic brain sections (E16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b–d</xref>). Relatively low level of expression was noted in the ventricular zone (VZ), and the subventricular zone, where Tbr2 positive cells reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Expression of C3, MASP1 and MASP2 was noted in areas where postmitotic neurons are present (Tuj1 positive, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>), and higher levels of expression were detected in the cortical plate (CP), where Tbr1 immunostaining marks the deep layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). The validity of the C3, Masp1 and Masp2 antibodies was confirmed by showing loss of immunoreactivity in brain sections of the respective knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a–h</xref>). To complement the protein expression data, we examined the expression of the mRNA of the abovementioned molecules in cortices of developing embryos. In addition, we tested for mRNA expression of two important receptor proteins in this pathway, C3aR and C5aR. C3aR is the receptor for C3a, the cleavage product of C3, while C5aR binds C5a. The mRNA expression of the complement genes <italic>C3, Masp1, Masp2, C3aR</italic> and <italic>C5aR</italic> was dynamic and varied at different embryonic ages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1i–m</xref>). To better visualize the cellular localization of the complement proteins, E14 mouse embryos were <italic>in utero</italic> electroporated with Lifeact-GFP that marks the cell periphery, and the brain sections were immunostained at E16. Neuronal progenitors that are electroporated in the VZ will differentiate and follow the normal migratory path to superficial layers of the CP at E18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). At E16 the majority of migrating neurons electroporated on E14 undergoes multipolar-to bipolar transition in the intermediate zone (IZ). High resolution and Z-stack images of neurons taken from the IZ (relative position marked by * in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b–d</xref>) demonstrate that most of the complement protein deposits are extracellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i–k</xref>).</p>
<p>We next questioned whether the pathway is active in the developing brain. To this end, we tested and showed proteolytic processing of Complement protein C3 using an ELISA kit specific for the detection of cleaved C3 (C3a); we detected 2.89±0.32 ng of cleaved C3 per mg of total protein with no C3a expression in <italic>C3</italic> knockout cortices. In addition, C3b was detected in developing brain lysates by western blot analysis using antibodies specific for activated fragments of C3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1n</xref>). We then tested the hypothesis that C3 can regulate radial neuronal migration in the developing brain. The position of C3 knockout labelled neurons across the width of the cortex differed significantly from that found in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l,m</xref>). In the C3 knockout brains more GFP labelled neurons were found in deeper bins (closer to the VZ) and less were found in the superficial layers of the CP suggesting neuronal migration impairment. Following this, the possible role of members of the lectin pathway in regulation of neuronal migration was studied. The lectin pathway is activated via the binding of the recognition molecules mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and of ficolins, to different ligands. The binding activates the associated proteases mannan-binding lectin serine peptidases 1 and 2 (MASP1 and MASP2) (reviewed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Neuronal migration was analysed in <italic>Masp1</italic> knockout embryos generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d,g</xref>). Neurons born at E14 were labelled with IdU, and their relative position in the brain was analysed at E18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1n,o</xref>). While control litter-mates exhibited a normal pattern of neuronal migration with most of the E14 labelled neurons reaching the CP by E18, neurons in <italic>Masp1−/−</italic> embryos had a wider pattern of distribution (differences are significant in three out of five bins, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1o</xref>). In a similar manner, the role of MASP2 in migrating neurons was examined, using <italic>Masp2−/−</italic> embryos generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e,f,h</xref>). Neuronal migration impairment was observed in the <italic>Masp2</italic> knockout embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1p,q</xref>). Comparison of the position of neurons labelled by IdU at E14 and analysed at E18 revealed significant differences between <italic>Masp2</italic> knockout and their wild-type litter-mates (three out of five arbitrary bins across the width of the CP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1q</xref>). We next tested for possible cortical lamination phenotypes in the abovementioned knockout mice. We noted that the width of C3 knockout cortices was reduced in comparison to control (76.4±1.4%, versus 100±3.5%, <italic>n</italic>=8, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=0.0004). The relative width of the deep-layers (Tbr1+) and the superficial layers (Cux1+) increased by 4.8±1.3% (<italic>n</italic>=8, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=0.03) and 16.8±3.4% (<italic>n</italic>=8, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=0.003), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1r–t</xref>). In case of <italic>Masp1</italic> and <italic>Masp2</italic> knockout, a reduction in the relative domain occupied by Cux1+ cells was noted (14.6±2.3%, <italic>n</italic>=5, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=0.0017 and 10.3±2.8%, <italic>n</italic>=5, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=0.022 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1u–z</xref>). No change in the Tbr1-positive domain was observed. The width of <italic>Masp1</italic> knockout cortices was similar to that of wild-type, whereas <italic>Masp2</italic> knockout cortices exhibited an 8% reduction in width as compared to wild-type (92±2.6% versus 100±1.9% respectively, <italic>n</italic>=5, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=0.04).</p>
<p>We next moved to a knockdown system that allows an acute downregulation of gene products in a small subpopulation of neurons, thus avoiding gene-redundancy effects and serving asa module for screening for possible rescue molecules. <italic>C3</italic> knockdown in the developing cortex resulted in a neuronal migration deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b,e</xref>). The efficiency of C3 shRNA was confirmed by qPCR and was found to reduce the mRNA levels dramatically to 14.5±10.6% (<italic>n</italic>=6, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=0.009) of the control expression levels. C3 protein levels were consequently reduced as evident by immunostaining, and were corrected when a C3 cDNA construct resistant to the shRNA (C3<sup>res</sup>) was co-introduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a–d</xref>). <italic>In utero</italic> electroporation of <italic>Masp1</italic> shRNA significantly impaired neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a–e</xref>), recapitulating our finding in the knockout mice. <italic>Masp1</italic> shRNA reduced <italic>Masp1</italic> mRNA levels by 38.5±3.5% in comparison to control shRNA (real-time qPCR, <italic>n</italic>=9, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=4.8E<sup>−08</sup>.) <italic>Masp1</italic> shRNA treatment also resulted in decreased MASP1 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e,f,h</xref>). Addition of <italic>Masp1</italic><sup>res</sup> partially corrected the observed protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e–h</xref>). Neuronal migration impairment was also observed in the embryonic brains treated with <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,d,e</xref>). The position of the labelled neurons significantly differed in all five bins, spanning the width of the CP. <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA levels were reduced by 52.4±7.4% in comparison to control (<italic>n</italic>=9, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>=7.1E<sup>−05</sup>). The changes in MASP2 protein levels following shRNA or rescue treatments were confirmed by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2i–l</xref>). The shRNA treatments (E14–E18) of the three complement protein genes resulted in neurons that are stalled in the IZ. The morphology of the stalled cells combined with immunostaining for Golgi was analysed. In polarized migrating neurons, the Golgi apparatus clusters and usually only one cluster per cell is detected. When either <italic>C3, Masp1</italic> or <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA were introduced, a dispersion of the Golgi apparatus was evident on E18 with more than two clusters per cell, corresponding to cells which exhibited multipolar morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2m–q</xref>). The multipolar morphology is a transient state that is normally followed by adoption of bipolar morphology. Whereas control E14-labelled cells undergo multipolar-to-bipolar transition on E16, this process was impaired following knockdown of either <italic>C3</italic>, or <italic>Masp1</italic> or <italic>Masp2</italic>. We examined whether <italic>Masp2</italic> knockdown affected apoptosis, but the number of apoptotic cells on E18 did not differ from control treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Next, the postnatal effects of the abovementioned embryonic interventions were studied. Analysis of the position of Cux1-positive cells on P8 revealed that knockdown of either <italic>C3</italic>, or <italic>Masp1</italic> or <italic>Masp2</italic> resulted in a more superficial position than the control cells. In case of either <italic>Masp1</italic> or <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA a significant proportion of the cells did not reach superficial layers at all. Some of the <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA cells were positioned ectopically in the white matter. In case of <italic>Masp1</italic> shRNA treatment, cells abnormally positioned in the IZ/CP border were noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f–n</xref>). To determine the fate of the cells in ectopic positions, sections were immunostained with antibodies for the upper layer marker Cux1 and the deep layer marker Tbr1. The majority of cells in control shRNA treated brain were Cux1 positive (94.8±0.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f,j</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2v</xref>). The majority of <italic>C3, Masp1</italic> and <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA treated cells were Cux1 positive regardless of their position (91.4±0.8%, 86.9±1%, <italic>P</italic>=0.01, 78.6±1.6%, <italic>P</italic>=0.01 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g–i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2v</xref>). The reduction of the total number of Cux1-positive cells following <italic>Masp1</italic> or <italic>Masp2</italic> knockdown was not compensated by additional cells positive for the deep layer neuronal marker Tbr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2j–m</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2w</xref>) nor by the number of cells positive for the glial marker GFAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2r–u,x</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined whether the observed phenotypes could be solely explained by changes in the proliferative behaviour of the progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We tested neuronal stem cell proliferation by a short IdU pulse, which is incorporated in S phase (30 min), and phospho-Histone H3 (pHis+), preferentially labelling cells in M phase, and immunostained embryonic brain sections using the respective antibodies. No differences between <italic>C3</italic> knockout and littermate control embryos were observed in the amount of pHis+ cells in the VZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e–g</xref>). However, in the subventricular zone of <italic>C3</italic> knockout brains, an increase of 24.8±2% in pHis+ cells was observed in comparison to the control littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e–g</xref>). These results suggest possible changes in cell-cycle parameters of the intermediate progenitors. The same assays were conducted in embryos treated with <italic>Masp1</italic> or <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA constructs compared with control shRNA at E13 and analysed on E14. No changes were noted in case of <italic>Masp1</italic> shRNA treated brains in the proportion of IdU+ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b,d</xref>). However, <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA treatment resulted in a significant increase of IdU+ cells (increase of 47.9±7%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,c,d</xref>). The observed changes in the proliferation of the progenitors may explain in part the reduction in the width of <italic>C3</italic> and <italic>Masp2</italic> knockout cortices mentioned above; however, since the migratory effect seen across treatments is not consistent with the proliferation abnormalities, it is unlikely that the observed migration phenotype can be exclusively explained by the changes in cell cycle parameters.</p>
<p>The initiation of the classical arm of the complement pathway requires the binding of C1q to many of its interacting partners, which then leads to a conformational change in the C1 complex and to the exposure of the serine proteases C1r and C1s to cleave C2 and C4 (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization data (GenePaint.org) show the expression of C1q, C1s and C1r in the developing brain. To test the role of classical complement cascade in corticogenesis, we examined whether C1qa-deficient mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (a gift from Marina Botto, Imperial College London) exhibit a neuronal migration phenotype. At E18, the position of the GFP-positive neurons born at E14 did not differ between the wild-type and the knockout littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a–c</xref>). Most of the GFP-positive neurons resided in the expected CP layers in brain sections from embryos of both genotypes. Knockdown of an additional component of the classical pathway, <italic>C1s</italic>, resulted in mild though significant neuronal migration inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6d–f</xref>). The reduction of <italic>C1s</italic> mRNA by shRNA expression was verified by qPCR, displaying 47.4±8% reduction in the levels of <italic>C1s</italic> as compared to control shRNA (<italic>n</italic>=5, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test<italic>, P</italic>=0.0067).</p>
<p>Whereas knockout mice for the C1qa (a component of the classical pathway) show normal neuronal migration, knockout and knockdown for components of the lectin pathway (<italic>Masp1</italic> and <italic>Masp2</italic>), and complement <italic>C3</italic> exhibit neuronal migration impairment.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>C3 cleavage products rescue migration phenotypes</title>
<p>Activation of the complement pathway results in enhanced cleavage of C3 to C3a and C3b (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that if C3 proteolysis is important for neuronal migration, the expression of peptides, which mimic the cleavage products may mend neuronal migration deficits caused by the reduction of the level of upstream components of the lectin pathway. <italic>In vivo</italic>, C3b beta and alpha are attached by disulphide bonds, which we could not imitate in mimicry products; thus, to ensure their secretion, a signal peptide was attached to the N-terminal part of C3a, while C3b beta naturally has the signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. As previously mentioned C3 knockdown resulted in neuronal migration deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c,g</xref>). Specificity was indicated by successful partial rescue following introduction of an expression construct of C3 resistant to the shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,g</xref>). The C3 mimicry products were then expressed <italic>in utero</italic> together with <italic>C3</italic> shRNA. Addition of the <italic>C3a</italic> or the <italic>C3b beta</italic> fragments led to partial prevention of the <italic>C3</italic> shRNA migration phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e–g</xref>). The finding that the molecular mimics of C3 cleavage products improved C3-knockdown-induced migration deficits suggests that the activity of the complement pathway, and not only the C3 protein, is required for proper positioning of excitatory neurons in the developing brain. We then tested whether these mimicry products are capable of alleviating neuronal migration impairment when a more upstream component, <italic>Masp2</italic>, is knocked down. <italic>Masp2</italic> was chosen for rescue experiments because its functioning is more restricted to the activation of the lectin pathway in comparison with <italic>Masp1</italic>. Masp1 has been shown to activate the alternative pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and even to directly cleave C3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). As mentioned above, neuronal migration impairment was observed in the embryonic brains treated with <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h,i,m</xref>). The position of the labelled neurons significantly differed in all five arbitrary bins spanning the cortex. This phenotype was markedly improved following the addition of <italic>Masp2</italic> resistant to the shRNA (<italic>Masp2</italic><sup>res</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3j,m</xref>). Next, C3a or C3b beta peptides were expressed <italic>in utero</italic> together with <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3k–m</xref>). The expression of C3a to some extent, and of C3b beta to a better extent, significantly improved the displacement of the GFP-positive neurons.</p>

<title>Prenatal treatment with C3a/5a receptor agonists</title>
<p>We further hypothesized that receptors for C3a and/or C5a may be the downstream signalling components mediating the complement activity within the developing brain (schematic presentation of the pathway in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The C3a and the C5a receptors are expressed in the developing brain as evident by RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization data of E14 brain from GenePaint.org and real-time RT–PCR from E13–E18 cortices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1l,m</xref>). The relative levels of C3aR and C5aR in the E16 cortex are 14.7±2.4% and 2.9±0.4%, respectively, in comparison to the levels of C3aR and C5aR in adult mouse liver. To test our hypothesis, we introduced either a selective C3aR agonist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, or a dual C3aR/C5aR agonist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> together with <italic>Masp2</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a–e</xref>). <italic>Masp2</italic> knockdown is expected to result in less activation of the C3a and C5a receptors due to the reduction in the level of C3 cleavage products. Addition of either the single C3aR agonist or the dual complement peptide receptor agonist significantly rescued neuronal migration impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a–e</xref>). The dosage of the agonist treatment was determined using dose change of agonist. Half dose of the agonist partially rescued the migration phenotype combined with <italic>Masp2</italic> shRNA treatment. However, half-dosage was significantly less effective than the full dose treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Our hypothesis predicted that the activation of the C5a and/or C3a receptors would rescue the phenotype caused by <italic>C3</italic> shRNA treatment. Indeed, to a large degree the dual agonist, and to a lesser degree the C3aR agonist, significantly improved the position of the electroporated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>, control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>, C3 shRNA versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h and i</xref> respectively, quantified in 4j). Moreover, we were able to confirm that the activation of the C3a and the C5a receptors can also alleviate the migration deficit observed in the <italic>C3−/−</italic> embryos, while no migration impairment was observed in any of the agonist-treated brains (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4k</xref>, wild-type to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4l</xref>, C3 KO versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4m</xref>, C3 KO with agonists, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4n</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results suggest that neuronal migration is orchestrated mainly through activation of the lectin arm of the complement pathway. C3 cleavage occurs in the developing brain and activation of the complement C3a and C5a receptors is required for proper neuronal migration progression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our studies show that the active lectin/MASP arm of the complement pathway, leading to cleavage of C3, and activating the complement peptide receptors for C3a and C5a, is required for proper migration of neurons in the developing brain. Intervention in several components of this pathway, <italic>Masp1</italic>, <italic>Masp2</italic> or <italic>C3</italic> substantially impaired neuronal migration. The developmental defects following knockdown treatments had postnatal manifestations and long-lasting effects on the cortical organization. Following knockdown treatments of <italic>Masp1</italic>, <italic>Masp2</italic> or <italic>C3</italic>, labelled neurons occupied a more superficial layer than those observed in the control treatment. In addition, ectopic neurons were found in deep cortical layers or in even in the white matter following <italic>Masp1 or Masp2</italic> knockdown respectively. In case of <italic>Masp1</italic> knockdown the majority of the ectopic cells were Cux1 positive, whereas in case of <italic>Masp2</italic> knockdown only a portion of the ectopic cells exhibited Cux1 immunoreactivity. In both treatments, the ectopic cells were Tbr1 and GFAP negative. Therefore, although the treatments resulted in improper positioning of the labelled II–IV neurons born at the time of electroporation or IdU incorporation, the phenotype varied according to the specific gene being manipulated. This may be explained in part by the multi-arm nature of the complement pathway, the complex activities of these proteins and their interactions with additional pathways. It may be possible to speculate that <italic>C3</italic> related phenotypes can be partially rescued by C5 convertase activity of thrombin as has been previously demonstrated in <italic>C3</italic> knockout mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Such a compensatory mechanism is far less likely in the case of Masp2 manipulations, since <italic>Masp2</italic> knockdown or knockout is expected to result in less active thrombin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Finally, Masp1 possess an additional active role in the alternative arm of the complement pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, which may be additionally required for proper brain development. To a great extent, addition of molecular mimics of C3 cleavage products prevented neuronal migration inhibition following knockdown of <italic>Masp2</italic> or <italic>C3.</italic> This suggests that functional activation of the pathway, resulting in C3 cleavage and production of C3 and C5 bioactive mediators, may be an important step in shaping the journey of neurons on their way to the CP. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of the C3a and the C5a receptors prevented neuronal migration deficits in case of <italic>C3</italic> or <italic>Masp2</italic> knockdown and exhibited complete restoration of the position of neurons in <italic>C3</italic> knockout brains, suggesting that a single intervention may be sufficient to ameliorate migration phenotypes. Activation of the C3a or the C5a receptors is likely to activate small GTPases, which will in turn affect cytoskeletal dynamics required for proper neuronal migration. As key regulators of actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, cell polarity and adhesion, the Rho GTPases play critical roles in CNS neuronal migration (reviewed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The complement fragment C3a and its receptor have been previously demonstrated to act during collective cell migration of neural crest cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The mode of collective migration is rather different from radial neuronal migration studied here, although our studies imply that at least one of the chemo-attractants may be shared in both processes. In addition, perturbations in C5aR signalling during rodent brain development have been reported to result in select defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, suggesting widespread roles for complement fragments C3a and C5a in neuronal development.</p>
<p>Knockdown or knockout of specific elements of the classical pathway (<italic>C1qa</italic> and <italic>C1s</italic>) exhibited a mild effect on the progression of neuronal migration. The classical pathway is initiated by the creation of the C1 complex which is composed of C1q, C1s and C1r. The formation of the complex is controlled by C1-inhibitor, which can physically interact with either C1s or C1r and thereby interfere with creation of the C1 complex. C1-inhibitor prevents the formation of the activation complexes of the lectin pathway and the thrombin pathway as well. <italic>C1qa</italic> −/− mice do not have functional C1 complex, and do not exhibit a neuronal migration defect. Therefore, we concluded that the classical pathway is not involved in the migration regulation. Our findings implicated <italic>C1s</italic> in regulation of neuronal migration; it is possible that C1s has activities that are beyond those related to the classical pathway. For example, it may be possible to postulate that knockdown of C1s may lead to higher levels of unoccupied C1-inhibitor that may in turn inhibit the lectin pathway, and this over-inhibition results in neuronal migration impairment. Unlike the process of synapse elimination, where the classical pathway plays a major role<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, our results point to the greater importance of the lectin pathway in the regulation of neuronal migration.</p>
<p>Mutations in components of the lectin pathway have been previously implicated in 3MC syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The 3MC syndrome is grouping of the Carnevale, Mingarelli, Malpuech and Michels syndromes, which are four rare autosomal recessive disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> postulated to be part of the same clinical manifestation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The main features of the 3MC syndrome are facial dysmorphic traits, including hypertelorism, blepharophimosis, blepharoptosis and highly arched eyebrows. Likewise, cognitive impairment, cleft lip and palate, postnatal growth deficiency and hearing loss are also consistent findings. Mutations were detected in two genes belonging to the lectin pathway; <italic>COLEC11</italic> encoding for the CL-K1 protein, which is a member of the protein family of C-type lectins (similar to MBL), <italic>MASP1</italic> encoding for the MASP1 protein, which binds MBL, and MASP3, a product of a differential splice form<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Our experiments using <italic>Masp1</italic> shRNA and <italic>Masp1</italic> knockout are expected to affect both gene products. Therefore, it is attractive to propose that intellectual impairment observed in most patients with 3MC syndrome may be explained in part by the role of the lectin pathway in the regulation of neuronal migration.</p>
<p>Consistent with this idea, database searches indicated that multiple complement pathway components are associated with ASD with different types of associations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. These disorders are typically characterized by social deficits, communication difficulties, stereotyped or repetitive behaviours and interests, and in some cases, cognitive delays. Neuronal migration deficits should be considered as one of the underlying pathologies in ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. New exome sequencing technology has identified novel rare variants and has found that sporadic cases of ASD are enriched for disruptive <italic>de novo</italic> mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Therefore, we further analysed existing ASD exome sequencing data and show that ASD patients exhibit <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in complement genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Mutations in 14 different genes were detected, additional evidence for the involvement of three of the genes in ASD exists (<italic>COLEC12</italic>, <italic>C3</italic> and <italic>FGA</italic>). Among the 16 identified mutations, 15 were analysed by functional prediction programs, 6 or 9 were found to be damaging or possibly damaging by SIFT or PolyPhen program, respectively. Nevertheless, it is likely that not only mutations that are predicted to be damaging can be involved in disease, as has been recently demonstrated in patients with ASD or schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Underscoring our functional studies are damaging mutations detected in <italic>C3</italic> (K610T and D1569E) and in <italic>MASP1</italic> (Y294N). Collectively, our results and the abovementioned <italic>de novo</italic> mutations studies warrant further investigation to probe the involvement of the complement pathway in ASD.</p>
