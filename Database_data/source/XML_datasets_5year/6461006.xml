<title>Background</title>
<p>As an important aspect of tumor heterogeneity, genetic variation may influence susceptibility and prognosis in different types of cancer. By exploring the prognostic value of genetic variation, this study aimed to establish a model for predicting postoperative survival and assessing the impact of variation on clinical outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Material/Methods</title>
<p>A genome-wide association study of 367 patients with HCC was conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with prognosis. Identified predictors were further evaluated in 758 patients. Two prognostic models were established using Cox proportional hazards regression and Nomogram strategy, and validated in another 316 patients. The effect of the SNP rs2431 was analyzed in detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>A prognostic model including 5 SNPs (rs10893585, rs2431, rs34675408, rs6078460, and rs6766361) was established and exhibited high predictive accuracy for HCC prognosis. The panel combined with tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage resulted in a significantly higher c-index (0.723) than the individual c-index values. Stratified by the Nomogram prediction model, the median overall survival for the low-risk and high-risk groups were 100.1 versus 30.8 months (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) in the training set and 82.2 versus 22.5 months (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) in the validation set. A closer examination of rs2431 revealed that it may regulate the expression of FNDC3B by disrupting a microRNA-binding site.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study established prediction models based on genetic factors alone or in combination with TNM stage for postoperative survival in patients with HCC, and identified FNDC3B as a potential therapeutic target for combating HCC metastasis.</p>

<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the second most common cause of death from cancer worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-medscimonit-25-2452">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-medscimonit-25-2452">2</xref>]. Around 50% of newly diagnosed cases occur in China. HCC is highly vascularized with frequent intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastasis, which is responsible for the rapid recurrence and poor survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-medscimonit-25-2452">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-medscimonit-25-2452">4</xref>]. In the past few decades, although progress has been made in the clinical management of HCC, prognosis has not improved substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-medscimonit-25-2452">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-medscimonit-25-2452">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form of genetic variation in the human genome. They are related to risk and heterogeneity in human diseases, clinical course, and response to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-medscimonit-25-2452">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-medscimonit-25-2452">8</xref>]. Although studies have demonstrated associations between SNPs in specific candidate genes for HCC and outcome, the prognostic value of these germline variants remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-medscimonit-25-2452">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-medscimonit-25-2452">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Genome-wide interrogation, which is independent of a priori hypotheses, has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying genetic variants associated with the length of survival for different types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-medscimonit-25-2452">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-medscimonit-25-2452">16</xref>]. While the candidate gene approach is based on our relatively limited understanding of tumor and host biology, the genome-wide interrogation approach allows a more comprehensive evaluation of germline variants across the whole genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-medscimonit-25-2452">12</xref>]. For HCC, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genetic variants at genomic <italic>loci</italic> 1p36.22, 6p21.32, 7q21.13, and 21q21.3, in <italic>STAT4</italic> and <italic>HLA-DQ</italic>, and in the HLA class I region that confer susceptibility in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-medscimonit-25-2452">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-medscimonit-25-2452">21</xref>]. However, little is known about genomic <italic>loci</italic> associated with the survival of patients with HCC.</p>
<p>In this study, we first conducted a GWAS of 367 patients with HCC to identify SNPs associated with outcome. With the aim of building a survival prediction model, the prognostic values of SNPs were further evaluated in a replication set of 758 cases. The survival prediction model was then validated in an independent set of 316 patients and combined with TNM stage to construct a new model that included “seed and soil” factors. According to this model, the SNP rs2431, which is located in the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of <italic>FNDC3B</italic>, regulates the expression level of this metastasis-promoting gene by affecting the binding of miR-409-3p.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>A total of 1802 patients with HCC who underwent liver resection at the authors’ institutes between 2004 and 2009 were recruited. Among these patients, 1441 were enrolled in the SNP genotyping study: 1) the discovery set consisted of 367 patients for genome-wide interrogation of <italic>loci</italic> related to survival; 2) the replication set consisted of 758 patients to further evaluate the prognostic value of SNPs, and the discovery and replication sets were combined to construct a genetic prediction model for postoperative survival in patients with HCC; 3) the independent validation set consisted of 316 patients to test the prognostic value of the 5-SNP survival prediction model. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues of the remaining 361 patients were used to construct a tissue microarray for immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. The flow of the study is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec sec-type="subjects">
<title>Patients and specimens</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Fudan University (2017-041). No patients in this study received preoperative cancer treatment before curative resection for HCC, and all patients were followed up until April 2014. All of the samples included in this study had no visible residual tumor after curative resection. All patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC received antiviral therapy. No patients included in this study received molecular targeted therapy. Data on survival or death and clinicopathological characteristics were recorded for all participating individuals. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of surgery to the date of last follow-up or death. During the follow-up period, patients were examined every 2–3 months after the operation. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was performed when tumor recurrence was suspected. Snap-frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue samples and blood were obtained from patients after obtaining written informed consent. All tumors were confirmed to be HCC by 2 independent pathologists. Histological grade was staged using the TNM stage system of the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer (2010).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>DNA extraction and genotyping</title>
<p>In the discovery set, genomic DNA of each study participant was extracted from blood samples using the Quick Gene DNA Whole Blood Kit (Fujifilm, Osaka, Japan) and genotyped using GeneChip Axiom Genome-Wide Human ASI (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A total of 367 samples and 630 573 SNPs were used in the final GWAS. In the replication and validation sets, genomic DNA from each participant was extracted from tumor-adjacent tissue samples using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and chosen SNPs were genotyped using MassARRAY (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Quality control</title>
<p>Systematic quality control was performed on genotyping data from the GWAS and Sequenom MassArray data using PLINK, including 95% SNP and 90% individual call rate thresholds; the number of samples excluded from analyses is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 1</xref>. For each sample set, the genotype counts and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. The call rates for 5 selected SNPs in each sample set were all &gt;95%. In the entire cohort, the HWE results were χ<sup>2</sup>=0.191, <italic>P</italic>=0.662 for rs10793585; χ<sup>2</sup>=4.822, <italic>P</italic>=0.028 for rs2431; χ<sup>2</sup>=0.890, <italic>P</italic>=0.169 for rs34675408; χ<sup>2</sup>=0.233, <italic>P</italic>=0.629 for rs6078460; χ<sup>2</sup>=0.077, <italic>P</italic>=0.782 for rs6766361. No significant deviation from HWE was detected (<italic>P</italic>≤0.001). To evaluate the genotyping quality, we genotyped the 23 SNPs in 30 randomly selected genome-wide scan samples using Sequenom MassArray, and the concordance between the 2 methods was &gt;95%.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Detection of protein levels by western blotting</title>
<p>Total protein was extracted, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The following antibodies were used: anti-FNDC3B (ab135714; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-GAPDH (CST), and goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Cwbiotech), which was used as the secondary antibody. Protein was detected by Image Acquisition using ImageQuant™ LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Marlborough, MA, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Dual luciferase reporter assay</title>
<p>HEK293T or Hep3B cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 50% to 60% confluence. After 24 hours, cells were transfected with 120 ng of pWPI-miR-409-3p vector or control vector, and co-transfected with 30 ng of the 3′UTR of <italic>FNDC3B</italic> vector containing the rs2431[G] or rs2431[A] alleles using 0.45 μL of Fugene (Promega). Cells were collected 48 hours after transfection, Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega). Luciferase reporter assays were performed in duplicate and repeated in 3 independent experiments. Luciferase activity was detected using an Orion II microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany).</p>
</sec>
<sec sec-type="methods">
<title>IHC staining analysis</title>
<p>Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were used for IHC staining. The rabbit polyclonal antibody to FNDC3B (HPA007859; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was incubated with the tissue sections or microarrays at 4°C overnight and detected using the GTVision™ II Kit (HRP/DAB, Rabbit/Mouse; Genetech, San Francisco, CA, USA). Staining intensity was scored manually by 2 independent experienced pathologists as follows: 0=no staining, 1=weak staining, 2=moderate staining, and 3=strong staining. Tissue sections or microarrays were scored based on the percentage of positively stained cells (0–100%). The final IHC reaction score (IRS) was calculated as the sum of the products of the intensity score and the percentage of positive cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Cell lines and cell culture</title>
<p>Four human HCC cell lines (MHCC97-H, HCCLM3, Huh7, and Hep3B), and one human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T) were used in this research. MHCC97-H and HCCLM3 were established at the Liver Cancer Institute and Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University and have high metastatic potential; Huh7, Hep3B, and HEK293T were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</sec>
<sec sec-type="methods">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Genotype quality control was performed within each study population using PLINK. For the GWAS and replication of survival data, multiple linear regression was performed for each SNP and case. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genotyped SNPs on the same chromosome was determined using Haploview version 4.2 (Broad Institute). TAGster was used for tag SNP selection, and LD was measured by <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> with a threshold of 0.8 and a maximum distance between SNPs of 250 kb. Genotype data for SNPs were obtained from dbSNP (April 2009) for the Asian population. A principal component analysis (PCA)-based method implemented in the software package GCTA was used to detect population outliers and stratification. Kaplan-Meier and χ<sup>2</sup> tests were implemented in SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). <italic>P-</italic>values for survival analyses were obtained using log-rank tests. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied for univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate the effect of each clinical variable, including hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and to construct a survival predicted model. Nomogram, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and the calibration curve were plotted using R version 3.3.3, and the nearest neighbor estimate was used for the ROC analysis. HWE was evaluated using χ<sup>2</sup> tests.</p>

<title>Patient characteristics</title>
<p>Detailed clinicopathological characteristics of participants in the discovery, replication, and validation sets are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-medscimonit-25-2452">Table 1</xref>. No significant differences in clinicopathologic features were observed among the discovery, replication, and validation sets. Among the selected characteristics, TNM stage, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, Child-Pugh stage, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration, tumor size, tumor number, vascular invasion, portal vein tumor thrombus, extrahepatic metastasis, tumor differentiation, and tumor encapsulation were significantly associated with survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s2-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The characteristics of the 361 cases for tissue microarrays used for IHC analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s3-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 3</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Selection of SNPs associated with survival length in HCC</title>
<p>After standard quality filtering, 630 573 SNPs and 367 cases were used for genome-wide interrogation of survival length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 2</xref>). PCA showed little evidence of population stratification in our study populations; therefore, no principal component was adjusted in subsequent association analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s14-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). The effect of genotypes on OS was investigated using multiple linear regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-medscimonit-25-2452">22</xref>]. A quantile-quantile plot revealed a good match between the distributions of observed <italic>P</italic>-values and those expected by chance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s14-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Among all SNPs, only 6 met the standard threshold (<italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>) for GWAS. Our limited sample size for the discovery set (n=367) might not be sufficient for optimal statistical power. To identify as many significant features for validation as possible, we defined the threshold as <italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−3.5</sup> and identified 149 SNPs that were significantly associated with the length of survival. The 6 SNPs that met the <italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>−5</sup> threshold were directly included in the replication stage. Combined the results of Kaplan-Meier analyses (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), 23 candidate SNPs were selected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s4-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) for further evaluation in an independent replication set of 758 samples using MassARRAY. Among them, 8 SNPs were located in functional regions of genes, such as the 3′UTR, 5′UTR, or coding sequence (CDS).</p>
<p>In the replication set, 7 of the 23 SNPs (rs10790836, rs10893585, rs11600756, rs2431, rs34675408, rs6078460, and rs6766361) were significantly associated with OS in HCC (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-medscimonit-25-2452">Table 2</xref>). The association between the 23 SNPs and the time to recurrence was also analyzed, and all 7 SNPs showed significant predictive value in the combined sample set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s5-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Three SNPs (rs10790836, rs10893585, and rs11600756) located on Chr.11q24 were in strong LD and could be tagged by rs10893585 (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.8272 for rs10790836, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.8511 for rs11600756).</p>
<p>According to Kaplan-Meier estimates, genotypes of each SNP could be subdivided into benign and malignant. OS was significantly longer for CT+TT than CC, AA than AG+GG, TT than GT, AG+GG than AA, and AA+CA than CC for rs10893585, rs2431, rs34675408, rs6078460, and rs6766361, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s15-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). To further evaluate the prognostic value of the 5 selected SNPs, multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed using the combined cohort. Significant individual features from the univariate analysis were adopted as covariates. The SNPs were independent prognostic indicators of the length of survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s6-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Construction and validation of an SNP survival prediction model</title>
<p>To further define an SNP panel that could accurately predict prognosis in patients with HCC after curative resection, we applied the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the risk of long-term survival using an entry procedure on the combined discovery and replication sets. The Cox <italic>P</italic>-values for all 5 SNPs were less than 0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s7-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). For each SNP, the Cox coefficient was set as the final value for further calculations to obtain a survival prediction model. The predicted survival value, which could be defined as the Cox index, of different haplotypes was calculated based on the following 5-SNP panel:</p>

<p>Categorical genotypes were coded as follows: CC as 1 and CT+TT as 0 for rs10893585; AA as 1 and AG+GG as 0 for rs2431; GT as 1 and TT as 0 for rs34675408; AA as 1 and AG+GG as 0 for rs6078460; AA+CA as 1 and CC as 0 for rs6766361. In the model, a higher score indicated poorer prognosis.</p>
<p>The prognostic performance of the SNP scoring system was evaluated by ROC analysis and Harrell’s c-index. The area under the ROC curve for 5-year survival was 0.716 (95% CI: 0.683–0.746), better than that for any single SNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s16-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), and the c-index was 0.666 (95% CI: 0.642–0.689). Using the optimal cutoff value (−0.057) determined from the ROC curve, the sensitivity and specificity of the 5-SNP survival prediction model were 58.8% and 74.8%, respectively. Then, Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic performance of the 5-SNP prediction model using the discovery and replication sets( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). According to the cutoff value of the model, the patients were subdivided into high-risk (higher prediction value) and low-risk (lower prediction value) groups. A significantly longer survival time was found in low-risk patients than in high-risk patients in the combined set, with median OS of 100.1 and 35.5 months, respectively (HR=1.725, <italic>P</italic>=1.45×10<sup>−10</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s8-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). To further evaluate the prognostic value of the 5-SNP prediction model, multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed for each set. The 5-SNP prediction model was an independent prognostic indicator of OS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s9-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 9</xref>).</p>
<p>The prediction model was analyzed using another independent validation set. Kaplan-Meier survival curves provided strong evidence for the reliability of predictions in the validation set, with median OS times of 80.2 and 48.0 months, respectively (HR=1.481, <italic>P</italic>=0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 3D, 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s8-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). In addition, multivariate analyses also demonstrated that the 5-SNP prediction model was an independent prognostic factor for OS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s9-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Furthermore, the association between the 5-SNP prediction model and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was also analyzed, and in all sample sets, significantly longer RFS times were found in low-risk patients than in high-risk patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s10-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Combining the SNP prediction model with TNM stage</title>
<p>In addition to the 5-SNP prediction model, multivariate analyses showed that various clinicopathologic features, such as tumor number, tumor size, and tumor invasion, were also independent factors for survival in HCC. To explore whether tumor-specific characteristics could complement and strengthen the SNP algorithm, we added TNM stage data, which is a comprehensive summary of these clinicopathological features, to the 5-SNP prediction model using a Nomogram strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>P</italic>-values for all variables in the Nomogram model were less than 0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s11-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). The predicted survival value for HCC, which could be defined as the Nomogram index, for different haplotypes can be calculated based on the 5 SNPs and the TNM stage as follows:</p>

<p>In the model, the higher the score, the worse the prognosis.</p>
<p>Harrell’s c-index of the Nomogram for predicting survival was 0.723 (95% CI: 0.701–0.745), which was significantly higher than those of the SNPs or the TNM stage alone (SNPs: 0.666, <italic>P</italic>=2.33×10<sup>−4</sup>; TNM stage: 0.654 (95% CI: 0.632–0.676), <italic>P</italic>=5.80×10<sup>−6</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 4B</xref> (left)). The result was confirmed using the validation set with a Harrell’s c-index of the Nomogram of 0.714 (95% CI: 0.673–0.755), which was significantly higher than those of SNPs or TNM stage alone (SNPs: 0.648 (95% CI: 0.606–0.691), <italic>P</italic>=0.014; TNM stage: 0.652 (95% CI: 0.610–0.694), <italic>P</italic>=0.018; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 4B</xref> (right)). The calibration plots for the probability of survival at 3 or 5 years after surgery also showed optimal agreement between the prediction by Nomogram and actual observation in the combined set and validation set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>The area under the ROC curve for 5-year survival was 0.766 (95% CI: 0.735–0.796), which was significantly higher than those for the SNPs or TNM stage alone (SNP: 0.716, <italic>P</italic>=0.011; TNM stage: 0.698 (95%CI: 0.664–0.731), <italic>P</italic>=0.002; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s17-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Using the optimal cutoff value (0.695) determined from the ROC curve, the sensitivity and specificity of the Nomogram survival prediction model were 69.6% and 73.2%, respectively.</p>
<p>Kaplan-Meier survival curves also provided strong evidence for the reliability of predictions in the combined (discovery and replication) set and validation set. Survival time was significantly longer for patients with lower prediction values than for patients with higher prediction values, with median OS times of 100.1 versus 30.8 months and 82.2 versus 22.5 months, respectively (HR=2.512, <italic>P</italic>=6.52×10<sup>−24</sup>; HR=2.415, <italic>P</italic>=2.33×10<sup>−10</sup>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s12-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). Similar results were obtained using the discovery set, replication set, and the entire cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s18-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s12-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). Furthermore, we compared RFS times between groups with lower and higher prediction values divided by the Nomogram prediction model in each sample set, and found that the Nomogram prediction model was significantly associated with the RFS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s13-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 13</xref>.).</p>
<p>To assess the reliability of the 5-SNP prediction model and the Nomogram prediction model for the prediction of HCC prognosis, we conducted a subgroup analysis of patients with different clinical parameters that were not included in our prognostic model, such as gender, age, serum AFP level, serum alanine aminotransferase level, liver cirrhosis status, and BCLC stage. The Nomogram prediction model showed excellent prognostic performance in all subgroups, while the 5-SNP prediction model showed very good prognostic performance in most subgroups, except in the female subgroup (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-medscimonit-25-2452">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Functional relevance of rs2431</title>
<p>To understand the mechanism by which genetic variants influence HCC prognosis, we performed functional analyses of the SNPs included in the prediction model. Among the 5 SNPs, rs2431 and rs34675408 were located in the 3′ UTR of <italic>FNDC3B</italic> and the exonic region of <italic>OSMR</italic>, respectively. Taking the genotype frequencies into account, we focused on rs2431.</p>
<p>Genetic variants in the 3′ UTR might influence gene expression via gain or loss of the binding site of microRNAs involved in regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-medscimonit-25-2452">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-medscimonit-25-2452">27</xref>]. Therefore, we first obtained data from SNPinfo (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo">http://www.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo</ext-link></italic>) and found that miR-409-3p is the only miRNA that exerts diverse effects when binding to different alleles. Dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that the binding between miR-409-3p and rs2431[G] was significantly weaker than binding to rs2431[A] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, we investigated the genotype of rs2431 in four HCC cell lines, and found the GG genotype in MHCC97-H and HCCLM3 and AA genotype in Huh7 and Hep3B. Interestingly, the overexpression of miR-409-3p induced much greater suppression of FNDC3B expression in cell lines harboring the rs2431[A] allele than in those with the rs2431[G] allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 5B</xref>). By IHC staining in 60 HCC tissues randomly selected from the 1125 genotyped samples, we found that HCC tissues with the rs2431[G] allele had significantly higher FNDC3B IHC reaction scores (IRS) (1.500±0.097; n=30) than those of tissues with the rs2431[A] allele (1.050±0.124; n=30) (<italic>P</italic>=0.0034; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, a linear regression analysis showed a negative relationship between miR-409-3p and FNDC3B in HCC tissues with the rs2431[A] allele, but showed no relationship in HCC tissues with the rs2431[G] allele with a similar expression level of miR-409-3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggested that <italic>FNDC3B</italic> is a target gene of miR-409-3p in HCC cells harboring the rs2431[A] allele but not rs2431[G].</p>
<p>Furthermore, the median time to recurrence after surgery for individuals with the GG or AG genotype at rs2431 (37.5 months) was substantially shorter than that of individuals with the AA genotype (62.8 months); the HR for recurrence was 1.314 (95% CI=1.042–1.657; <italic>P</italic>=0.023). A significant association was also found between the rs2431 genotype and tumor vascular invasion (<italic>P</italic>=0.046; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s19-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the role of <italic>FNDC3B</italic> in HCC, we also investigated the expression level of FNDC3B in tissue microarrays that contained HCC tissues from 361 patients by IHC staining. The staining density for FNDC3B in HCC tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent non-tumor tissues (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 6A</xref>). IRS&gt;1.5 was observed in 95 of 361 HCC tissues but only in 28 of the corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues. Consistent with the rs2431 genotypes, the FNDC3B level was significantly associated with the length of survival (<italic>P</italic>=0.015; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-medscimonit-25-2452">Figure 6B</xref>) and tumor vascular invasion (<italic>P</italic>=0.036). Additionally, FNDC3B levels in tumor tissues were significantly associated with the sex, age, tumor size, and TNM stage, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s3-medscimonit-25-2452">Supplementary Table 3</xref>.</p>

<sec sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite recent advancements in diagnostic techniques and multimodal treatments, HCC remains one of the most aggressive and lethal diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-medscimonit-25-2452">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-medscimonit-25-2452">6</xref>]. In this study, using a genome-wide interrogation and replication approach, we identified 5 SNPs as independent genetic factors that affect the survival of patients with HCC. Using a Cox proportional hazards regression model, we established a 5-SNP model to predict survival in HCC. We validated the model using another independent sample set. We further showed that the prediction efficiency can be enhanced by incorporating TNM stage data into a new Nomogram model.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that individual genetic background plays an important role in both susceptibility and the outcome of HCC; this may explain observed variation in the response to the same treatment among patients with HCC. The SNP prediction model may provide a tool for the improved prediction of HCC progression and for guiding HCC monitoring or intervention, even before surgery. Additionally, the prediction model may provide new insight into the determinants of prognosis for patients with HCC. Further studies of the SNPs may identify new biological pathways affecting postoperative survival in HCC.</p>
<p>Since the progression of HCC is complicated, it is unlikely that a single genetic variant will have a drastic effect on clinical outcomes in HCC. However, several synergistic SNPs may have a combined effect on progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-medscimonit-25-2452">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-medscimonit-25-2452">8</xref>]. Therefore, using a Cox proportional hazards regression model, we established a model that combined 5 SNPs to predict the long-term survival of patients with HCC after surgery. Strikingly, the survival rate 60 months after surgery calculated using our 5-SNP panel could serve as a reliable and accurate prognostic biomarker.</p>
<p>We chose rs2431, which has a MAF of 0.620 and is located in the 3′UTR of <italic>FNDC3B</italic> for detailed investigations. <italic>FNDC3B</italic> is located at Chr.3q26 and is a member of the fibronectin gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-medscimonit-25-2452">28</xref>]. The disruption of FNDC3B inhibits adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, and the loss of FNDC3B expression causes a notable reduction in stress fiber formation, delaying cell adhesion, spread, and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-medscimonit-25-2452">29</xref>]. Interestingly, FNDC3B over-expression could result in the malignant transformation of mammary and kidney epithelial cells and hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-medscimonit-25-2452">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-medscimonit-25-2452">32</xref>]. Our functional experiments confirmed this at the biochemical level. Taken together, the rs2431 genotype may be an invaluable target for guiding anti-metastasis therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>The sample sizes of the discovery set (n=367), replication set (n=758), and validation set (n=316) might not be sufficient with respect to statistical power. In the near future, the association between the 5 genetic variants and survival time for individuals with HCC should be confirmed using larger sample sizes. To identify as many significant features as possible, we defined the threshold as 10<sup>−3.5</sup>. Using this threshold, 17 of 23 SNPs chosen for replication had a <italic>P</italic>-value that does not meet the median threshold for SNPs in previous GWASs (usually 10<sup>−5</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-medscimonit-25-2452">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-medscimonit-25-2452">34</xref>]. Multicenter studies should be conducted to further optimize the current model.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, using a genome-wide analysis, we developed survival prediction models for postoperative survival in patients with HCC. Hopefully, the performance and practicability of these models may facilitate clinical management, outcome prediction, and decision-making by physicians.</p>
