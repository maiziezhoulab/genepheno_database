<abstract>
<p>Curative therapeutic options for a number of immunological disorders remain to be established, and approaches for identifying drug candidates are relatively limited. Furthermore, phenotypic screening methods using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived immune cells or hematopoietic cells need improvement. In the present study, using immortalized monocytic cell lines derived from iPSCs, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) system to detect compounds that inhibit IL-1β secretion and NLRP3 inflammasome activation from activated macrophages. The iPSCs were generated from a patient with neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) as a model of a constitutively activated NLRP3 inflammasome. HTS of 4,825 compounds including FDA-approved drugs and compounds with known bioactivity identified 7 compounds as predominantly IL-1β inhibitors. Since these compounds are known inflammasome inhibitors or derivatives of, these results prove the validity of our HTS system, which can be a versatile platform for identifying drug candidates for immunological disorders associated with monocytic lineage cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the main cell types affected by immunological disorders are white blood cells, such as lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. Although our understanding of the cellular pathophysiology of immunological disorders has greatly benefited from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using patient-derived primary hematopoietic cells or <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models, these approaches have several limitations. Patient-derived hematopoietic cells cannot be obtained in sufficient quantities, and their <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes can be affected by <italic>the in vivo</italic> conditions of the patient, such as the cytokine milieu or the administration of therapeutic agents. While animal models have provided important insights into these disorders, species differences in the immunological development causes discrepancies in the function and phenotype of the immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref003">3</xref>]. Overall, high-throughput screening (HTS) of therapeutic compounds using patient-derived cells or animal models is usually not feasible.</p>
<p>The establishment of disease- or patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref005">5</xref>] has led to the development of a new field of disease modeling. Owing to their pluripotency and capacity for self-renewal, iPSCs can function as an unlimited source of patient-derived somatic cells and progenitor cells. iPSCs have also been used as a source of phenotype-based HTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref009">9</xref>]. However, several roadblocks remain for iPSC-based HTS as follows: 1) obtaining a large number of differentiated progenies from PSCs is cost- and labor-intensive, and 2) the yield and function of the differentiated cells often vary among clones and experimental batches.</p>
<p>We have established iPSCs from patients with autoinflammatory syndromes including neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID, also known as chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular [CINCA] syndrome) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref010">10</xref>], Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref011">11</xref>] and Blau syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref012">12</xref>] for disease modeling. In these studies, iPSC-derived myeloid cells were immortalized by transducing lentiviral vectors that encoded <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>BMI1</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref013">13</xref>], and disease phenotypes were recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, iPSC-derived immortalized myeloid cell lines (iPS-MLs) can be expanded from one experimental batch with reduced financial and labor costs. They also can be stored and differentiated into terminally differentiated progenies. Therefore, iPS-MLs can overcome the roadblocks associated with iPSC-based HTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>NOMID is the most severe form of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), an autoinflammatory disease caused by heterozygous mutations in the <italic>NLRP3</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref016">16</xref>]. NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is expressed mainly in myelomonocytic lineage cells and acts as a sensor of cellular stress induced by various pathogens and sterile stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref017">17</xref>]. In normal macrophages, a “priming” stimulus, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induces the expression of NLRP3 and pro-interleukin (IL)-1β, an inactive form of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Then an “activating” stimulus, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), enhances the assembly of a protein complex known as NLRP3 inflammasome. This inflammasome contains the protease caspase-1, which processes pro-IL-1β to the mature form. On the other hand, LPS stimulation of monocytic cells obtained from untreated CAPS patients induces robust IL-1β secretion without secondary activating signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref018">18</xref>] due to autoactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Indeed, anti-IL-1 therapy for CAPS patients has been proven effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref020">20</xref>]. However, anti-IL-1 therapy has several weak points. The efficacy of anti-IL-1 therapy is often inadequate for patients with severe phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref021">21</xref>]. IL-1β maturation is mediated not only by NLRP3 inflammasome, but also other inflammasomes and proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref022">22</xref>]. Thus, a complete blockade of IL-1β may result in excessive immunosuppression. Moreover, the cost and lifelong injection of biologics worsen the patients’ quality of life. Therefore, other therapeutic approaches such as the direct inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activity are under consideration.</p>
<p>NLRP3 inflammasome is an attractive drug target because NLRP3 inflammasome activation is associated with the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref023">23</xref>]. Recently, several selective NLRP3 inhibitors entered the clinical phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref024">24</xref>]. Their chemical structures are undisclosed but presumed to be sulfonylureas or their derivatives. MCC950, a sulfonylurea-based potent selective inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref025">25</xref>], was also recently identified as a direct NLRP3 inhibitor by binding to the Walker B ATP-hydrolysis motif of the NACHT domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref027">27</xref>]. Given that CAPS-related mutations frequently occurs in the NACHT domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref028">28</xref>], it is not surprising that most CAPS-related NLRP3 mutants escape efficient MCC950 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref029">29</xref>]. Therefore, novel NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors effective for diseases including CAPS are sought.</p>
<p>In the present study, we developed an HTS system to identify compounds that regulate the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome using iPSCs generated from a NOMID patient. We established iPS-MLs, which we used as a prototype of NLRP3-activated immune cells, by immortalizing iPSC-derived monocytic progenitor cells. We conducted HTS of approximately 5,000 compounds and validated their inhibitory effect on the secretion of IL-1β.</p>

<title>Functional monocytic cells on feeder- and serum-free monolayer culture</title>
<p>We previously reported that macrophages derived from iPSCs carrying disease-associated mutations in the <italic>NLRP3</italic> gene showed excessive secretion of IL-1β without secondary signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref030">30</xref>]. These macrophages were considered functional based on compatible appearances with primary macrophages under an electron microscope, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and the phagocytosis of Listeria monocytogenes. Macrophages in that study were obtained via a differentiation protocol using OP9 feeder layers. Recently, we have updated our monocyte-macrophage differentiation system to a defined condition without feeder cells and serums, which can also produce functional macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref031">31</xref>]. We therefore examined whether monocytes obtained with the feeder- and serum-free monolayer differentiation system exhibited a similar <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotype.</p>
<p>For this, a NLRP3-mutated iPSC clone derived from a NOMID patient with a somatic NLRP3-Y570C mutation was differentiated into monocytic-lineage cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref030">30</xref>]. Since the NLRP3 mutation was a somatic mosaicism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref032">32</xref>], the NLRP3-non-mutated (wild-type) clone derived from the same donor was used as an isogenic control iPSC line. The differentiated cells showed a mononuclear and slightly foamy appearance, consistent with the appearance of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and expressed the hematopoietic cell marker CD45, the myeloid cell marker CD11b and the monocytic cell marker CD14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>We collected floating monocytic cells from the culture supernatant and evaluated their cytokine production. We used LPS as a priming signal and silica as a secondary inflammasome-activating signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref033">33</xref>]. As expected, the wild-type iPSC-derived monocytes required two sequential signals to secrete IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), while the monocytes carrying the NLRP3 mutation showed excessive IL-1β secretion without a secondary signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Both clones showed robust secretion of IL-6, confirming the appropriate downstream signal transduction of LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Overall, the monocytic cells differentiated under feeder- and serum-free condition showed the abnormal IL-1β secretion associated with the <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotype of NOMID.</p>

<title>Establishment of iPS-MLs from monocytic progenitor cells</title>
<p>We next established an iPS-ML line from the iPSC-derived monocytic cells. For this, we recovered monocytic lineage cells and introduced lentiviral vectors encoding <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>BMI1</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref013">13</xref>]. After 7–10 days culture in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), the cells started to continuously proliferate in an exponential manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The iPS-MLs showed a small mononuclear appearance consistent with the appearance of monocytic-lineage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The integration of transgenes into the genome of iPS-MLs was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The iPS-MLs expressed CD45, CD11b and CD14, similar to the original iPSC-derived monocytic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Karyotype analysis of the iPS-ML demonstrated that most of the cells maintain normal karyotype except for some normal variations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237030.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Because monocytes are heterogeneous progenitor cells that can differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref034">34</xref>], they might be composed of a heterogeneous population, potentially making their cytokine production insufficient. We therefore compared the cytokine profiles of iPS-MLs and terminally-differentiated iPS-ML-derived macrophages. The iPS-MLs carrying a NLRP3 mutation (NOMID-MLs) were differentiated into macrophages (ML-MPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Since ML-MPs produced an increased amount of IL-1β and IL-6 compared with NOMID-MLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>) and showed less variability than iPSC-derived monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g002">Fig 2H</xref>), we decided to use ML-MPs to construct our HTS.</p>

<title>Establishment of an HTS platform using ML-MPs</title>
<p>To establish our HTS system, we differentiated NOMID-MLs into ML-MPs and disseminated them onto 384-well plates. We added the compounds at the same time as when we disseminated the cells into the culture wells. Then the ML-MPs were cultured with appropriate concentrations of compounds for 4 hours in order for the cells to firmly adhere to the plate surface and they were stimulated with LPS for another 18 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). After incubation, the supernatant was collected, and the relative concentrations of cytokines were measured using a homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay. In this protocol, a caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CHO, specifically inhibited the secretion of IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, which inhibits the NF-κB pathway by blocking the degradation of IκB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref035">35</xref>], decreased the production of both IL-1β and IL-6 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These data proved the specificity of the HTS system. We also evaluated the inhibitory effect of MCC950. MCC950 inhibited the secretion of IL-1β with an approximate IC<sub>50</sub> at 2 μM without inhibiting the secretion of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Overall, the iPS-ML-based cytokine assay in combination with the HTRF system successfully detected the inhibitory effect of previously reported compounds, proving the application of our system to HTS.</p>

<title>HTS using annotated compounds</title>
<p>To identify compounds that inhibit the activation of mutant NLRP3, we next performed HTS using 4,825 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs and compounds with known bioactivity. To evaluate the quality of the assay system, the Z'-factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref036">36</xref>] and signal/background (S/B) ratio of each plate were calculated using the data from DMSO controls with or without stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237030.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Regarding IL-1β, the Z'-factor and S/B ratio were consistently high for each 384-well plate (Z’-factor 0.77±0.03 and S/B ratio 8.98±0.28; mean±SE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Since a Z'-factor over 0.5 indicates an excellent assay, these data proved the appropriateness of our HTS system. The Z’-factor and S/B ratio for IL-6 were slightly lower than those for IL-1β (Z’-factor 0.47±0.07 and S/B ratio 4.29±0.14).</p>
<p>In the first screening, we assessed the inhibitory effects of all compounds influencing cytokine secretion at 1 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237030.s004">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237030.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). We first selected the 238 compounds that induced a more than 30% reduction in IL-1β secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Of these, the 109 compounds that also nonspecifically inhibited or enhanced IL-6 secretion were excluded. We adopted a more relaxed criterion for IL-6 modulators, because the Z’-factors of the IL-6 assay were lower than those of the IL-1β assay. We also excluded duplicate compounds and known steroids with broad anti-inflammatory effects. For the remaining 81 compounds, we evaluated the reproducibility of the inhibitory effects at 5 different dose. Twelve compounds showed IC<sub>50</sub> values at less than 10 μM and predominant IL-1β inhibition at least at two different doses. Finally, seven compounds consistently showed predominant IL-1β inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). All seven compounds have previously been reported to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref040">40</xref>], indicating their inhibitory effects on both wild-type and mutant cells.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Validation of hit compounds with primary human cells</title>
<p>We also wondered if the effect of these compounds could be recapitulated in primary human cells. We used primary peripheral blood mononuculear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy volunteers for the validation. To obtain prompt IL-1β secretion from non-mutant cells, we stimulated the PBMCs with LPS and ATP. Compounds modulating the activity of HSP90 (17-AAG and herbimycin A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref041">41</xref>]) showed a selective inhibitory effect on IL-1β secretion comparable to the effects seen in ML-MPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g004">Fig 4</xref>). On the other hand, the remaining compounds aside from the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK inhibited both IL-1β and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237030.g004">Fig 4</xref>), indicating that they had off-target effects or their IL-1β inhibitory effects were nonspecific.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We established a disease-associated phenotypic HTS system for NOMID using iPS-MLs. Our HTS platform showed a stable Z’-factor and S/B ratio for the amount of IL-1β. To avoid false positives such as nonspecific inhibitors and cytotoxic compounds, we also measured the amount of IL-6, an inflammasome-independent cytokine. We identified 7 compounds as predominant inhibitors of IL-1β secretion from among 4,825 candidates. The compounds identified here have already been reported as inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasome, proving the validity of our strategy. Screening a larger number of compounds may help identify novel and more specific compounds.</p>
<p>We could efficiently immortalize monocytic progenitor cells derived from human iPSCs. Moreover, these iPS-MLs could differentiate into terminally differentiated macrophages (ML-MPs), as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237030.ref042">42</xref>]. ML-MPs showed enhanced cytokine secretion and therefore were deemed suitable for HTS. In this manner, the financial and labor costs of HTS can be dramatically decreased. Our strategy can be applied to other immunological disorders in which monocyte-macrophage-lineage cells play critical pathological roles. In addition, the immortalization of iPSC-derived hematopoietic cells for HTS can be expanded to other hematopoietic disorders. One concern associated with the immortalization of monocytic cells is that the immortalization can affect the characteristics of the cells, especially regarding the cell cycle and death, which may affect the immunological functions. To avoid any potential changes in the cellular phenotype, we first expanded the iPS-MLs, generated a larger number of frozen stocks, and then used the same passage number of the stocks for a series of HTS sessions.</p>
<p>Modulating the function of the inflammasome by small compounds is a promising frontier for controlling diseases associated with inflammasome-mediated chronic inflammation. Some compounds, such as MCC950, have already been shown to be markedly effective without any significant side effects in animal models. Nevertheless, identifying more candidates to modulate NLRP3 inflammasome is desirable, as MCC950 inefficiently inhibits CAPS-related NLRP3 mutants. Interestingly, we identified several compounds effective in mutant cells that were previously reported to inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, indicating that the activation of mutant NLRP3 shares activating signals to some degree with wild-type NLRP3. However, several compounds that exerted predominantly IL-1β inhibitory effects on mutant cells were nonselective on PBMCs, which could be explained by off-target effects or false positives. Off-target effects including cytotoxicity could be the result of a higher sensitivity by PBMCs to the true positives. The clear reason is difficult to elucidate, however, because of the heterogeneity of the PBMC population. On the other hand, iPS-MLs consist of relatively homogenous cell populations and may therefore be more useful than primary cells in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. As for nonspecific inhibitors and false positives in HTS, the upregulation of certain signaling pathways irrelevant to the inflammasome in iPS-MLs might be one cause. Cytotoxic compounds may also suppress cytokine secretion in a non-specific manner. Additionally, our HTS system relies on the amount of secreted cytokines, which can vary between cells and only indirectly describes the inflammasome activity. Thus, a combination of measuring the cytotoxicity and direct detection of the inflammasome activity should improve the accuracy of our HTS system.</p>
<p>To conclude, although phenotypic screenings have been performed with various cell types differentiated from human PSCs, the number of screenings with immune cells is still limited. Our HTS system provides a large number of functional monocytic lineage cells and a versatile platform for compound screening to modify disease-associated phenotypes. Therefore, it can be used to screen candidate compounds for the treatment of congenital immunological disorders associated with monocytic lineage cells.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: In this manuscript, Ryosuke Seki et al. reported that NOMID patient-derived pluripotent stem cells were employed to immune cell differentiation, especially for macrophages. Based on the feeder- and serum- free differentiation protocol, the differentiated macrophages exhibited mature phenotype, the activated macrophages with IL-1β and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, these activated macrophages could be used for high-throughput screening of 4825 compounds functioned as IL-1β inhibitor. And this manuscript could be published after the following modifications:</p>
<p>Major modification:</p>
<p>(1) In this manuscript, based on the feeder- and serum- free differentiation protocol, the author prepared monocytic progenitor cells. They performed May-Giemsa and flow analysis these macrophages, but there may need more characterization of the macrophage cells, for example, morphology under phase-contrast condition, and phagocytosis and cholesterol efflux function analysis.</p>
<p>(2) For the iPS-ML cell line, they were prepared through gene modification of iPSC-derived monocytic cells by lentiviral vectors. After the gene modification, there need supplementary characterization to support the successful gene modification. And the karyotyping for the engineered cells should be performed.</p>
<p>(3) During the HTS performance, the ML-MPs were treated with various compounds for 4 hours prior to the treatment of LPS, so the authors should explain why they treat the cells with various compounds for 4 hours.</p>
<p>(4) At the Result part, the authors should make more description on the “Validation of hit compounds with primary human cells”.</p>
<p>(5). The authors should unify the reference format in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this manuscript, the authors developed an HTS platform to screen the small molecule which could be the potential treatment of NOMID patients. I have several concerns before publishing this work:</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>1. The author immortalized an iPSC derived ML cells to reduce the cost and variability of the differentiation. Then I think that even a more straightforward way should be like immortalize the ML cells harvested from the NOMID patients. How do you compare these two strategies, given that iPSC derived ML cells are immature and less functional compared to the adult cells?</p>
<p>2. Why monocytes are non-ML instead of ML in fig.2h</p>
<p>3. During the screening, the authors didn’t rule out the effect of drug cytotoxicity. The decreased secretion could be due to the cell numbers decrease.</p>
<p>4. In figure 4, the authors used PBMC from the healthy donor to validate the hits. However, in figure 1c&amp;d, the authors showed that the WT cells is less responsive to LPS alone. The authors should use patient derived PBMC to validate.</p>
<p>Minor concerns:</p>
<p>1. In general, the quality of figure is not good, especially the figure 3.</p>

<p>Response to reviewers</p>
<p>Reviewers' comments:</p>
<p>Reviewer #1</p>
<p>Major modification:</p>
<p>(1) In this manuscript, based on the feeder- and serum- free differentiation protocol, the author prepared monocytic progenitor cells. They performed May-Giemsa and flow analysis these macrophages, but there may need more characterization of the macrophage cells, for example, morphology under phase-contrast condition, and phagocytosis and cholesterol efflux function analysis.</p>
<p>Author’s comment:</p>
<p>As the reviewer pointed out, the functional characterization of iPSC-derived macrophages is important. We previously confirmed the macrophages obtained from the same iPSC clones have phagocytic activity and similar appearance in electron microscopy as primary cells (Tanaka, Blood 2012). Although the differentiation protocol for macrophages is slightly different from that used in the current study, the current differentiation protocol can also induce functional macrophages based on previous cytokine and chemotaxis analyses (Yanagimachi, PLoS ONE 2013). We modified the first paragraph of the Results section accordingly. Therefore, in this study, we focused on whether the differentiated monocytic cells had the disease-relevant phenotype.</p>
<p>(2) For the iPS-ML cell line, they were prepared through gene modification of iPSC-derived monocytic cells by lentiviral vectors. After the gene modification, there need supplementary characterization to support the successful gene modification. And the karyotyping for the engineered cells should be performed.</p>
<p>Author’s comment:</p>
<p>We performed karyotyping of the iPS-MLs in the revised manuscript (see S1 Table).</p>
<p>(3) During the HTS performance, the ML-MPs were treated with various compounds for 4 hours prior to the treatment of LPS, so the authors should explain why they treat the cells with various compounds for 4 hours.</p>
<p>Author’s comment:</p>
<p>In our protocol, we added compounds when the cells are disseminated into the culture wells. However, before LPS stimulation, we had to wait 4 hours until all the cells were firmly attached to the culture wells. We added an explanation to page 15, lines 192-195 of our revised manuscript with track changes.</p>
<p>(4) At the Result part, the authors should make more description on the “Validation of hit compounds with primary human cells”.</p>
<p>Author’s comment:</p>
<p>We modified the section “Validation of hit compounds with primary human cells” in the Results to include more description. We also modified the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p>
<p>(5). The authors should unify the reference format in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Author’s comment:</p>
<p>We unified the format.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this manuscript, the authors developed an HTS platform to screen the small molecule which could be the potential treatment of NOMID patients. I have several concerns before publishing this work:</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>1. The author immortalized an iPSC derived ML cells to reduce the cost and variability of the differentiation. Then I think that even a more straightforward way should be like immortalize the ML cells harvested from the NOMID patients. How do you compare these two strategies, given that iPSC derived ML cells are immature and less functional compared to the adult cells?</p>
<p>Author’s comment:</p>
<p>As the reviewer wondered, generating immortalized macrophages from the primary blood samples of NOMID patients can be an alternative. However, there are several problems with this approach. First, current gene sets for generating iPS-MLs fail to immortalize primary macrophages (personal communication with Dr. Satoru Senju, Kumamoto University). Second, since NLRP3 mutations in NOMID patients are often low-level somatic mosaicism (Saito, Blood 2008), it is difficult to separate mutant and wild-type cells from patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells. As the reviewer mentioned, the iPS-MLs were relatively immature. However, they could still be differentiated into terminally differentiated macrophages (ML-MPs) that possess sufficient ability for cytokine secretion. Therefore, in this study, we used iPS-MLs for the HTS. We believe our data proved that the iPS-ML-based HTS can be a useful platform for seeking candidate compounds for immune disorders. </p>
<p>2. Why monocytes are non-ML instead of ML in fig.2h</p>
<p>Author’s comment:</p>
<p>ML in the study means an immortalized cell line established from iPSC-derived monocytes. “Monocytes” in Fig 2h indicates differentiated monocytes from iPSCs (not primary). To avoid confusion, we modified the labels in the figure.</p>
<p>3. During the screening, the authors didn’t rule out the effect of drug cytotoxicity. The decreased secretion could be due to the cell numbers decrease.</p>
<p>Author’s comment:</p>
<p>We agree that cytotoxicity may affect the results of the screening. Since we expected that cytotoxic compounds would reduce the levels of both IL-1β and IL-6, we selectively picked up compounds that selectively inhibited IL-1β secretion, which could also exclude false positives to some extent. Indeed, measuring cytotoxicity is helpful for the hit validation. However, in our current study, we are focusing on the construction and validation of the iPS-ML-based HTS system, which could be a novel platform for identifying therapeutic candidate compounds for immune disorders, and identified several previously reported compounds, which demonstrated the validity of system. If we identify undefined compounds in the future, we must evaluate their cytotoxicity, as the reviewer pointed out. We added some discussion about this point in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p>
<p>4. In figure 4, the authors used PBMC from the healthy donor to validate the hits. However, in figure 1c&amp;d, the authors showed that the WT cells is less responsive to LPS alone. The authors should use patient derived PBMC to validate.</p>
<p>Author’s comment:</p>
<p>Thank you for pointing out the ambiguity of our statement. In the case of WT-PBMCs, prompt cytokine secretion was observed by adding LPS and ATP. We actually used this stimulation but failed to describe the condition in the results and figure legends. In the revised manuscript, we added the appropriate description in the results and legend of Fig 4. Using this condition, we could assay with PBMCs sufficiently.</p>
<p>Minor concerns:</p>
<p>1. In general, the quality of figure is not good, especially the figure 3.</p>
<p>Author’s comment:</p>
<p>We improved Figs 3 and 4 and deleted Fig 3h, the list of hit compounds with data from the first screening, because the data are listed in S2 Table.</p>
