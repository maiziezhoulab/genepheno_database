<abstract>
<p>CC2D1A and CC2D1B belong to the evolutionary conserved Lgd protein family with members in all multi-cellular animals. Several functions such as centrosomal cleavage, involvement in signalling pathways, immune response and synapse maturation have been described for CC2D1A. Moreover, the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> ortholog Lgd was shown to be involved in the endosomal trafficking of the Notch receptor and other transmembrane receptors and physically interacts with the ESCRT-III component Shrub/CHMP4. To determine if this function is conserved in mammals we generated and characterized <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> and <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> conditional knockout mice. While <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> deficient mice displayed no obvious phenotype, we found that <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient mice as well as conditional mutants that lack CC2D1A only in the nervous system die shortly after birth due to respiratory distress. This finding confirms the suspicion that the breathing defect is caused by the central nervous system. However, an involvement in centrosomal function could not be confirmed in <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient MEF cells. To analyse an influence on Notch signalling, we generated intestine specific <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> mutant mice. These mice did not display any alterations in goblet cell number, proliferating cell number or expression of the Notch reporter Hes1-emGFP, suggesting that CC2D1A is not required for Notch signalling. However, our EM analysis revealed that the average size of endosomes of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> mutant cells, but not <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> mutant cells, is increased, indicating a defect in endosomal morphogenesis. We could show that CC2D1A and its interaction partner CHMP4B are localised on endosomes in MEF cells, when the activity of the endosomal protein VPS4 is reduced. This indicates that CC2D1A cycles between the cytosol and the endosomal membrane. Additionally, in rescue experiments in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, CC2D1A and CC2D1B were able to functionally replace Lgd. Altogether our data suggest a functional conservation of the Lgd protein family in the ESCRT-III mediated process in metazoans.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The proteins of the Lgd/CC2D1 family are conserved in all multicellular animals. The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> ortholog Lgd is involved in the regulation of signalling receptor degradation via the endosomal pathway. Loss of <italic>lgd</italic> function causes ectopic ligand-independent activation of the Notch signalling pathway due to a defect in the endosomal pathway. For the mammalian proteins no endosomal function has been defined so far. Here, we asked whether the function of Lgd is conserved in mammals with the focus on the question whether its orthologs are also involved in the endosomal pathway and regulation of Notch pathway activity. Therefore, we generated and characterised <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> and <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> conditional knockout mice. We found that the loss of <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> does not lead to an obvious phenotype, while the known lethality of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient newborns is nervous system dependent. In experiments with MEFs isolated from knockout animals we provide evidence that both CC2D1 proteins are involved in the function of the ESCRT-III complex in a similar manner as Lgd in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>. Moreover, we found that the loss of one CC2D1 protein is not sufficient to cause ectopic activation of Notch signalling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>CC2D1A (Coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing protein 1A)/LGD2 and CC2D1B/LGD1 belong to the evolutionary conserved Lgd protein family that is present in the genomes of all metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref001">1</xref>]. Members of this family contain four tandem repeats of the DM14 domain and one C2 domain. The <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> ortholog Lgd (Lethal (2) giant discs) was shown to be involved in the trafficking of the Notch receptor and other transmembrane proteins through the endocytic pathway. Loss of its function results in an ectopic and ligand-independent activation of the Notch pathway in several tissues that leads to over-proliferation of imaginal disc cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref004">4</xref>]. Therefore <italic>lgd</italic> was classified as a hyperplastic tumour suppressor gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref005">5</xref>]. Moreover, its loss causes enhanced activation of the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> BMP signalling pathway (Dpp pathway) during oogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Several rather diverse functions have been described for CC2D1A. It was first identified in a large-scale screen to identify genes that activate the NFκB pathway in HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref007">7</xref>]. Later, the function in the canonical IKK pathway was confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref008">8</xref>]. Additionally, CC2D1A appears to act as a transcriptional repressor of the dopamine receptor gene <italic>DRD2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref009">9</xref>] and the serotonin receptor gene <italic>5-HT1A</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref010">10</xref>]. Likewise, CC2D1B functions as a repressor for the <italic>5-HT1A</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref011">11</xref>]. Moreover, CC2D1A seems to be involved in the regulation of signalling pathways. During EGFR signalling it acts as a scaffold protein to recruit and activate PDK1/Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref012">12</xref>]. In line with this observation is that silencing of <italic>CC2D1A</italic> inhibits growth of EGFR induced lung cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref013">13</xref>]. It is a positive regulator of the cAMP/PKA pathway, where it is required for PKA activation and regulation of PDE4D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref015">15</xref>]. In innate immunity, CC2D1A modulates the TLR3 and TLR4 signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref016">16</xref>] and the RLR pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref017">17</xref>]. Centrosome associated CC2D1A appears to regulate centriole cohesion by preventing premature cleavage in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref018">18</xref>]. However, most of these ascribed diverse functions are based on cell culture experiments and it is not known whether the CC2D1 proteins perform them <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Several mutations in <italic>CC2D1A</italic> are linked to severe forms of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref020">20</xref>]. <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficiency in mice leads to an even severer phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref021">21</xref>]. Mutant mice die postnatally within a few minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref021">21</xref>], hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref015">15</xref>] or within a day after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref017">17</xref>] due to difficulties in breathing. The underlying cause of the defect was suspected to be a defect in maturation of synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref021">21</xref>] or dysregulation of the cAMP/PKA pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref015">15</xref>]. However, the analysis was performed with conventional knockout mice and it remains unclear which mutant tissue contributes to the breathing defect. In contrast to CC2D1A, virtually nothing is known about the function of CC2D1B <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, Lgd physically interacts with Shrub (CHMP4 in mammals), the major subunit of the ESCRT-III complex, which is required for the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) during endosomal maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref022">22</xref>]. ESCRT-III together with four other ESCRT-complexes generates the ILVs in maturing endosomes (MEs), which—as a result—become multivesicular bodies (MVBs). In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, ILV formation is required for the termination of signalling through several signalling pathways, among them the BMP and EGFR-pathways. Moreover, it prevents the ectopic activation of the Notch pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref025">25</xref>]. Whether this is also the case in mammals is not known. The other ESCRT-complexes are termed ESCRT-0, I, II, and the VPS4 complex. ESCRT-0—II act in sequence to concentrate ubiquitinated cargo and to assemble ESCRT-III at the sites of cargo concentration. ESCRT-III consists of four subunits (CHMP6, CHMP4, CHMP3 and CHMP2) as well as several auxiliary factors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref026">26</xref>]). Three <italic>CHMP4</italic> genes are present in humans, termed <italic>CHMP4A</italic>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. Mice lack <italic>CHMP4A</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref027">27</xref>]. CHMP6 is activated by ESCRT-II and induces the polymerisation of CHMP4s into a filament that is capped by CHMP3 and CHMP2. The filament is disassembled by the AAA ATPase VPS4 into monomers during vesicle abscission. CHMP4 monomers exist in a “closed” inactive form in the cytosol and can be recruited to the limiting membrane for another round of polymerisation. Thus, CHMP4s cycle between a monomeric closed form in the cytosol and an “open” polymerised form at the endosomal membrane. The cycling is the reason for the finding that the majority of CHMP4s are located in the cytosol upon antibody staining. Only if the function of Vps4p is abolished, ESCRT-III proteins strongly accumulate at the endosome and can be detected there in antibody staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Although clearly involved in endosomal trafficking in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, no definite link to endocytic trafficking has been established for the mammalian orthologs of Lgd, CC2D1A and CC2D1B. Rescue experiments in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> suggested functional similarities, since murine CC2D1A and CC2D1B were able to replace Lgd during wing development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref001">1</xref>]. However, it turned out later that the rescue assay was not suitable to test the ability of the Lgd orthologs to functionally replace Lgd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref022">22</xref>]. Another assays suggested that down-regulation of <italic>CC2D1A</italic> in HeLa cells weakly decreased EGF and TF endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref029">29</xref>]. A yeast two-hybrid screen revealed an interaction between CC2D1A and CHMP4 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref030">30</xref>]. This interaction was further refined by Martinelli et al. by showing that CC2D1A might regulate CHMP4B polymerisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref031">31</xref>]. The same group could also show that the over-expression of CC2D1A inhibits CHMP4B dependent HIV-1-budding in cells. Correspondingly, siRNA mediated depletion of <italic>CC2D1A</italic> increased HIV-1-budding under certain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref032">32</xref>]. Taken together, these experiments suggest that mammalian members of the Lgd gene family might also participate in the regulation of the endocytic pathway.</p>
<p>Like in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, the Notch signalling pathway plays a pivotal role during development and tissue homeostasis in mammals (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref033">33</xref>]). In the gut epithelium, the role of the Notch pathway is particularly well understood. It is required for the maintenance of proliferation of intestinal stem cells and for the differentiation of the progenitor cells in the crypt. Inhibition of Notch signalling results in the arrest of crypt cell proliferation and guides all crypt cells into a goblet cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref034">34</xref>]. Conversely, ectopic Notch signalling in the embryonic and adult intestine leads to ectopic proliferation of crypt progenitor cells and impairs goblet and enteroendocrine cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>The Notch signalling pathway is activated through direct binding of its ligands (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref037">37</xref>]). The binding elicits the separation of the intracellular domain of the receptor (NICD) through two proteolytic cleavages by ADAM10 and the γ-secretase complex, which subsequently travels to the nucleus and associates with the CSL transcription factor to activate expression of target genes, such as <italic>Hes1</italic>.</p>
<p>Here, we analyse the role of CC2D1A and CC2D1B in mouse with the focus on the questions whether CC2D1 proteins are involved in the endocytic pathway and the regulation of the activity of Notch signalling as observed for Lgd in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>. For this purpose, we have generated conditional knockout mouse models for both genes and analysed their function. We show for the first time that the postnatal death of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient mice is caused by tissue-specific absence of the gene function in the nervous system. In contrast, <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> does not appear to be essential for embryogenesis or survival or fertility of mice. Furthermore, we find that Notch signalling is not altered in the intestine of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> or <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> deficient mice compared to wild type. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mutant animals do not show detectable alterations in the endocytic trafficking and degradation of the Notch receptor. We observe that CC2D1A, like <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> Lgd, locates in the cytosol, but accumulates at MEs when VPS4 function is reduced. This finding, together with cell fractionation data, indicates that CC2D1 proteins are temporally associated with the ME. EM analysis of MEFs reveals an increase of the size of the endosome in <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient cells, indicating a defect in endosomal morphogenesis. In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, expression of CC2D1A and CC2D1B under the control of the endogenous <italic>lgd</italic> promoter can rescue the loss of function of <italic>lgd</italic>. Altogether, the results provide strong evidence that the endosomal function of the Lgd protein is conserved in mammals.</p>

<italic>Cc2d1b</italic> is not essential during embryogenesis or survival and fertility of adult mice</title>
<p>To characterise the function of CC2D1B <italic>in vivo</italic> we generated a <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> conditional null allele by breeding the KOMP mouse strain C57BL/6N-<italic>Cc2d1b</italic>
<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup> with a Flp deleter strain to generate a <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> allele where exon 3 is flanked by loxP sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Cre-mediated recombination deletes the floxed exon, leading to a frame-shift mutation and a premature stop codon after 102bp of missense sequence. The predicted truncated protein consists of 56 amino acids and contains no known domains. We confirmed <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> deficiency by genotyping PCR, RT-PCR and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref>). For immunoblotting, we generated a polyclonal antibody directed against the N-Terminus of CC2D1B (aa 1–253). The truncated protein was not detectable, suggesting low affinity of the polyclonal antibody to epitopes in the truncated protein, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or instability of the truncated CC2D1B protein. Nevertheless, a putative dominant negative effect of such a fragment is highly unlikely as the fragment lacks all known functional domains. The genotype distribution of offspring from heterozygous breedings matched the expected Mendelian ratio (n = 30; wild type = 6, heterozygous = 17, homozygous = 7; χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.59, p = 0.74). Homozygous animals are viable and fertile with no obvious abnormalities and were kept as a homozygous line. In summary, loss of <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> function does not lead to an obvious phenotype under the used conditions.</p>

<p>One possibility why the loss of <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> function has no detectable effect on viability of mice is that the expression of CC2D1A is up-regulated to compensate for its loss. We tested this possibility in Western blots and found that the expression of CCD1A was unaffected in <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> deficient MEFs, instead of elevated as would be expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005749.s001">S1A and S1C Fig</xref>). Conversely, the loss of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> caused a reduction of the CC2D1B level to approximately 60% of the wild type level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005749.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>; see below for <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> mutant cells).

<title>Loss of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> in the nervous system results in perinatal death</title>
<p>An open question is whether a defect in the brain is responsible for the breathing defect that causes the perinatal death of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref021">21</xref>].

Extensive breeding of <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic>

<sup>tg/+</sup>,<italic>Cc2d1a</italic>
<sup>flox/flox</sup> animals. As the genotype distribution of conditional <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> mutant embryos up to E18.5 was normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005749.s009">S2 Table</xref>) we had a closer look at newborn animals and compared <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient animals with Nestin-Cre conditional <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> mutants. We monitored five births for both lines. Mutant animals were born in expected Mendelian ratios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005749.s010">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005749.s011">S4</xref> Tables). Eight out of eight <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient animals failed to breathe and turned cyanotic after birth, while this was the case in only four out of twelve brain specific <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Nevertheless, all brain specific <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> mutants died within 12 hours after birth, as no animal was observed the morning after giving birth probably due to the mother cannibalizing dead litter.</p>
<p>The slight difference in the time of death between the full knockout animals and the brain specific mutants might suggest that the reason for the perinatal death is not entirely nervous system dependent or that the background of mice influences the time of death. The latter is supported by the fact that <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient mice of a C57BL/6J background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref017">17</xref>] die within one day after birth while <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient mice of 129/Sv background die within minutes after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref021">21</xref>]. As <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> mice in this study were derived from a C57BL/6N x 129Sv hybrid line backcrossed several generations to C57BL/6N and the Nestin-Cre animals are of a C57BL/6J genetic background, the observed difference might be strain-dependent. To test this possibility we crossed <italic>Cc2d1a</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup> animals with C57BL/6J wild type or C57BL/6J-<italic>Nestin-Cre</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup> mice to generate <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> mutants with the same background as the Nestin-Cre conditional mutants. We monitored three births with five <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005749.s012">S5 Table</xref>). Five out of five mutant animals displayed no breathing after birth and turned cyanotic like the mutants on the original background, suggesting that the analysed backgrounds do not influence the time of death. Taken together, these results indicate that the loss of CC2D1A in the nervous system is sufficient to induce the full knockout phenotype (namely the perinatal death due to respiratory distress), even though with incomplete penetrance.</p>

<title>CC2D1A appears not to regulate centrosome function or mitotic events in murine cells</title>
<p>CC2D1A was recently described to localise to centrosomes and regulate centriole cohesion in HeLa cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of CC2D1A in these cells was shown to cause formation of multipolar spindles accompanied by separase dependent centriole splitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref018">18</xref>].

To generate a specific polyclonal CC2D1A antibody we immunized guinea pigs with a murine antigen that comprises the 4th DM14 domain (aa 481 to 640) fused to the extended C-Terminus of CC2D1A (aa 788 to 943) that is absent in CC2D1B.

<p>It is reported that CC2D1A co-localises with the centrosome marker γ-Tubulin in HeLa cells and its depletion causes an increase in the mitotic index and a reduction in the number of viable cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref018">18</xref>]. To confirm this finding in primary murine cells we stained MEF cells with anti-γ-Tubulin and anti-CC2D1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). We did not find significant co-localisation of γ-Tubulin and CC2D1A. However, when we over-expressed human CC2D1A-dsRed we found co-localisation with γ-Tubulin in several cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting that CC2D1A proteins do localise close to the centrosomes upon overexpression. In contrast, human EGFP-CC2D1B does not co-localise with γ-Tubulin upon over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>We did not observe a significant difference in the mitotic indices of wild type (0.02%, 974 cells) and <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient (0.01%, 1478 cells) MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Finally, a cell proliferation assay did not reveal significant variation between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).

<title>CC2D1A and CC2D1B appear to cycle between the cytosol and the limiting membrane of maturing endosomes</title>
<p>To determine the subcellular localisation of CC2D1A, we stained wild type MEFs using our specific CC2D1A antibody together with organelle markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005749.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We found that CC2D1A is distributed in punctate structures in the cytosol. We could not associate these punctae with distinct organelles, indicating that CC2D1A is not localised on the ER, the Golgi or endosomes but accumulate in unidentified punctae.</p>
<p>Moreover, we found little co-localisation of CC2D1A and CHMP4B and neither of them could be detected on RAB7 positive late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g007">Fig 7A and 7A`</xref>). CC2D1 proteins have a C2 binding domain that has been shown to be able to bind phospholipids present in endosomal membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref004">4</xref>]. To test whether CC2D1A and CC2D1B can associate with membranes in general, we performed a cell fractionation assay. We detected CC2D1A and CC2D1B in the cytosolic as well as in the membrane fraction, in contrast to control proteins, which were correctly restricted to only one fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005749.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). This result indicates that a fraction of CC2D1A and also CC2D1B is associated with membranes. CHMP4 proteins cycle between the endosomal membrane and the cytosol. An endosomal localisation of the CHMP4 yeast ortholog Snf7 could only be observed in the absence of Vps4p function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref028">28</xref>]. Loss of Vps4p leads to an accumulation of ESCRT-III on endosomal membranes and disrupts proper ILV formation. We wondered whether this is also the case for CHMP4 proteins in mammals and, since CC2D1 proteins physically interact with CHMP4 proteins (see below), whether CC2D1A also accumulates at the endosomal membrane upon reduction of VPS4 function. The mammalian genome contains two <italic>Vps4</italic> genes, <italic>Vps4a</italic> and <italic>Vps4b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref045">45</xref>].

To analyse the influence of the two mammalian orthologs VPS4A and VPS4B on subcellular localisation of CC2D1A, we generated MEFs that are double heterozygous for <italic>Vps4a</italic> and <italic>Vps4b</italic>. Strikingly, we observed dramatically enlarged LAMP1 positive MEs/lysosomes in these cells, although the corresponding mice were healthy and displayed no detectable phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Moreover, CHMP4B accumulated on the enlarged MEs of the double heterozygous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g007">Fig 7B and 7B`</xref>). This indicates that a reduction of VPS4 function results in the accumulation of CHMP4 proteins on the endosomal membrane also in mammals. Importantly, also CC2D1A accumulated on these CHMP4B/LAMP1 positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g007">Fig 7B and 7B`</xref>). In a complementary experiment, we over-expressed a dominant negative VPS4B (VPS4B<sup>E235Q</sup>) that lacks its ATPase activity leading to aberrant endosomal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref046">46</xref>]. Indeed, we could confirm that expression of VPS4B<sup>E235Q</sup> in wild type MEFs leads to the formation of enlarged endosomal structures while expression of normal VPS4B did not lead to any changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005749.s005">S5B and S5B` Fig</xref>). Moreover, FK2, a marker for ubiquitinated proteins, strongly labelled the VPS4B<sup>E235Q</sup> induced aberrant MEs, suggesting that the removal of CHMP4 from the endosomal membrane is impaired.

These results indicate that CC2D1A might function at the endosome and cycles between the cytosol and the endosomal membrane, just like its interaction partner CHMP4B. They also indicate that CC2D1A appears to be removed from the endosomal membrane by VPS4 and suggest that CC2D1A is involved in ESCRT-III function in mammals.</p>

<title>Endogenous interaction between CC2D1A and CHMP4B</title>
<p>So far only <italic>in vitro</italic> data showed physical interactions of CHMP4B with CC2D1A. In order to test whether this can also be observed between the corresponding endogenous proteins in a cell, we performed the proximity ligation assay (PLA). PLA enables the <italic>in situ</italic> detection of endogenous protein protein interactions, using protein specific antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref047">47</xref>]. For the assay, we compared wild type and <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient MEF cells and used our specific CC2D1A antibody in combination with a commercially available CHMP4B antibody. As expected, only few PLA signals were visible in <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient cells (0.6±1.07), confirming the accuracy of the method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In contrast, abundant PLA signals were detected in wild type MEFs (6.47±3.18) indicating that endogenous CC2D1A and CHMP4B interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g008">Fig 8</xref>). To exclude the possibility that CHMP4B and CC2D1A interact in the cytosol randomly by freely diffusing cytosolic proteins we performed PLA with CHMP4B and the cytosolic protein PGK1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005749.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Again, we could detect a clear interaction only in the control and not between CHMP4B and PGK1 (5.61±2.39 for CHMP4B with CC2D1A compared to 0.64± 1.01 for CHMP4B with PGK1). Taken together, these experiments further support the assumption that CC2D1A and possibly also CC2D1B are involved in ESCRT-III mediated events.</p>

<title>Deficiency of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> leads to enlarged endo/lysosomes</title>
<p>To further elucidate a function of CC2D1 proteins in endosome maturation we analysed the endo/lysosomal compartments of wild type and mutant MEFs with the transmission electron microscope (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g009">Fig 9</xref>).

<title>Human CC2D1A and CC2D1B can replace the function of Lgd in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>
</title>
<p>In order to obtain further evidence for the conservation of the function of the Lgd proteins in metazoans, we asked whether and to what extent the two mammalian orthologs of Lgd could replace the loss of function of <italic>lgd</italic> in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>. Since it turned out that rescue experiments with the Gal4/UAS system are not suitable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref022">22</xref>], our previously reported results are not meaningful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref001">1</xref>]. We therefore here used an assay that we have later developed for the structure-function analysis of Lgd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref022">22</xref>]. In short, human CC2D1A and CC2D1B were cloned behind the <italic>lgd</italic> promoter (lgdP) and the constructs were inserted into the same landing site to neutralise position effects on expression. Thus, CC2D1A and CC2D1B are expressed at endogenous level and similar to each other. This allowed the direct comparison of the effects caused by the two constructs.</p>
<p>Loss of <italic>lgd</italic> function in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> results in over-proliferation of the imaginal discs, which are epithelial monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g010">Fig 10A and 10B</xref>). Moreover, target genes of Notch such as <italic>wingless</italic> (<italic>wg</italic>) are ectopically expressed, indicating that the Notch pathway is ectopically activated ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref002">2</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g010">Fig 10A and 10B</xref>). We found that both orthologs could rescue the <italic>lgd</italic> mutant phenotype, albeit to different extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g010">Fig 10C–10F</xref>). <italic>lgdP</italic>-<italic>CC2D1B</italic> completely rescued the mutant, even if only one copy was present in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g010">Fig 10C</xref>). We obtained normal looking fertile flies. In the case of <italic>lgdP</italic>-<italic>CC2D1A</italic> only two copies present resulted in a complete rescue of the imaginal disc phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005749.g010">Fig 10D–10F</xref>). However, in this case the fully differentiated flies failed to hatch. These experiments reveal functional differences between the human CC2D1 proteins for the first time and indicate that CC2D1B is more similar to Lgd than CC2D1A. Nevertheless, both orthologs can rescue the <italic>lgd</italic> mutant phenotype to different extent, indicating a significant overlap in their function.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report the first characterisation of the Lgd homologue CC2D1B in a mammalian system. We found that it is not an essential gene in mouse, since its loss of function results in no detectable phenotype. We confirmed the previously reported finding that the loss of function of its paralogue CC2D1A results in postnatal death due to failure to breathe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref021">21</xref>]. We here extend this finding by showing that the postnatal death is mostly caused by loss of its function in the nervous system. This result extends previous studies, that suggested either an involvement of CC2D1A in neuronal differentiation and brain development via the regulation of the Protein Kinase A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref015">15</xref>] or in functional maturation of synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, a defect in certain neurons or glia cells is probably the cause of the breathing defect and the resulting death of mutant animals.</p>
<p>We failed to find evidence for an involvement of the CC2D1 proteins in cell division. Instead <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> or <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> mutants develop normally and MEFs harvested from these homozygous mutants do not show a cell division phenotype nor are they multi-nucleated as has been found for HeLa cells treated with <italic>CC2D1A</italic> specific siRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref018">18</xref>]. This is in agreement with the fact that mutant animals develop until birth with no obvious defects.</p>
<p>In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> the loss of function of <italic>lgd</italic> results in the constitutive ligand-independent activation of Notch in several epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref006">6</xref>]. In order to test whether the loss of one of the orthologs results in ectopic Notch activation in mammals, we analysed their function in the epithelium of the gut of mice. In contrast to <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, we did not find any evidence for ectopic activation of the Notch signalling pathway if one of the two orthologs is inactivated. The number or distribution of goblet cells did not change and the expression of the Notch activity reporter Hes1-emGFP and endogenous <italic>Hes1</italic> was unaffected upon loss of function of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> or <italic>Cc2d1b</italic>. This suggests that the individual loss of the genes does not result in uncontrolled activation of the Notch pathway in mammals. Notch signalling is critical for T cell development (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref054">54</xref>]). In <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient embryos the development and function of thymocytes is not impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref021">21</xref>] further supporting the notion that Notch signalling is not altered in the absence of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> alone.</p>
<p>It might still be possible that weak ectopic activation of the Notch pathway occurs in mutant mice, but this activation is too weak to be detected with our test systems and to manifest itself in phenotypes in the gut epithelium. However, it is possible that this weak activity has effects in other tissues, such as the brain. Indeed, it has been reported that CC2D1A over-expression leads to weak Notch reporter activity in HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref020">20</xref>]. This weak activation might be responsible for the brain defect, since the Notch pathway is known to regulate neural development and postnatal neurogenesis (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref055">55</xref>]). Moreover, activation of the pathway in cultured neurons changes their dendritic arborisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref057">57</xref>]. Importantly, a similar arborisation defect together with activation of the Notch pathway has been observed upon inactivation of Shrub, the ortholog of the CHMP4s in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref027">27</xref>]. However, CC2D1A was also shown to act as a positive regulator of the cAMP/PKA pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref015">15</xref>] that is known to regulate synaptic plasticity, learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref059">59</xref>] and the NF-κB pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref007">7</xref>] that is involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref060">60</xref>]. Intriguingly, NF-κB activation was shown to be specific to CC2D1A, while CC2D1B could not activate NF-κB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref020">20</xref>] suggesting that the proteins are not functional redundant with regard to NF-κB signalling. These finding could also explain why <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient mice die early while <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> deficient mice display no obvious phenotype.</p>
<p>Our pulse and chase experiment to analyse the endosomal degradation of the human NOTCH1 receptor showed no alterations in wild type and <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> deficient MEFs. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that our method might not be sensitive enough for detection if a slight delay or defect in degradation occurs. The siRNA mediated depletion of <italic>CC2D1A</italic> in HeLa cells, analysed with high-resolution confocal microscopy and quantitative multiparametric image analysis, detected a decrease in EGF and TF endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref029">29</xref>], supporting a function of CC2D1A in the endocytic pathway. Indeed we found clear evidence for an involvement of CC2D1 proteins in the endocytic pathway: 1. Our EM analysis revealed that the endosomes are enlarged upon loss of <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> function. Importantly, the classification according to size revealed that larger size classes appear in the mutant that are absent in the wild type. This has also been found <italic>lgd</italic> mutant cells in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref053">53</xref>]. 2. We found that a fraction of both CC2D1 proteins is associated with membranes. 3. While CC2D1A is distributed in the cytosol in wild type MEFs, it accumulates on endosomal membranes of <italic>Vps4a</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup>,<italic>Vps4b</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup> double heterozygous MEFs. This relocation is striking and suggests that, like the CHMP4 proteins, CC2D1A and probably also CC2D1B cycles between the cytosol and the limiting membrane of the endosome. It also suggests that both proteins are involved in the function of ESCRT-III. 4. We show that CC2D1A interacts with CHMP4B at endogenous level. This has not been shown for the full-length proteins and especially not under endogenous conditions. Thus, our findings show for the first time that this interaction occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>. 5. We show that both CC2D1 proteins can replace the function of Lgd in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>. In the fly Lgd is evidently involved in endosomal trafficking of transmembrane proteins and both Lgd orthologs can take over this function. Moreover, CC2D1A genetically interacts with the CHMP4 ortholog Shrub in <italic>D</italic>. melanogaster, suggesting that it requires Shrub respectively the CHMP4 orthologs for its function. Interestingly, the rescue ability of both orthologs differed: While the imaginal disc phenotype could be completely rescued by both CC2D1 proteins, only flies expressing CC2D1B were viable and fertile. CC2D1A contains an extended C-Terminus with no putative domains that is missing in Lgd and CC2D1B. This C-terminal extension might be the reason for the poorer rescue ability and might be required for the suggested additional non-redundant functions of CC2D1A in mammals.</p>
<p>Despite the differences in the extent of the rescue, our experiments in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> suggest that CC2D1A and CC2D1B have overlapping functions in the endocytic pathway. Thus, it is likely that functional redundancy among both CC2D1 proteins prevents the formation of a detectable cellular phenotype if only one gene is deleted, especially since we found that both proteins are present in all cells tested. Therefore, it will be necessary to delete both genes to further evaluate their function in the endocytic pathway and Notch pathway regulation. The analysis of these double mutants will illuminate the function of CC2D1A and CC2D1B in mammals.</p>

<title>Generation of a <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> conditional knockout mouse</title>
<p>The <italic>Cc2d1a</italic> targeting vector was generated using the pGK12 vector (Artemis Pharmaceuticals, Köln) which contains a PGK <italic>neomycin</italic> cassette, as a positive selection marker, and the <italic>Herpes Simplex virus thymidine kinase</italic> (TK) gene, as a negative selection marker. The 2.3 kb 5`arm, the deleted area (4kb, exons 7–14) and the 5.0 kb 3`arm were amplified via PCR using BAC-DNA RP23-298K21 (BACPAC Resources, Oakland, USA) as a template and confirmed by sequencing. The 129/B6 F1 hybrid ES cell line v6.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005749.ref061">61</xref>] was electroporated with the <italic>Not</italic>I linearized targeting vector. Using Southern Blot analysis five targeted ES cell clones were identified and injected into blastocysts of CB20 mice and transplanted into pseudopregnant host mothers.

<title>Generation of <italic>Vps4a</italic> and <italic>Vps4b</italic> knockout mice</title>
<p>The C57BL/<italic>Vps4a</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup> heterozygous knockout mouse strain resulted from a conditional <italic>Vps4a</italic> knockout model. Vector construction and targeted knockout strategy was designed together with genOway (Lyon, France), where mice were generated. 129Sv/Pas ES cells were transfected with the targeting construct pVPS4a-KOE1-HR. This vector contains a short (1,9 kb) and a long (5,8 kb) <italic>Vps4a</italic> homology region. Two <italic>Lox</italic>P sites were inserted flanking <italic>Vps4a</italic> exon 2 and exon 3. The positive selection neomycin gene flanked by FRT sites is inserted upstream of exon 2 and the negative selection marker Diphteria Toxin A (DTA) is located downstream from the distal long homology arm at the 3’ end of <italic>Vps4a</italic>. Homologous recombination in ES cells was demonstrated by PCR and Southern blot analysis. After blastocyst injection male chimeras were mated with female Flp-expressing mice (C57BL/6J) to excise the neomycin selection cassette and to generate heterozygous mice carrying the floxed <italic>Vps4a</italic> allele. Breeding floxed <italic>Vps4a</italic> mice with C57BL/6J Cre-expressing mice led to constitutive heterozygous <italic>Vps4a</italic> knockout mice lacking exon 2 and 3. The heterozygous <italic>Vps4a</italic> knockout mice were inbred with C57BL/6 mice for more than 10 generations.</p>
<p>The 129Sv/<italic>Vps4b</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup> is a classical knockout mouse strain that was generated using the targeting construct pVPS4b-KO, where the <italic>Vps4b</italic> exon 1–4 region is replaced by a neomycin-resistance cassette. The negative selection marker DTA is located at the 3’ end of the <italic>Vps4b</italic> homology region. Following homologous recombination in ES cells and blastocyst injection, heterozygous <italic>Vps4b</italic> knockout mice were confirmed by Southern blot analysis and inbred with 129Sv mice for more than 10 generations. This <italic>Vps4b</italic> knockout mouse strain was generated in collaboration with U. Rüther (Düsseldorf).</p>

<title>Generation and purification of antibodies</title>
<p>For the production of a CC2D1B/mLGD1 antibody a murine <italic>Cc2d1b</italic> cDNA fragment (covering amino acids 1–253) was amplified from RIKEN Mouse FANTOM Klon A830039804 with the primers mLGD1-AK-For (5`aaactcgaggcatgccagggccaagacc3`) and mLGD1-AK-Rev (5`aaagcggccgctggctccatggcacaggga3`) and cloned into the GST affinity tag containing vector pGEX-6P-2 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) using <italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I restriction sites. The GST-CC2D1B(1–253) fusion protein was expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and captured by immobilized glutathione. After removal of GST affinity tag by PreScission Protease guinea pigs were immunized with the CC2D1B(1–253) antigen (Cocalico Biologicals Inc.). Serum from the final bleed was further affinity purified with the antigen immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane.</p>
<p>For the production of a CC2D1A/mLGD2 antibody guinea pigs were immunized (Eurogentec s.a.) with a GST tagged antigen that consists of the 4<sup>th</sup> DM14 domain (amino acids 481 to 640) fused to the extended C-Terminus of CC2D1A (amino acids 788 to 943) that is absent in CC2D1B.

In contrast to over-expression of VPS4B, only over-expression of VPS4B<sup>E235Q</sup> led to the formation of enlarged endosomes.
