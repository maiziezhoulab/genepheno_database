<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par14">Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, OMIM ref. 176,270) and Angelman syndrome (AS, OMIM ref. 105,830) are clinically distinct neurogenetic disorders with multiple phenotypic manifestations. PWS patients present with neonatal hypotonia, poor sucking and weak cry in the postnatal period, delayed psychomotor development and hyperphagia in early childhood, severe obesity, short stature and hypogonadism in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; The initial symptoms of AS overlap with a lot of other disorders, and more characteristic features present later in childhood, including microcephaly, severe developmental delay, gait ataxia and/or tremulousness of the limbs, seizures, absent or severely limited speech, and a unique behavior with happy demeanor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Each syndrome occurs with an estimated prevalence of 1:15,000â1:25,000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par15">The two clinically distinct disorders are both caused by genetic alterations in chromosome region 15q11.2âq13. PWS is attributed to deficiencies of paternally expressed genes, usually as the consequence of paternal deletion (65â70%), maternal uniparental disomy (UPD(15)mat, 20â30%), mutations/ deletions of the imprinting centre (2â5%) and a translocation of the imprinting center (&lt;â1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. AS arises from molecular defects including maternal deletion (70â75%), paternal uniparental disomy (UPD(15)pat, 2â7%), <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene mutations (5â10%) and mutations/ deletions of the imprinting centre (3â5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Establishing the molecular mechanism will provide information on possible clinical features, prognosis and recurrence risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec2">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="Sec3">
<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p id="Par16">The study has been approved by Medical Ethics Committee of Guangdong Women and Children Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, their parents or legal guardians (in the case of children under 16). Authors had access to information that could identify individual participants, and the information was anonymized prior to submission. All the procedures performed in the study were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Patients and samples</title>
<p id="Par17">Key Laboratory of Inherited Metabolic Diseases under Health Department of Guangdong Province was set up in Guangdong Women and Children Hospital, and has been served as a tertiary referral centre for the province. The centre provides comprehensive genetic counseling, diagnostic and laboratory service for suspected patients and their families. 290 patients suspected for PWS/AS were referred for further diagnosis and genetic confirmation, and 3041 neonates with initial symptoms of PWS/AS were recommended for the genetic screening. The study cohort of 3331 individuals was recruited from June 2013 to December 2016 under an institutional review board-approved protocol of informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Clinical manifestations</title>
<p id="Par18">Of the 3331 suspected individuals, 3241 were neonates (â¤ 28âdays) presented with hypotonia, poor responsiveness, feeding difficulty and weak cry; 49 were infants (1âmonth to 1âyear of age) demonstrated with hypotonia and delayed psychomotor development; another 39 children (1âyear to 15âyears of age) were referred to the center because of some further characteristic behaviors of PWS or AS. Given that both PWS and AS have clinical overlaps with other diseases, it is difficult to diagnose them solely based on clinical manifestations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">
<title>Genetic diagnosis</title>
<p id="Par19">Blood samples were obtained from all participants and genomic DNA was isolated from the whole blood by standard procedures using the DNA isolation mini kit (ZEESAN, Xiamen, China) and Lab-Aid 820 nucleic acid extraction instrument (ZEESAN, Xiamen, China).</p>
<sec id="Sec7">
<title>Methylation-specific PCR analysis</title>
<p id="Par20">Genomic DNA was treated with sulfite using the CpGenome Turbo Bisulfite Modification Kit (Millipore, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. The imprinting gene SNRPN containing a potential imprinting center for a chromosome domain on chr15q11â13. Almost all CpG dinucleotides are methylated on the maternal chromosome and unmethylated on the paternal chromosome. The methylated SNRPN locus was amplified with the MF 5â-TAAATAAGTACGTTTGCGCGGTC-3â² and MR 5â-AACCTTACCCGCTCCATCGCG-3â² to generate the 174âbp methylation product. While the non-methylation primers PF 5â²-GTAGGTTGGTGTGTATGTTTAGGT-3â² and PR 5â-ACATCAAACATCTCCAACAACCA-3â², were used to amplify 100âbp of the non-methylated allele.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec8">
<title>STR linkage analysis</title>
<p id="Par21">The multiplex-fluorescent-labeled STR linkage analysis was performed as previously described<sup>.</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] The microsatellite markers were selected according to their high heterozygosity and locations in the typical deletion region and adjacent regions. Seven STR markers D15S11, D15S646, D15S817, D15S128, D15S1513, GABRB3, D15S822 located in the typical PWS/AS deletion region of BP1 to BP3, and two loci D15S659, FES in the distal region near telomere. The experimental procedures were as previously described<sup>.</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems) was used for data collection and allele sizing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec9">
<title>Chromosomal microarray analysis</title>
<p id="Par22">The chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) was carried out to identify chromosomal breakpoints in confirmed cases. And in undetected cases, it was employed to detect other chromosomal abnormalities. From 2012 to 2014, Agilentâs 8âÃâ60âK commercial array (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) was employed for array-based CGH analysis, and Agilent Genomic Workbench Lite Edition 6.5.0.18 software (Agilent Technologies) was used for data analysis. From 2015 onwards, CMA was performed with CytoScan 750âK array (Affymetrix, CA, USA), and Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite software was used for genotype calling, quality control and CNV identification.</p>

<title>Methylation-specific PCR analysis</title>
<p id="Par23">The PCR products of 174âbp and 100âbp were obtained from methylated and unmethylated alleles of <italic>SNRPN</italic> gene locus. In 13 patients, the MS-PCR results demonstrated absence of maternal allele at 15q11-q13 or deletion of a methylated CpG island at the <italic>SNRPN</italic> gene (presented with only 100âbp of paternal fragment), were suspected for AS; 36 patientsâ analysis results showed the paternal chromosome is aberrantly methylated at this region (presented with only 174âbp of maternal fragment), and were suspected for PWS (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>MS-PCR analysis of SNRPN gene in PWS/ AS patients.

<p id="Par24">The MS-PCR results of another 3281 participants presented normal (with both 100âbp and 174âbp fragments). Clinical re-assessments were carried out. For those individuals presented with characteristic features of AS, <italic>UBE3A</italic> sequence analysis were recommended; For those presented with mild or atypical symptoms, further examinations and adequate follow-up were provided; For those demonstrated with severe manifestations, a careful review of the patientsâ histories, clinical features and EEG findings were suggested for differential diagnoses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec12">
<title>STR linkage analysis</title>
<p id="Par25">The multiplex-fluorescent-labeled STR linkage analysis was carried out to define the underlying genetic mechanism in 49 suspected patients and their parents. 13 patients showed the maternal region deletion at the chromosome 15q11-q13 and were confirmed as AS. Of them, one patient carried two chromosome 15 alleles inherited from one paternal chromosome 15, and was identified as AS with isodisomic uniparental disomy type. Moreover, 36 patients demonstrated with the paternal deletion in this region and were diagnosed as PWS. Of them, 5 patients carried two chromosome 15 alleles inherited from one maternal chromosome 15, and was identified as PWS with isodisomic uniparental disomy type. Another one patient was diagnosed with PWS caused by mixed segmental isodisomic/heterodisomic uniparental disomy of maternal chromosome 15. The results of all the patients tested by STR linkage analysis were listed in TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>, and some representative cases were shown in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig"

<title>Chromosomal microarray analysis</title>
<p id="Par27">For 21 PWS/AS patients, CMA was carried out to validate previous results and to detect the chromosomal breakpoints. The results were in accordance with previous tests and demonstrated with various deletion fragments. The results of some representative cases were shown in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>. For another 56 subjects presented with severe clinical manifestations but tested negative for PWS/AS, CMA was employed to detect other chromosomal abnormalities. It identified 14 CNVs in 11 out of 56 (19.6%) patients. Among these CNVs, 5 were classified as pathogenic, 6 as VOUS, and 3 as benign. Two pathogenic CNVs were reported in one patient. Therefore, CMA approach identified another 4 patients in 56 individuals with clinically overlapped features but tested negative for PWS/AS. The causative CNVs and their related syndromes were listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>. The 1p36 microdeletion syndrome resembles PWS presenting with developmental delays/ intellectual disability, craniofacial dysmorphism, hypotonia and other congenital anomalies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The MowatâWilson syndrome is caused by heterozygous mutations in ZEB2 gene on chromosome 2, is associated with severe mental retardation, microcephaly, seizures, short stature, and characteristic facial features that resemble those of AS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The 22q13.3 deletion syndrome may present with nondysmorphic facial features, absent or minimal speech, and moderate to severe developmental delay, sometimes with behavioral features in the autism spectrum, and may present with an AS-like phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Another patient with an AS-like condition carried 17p13.2-pter deletion and 22q13.33-qter duplication, presented with brain abnormalities, developmental delay, facial dysmorphisms, hypotonia and seizures.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>CMA results of some representative cases with PWS/AS<bold>. a</bold> Chromosomal microarray analysis of Case 16 showing the patient has a deletion mutation of chromosome 15. <bold>b</bold> Chromosomal microarray analysis of Case 19 showing the patient has segmental iso/heteroUPD on chromosome 15</p></caption><graphic id="MO3" xlink:href="13039_2019_420_Fig3_HTML"></graphic></fig><table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>The causative CNVs other than 15q11â13 detected by CMA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Causative CNVs</th><th>Related Syndrome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>arr[hg19] 1p36.33p36.32 (849,466-4,273,842)Ã1</td><td>1p36 microdeletion syndrome</td></tr><tr><td>arr[hg19] 2q22.2q22.3 (143,208,691-147,030,229)Ãâ1</td><td>Mowat-Wilson syndrome</td></tr><tr><td>arr[hg19] 22q13.33 (49,542,105-51,197,766)Ã1</td><td>22q13.3 microdeletion syndrome</td></tr><tr><td>arr[hg19] 17p13.3p13.2 (525â5,387,515)Ã1; 22q13.33 (50,522,375-51,197,766)Ã3</td><td>Miller-Dieker syndrome</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par28">The strategies for the analysis of PWS/AS can be affected by many factors, including the arrangement of laboratory services, the coverage of medical insurance and the patterns of referral. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] In the present study, the MS-PCR approach was employed as a first-tier screening test to detect abnormal parent-specific methylation within the PWS and AS critical region. It is a rapid and convenient platform, which can accurately identify more than 99% of PWS and approximately 80% of AS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. <italic>UBE3A</italic> sequence analysis detects mutations in approximately a further 10% of patients with AS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The multiplex-fluorescent-labeled STRs assay based linkage analysis was carried out to define the underlying genetic mechanisms. It can differentiate the molecular defects between typical deletion and UPD, exactly uniparental heterodisomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Establishing the mechanism will provide information on the possible clinical features, the prognosis and the recurrence risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, CMA was carried out to validate previous results and to detect the chromosomal breakpoints. It is an efficient and sensitive method for precisely detecting CNVs, and SNP-based CMA can directly identify isodisomic UPDs or identical by descents (IBDs) and associated mosaicisms. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] The strategies adopted in the study for the analysis of PWS/AS demonstrated with satisfying performance. Yet the routine approaches did not include methylation-specific multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) analysis, which can simultaneously detect copy number changes and DNA methylation defects within chromosome 15q11â13 region in a semi-quantitative manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], mainly out of the financial consideration. Since the costs of genetic testing for PWS/AS were not covered by the Medicare scheme in China, more cost-effective approaches were employed for the routine detection.</p>
<p id="Par29">As to the study cohort, the majority of suspected individuals (3241 out of 3331) were neonates (â¤28âdays) presented with initial symptoms of PWS/AS, such as poor reflexes, sucking and swallowing difficulties. Given that the characteristic signs evolve with age and the initial symptoms overlap with other disorders, it could be difficult for the clinical diagnosis of PWS/AS in early infancy. As previous studies indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the median age of diagnosis in PWS patients varied between 0.8 and 19.8âyears, and in AS patients it was 0.9 to 6.2âyears. In the present study, genetic screening was carried out in suspected individuals from neonatal intensive care units. The median age of diagnosis was 12âdays in PWS patients and 22âdays in AS patients. The prognosis of confirmed patients has improved significantly by early and continued therapies. Furthermore, by carefully analyzing the clinical manifestations of PWS/AS neonates in the present study and retrospectively viewing the special features of Asian patients in previous researches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], a better understanding of clinical manifestations in Asian PWS/AS patients was learned. It would facilitate the differential diagnosis and early referral, and could result in early diagnosis and better management for PWS/AS patients.</p>
<p id="Par30">Moreover, in this cohort, 83.3% of PWS were caused by paternal microdeletion, 16.7% by UPD(15)mat; while 85.7% of AS were caused by maternal microdeletion, 7.1% by UPD(15)pat, and 7.1% by <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene mutation. The distributin pattern of underlying meachanisms in this cohort was compared with those in other published cohorts. In western populations like United States and Germany, about 70â75% of PWS were caused by paternal microdeletion and 20â25% by UPD(15)mat; whereas in Asian regions like Japan, Korea and Taiwan of China, 80% of PWS were caused by paternal microdeletion and 15â20% by UPD(15)mat. The distributin of underlying meachanisms in our cohort of PWS patients was similar to the patterns in Asian PWS cohorts. Besides, in previous published cohorts, 70â75% of AS were caused by maternal microdeletion, 2â7% by UPD(15)pat, 3â5% by IC defect and about 5â10% by <italic>UBE3A</italic> mutation. The distributin of underlying meachanisms in our cohort of AS patients was similar to the patterns in published AS cohorts, only the proportion of AS caused by maternal microdeletion was comparetively higher than in other cohorts. Microdeletion type was the most common reported mechanism for AS. One of the explanation was chromosome 15q11â13 region harbored multiple low copy repeats (LCRs) that mediated recurrent homologous rearrangement like deletion, duplication and inversion which made this imprinted region as one of the most variable regions in the human genome. Another explanation for its higher proportion might due to ethnic backgorund. The cohort in our study was composed of Chinese Han population, and most of Southern China ancestries. Yet the difference might still be caused by bias in the distributin due to the limited size of the AS patient cohort. Genetic counseling was offered to families with affected individuals, concerning the nature of the diseases, genetic etiology of different molecular classes, interventions and prognosis of PWS/AS patients. Assessment of recurrence risk was carried out based on the genetic mechanism of the proband [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par31">A practical set of molecular genetic testing has been adopted for the diagnosis of PWS/AS in the clinical practice of Guangdong Province, and demonstrated with comparatively satisfying performance. A better understanding of clinical manifestations and underlying meachanisms in Chinese PWS/AS patients was learned through this comparetively large cohort of 36 PWS patients and 14 AS patients. Identifying the disorders at early age, establishing the molecular mechanisms, carrying out treatment intervention and close monitoring can significantly improve the prognosis of PWS/AS patients.</p>
