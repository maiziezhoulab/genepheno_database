<abstract>
<p>Standardization of the use of next-generation sequencing for the diagnosis of rare neurological disorders has made it possible to detect potential disease-causing genetic variations, including de novo variants. However, the lack of a clear pathogenic relevance of gene variants poses a critical limitation for translating this genetic information into clinical practice, increasing the necessity to perform functional assays. Genetic screening is currently recommended in the guidelines for diagnosis of hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (HLDs). HLDs represent a group of rare heterogeneous disorders that interfere with the myelination of the neurons in the central nervous system. One of the HLD-related genes is <italic>HSPD1</italic>, encoding the mitochondrial chaperone heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), which functions as folding machinery for the mitochondrial proteins imported into the mitochondrial matrix space. Disease-causing <italic>HSPD1</italic> variants have been associated with an autosomal recessive form of fatal hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD4, MitCHAP60 disease; MIM #612233) and an autosomal dominant form of spastic paraplegia, type 13 (SPG13; MIM #605280). In 2018, a de novo <italic>HSPD1</italic> variant was reported in a patient with HLD. Here, we present another case carrying the same heterozygous de novo variation in the <italic>HSPD1</italic> gene (c.139T &gt; G, p.Leu47Val) associated with an HLD phenotype. Our molecular studies show that the variant HSP60 protein is stably present in the patient's fibroblasts, and functional assays demonstrate that the variant protein lacks in vivo function, thus confirming its disease association. We conclude that de novo variations of the <italic>HSPD1</italic> gene should be considered as potentially disease-causing in the diagnosis and pathogenesis of the HLDs.</p>

<body><sec id="s1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (HLDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by defective myelination in the central nervous system accompanied by developmental delay, spasticity, and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC4">Charzewska et al. 2016</xref>). HLDs are genetically heterogeneous disorders, and 17 types of HLDs have been identified by variations in different genes thus far. These genes include those that are directly related to myelination (i.e., <italic>PLP1</italic>, <italic>GJC2</italic>, <italic>FAM126A</italic>, and <italic>TUBB4A</italic>) but also genes for which the involvement in myelination is not yet characterized (e.g., <italic>PYCR2</italic>, <italic>HIKESHI</italic>, and <italic>HSPD1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC17">Pouwels et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC21">Vanderver et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC5">Duncan and Radcliff 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC6">Duncan et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC20">van der Knaap and Bugiani 2017</xref>).</p><p>Among different types of HLDs, HLD4, also known as MitCHAP60 disease (MIM #612233), is attributed to a biallelic pathogenic variant in the <italic>HSPD1</italic> gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC12">Magen et al. 2008</xref>). HLD4 is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder, presenting initially with central hypotonia, strabismus, and psychomotor delay. Patients develop acquired microcephaly, spasticity, and developmental regression. Seizures are also reported in some patients. Typically, the onset of the condition is within the first 3 months of life and is fatal within the first 2 decades. There is a wide range of reported intrafamilial and interfamilial phenotypic heterogeneity, particularly with respect to the degree of psychomotor impairment and the rate of neurologic and developmental deterioration. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in these patients reveals diffuse hypomyelination, thin corpus callosum, thin brainstem, and varying degrees of ventricular enlargement. A subset of patients has markedly increased urinary secretion of ethylmalonic acid as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC12">Magen et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC3">Bross and Fernandez-Guerra 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC11">Kusk et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>The human <italic>HSPD1</italic> and <italic>HSPE1</italic> genes encode the essential mitochondrial HSP60 and HSP10 chaperones, respectively, which form a folding chamber to facilitate protein folding and assembly in the mitochondrial matrix space. Variations in <italic>HSPD1</italic> and <italic>HSPE1</italic> are implicated in the following neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCS004879COMTB1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC3">Bross and Fernandez-Guerra 2016</xref>): (i) homozygosity for the HSP60:p.Asp29Gly variation causes the fatal hypomyelination disorder (HLD4; MitCHAP60 disease; MIM #612233) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC12">Magen et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC14">Parnas et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC11">Kusk et al. 2016</xref>), (ii) heterozygosity for the HSP60:p.Val98Ile variation causes spastic paraplegia (SPG13; MIM #605280) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC8">Hansen et al. 2002</xref>), (iii) heterozygosity for the HSP10:p.Leu73Phe variation causes a neurological and developmental disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC2">Bie et al. 2016</xref>), and (iv) heterozygosity for the HSP60:p.Leu47Val variation causes hypomyelination disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC23">Yamamoto et al. 2018</xref>). In addition to these genetic variations, another molecular mechanism can lead to HSP10 chaperone deficiency, without involving a genetic alteration in the <italic>HSPE1</italic> gene. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC19">Szego et al. (2019)</xref> demonstrated that newly synthesized HSP10 directly interacts with α-synuclein, forming α-synuclein aggregates that result in cytosolic trapping of HSP10. This prevents import of HSP10 into the mitochondrial matrix. The subsequent reduced levels of HSP10 in the mitochondrial matrix result in mitochondrial dysfunction. In agreement with this conclusion, Szego et al. showed that HSP10 overexpression delays α-synuclein pathology both in vitro and in vivo.</p><table-wrap id="MCS004879COMTB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Genotype and clinical features of patients with <italic>HSPD1</italic> and <italic>HSPE1</italic> variations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Disease association</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Variations in <italic>HSPD1</italic> or <italic>HSPE1</italic></th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Genotype</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age at onset</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Gender</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Symptoms</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">PolyPhen-2 prediction<sup>a</sup></th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Growth in genetic complementation assay</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>ACADS</italic> polymorphism genotype</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Urine ethylmalonic acid</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Reference(s)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 4 (HLD4;MitCHAP60;

He was born by vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery at 38 wk gestation to a G1P0 woman following an uncomplicated pregnancy. His early gross motor milestones fell within the normal range, but delayed milestones became apparent by 18 mo of age. He did not walk independently until 22 mo of age. Neurological evaluation at 24 mo of age revealed mild bilateral postural tremor in the upper extremities, mild ataxia, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and abnormal motor coordination. He was also clumsy and showed gait instability. He had no history of developmental regression or seizures. His brain MRI recorded at 36 mo of age showed diffuse/delayed hypomyelination of the cerebral and cerebellar white matter suggestive of underlying HLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS004879COMF1">Fig. 1</xref>A–C). However, the patient had normal corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS004879COMF1">Fig. 1</xref>D). Patient had mild postural tremor at 4 yr and 2 mo; reflexes were 2+ bilaterally in the patella and the Achilles’ and 1+ bilaterally in the triceps. He was able to jump with two feet at 4 yr and 10 mo of age. Physical examination at 5 yr and 2 mo of age revealed normal growth parameters (height 85th percentile, weight 25–50th percentile, head circumference 75th percentile) and no dysmorphic features. No regression and no seizures were noted at this age. Examination at 7 yr and 9 mo revealed coordination and fatigue challenges, and motor development reaching to plateau.

Calculations based on our mass spectrometry data indicated similar amounts of variant and HSP60 wild-type proteins in the patient's fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS004879COMF4">Fig. 4</xref>C). As the wild-type HSP60 protein constitutes 100% in the control cells, the percentage of the HSP60:p.Leu47Val protein in the patient cells is ∼50%, thus demonstrating that the mutant HSP60:p.Leu47Val protein is as stable as wild-type HSP60.</p><fig id="MCS004879COMF4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Detection and quantification of wild-type and variant HSP60 peptide levels by mass spectrometry demonstrate that the variant protein is present, suggesting that the mutation is causing a dominant negative effect on HSP60 function.

These advancements considerably speed up the discovery of de novo mutations and mutational hotspots in the human genome. Detection of the same de novo variation in multiple patients with the same disease phenotypes contributes to the confirmation of the disease-causing nature of gene variations and in-depth functional studies of the variant proteins expand our knowledge on molecular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC1">Acuna-Hidalgo et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>As reported before, different disease-causing variations in the <italic>HSPD1</italic> and <italic>HSPE1</italic> genes, which respectively encode the mitochondrial HSP60 and HSP10 chaperones, have been found to result in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental diseases with different severities (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="MCS004879COMTB1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC3">Bross and Fernandez-Guerra 2016</xref>). Here, we propose a possible novel autosomal dominant mechanism for HLD4 and suggest that a subset of autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in the <italic>HSPD1</italic> gene produces an HLD phenotype. We based this mechanism on our investigations of a case of the 7-yr-old patient that presented with a brain MRI finding consistent with HLD and a heterozygous p.Leu47Val de novo variation in the <italic>HSPD1</italic> gene, together with the case previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC23">Yamamoto et al. 2018</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the disease-causing nature of the p.Leu47Val variation, we performed in silico analyses and in vivo functional assays. The sequence alignment of the human HSP60 protein and its homologs shows the strict conservation of Leu47, together with the other disease-associated amino acid residues—Asp29 and Val98—from <italic>E. coli</italic> to humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS004879COMF2">Fig. 2</xref>A). Our structural analysis suggests that these amino acids could be involved in stabilization of the seven-subunit HSP60 structure. Indeed, a recent publication has shown that the p.Asp29Gly and p.Val98Ile variations interfere with functional conformational changes in the HSP60 chaperone complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC22">Wang et al. 2019</xref>). These disease-associated amino acids are located in close proximity to each other and the ATP-binding domain, yet are not directly in contact with the bound ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS004879COMF2">Fig. 2</xref>B–D). This further supports the possibility that replacement of the linear carbon side chain of leucine with the β-branched valine in this densely packed part of the HSP60 structure may also disturb transmission of the conformational changes triggered by ATP hydrolysis, and thus impair protein function.</p><p>Urine metabolic screening detected increased excretion of ethylmalonic acid, which is an indicator of short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD, <italic>ACADS</italic>) deficiency, an inborn error of mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. Elevated urine ethylmalonic acid has also been observed in patients in whom homozygosity for the polymorphic c.624G &gt; A variation was found as the only variation in the <italic>ACADS</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC7">Gregersen et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC16">Pedersen et al. 2008</xref>). Presence of intermittent increase of urinary ethylmalonic acid excretion has been described in patients with HLD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC12">Magen et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC11">Kusk et al. 2016</xref>). Earlier studies have shown functional interaction of SCAD with the HSP60 chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC15">Pedersen et al. 2003</xref>), and therefore elevated levels of ethylmalonic acid, as seen in the current patient, may be the result of the heterozygosity for the c.625G &gt; A common variant in the <italic>ACADS</italic> gene, in connection with the impaired HSP60 function.</p><p>Discrepancies between in silico analysis and in vivo functional assays for HSP60 variants have shown the importance of evaluating the activity of the HSP60/HSP10 complex in each case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC3">Bross and Fernandez-Guerra 2016</xref>). Here we used both an <italic>E. coli</italic>–based genetic complementation system and patient's fibroblasts for in vivo functional analyses. The genetic complementation system showed abolished bacterial cell growth and a decreased linkage score for the HSP60:p.Leu47Val variant, indicating its failure to complement the deletion of the <italic>E. coli groESgroEL</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="MCS004879COMTB2">Table 2</xref>), demonstrating a loss of protein function. Moreover, in the patient's fibroblasts we detected a 1:1 ratio of wild-type to variant peptide, indicating that it is stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCS004879COMF4">Fig. 4</xref>C). In the previous report of this variation, Yamamato et al. discusses the possibility of compound heterozygosity for the <italic>HSPD1</italic> variant. Detection of both the variant and the wild-type peptides in equal amounts in patient's fibroblasts excludes the possibility of compound heterozygosity through variations in the noncoding regions of the wild-type allele that might affect its expression. Taken together, our functional results are consistent with the conclusion that the HSP60:p.Leu47Val variant exerts an autosomal dominant disease mechanism.</p><p>In summary, this case study reveals a de novo variant in the <italic>HSPD1</italic> gene with an autosomal dominant disease mechanism. As such, it is important to consider the possibility that other heterozygous de novo variants in the <italic>HSPD1</italic> gene may exist, resulting in neurodevelopmental disorder manifestations such as HLD. The presence of the same de novo variation in two different patients with similar clinical phenotypes might suggest that the p.Leu47Val variant is the consequence of a mutational hotspot in the <italic>HSPD1</italic> gene. However, the mutated base is not in a CpG site that would increase susceptibility to mutation. It is likely that variation of this amino acid comes to clinical attention because this position in the protein is especially crucial. The basis for the mechanistic role of <italic>HSPD1</italic> in myelination is yet to be understood. These developments reveal the therapeutic potential of HSP60-targeting compounds and contribute to the continuing interest of developing small molecules to modulate HSP60 function in a variety of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCS004879COMC13">Meng et al. 2018</xref>). Finally, this study further underlines the potential of whole-exome sequencing in the diagnosis of rare diseases, and the necessity of performing functional assays in order to confirm disease-causing potential of de novo variants.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genomic Analyses</title><p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed by Centogene AG, and 100% coverage for coding regions of the <italic>HSPD1</italic> gene was reported by the company (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molecularcasestudies.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/mcs.a004879/-/DC1">Supplemental Table S1</ext-link>).
