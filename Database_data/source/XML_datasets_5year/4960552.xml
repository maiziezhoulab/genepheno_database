<abstract>
<p>Aldehyde-oxidase-4 (AOX4) is one of the mouse aldehyde oxidase isoenzymes and its physiological function is unknown. The major source of AOX4 is the Harderian-gland, where the enzyme is characterized by daily rhythmic fluctuations. Deletion of the <italic>Aox4</italic> gene causes perturbations in the expression of the circadian-rhythms gene pathway, as indicated by transcriptomic analysis. AOX4 inactivation alters the diurnal oscillations in the expression of master clock-genes. Similar effects are observed in other organs devoid of AOX4, such as white adipose tissue, liver and hypothalamus indicating a systemic action. While perturbations of clock-genes is sex-independent in the Harderian-gland and hypothalamus, sex influences this trait in liver and white-adipose-tissue which are characterized by the presence of AOX isoforms other than AOX4. In knock-out animals, perturbations in clock-gene expression are accompanied by reduced locomotor activity, resistance to diet induced obesity and to hepatic steatosis. All these effects are observed in female and male animals. Resistance to obesity is due to diminished fat accumulation resulting from increased energy dissipation, as white-adipocytes undergo trans-differentiation towards brown-adipocytes. Metabolomics and enzymatic data indicate that 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid and tryptophan are novel endogenous AOX4 substrates, potentially involved in AOX4 systemic actions.</p>

<p>Aldehyde oxidases (EC 1.2.3.1, AOXs) are molybdo-flavoenzymes characterized by broad substrate specificity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. AOXs oxidize aldehydes into carboxylic acids and hydroxylate aromatic heterocycles. The active form of AOXs is a 300 kDa homodimer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The number of mammalian AOX isoenzymes varies according to the species considered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Humans are characterized by a single enzyme, AOX1, while rodents synthesize four isoenzymes, AOX1, AOX2 (previously AOX3L1), AOX3 and AOX4. In mice, AOXs are encoded by distinct genes, clustering on chromosome 1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In humans, the vestiges of the mouse <italic>Aox</italic> gene-cluster are identifiable on chromosome 2, where <italic>AOX1</italic> lays next to the mouse <italic>Aox3</italic> and <italic>Aox2</italic> orthologs that underwent a process of pseudogenization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
<p>The physiological function and substrates of mammalian AOXs are obscure, although human and mouse liver AOX isoenzymes play a role in phase I metabolism of xenobiotics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies suggest that mouse AOX isoenzymes have overlapping substrate specificities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Among the substrates of potential physiological relevance, <italic>all-trans</italic> retinaldehyde (RAL), the metabolic intermediate of vitamin A, is oxidized by mouse AOXs into <italic>all-trans</italic> retinoic acid (ATRA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The four mouse AOXs are proposed to exert distinct functions given their tissue-specific pattern of expression. AOX1 is relatively ubiquitous, although high levels of the corresponding mRNA and protein are found in liver and lung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The expression profiles of AOX3 and AOX1 mRNAs as well as proteins are largely overlapping<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. High levels of AOX2 are observed only in the Bowman’s glands of the nasal cavity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. AOX4 is expressed in the tongue, oesophagus and epidermis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Nevertheless, the Harderian-gland (<italic>HG</italic>) is by far the richest source of AOX4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> where the enzyme represents 2% of all cytosolic proteins. <italic>HG</italic> is a large exocrine gland of the intra-orbital cavity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and it is conserved in most vertebrates with the exception of primates. <italic>HG</italic> physiological function is incompletely defined, although it is involved in the control of the diurnal cycle, as it synthesizes large amounts of the photodynamic compounds, protoporphyrin IX<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and melatonin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. <italic>HG</italic> is also involved in eye and fur coat lubrication <italic>via</italic> production of a lipid-rich secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Specific physiological processes in the rodent <italic>HG</italic>, such as lipid and protein metabolism, show rhythmic fluctuations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p>
<p>The present work provides novel insights into the physiological function of AOX4 which result from an integration of the phenotypic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data obtained in <italic>Aox4</italic> knock-out (<italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>

<title>Perturbations of periodical clock-gene expression in HG of <italic>Aox4</italic>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice</title>
<p>The gene-expression profiles of <italic>HG</italic> in female AOX4 knock-out (<italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and wild-type (<italic>WT</italic>) mice were compared. <italic>Aox4</italic>-deletion is associated with differential expression of 759 probes (log<sub>2</sub> fold-change ± 0.5; p-value &lt; 0.005), most of which are down-regulated (658 probes), as indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>. Pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>) indicates enrichment of gene networks controlling the immune response such as “Immune response_CD16 signalling in NK cells” (FDR = 2.3 e<sup>−4</sup>). Other enriched gene-sets, such as “Regulation of lipid metabolism” (FDR = 6.0 e<sup>−4</sup>), “Insulin, IGF-1 and TNF-alpha in brown adipocyte differentiation” (FDR = 1.4 e<sup>−2</sup>) control lipid homeostasis. One of the top gene signatures significantly enriched in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice is relevant for the purported role of <italic>HG</italic> in the light/dark cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S1a</xref>). This METACORE signature (“Circadian-rhythm”) ranks 3<sup>rd</sup> among the top perturbed ones (FDR = 2.9 e<sup>−4</sup>). AOX4 deletion alters the expression of circadian rhythm genes, like <italic>Arntl</italic> (also known as <italic>Bmal1</italic>) <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic> or <italic>Cry1</italic>, and other clock-genes, like <italic>Dbp</italic>, which are not present in the METACORE “Circadian-rhythm” pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>). The expression profiles of three major clock-genes, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Dbp</italic> and <italic>Arntl</italic>, were validated by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S1b</xref>). It must be noticed that the microarray data were obtained at a single time point during the diurnal cycle, between zeitgebers (<italic>ZT</italic>) 1–4 (<italic>ZT</italic>0 = 7 a.m., lights-on; <italic>ZT</italic>12 = 7 p.m., lights-off), as the observed perturbations on clock genes were unexpected.</p>
<p>Clock-genes are characterized by diurnal and cyclic variations in their expression. To get insights into the dynamic effects exerted by <italic>Aox4</italic>-deletion on selected clock-genes, we evaluated the expression levels of <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Dbp</italic>, <italic>Arntl</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>RORα</italic> and <italic>Rev-erbβ</italic> every six hours up to 24 hours in an independent set of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S2</xref>). As expected, these mRNAs show cyclic profiles of expression with peaks at different <italic>ZT</italic>s (<italic>Per2</italic> = 10/16; <italic>Dbp</italic> = 10; <italic>Arntl</italic> = 22; <italic>Clock</italic> = 22; <italic>RORα</italic> = 4/10; <italic>Rev-erbβ</italic> = 10) in female <italic>WT</italic> mice. <italic>Aox4</italic>-deletion causes an overall reduction in the oscillation amplitude of <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Dbp</italic>, <italic>Arntl</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>RORα</italic> mRNAs, with minor shifts in the oscillation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As for the oscillatory pattern of the clock gene <italic>Rev-erbβ</italic> (<italic>Nr1d2</italic>), whose expression was not altered on the basis of microarray data, it is virtually identical in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Although <italic>Aox4</italic> expression in <italic>HG</italic> is similar in male and female animals, there is a restricted time window in which the enzyme shows sexual dimorphism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. As all the above studies were conducted in females, we looked for potential sex differences in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> perturbations of clock-genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S2</xref>). The diurnal expression profiles of each clock mRNA can vary in <italic>WT</italic> female and male animals. However, relative to <italic>WT</italic>, <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>HG</italic> of both female and male mice present with reductions in the amplitude of <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Dbp</italic>, <italic>Arntl</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>RORα</italic> diurnal oscillations, indicating that regulation of these genes by AOX4 is not influenced by sex. Interestingly, the diurnal oscillatory patterns of <italic>Arntl</italic> and <italic>Clock</italic> in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>and <italic>WT</italic> mice of both sexes is remarkably similar, consistent with the observation that the two transcription factors act as heterodimers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>
<p>AOX4 may control clock-gene periodical expression <italic>via</italic> a substrate/product of the enzyme. Thus, we evaluated whether <italic>HG</italic> AOX4 enzymatic activity is also characterized by a daily oscillatory pattern and whether this is not influenced by sex. We measured AOX4-dependent oxidizing activity of phthalazine, a specific substrate, in female and male <italic>WT</italic> animals at the same <italic>ZTs</italic> considered for clock genes. Indeed, <italic>HG</italic> AOX4 enzyme activity varies with the diurnal cycle, being low during the light-phase and high at the end of the dark-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The overall levels and the light/dark profiles of AOX4-dependent phthalazine-oxidizing activity are very similar in male and female <italic>WT</italic> mice. These data support the idea that disruption of the diurnal variations in the local levels of one or more molecules directly or indirectly controlled by AOX4 is at the basis of the perturbations in clock-gene expression observed in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>HG</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Potential novel AOX4 substrates relevant for the control of circadian-rhythm genes in HG</title>
<p>To identify potential mediators of the AOX4-dependent effects on clock gene expression, we initially focused on two photo-sensors, protoporphyrin-IX and melatonin, which are abundant in <italic>HG</italic>s<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Protoporphyrin IX levels were evaluated in female <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals at four <italic>ZT</italic>s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S3a</xref>). The porphyrin content is higher in knock-out mice at three of the four <italic>ZT</italic>s, suggesting that AOX4 modulates the levels of protoporphyrin IX in <italic>HG. Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice are stabilized on a <italic>C57BL/6J</italic> background, which has a melatonin deficit due to the absence of hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase (HIOMT; EC 2.1.1.4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Consistent with this, both <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>animals are characterized by serum melatonin levels which are below the detection limit of the mass-spectrometry method used to determine the hormone in HIOMT-proficient <italic>C3H/HeJ</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S3b</xref>). Thus, while protoporphyrin IX may be involved in AOX4-dependent control of clock-genes, melatonin is unlikely to mediate the effects on clock-gene expression observed in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>mice.</p>
<p>To identify other endogenous mediators, we performed untargeted differential metabolomic studies in the <italic>HG</italic> of female mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S4</xref>). We identified 25 metabolites distinguishing <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> from <italic>WT</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table S2</xref>). Among them, tryptophan and 5-hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5HIAA) drew our attention, as they are part of the serotonin/melatonin biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S5</xref>), which controls circadian-rhythms. Tryptophan is more abundant in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> than <italic>WT</italic> mice, while 5HIAA is measurable only in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. The chemical structures of 5HIAA and tryptophan suggest that they are potential AOX substrates. To support this hypothesis, purified <italic>HG AOX4</italic> was incubated with tryptophan, 5-HIAA and serotonin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S6a</xref>). AOX4 recognizes tryptophan and 5-HIAA as substrates, while the enzyme does not metabolize the structural analogue, serotonin. 5HIAA and tryptophan are metabolized also by purified liver AOX3. Mass-spectrometric analysis of the reaction mixtures indicate that AOX4 and AOX3 oxidize 5HIAA and tryptophan to mono-hydroxylated products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S6b,c</xref>). As for tryptophan, incubation of the compound with both AOX4 and AOX3 results in the same three mono-hydroxylated products. The mass fragmentation profiles of the 3 peaks are distinct from that of 5-OH-tryptophan, the product of tryptophan-hydroxylases. These data suggest that 5HIAA and tryptophan or derived metabolites represent direct mediators of the AOX4-dependent effects on clock-genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Sex influence on clock-gene perturbations in tissues other than HG</title>
<p>The action of AOX4 on clock-genes may be part of systemic effects involving tissues other than <italic>HG</italic>. Thus, we compared the gene-expression profiles of visceral white-adipose-tissue (<italic>WADT</italic>) and liver of female <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>and <italic>WT</italic> mice. <italic>WADT</italic> and liver do not express AOX4, although they contain significant amounts of other AOXs, <italic>i.e</italic> AOX1 in <italic>WADT</italic> and AOX3 plus very low levels of AOX1 in liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In addition <italic>WADT</italic> and liver are representative of tissues having a major role in energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis, two processes potentially influenced by circadian rhythms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>
<p>A large number of genes is modulated in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>WADT</italic> and liver selectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table S1</xref>). The number of differentially regulated genes (log<sub>2</sub> fold-change ±0.5; p-value &lt; 0.005) is 601 in <italic>WADT</italic> and 962 in liver. In <italic>WADT</italic> and liver, pathway enrichment analysis indicates that the genes are organized in 48 and 20 overlapping networks (FDR &lt; 0.05), respectively. Similar to what is observed in <italic>HG</italic>, “Circadian-rhythm” is ranking among the top enriched pathways in <italic>WADT</italic> and liver of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl.

<p>Evaluation of the daily oscillatory patterns of <italic>Per2, Dbp</italic> and <italic>Arntl</italic> in female <italic>WADT</italic> and liver confirms what was observed in <italic>HG</italic>, as <italic>Aox4</italic>-deletion reduces the amplitude of the diurnal oscillations of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). A similar trend is observed for <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Rorα</italic>, although the results reach statistical significance only for <italic>Rorα</italic> in liver.

As observed in <italic>HG</italic>, <italic>WADT</italic> and liver, both female and male <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice show a reduction in the daily oscillation amplitude of these mRNAs in the hypothalamus too.

<title>Contribution of AOX3 to sex-dependent clock-gene regulation in liver</title>
<p>AOX3, AOX1 and AOX4, act on largely overlapping sets of substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In addition, hepatic AOX3 is sex and testosterone dependent, with males expressing much larger amounts of the protein than females<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Thus, we evaluated whether the sex-dependent differences in the clock-gene perturbations observed in liver and <italic>WADT</italic> of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice may be associated with altered amounts of hepatic AOX3 and adipocyte AOX1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In liver, low and similar levels of phthalazine-oxidase activity are detectable in <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>females throughout the diurnal cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). <italic>WT</italic> males show at least ten-fold higher levels of phthalazine-oxidase activity than females. Surprisingly, the amounts of this enzymatic activity are even larger in male <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. This male-specific difference in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals is more evident if the production of ATRA from RAL is measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Hence, male <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>mice seem to activate a compensatory response to <italic>HG</italic> AOX4 deficiency by increasing hepatic AOX3 protein in liver, as indicated by the Western blot data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). A similar compensatory increase of AOX enzymatic activity is likely to occur in male <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>WADT</italic> due to AOX1 mRNA and protein up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). Induction of liver AOX3 and <italic>WADT</italic> AOX1 are likely to influence the local production of substrate(s)/metabolite(s) common to AOX3, AOX1 and AOX4.

<title>Female and male <italic>Aox4</italic>
<sup>−/−</sup> animals present with reduced locomotor activity</title>
<p>Clock-gene modifications may affect animal behavior, which led us to compare locomotor activity in female <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>and <italic>WT</italic> mice across the circadian cycle. During the dark-phase, two activity peaks are evident in <italic>WT</italic> mice (<italic>ZT</italic> = 13–17,20). The height of the two peaks is reduced in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). During the light-phase, three small peaks, disappearing in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals, are evident in <italic>WT</italic> mice (<italic>ZT</italic> = 1,6,10). Regardless of the light/dark phase, female <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>mice show an overall decrease in locomotor activity relative to <italic>WT</italic> animals. Although minor sex-dependent differences in the daily motile pattern of <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>mice are observed, the overall reduction in locomotor activity is confirmed in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In the case of male <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> mice, only cumulative data are presented, although a significant reduction in locomotor activity is observed both during the light- and dark-phase. The motile behaviour of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>and <italic>WT</italic> animals was also compared in male mice adapted to constant darkness for two different periods of time (6 days and 6 weeks). In these conditions, the reduction in locomotor activity of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>mice is maintained and become more significant with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This indicates that AOX4 controls locomotor activity <italic>via</italic> mechanisms independent of light and sex.</p>
<p>Muscle strength deficits may contribute to decreased locomotor activity of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>mice. Hence, we subjected animals to hanging wire tests, which measure muscle strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Mature (14–15 weeks) <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>females show equivalent hanging times as <italic>WT</italic> animals, while a mild deficit is present in young (7 weeks) <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>males. This deficit becomes more evident in mature (14 weeks old) animals, and it is not accompanied by weight loss of the gastrocnemius, soleus and tibial muscles. It is interesting that the diameter of the tibial muscle fibers (see Materials and Methods) in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>male mice is lower than in <italic>WT</italic> animals (Mean ± SE: <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> = 37.5 ± 0.3, <italic>WT</italic> = 43.7 ± 0.3; Student’s t-test p = 6.2 E<sup>−35</sup>). A similar difference in fiber size is not evident in the female counterparts (Mean ± SE: <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> = 38.4 ± 0.3, <italic>WT</italic> = 38.8 ± 0.1; Student’s t-test p = 0.38). These last results may partially explain why muscle weakness is specifically observed in male animals. In conclusion, the deficit in locomotor activity observed in both female and male <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals is unlikely to be due to muscular atrophy.</p>
<p>Decreased <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>locomotor activity may cause alterations in energy homeostasis. Consequently, we subjected female animals to indirect calorimetry. In <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals, the daily profiles of locomotor activity and energy expenditure, calculated from oxygen consumption and carbonic anhydride production, are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Overall, energy expenditure is also similar in <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, except for a small, but significant increase of this parameter in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice at <italic>ZT</italic>9.</p>

<p>Circadian clocks regulate body weight <italic>via</italic> control of fat deposition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Moreover, <italic>HG</italic> metobolomics suggest a role for AOX4 in lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table S2</xref>). In fact, many metabolites differentially regulated in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>HG</italic> are lipids, including cholesterol, phospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholines; phosphatidylethanolamines; lysophosphatidylethanolamine), linoleic acid and dihomo-γ-linolenoyl-ethanolamide. Alterations in HG lipid metabolism may be consequent to more general effects on cell energy balance, as suggested by the observation that panthotenate is measurable only in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. The increase in N(6)-(1,2 dicarboxyethyl) AMP, a fumarate precursor, may reflect stimulation of the citrate cycle. High panthotenate levels in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals may be due to augmented energy wasting <italic>via</italic> enhanced mitochondrial activity. In <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, isobutyryl-L-carnitine depletion may also be consistent with increased mitochondrial oxidative activity, as the compound is the product of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, which are mitochondrial enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation. Indeed, crude mitochondrial fractions of <italic>HG</italic> from female <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice contain significantly larger amounts of citrate synthase and ATP synthase (complex-V) than the <italic>WT</italic> counterparts and a trend towards higher levels of complex-I to complex-IV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S7</xref>), supporting an increase in the number and activity of these organelles. Finally, process analysis of the <italic>HG</italic> microarray data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table S1</xref>) indicates the AOX4-deficiency affects lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Given this background, we evaluated whether <italic>Aox4</italic>-deletion affects body weight in female mice fed standard (<italic>ND</italic>) or high-fat (<italic>HFD</italic>) diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). <italic>ND</italic> fed <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice show similar body weight-gain as <italic>WT</italic> mice. <italic>HFD</italic> causes a much lower increase in the weight of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> than <italic>WT</italic> mice. The lean phenotype of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals is further supported by the weight-gain values after normalization for the initial body weight. These effects are confirmed in male animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Hence, both female and male <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice show equal resistance to diet-induced increase in body weight, as also indicated by the total body weight curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S8</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the mechanisms underlying the deficits in weight-gain observed in knock-out mice, we determined food-intake and we calculated energy-intake (food-intake x food-caloric-content) as well as feed-efficiency (daily weight gain/energy intake) in female <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> animals fed <italic>ND</italic> and <italic>HFD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). After normalization for individual body weight, <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> mice kept on <italic>ND</italic> show no difference in food/energy-intake. These indexes are slightly although significantly higher in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals fed <italic>HFD</italic>. Given the reduced weight-gain, <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice exposed to <italic>HFD</italic> show a lower feed-efficiency than <italic>WT</italic> animals. This is not explained by an overall increase in whole-body energy-expenditure, as indirect calorimetric analysis indicates no difference between <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> mice fed <italic>HFD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), replicating the data observed in basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In addition, we evaluated whether intestinal nutrient absorption or urine production is affected in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals kept under standard conditions. No difference in the daily amount of faeces or urine volume is observed in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl.

The volume of abdominal <italic>WADT</italic> was assessed by Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging (MRI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>).

These phenomena are amplified upon <italic>HFD</italic>. The deficit in abdominal fat deposition is supported by <italic>WADT</italic> microscopic analysis in <italic>ND</italic>-fed mice which shows that adipocytes are larger in <italic>WT</italic> than <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>animals because of a higher lipid content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Relative to <italic>ND</italic>-fed mice, the weight of visceral, subcutaneous and inguinal <italic>WADT</italic> is increased in all <italic>HFD</italic>-fed animals. However, the weight increment is lower in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> than <italic>WT</italic> visceral/inguinal fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Similarly, the increase in total and lean body mass of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>mice on <italic>HFD</italic> is less pronounced than in <italic>WT</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>).

We focussed our attention on UCP1, as it is a key functional enzyme in <italic>rBADT</italic> uncoupling mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increasing thermogenesis at the expense of fat deposition. We measured the levels of the <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA by RT-PCR confirming and extending the microarray results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA levels tend to be higher in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> than <italic>WT</italic> animals upon <italic>ND</italic> feeding.

<p>The obesity-associated metabolic syndrome includes hepatic steatosis and altered glucose or insulin sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Histochemical analysis of female liver slices demonstrates that neither <italic>WT</italic> nor <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice fed <italic>ND</italic> show signs of steatosis. Upon <italic>HFD</italic>, a consistent increase in oil-red-positive hepatocytes is observed in <italic>WT</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). The steatotic response is strongly reduced in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. In line with this, <italic>HFD</italic> causes triglyceride accumulation in female <italic>WT</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). An increase in triglycerides is observed also in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> liver, although it never reaches statistical significance. These last differential effects on triglyceride accumulation are much more evident in male <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p>In <italic>ND</italic>-fed <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, blood glucose basal levels are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>). Exposure to <italic>HFD</italic> increases glucose in both types of mice. Nevertheless, the glucose-tolerance curves calculated for <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> mice are similar regardless of diet and the relative AUC (Area Under the Curve) values are also similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>). The results of the insulin tolerance tests suggest that <italic>ND</italic>-fed <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals show a mild and short-lived increase in insulin resistance relative to <italic>WT</italic> mice, which translates into higher AUC values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8e</xref>). As a consequence, the increase in the AUC values caused by <italic>HFD</italic> (ΔAUC, <italic>HFD</italic>-<italic>ND</italic>) in <italic>WT</italic> mice (Mean of <italic>WT/</italic>ΔAUC = ±66, SE = 4, p-value = 0.007) is no more observed in the <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> counterparts (Mean of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>/</italic>ΔAUC = −10, SE = 1, p-value = 0.623). We defined whether the mild insulin resistance observed in <italic>ND</italic>-fed <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice is accompanied by alterations in the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) in <italic>WADT</italic> and the downstream intracellular effector AKT in liver and muscles following challenge with insulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In <italic>WADT</italic>, insulin treatment causes a rapid increase in the phosphorylation levels of IR, while insulin-dependent phosphorylation of AKT is observed in liver and muscles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S12</xref>). However, AOX4 deletion does not have a significant effect on the insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the two proteins. The data indicate that the mild insulin resistance observed in <italic>ND</italic>-fed knock-out mice cannot be explained by alterations in the phosphorylation/activation of IR and AKT in three major insulin-responsive tissues.</p>
<p>Gene-expression studies were performed in liver of <italic>HFD</italic> fed <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> mice. PCA demonstrates that <italic>HFD</italic> exerts selective effects in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8f</xref>). While 962 probes are differentially expressed (log<sub>2</sub> fold-change ±0.5; p &lt; 0.005) in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> relative to <italic>WT</italic> mice exposed to <italic>ND</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table S1</xref>), they are decreased to 325 (up-regulated = 248; down-regulated = 77) in <italic>HFD</italic> fed <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table S3</xref>). <italic>HFD</italic> up-regulates <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Per3</italic> and down-regulates <italic>Arntl</italic> and <italic>Clock</italic> in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> liver. This results in enrichment of the “Circadian-rhythm” pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table S3</xref>). Given the small number of genes selectively modulated by <italic>HFD</italic> in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> liver, only six gene pathways are enriched and five of them control cell-cycle and proliferation. These cell pathways have no obvious links with steatosis. However, it is possible that resistance to steatosis is consequent to the basal or constitutive alterations in gene-expression already observed in the liver of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals fed <italic>ND</italic>. In fact, the top (Insulin signaling:generic cascades) and the 6th (Role of Adiponectin in regulation of metabolism) enriched pathways in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> liver are involved in the control of lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice are characterized by major alterations in the global gene-expression profile of <italic>HG</italic>, affecting numerous cellular processes. One of the gene-sets which is mostly affected by <italic>Aox4</italic>-deletion controls circadian-rhythms. In <italic>HG</italic>, <italic>Aox4</italic>-deletion modifies the amplitude of the diurnal oscillations of various clock-genes. Given the daily fluctuations of <italic>HG</italic> AOX4 itself, physiological substrate(s)/product(s) of the enzyme may be part of a circuit controlling diurnal rhythms. In <italic>HG,</italic> ATRA may be one such AOX4 product<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, as the retinoid levels are reduced in the gland of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In addition, ATRA is a potential regulator of circadian-rhythms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and transcription of <italic>Arntl</italic> and <italic>Per1</italic> clock-genes is controlled by the retinoid <italic>via</italic> nuclear retinoic acid receptors and <italic>Rorα</italic> (retinoic-acid-receptor-Related-Orphan-Receptor-α)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p>
<p>The absence of AOX4 in <italic>HG</italic> has systemic consequences, since it influences clock-gene expression also in <italic>WADT</italic> and liver, two tissues devoid of the enzyme. <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice are characterized by two major systemic changes associated with and potentially determined by clock-genes perturbations, <italic>i.e.</italic> resistance to obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and reduction of locomotor activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Resistance to obesity is due to effects on adipose tissue homeostasis, as <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice present with lower volumes of <italic>WADT</italic> than <italic>WT</italic> animals. If <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice are fed <italic>HFD</italic>, the effect is magnified and accompanied by protection from liver steatosis. Resistance to obesity and steatosis is due to decreased feed efficiency and it is not directly related to alterations in locomotor activity, appetite or food intake. It is well known that circadian rhythms, locomotor activity and obesity are tightly related physiological processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Indeed, <italic>Clock</italic> knock-out mice are characterized by an altered locomotor activity pattern which is similar to the one observed in our <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. However, <italic>Clock</italic> knock-out mice are hyperphagic and obese, which is the opposite of what we observe in our animals. Thus, alterations in <italic>Clock</italic> expression may be at the basis of the decrease in locomotor activity of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals, while the gene is unlikely to play a role in resistance to obesity. <italic>Rorα</italic> is another clock gene that may play a role in fat deposition, since it has been linked to reduced adiposity, resistance to diet-induced obesity, protection against hepatic steatosis and improved glucose homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. The intensity of <italic>Rorα</italic> diurnal oscillations is reduced in <italic>HG</italic> of both female and male animals, while a similar trend is observed only in female <italic>WADT</italic> and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>). These data suggest a possible involvement in the systemic effects of AOX4 on fat deposition. However, our results do not support this hypothesis, as we found no enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table S4</xref>) of the genes regulated in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice among <italic>Rorα</italic> direct targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>.</p>
<p>Sex has been shown to influence circadian-rhythms, fat deposition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, locomotor activity as well as <italic>Aox4</italic>, <italic>Aox3</italic> and <italic>Aox1</italic> expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals show resistance to diet induced obesity regardless of sex. By the same token, the overall decrease in locomotor activity shows no sex-specificity. Reduction in the oscillatory amplitude of clock-genes is the only trait of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals which is influenced by sex, albeit in a tissue-specific fashion. In fact, this parameter is significantly altered in the <italic>HG</italic> and hypothalamus of both female and male <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. In contrast, only female <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>
<italic>WADT</italic> and liver show a diminished diurnal oscillatory amplitude of <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Dbp</italic> and <italic>Arntl</italic> expression. A similar phenomenon is observed in the case of hepatic <italic>Rorα</italic>. Given up-regulation of AOX3 and AOX1 proteins in liver and <italic>WADT</italic> of male <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, we propose that the oscillatory behaviour of clock-genes in different tissues is controlled by common substrate(s)/product(s) of AOX4, AOX3 and AOX1 isoenzymes.</p>
<p>In <italic>WADT</italic>, <italic>HG</italic> AOX4 controls fat deposition by modulation of the balance between lipid synthesis and oxidation. One of the factors controlling this balance is represented by the relative proportion of cells presenting with the characteristics of <italic>WADT</italic> and r<italic>BADT</italic> adipocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, which are responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. r<italic>BADT</italic> adipocytes contain many mitochondria and high levels of UCP1, which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation. In <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>
<italic>WADT</italic>, <italic>HFD</italic> up-regulates <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other r<italic>BADT</italic> markers as well as genes controlling mitochondrial activity. Thus, AOX4 absence in <italic>HG</italic> determines a functional switch of white into brown adipocytes which increases burning and reduces deposition of fat. The increased number of r<italic>BADT</italic> adypocytes in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>
<italic>WADT</italic> does not affect whole-body energy-consumption, as assessed by indirect calorimetric analysis, although changes may go unnoticed for at least two reasons. First, we calculated that an approximately 3% energy imbalance would be sufficient to produce the differences in weight gain between <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Second, <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice show increased energy expenditure relative to <italic>WT</italic> controls, if decreased locomotor activity is taken into account. Lack of systemic alterations in energy balance are accompanied by a lack of effects on body temperature, which is not different in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> animals at any of the zeitgebers considered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S13</xref>).</p>
<p>In a previous study we reported that <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice are characterized by alterations in the thickness and structure of the skin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In addition, <italic>HG</italic> secretions are purported to play a role in thermal insulation of the skin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. This may suggest that <italic>WADT</italic> browning of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals may be stimulated to compensate heat loss due to improper skin insulation. However our data are against this hypothesis, as indicated by the results obtained in female animals maintained under thermoneutral conditions (30 °C) for 30 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S14</xref>). In these conditions, we determined the abdominal fat volume (MRI analysis) in animals kept under ND. As an internal control of our experiment, we compared <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA in <italic>BADT</italic> of animals maintained at 22 °C and at 30 °C. As expected, BADT <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA levels are lower in <italic>WT</italic> animals maintained at 30 °C relative to what is observed at 22 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S14a</xref>). This is in line with the decrease in thermogenic activity expected for mice under thermoneutral conditions. Significantly, a similar decrease is observed also in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, which is against the hypothesis that improper skin insulation may be at the basis of the observed effects on fat deposition. More importantly, the lower volume of abdominal fat in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice relative to the <italic>WT</italic> counterparts that was already observed at 22 °C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>, time 1 and 2) is unaffected by the switch to 30 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S14b</xref>). During the observation period no significant difference in body weight between WT and <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice maintained at 30 °C was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. 14c</xref>). Taken together, these data further support the idea that browning of WAT and UCP1-dependent thermogenesis are not stimulated to compensate heat loss due to improper skin insulation in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p>As for the molecular mechanisms underlying <italic>WADT</italic> browning in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, circulating factors produced in <italic>HG</italic>, such as Irisin, which drives <italic>BADT</italic> development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> may contribute to the process. In fact, <italic>Fndc5</italic> (coding for the Irisin precursor) expression is higher in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> than <italic>WT HGs</italic>, regardless of diet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Tables S1–3</xref>). Alterations in the circulating or local levels of substrates or products of AOX4 enzymatic activity in <italic>HG</italic> may also participate in the process of <italic>WADT</italic> browning. Retinaldehyde (RAL), a known AOX substrate, and ATRA, its oxidation product, may be candidates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In fact, ATRA and RAL control trans-differentiation of <italic>WADT</italic> into <italic>rBADT</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. However, indirect data are against an involvement of circulating ATRA deriving from <italic>HG</italic> AOX4 activity in the process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S15</xref>). In fact, no significant difference in serum ATRA is observed between female <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> mice at any of the <italic>ZT</italic> considered. In addition, male knock-out mice present with significantly higher levels of blood ATRA than the <italic>WT</italic> counterparts at <italic>ZT</italic>4. Collectively, these data indicate that other enzymes, i.e retinaldehyde dehydrogenases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, play a more important role in the control of serum ATRA levels than <italic>HG</italic> AOX4, liver AOX3 or <italic>WADT</italic> AOX1. As for the local production of ATRA by AOX3 and AOX1, it is equally unlikely that they are involved in the fat accumulation deficits observed in liver and <italic>WADT</italic> of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals. In fact, sex controls the levels of liver AOX3 and <italic>WADT</italic> AOX1 in knock-out mice, whereas it does not affect resistance to obesity. In <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> liver, the mechanisms underlying resistance to steatosis are unknown, although the gene-expression and metabolomic data are in line with decreased <italic>HFD</italic>-induced lipid synthesis/accumulation. Protection from <italic>HFD</italic>-induced steatosis may involve immune responses, as indicated by pathway enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table S3</xref>). This may reflect modulation of the chronic metabolic-related inflammation (meta-inflammation) associated with obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref> which may influence the secretion of soluble factors controlling liver steatosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>.</p>
<p>Resistance to diet-induced obesity and liver statosis are often accompanied by increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Our insulin tolerance tests suggest that <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals show signs of mild insulin resistance. However, the insulin-dependent phosphorylation of IR or AKT at the level of the three major insulin-responsive organs, liver, <italic>WADT</italic> and muscles do not explain these results. Hence, we looked for other underlying mechanisms, performing a detailed METACORE analysis on our microarray data using the broadest version of this pathway (“Development Regulation_Insulin pathway). We compared the genes of this pathway differentially expressed in the <italic>HD</italic>, liver and <italic>WADT</italic> of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> animals fed <italic>ND</italic> and <italic>HFD</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S16</xref>). This analysis demonstrates the already mentioned up-regulation of UCP1 in <italic>WADT</italic> of <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals fed <italic>HFD</italic>. Finally, it indicates that the hormone-sensitive-lipase, LIPS or LIPE, which is involved in the activation of <italic>BADT</italic> genes, is up-regulated in liver of <italic>HFD</italic> fed <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. Overall the data support the idea that <italic>Aox4</italic> deletion exerts significant influences only on the expression of components of the insulin pathway playing a role in <italic>BADT</italic> homeostasis and are predominantly observed in the <italic>WADT</italic> of <italic>HFD</italic> animals.</p>
<p>Given the relevance of the tryptophan/serotonin pathway for circadian-rhythms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> and fat deposition, the finding that tryptophan and 5HIAA are two novel physiological substrates of <italic>HG</italic> AOX4 and liver AOX3, is of biological significance. In fact, it is possible that variations in <italic>HG</italic>/blood levels of serotonin, tryptophan, 5HIAA or AOX-derived metabolites contribute to the systemic effects of <italic>Aox4</italic>-deletion on clock-genes. Interestingly, a very recent study demonstrates that knock-out mice for peripheral tryptophan-hydroxylase-1 (TPH1) are characterized by resistance to obesity which is explained by an increase in brown adipose tissue thermogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. In addition, mice deficient in neuronal TPH2 show altered thermogenesis and behavior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. With respect to this, it should be noticed that the levels of <italic>HG</italic> serotonin are significantly lower in <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> than <italic>WT</italic> mice (<italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>: mean ± SE = 459 ± 38 fmol/mg tissue, N = 6; <italic>WT</italic>: mean ± SE = 574 ± 39 fmol/mg tissue, N = 6, t-test = p &lt; 0.05). In serum, a similar trend is observed (<italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>: mean ± SE = 4.3 ± 0.9 nmol/ml, N = 6; <italic>WT</italic>: mean ± SE = 6.1 ± 0.3 nmol/ml, N = 6), although the results do not reach statistical significance. These data suggest a possible involvement of <italic>HG</italic> serotonin in the modifications of circadian rhythms and resistance to obesity observed in our experimental model.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study provides insights into the physiological function of AOX4 demonstrating that the enzyme plays a role in the control of diurnal rhythms, adipogenesis and locomotor activity, supporting the link between these three processes. Since the <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> model was generated on a background strain that lacks melatonin, our data imply that one or more AOX4 products or substrates other than melatonin mediate alterations in the biological clocks. The reported effects on diurnal rhythms, fat deposition and locomotor activity do not impact life expectancy, as <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>WT</italic> mice show the same survival curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. S17</xref>). The involvement of AOX4 in the process of fat deposition may also be of relevance for the human situation, as human AOX1 may play a similar role as mouse AOX4 in adipogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>.</p>

<title>Wire hanging test</title>
<p>Fourteen-week-old <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> (n = 9) and <italic>WT</italic> (n = 8) female mice were used for the experiment. A similar experiment was conducted on male animals.

Animals were suspended by their forelimbs to a 1.5 mm thick, 60 cm long metallic wire suspended 45 cm above soft ground, and the chronograph was started. The chronograph was stopped anytime the animal fell and restarted when it was placed again on the wire; the test was stopped after 180 seconds of suspension. The number of falls from the wire was recorded; after 10 falls, the test was discontinued. At the beginning of the test, each animal was given a score of 10 that was reduced by 1 after each fall. Results were expressed as the ‘average score’. The average score was calculated at any time point of the test as (10n–x)/n where n was the number of animals of the tested strain and x the cumulated number of falls.</p>

<p>Two different indirect calorimetry experiments were performed on twenty-week-old <italic>Aox4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (n = 20) and <italic>WT</italic> (n = 20) female animals, housed in groups of 4 mice per cage/respiratory chamber (5 cages per experimental group). In the first experiment, respiratory exchanges were measured on animals fed <italic>ND</italic>, while the experiment was performed after two weeks of adaptation to <italic>HFD</italic>. During the whole experimental period, mice were housed at a temperature of 22.0 ± 1.0 °C under a 12 h light-dark cycle (07:00–19:00 h). Food and water were available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Animals were adapted to the respiratory chambers by placing them in the cage systems for 48 h before starting data collection. Body weights of animals were determined at the beginning and at the end of the respiratory exchanges trials. In both experiments, each group of animals was subjected twice to respiratory exchanges trial (2 consecutive cycles of 24 h), with 1 month in between, carried out using the one or the other respiratory chamber (4 cycles of 24 h for each cage/respiratory chamber). Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, RQ end energy expenditure were expressed for the light phase (day, 07:00–19:00 h), dark phase (night, 19:00–07:00 h) and the entire 24 h period. At the end of the experiment blood samples, <italic>HG</italic>, liver, visceral, subcutaneous and inguinal adipose tissues were removed and analysed.</p>

<title>Locomotor activity</title>
<p>Seven- and ten-week-old male as well as female mice fed <italic>ND</italic> were placed individually in standard mouse cages equipped with infrared sensors to detect locomotor activity. In the case of males, 6 <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and 6 <italic>WT</italic> mice were maintained on a 12:12 LD cycle for one week, then the light was switched off and constant darkness (12:12 DD) maintained for 6 weeks. The locomotor activity of male animals was monitored every 6 minutes. In the case of female mice, the experiment locomotor activity was monitored every 15 min for 2 weeks. Body weight, temperature and food intake were measured twice a week.</p>

<title>High fat diet</title>
<p>Eight-ten-weeks old male and female mice were used. 20 <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and 20 <italic>WT</italic> were randomized and divided in two groups. 10 <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and 10 <italic>WT</italic> mice were fed standard chow (<italic>ND</italic>) while 10 <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and 10 <italic>WT</italic> animals were fed with a high fat diet (<italic>HFD,</italic> Teklad TD.88137). Food intake and body weight were measured twice a week. At the end of experiments, animals were sacrificed and blood, <italic>HG</italic>, adipose tissues as well as liver were isolated. Serum glucose, NEFA (non-esterified fatty acids), triglycerides and cholesterol were measured according to standard methods routinely used for human clinical samples.

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> MRI</title>
<p>Twelve-week-old female <italic>WT</italic> mice (n = 6) and the same number of age-matched <italic>Aox4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> animals were randomly recruited to determine the fat accumulation by MRI analysis. MRI experiment were carried out one day before the onset of the experiment (T0), one month (T1) and two months (T2) after the starting <italic>HFD</italic>. Before MRI experiments, mice were anaesthetized by inhalation of a mixture of O<sub>2</sub> (30%) and NO<sub>2</sub> (70%) containing 3% isoflurane. Mice were laid prone to a small glass column “Animal Bed- Brucker BioSpec Systems” Brucker connected to an anaesthetic system. During the whole duration of experiments the percentage of isoflurane was maintained from 0.8 to 1.2. Respiratory frequency was monitored by a mechano-sensor placed on the chest. All analyses were carried in a range of respiratory activity from 50 to 90 breaths/min.</p>
<p>All MRI experiments were carried out using a Brucker Biospec 70/30, equipped with a Brucker BGA12 gradients insert. A 72-mm transmitter/receiver birdcage coil was used. After a coronal scout SE image, 20 coronal multislice T1-weighted (T1W) images were acquired to localize the area of interest. All images were acquired with the following parameters: TR = 782.5 ms, TE = 14.3 ms, FOV = 30 × 30 cm 2, matrix size = 512 × 256, slice thickness = 2 mm, NEX = 1. All experiment were done by removing the sat-faturation process. To reduce image artefacts, a respiration trigger system was adopted. The body weight was recorded just before MRI analysis.</p>
<p>All images were exported as DICOM (Digital Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine) files. This version is required to maintain the original size of MRI acquisition. A public Java-based image processing program (Image J) was utilized for morphometric analysis. Total fat volume measurements were carried out by selecting five serial slices starting from the first section (1 cm of thickness) below the diaphragm to the hypogastric region. For each single section the total area was first determined. Fat accumulation (light signal) was investigated by measuring extraperitoneal (subcutaneous) and intraperitoneal (visceral). The volume was determined by multiplying the area of interest (mm<sup>2</sup>) by the thickness of sections (2 mm). The ratio between the fat volume and the whole volume of each single corresponding section was also calculated.</p>

<title>RT-PCR, Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from indicated tissues or cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the cDNA was synthesized using Reverse Transcription System (Promega). For the histological and immune-cytochemistry studies, tissues were fixed with Z-Fix (Anatech Ltd.), embedded in paraffin, sectioned at a thickness of 6–8 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunostaining experiments in the adipose tissue were conducted with an anti-perilipin antibody (D418, Cell Signaling) and anti-UCP1 (ab10983, Abcam). Western blots were performed using specific anti-UCP1 (ab23841, Abcam), anti-α-tubulin (T-5168, Sigma), anti-AOX1, -AOX2, -AOX3 and -AOX4 antibodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.
