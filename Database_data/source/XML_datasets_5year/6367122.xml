<abstract id="ABS1">
<p id="P1">Pain is the quintessential symptom for individuals suffering from sickle cell disease (SCD). Although the degree of suffering and the cost of treatment is staggering, SCD continues to be grossly understudied, including lack of data for pain related genes and prevalence of polymorphisms in this population. This lack of data adds to the inadequacy of pain therapy in this population. Pain genetics investigators have recently examined allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms from candidate genes in people who suffer with SCD. One of the genes identified was the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A gene (AVPR1A) and its associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10877969. Progress in explaining pain related polymorphisms associated with SCD can be facilitated by understanding the literature. The purpose of this literature review was to describe mechanisms of the polymorphic gene, <italic>AVPR1A</italic>, and the phenotypic variations associated with its SNPs relative to health conditions and pain. Published studies were included if the research addressed AVPR1A and was a full manuscript in a peer reviewed journal, English language, a human or animal study, and published 2009 to present. Abstracts were included if they were in English and provided information not found in a full manuscript. The results of this review revealed that AVPR1A is associated with behavioral phenotypes, which include pair bonding, Autism Spectrum Disorder, musical aptitude, infidelity, altruism, monogamy, mating, substance abuse, and alcohol preference. In addition, there were associations with pain, stress pain by sex, and sickle cell pain. Summary of this literature could provide insights for future pain research of this SNP in people with SCD.</p>
