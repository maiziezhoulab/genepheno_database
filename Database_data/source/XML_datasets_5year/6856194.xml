<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Synapsin I is a phosphoprotein that coats the cytoplasmic side of synaptic vesicles and regulates their trafficking within nerve terminals. Autoantibodies against Syn I have been described in sera and cerebrospinal fluids of patients with numerous neurological diseases, including limbic encephalitis and clinically isolated syndrome; however, the effects and fate of autoantibodies in neurons are still unexplored. We found that in vitro exposure of primary hippocampal neurons to patient’s autoantibodies to SynI decreased the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and impaired both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission. These effects were reproduced with a purified SynI antibody and completely absent in SynI knockout neurons. Autoantibodies to SynI are internalized by FcγII/III-mediated endocytosis, interact with endogenous SynI, and promote its sequestration and intracellular aggregation. Neurons exposed to human autoantibodies to SynI display a reduced density of SVs, mimicking the SynI loss-of-function phenotype. Our data indicate that autoantibodies to intracellular antigens such as SynI can reach and inactivate their targets and suggest that an antibody-mediated synaptic dysfunction may contribute to the evolution and progression of autoimmune-mediated neurological diseases positive for SynI autoantibodies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">A large battery of autoantibodies directed to neuronal proteins have been discovered in sera and CSF of patients suffering from a variety of neurological diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These autoantibodies target two main classes of antigens, namely cell surface and intracellular antigens. Autoantibodies directed against the amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type B receptor belong to the first group and are frequently detected in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of affected subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. A number of studies have clearly demonstrated the direct pathogenic role of these autoantibodies. Of note, antibody removal and immunotherapy are effective treatments and promote a clinical improvement in the affected patients. In contrast, the pathogenic role of antibodies directed against intracellular antigens, such as anti-neuronal nuclear antibody type 1 (ANNA-1), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) and amphiphysin, remains a topic of debate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although evidence exists that antibodies to GAD65 and amphiphysin have pathogenic effects, a clear mechanism for antibody internalization and interaction with intracellular targets is still lacking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">A new member of the continuously growing list of target autoantigens of anti-neuronal antibodies is the SV-associated protein Synapsin I (SynI). Synapsin I is a phosphoprotein that coats the cytoplasmic side of SVs and plays multiple roles in the regulation of SV trafficking between the RP and the readily releasable pool (RRP) and in the facilitation of the post-docking steps of release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Nonsense and missense mutations in the gene encoding SynI have been associated with epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. SynI autoantibodies have been identified in serum and CSF from patients suffering of various neurological disorders, including limbic encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, anxiety, depressive and bipolar disorders, but not in healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, no studies correlating the effect of these antibodies to the brain pathology have been published to date.</p>
<p id="Par4">In the present study, we sought to investigate whether autoimmune mechanisms involving SynI autoantibodies influence the properties of synaptic transmission and whether a direct interaction between autoantibodies and the intracellular synaptic target occurs within nerve terminals. Using patient CSF and purified antibodies, we found that anti-SynI antibodies induced marked effects on neuronal network connectivity and activity including a decreased density of synaptic connections and an impairment of excitatory and inhibitory transmission. We revealed that internalization of anti-SynI antibodies into neurons occurs through a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway via Fcγ II/III receptors, followed by interaction with the cytosolic antigen and change in SV density and clustering within nerve terminals. Interestingly all these effects phenocopy the SynI knockout (KO) phenotype and are occluded in SynI KO neurons. Our findings provide new insights into a unique immune-neuronal interaction and indicate a potential pathogenic role of SynI autoantibodies in promoting “<italic>autoimmune synaptopathies</italic>”.</p>

<title>SynI autoantibodies from patient CSF impair excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons</title>
<p id="Par5">To investigate potential pathogenic effects of SynI autoantibodies, we treated primary neurons with the CSF of a limbic encephalitis and clinical isolated syndrome patients (herein referred to as LE-CSF and CIS-CSF, respectively) that were characterized by high titers of IgG and IgA autoantibodies against SynI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. As control, we pooled CSF from two patients with non-inflammatory neurological disorders that were negative for anti-neuronal autoantibodies (herein referred to as control CSF). The demographic and clinical data are reported in <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To rule out the possibility that human CSF per se may induce changes in synaptic transmission in primary neurons, we compared frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs and mIPSCs in untreated neurons, or in neurons treated daily for 3 days with control CSF or commercial human IgG/IgA antibodies. None of the experimental conditions induced any change in the electrophysiological parameters (data not shown). Accordingly, treatment with control CSF was used as control condition throughout the study.</p>
<p id="Par6">We first addressed the effect of both LE-CSF and CIS-CSF treatments on excitatory synaptic transmission by recording mEPSCs in dissociated hippocampal neurons at 14 DIV after 72 h of incubation. Under this condition, the mEPSC frequency was significantly reduced in patient CSF-treated neurons as compared to control CSF and, consistently, the cumulative probability plots of inter-event intervals were shifted to greater values (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>). mEPSC amplitudes and their the cumulative probability plot were also significantly decreased in neurons treated with LE-CSF and CIS-CSF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>), in the absence of changes in the rise and decay times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). Next, we assessed inhibitory synaptic transmission by recording mIPSCs. Similar to excitatory transmission, we found a significant reduction in both mIPSC frequency and amplitude of in patient CSF-treated neurons compared to treatment with control CSF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e–g</xref>), in the absence of changes in the current kinetics (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the impairment of synaptic transmission was due to a nonspecific cytotoxic effect of the CSF, resting membrane potential, a very sensitive index of neuronal health, was measured by patch-clamp in the current-clamp configuration. No change in membrane potential was detected in neurons exposed to both LE-CSF and CIS-CSF as compared to control CSF-treated neurons, suggesting that neurons are healthy and viable (resting potential mV, mean ± SEM: control CSF −56,86 ± 1,57; LE-CSF −56.00 ± 1.05; CIS-CSF −51.33 ± 1635).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Patient-derived SynI autoantibodies decrease excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission and synapses.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Representative recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in primary hippocampal neurons treated with either control CSF (1.5 μg/mL, black traces), LE-CSF (1.5 μg/mL, red traces) or CIS-SF (1.5 μg/mL, blue traces) for 72 h. <bold>b</bold> Cumulative distribution of inter-event intervals and mean mEPSC frequency. <bold>c</bold> Cumulative distribution and mean of mEPSC amplitude. <bold>d</bold> Rise and decay times of mEPSCs. <bold>e</bold> Representative recordings of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in hippocampal neurons treated as in (<bold>a</bold>). <bold>f</bold> Cumulative distribution of inter-event intervals and mean frequency of mIPSCs. <bold>g</bold> Cumulative distribution and mean of mIPSC amplitude. <bold>h</bold> Rise and decay times of mIPSCs.

<p id="Par7">The consistent decrease in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events of both excitatory and inhibitory transmission suggests that a possible loss of synaptic connection might have occurred during exposure to the patient-CSF. Indeed, double labeling with β-tubulin and either the glutamatergic or GABAergic SV markers VGLUT1 and VGAT demonstrated a significant decrease in the density of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic puncta in cultures exposed to LE-CSF compared to control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1i–j</xref>). Consistently, presynaptic labeling of both excitatory and inhibitory terminals with antibodies to SynI revealed a significant decrease of the SynI-positive puncta after LE-CSF treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1i–j</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>The pathophysiological effects of patient’s CSF are specifically due to anti-SynI antibodies</title>
<p id="Par8">To unambiguously demonstrate that the physiological effects were causally linked to SynI autoantibodies, we used affinity-purified anti-SynI monoclonal IgGs (SynI-mAb). Interestingly, treatments with SynI-mAb induced a significant reduction in the frequency and amplitude of both mEPSCs and mIPSCs compared to control conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a, b</xref>), fully mimicking the results obtained with either LE-CSF or CIS-CSF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). These finding suggest that the impairment of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission is specifically mediated by the autoantibodies to SynI.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>The synaptic effects of patient-derived SynI autoantibodies are mimicked by affinity-purified anti-SynI antibodies.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Mean frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs (<bold>a</bold>) and mIPSCs (<bold>b</bold>) in neurons exposed for 72 h to affinity-purified anti-SynI monoclonal antibodies (Synaptic System #106011; SynI-mAb, 1.5 μg/mL, red bar), as compared to vehicle (white bar).

<sec id="Sec5">
<title>The expression of endogenous SynI is required for limbic encephalitis CSF-induced effects on synaptic transmission</title>
<p id="Par9">Although SynI is an intracellular antigen that never gets exposed on the cell surface in healthy neurons, we asked whether the effects of CSF containing SynI autoantibodies could be mediated by the interaction of autoantibodies with endogenously expressed SynI protein. To test this hypothesis, we repeated the above experiments by exposing SynI KO neurons to patient CSF and evaluating the effect on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Unlike wild type neurons, SynI KO hippocampal cultures did not show any difference in frequency, amplitude and kinetics of both mEPSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a–d</xref>) and mIPSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e–h</xref>) when treated with either LE or control CSF. Consistent with these findings, there was no difference in the density of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in SynI KO hippocampal neurons treated with LE-CSF with respect to those treated with control CSF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3i, j</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that patient CSF-induced dysregulation in primary neurons strictly targets the endogenous SynI protein.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>The effects of LE-derived SynI autoantibodies on excitatory and inhibitory transmission and synapses are abolished in SynI KO hippocampal neurons.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Representative recordings of mEPSCs in SynI KO hippocampal neurons treated with either control CSF (1.5 μg/mL, black trace) or LE-CSF (1.5 μg/mL, green trace) for 72 h. <bold>b</bold>–<bold>d</bold> Cumulative distribution of inter-event intervals and mean frequency of mEPSCs (<bold>b</bold>), cumulative distribution and mean of mEPSC amplitude (<bold>c</bold>) and rise/decay times of mEPSCs (<bold>d</bold>). <bold>e</bold> Representative recordings of mIPSCs in SynI KO hippocampal neurons treated as described in (<bold>a</bold>)<bold>. f</bold>–<bold>h</bold> Cumulative distribution of inter-event intervals and mean frequency of mIPSCs (<bold>f</bold>), cumulative distribution and mean of mIPSC amplitude (<bold>g</bold>) and rise/decay times of mIPSCs (<bold>h</bold>).

<title>Internalization of SynI antibodies is mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis via Fc II/III receptors</title>
<p id="Par10">To detail the mechanism responsible for SynI antibody-mediated effects, we asked whether anti-SynI antibodies enter neurons. To this aim, cells were treated with either LE-CSF or SynI-mAb for 72 h, fixed, permeabilized and immunoreacted with anti-human or anti-mouse secondary antibodies, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). Patient CSF-treated cells showed an intense immune staining of neuronal bodies and dendrites compared to control CSF, and an even stronger staining pattern was observed after incubation with SynI-mAb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, c</xref>). In contrast, SynI KO neurons showed only a faint background signal under both conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b, c</xref>).

<p id="Par11">In contrast to autoantibodies directed to membrane-bound receptors, it has been long discussed whether and how antibodies against intracellular antigens could reach their target.

<p id="Par16">To test whether endocytosed anti-SynI antibodies form an intracellular complex with endogenous SynI, we applied two experimental strategies. First, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay in wild type neurons extracellularly exposed to the SynI-mAb antibody for 72 h. When the SynI-mAb was quantitatively pulled down from the cell extract with Protein-G beads, a detectable amount of endogenous SynI was co-immunoprecipitated, indicating the formation of an intracellular complex between the exogenous antibody and SynI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). Second, a physical interaction between the SynI-mAb and endogenous SynI was detected by the proximity ligation assay (PLA). WT and SynI KO neurons were treated with either vehicle or the SynI-mAb antibody for 72. After fixing, an affinity-purified rabbit antibody against the N-terminal domain of SynI, G143, was used to recognize endogenous SynI. Next, secondary antibodies coupled to different oligonucleotides (PLA rabbit and PLA mouse probes) were applied and the fluorescent PLA signal (red dots) generated by rolling-circle amplification was quantified. SynI-mAb-treated WT neurons showed abundant PLA dots compare to control conditions, whereas SynI KO neurons showed only few PLA puncta under both conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c, d</xref>).

<title>Release of anti-SynI antibodies in the cytosol impairs SynI-dependent SV clustering</title>
<p id="Par17">It was recently demonstrated that SynI undergoes phase separation and condensate in droplets under physiological conditions in vitro, suggesting that SynI can guide protein phase separation required for SV clustering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To assess whether exposure to SynI autoantibodies alters the ability of SynI to undergo phase separation and form droplets, we incubated purified GFP-SynI under conditions mimicking the intracellular milieu and analyzed the fluorescence signal by TIRF microscopy. After few minutes, GFP-SynI incubated with control CSF formed droplets and the process reached a plateau phase after 45 min, however clear and significant increase in droplet formation was observed after the exposure to patient’s CSF at both short and long time points (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a, b</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>The interaction between internalized SynI antibodies and SynI decreases SV density and increases SynI liquid phase separation.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Representative images (<bold>a</bold>) and frequency distribution (<bold>b</bold>) of GFP-SynI droplets incubated with either control CSF or LE-CSF (25 μg/ml) for 5 and 45 min.

<p id="Par18">If droplet formation reflects the state of aggregation of SynI and acts as sort of decoy mechanism for SynI during the SV cycle, one would expect a difference in the density of SVs in nerve terminals of neurons treated with LE-CSF, mimicking the effect of SynI deletion in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par20">Antibodies to cell adhesion molecules, neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, proteins related to synaptogenesis, neurotransmitter synthesis and SV endocytosis have been identified in numerous group of neurological diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown that antibodies to surface antigens have a clear pathogenic role in disease development and progression, whereas straightforward pathogenetic mechanisms are more difficult to identify for autoantibodies directed to intracellular antigens.</p>
<p id="Par21">We have recently identified intrathecally synthesized IgA/IgG autoantibodies to the SV-associated protein SynI in several patients suffering from various neuropsychiatric diseases, including limbic encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. SynI is a SV phosphoprotein playing multiple roles in synaptic transmission and plasticity. It participates in synapse formation and maintenance, plays a major role in clustering SVs creating a RP of SVs and regulating their availability for exocytosis, and differentially affects the post-docking steps of release in excitatory and inhibitory synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. It is currently believed that its action in the assembly of the SV RP occurs through oligomerization of Syn molecules that cross-link SVs and bind them to the actin cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Moreover, it was recently reported that SynI-induced phase separation in the cytoplasm of the nerve terminal restricts the formation of SV clusters in the proximity to presynaptic release sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par22">In this study, we provide evidence that human SynI autoantibodies can adversely contribute to synaptic dysfunction. Firstly, these antibodies alter excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons and decrease the levels of SynI-positive synaptic contacts. The effects are highly specific for SynI, as SynI KO neurons incubated with patient-derived CSF did not show any change in synaptic transmission. Moreover, an identical synaptic phenotype was observed using affinity-purified anti-SynI antibodies. The observed phenotype confirms the role of SynI in the formation and maintenance of synaptic connections, as well as in adjusting the number of synaptic connections in response to extracellular signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup></p>
<p id="Par23">Secondly, these antibodies are internalized by a clathrin-dependent endocytosis mediated by FcγII/III receptors, which bind the constant region of IgG and are highly expressed in neurons. These findings are consistent with a general role of FcγRs in antibody uptake, as previously shown for anti-Tau antibody internalization in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease and for IgGs from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient in spinal cord motor neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The neuronal uptake of the antibodies and the emergence neuronal phenotype are causally related, since inactivation of distinct mechanisms of endocytosis or neutralization of FcγRs largely abolished both the antibody uptake and the synaptopathy. Interestingly, no antibody accumulation was observed in SynI KO neurons. We speculate that antibody uptake is equally efficient in both genotypes, but that, once internalized into SynI KO neurons, SynI autoantibodies cannot bind the endogenous target and are therefore more prone to degradation. Once internalized, the exogenous antibodies escape the endocytic compartment and accumulate in the cytosol, where they bind endogenous SynI, as demonstrated by subcellular fractionation, immunoprecipitation and in situ PLA assays.</p>
<p id="Par24">Recent studies have shown liquid–liquid phase separation is a mechanism through which intracellular components can assemble into membrane-lacking compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and that SynI, present in high concentrations within nerve terminals, can undergo phase separation leading to SV clustering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Indeed, we found that the formation of a SynI/antibody complex after incubation with patient CSF increases droplet formation, reflecting an excessive SynI aggregation/sequestration that may impair clustering of SynI and induce their dispersion in the cytosol. Notably, treatment of neurons with patient CSF induced a synaptic phenotype characterized by decreased overall SV density with no change in the number of docked SVs that fully mimics the phenotype of SynI KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that anti-SynI antibodies determine a loss-of-function effect in primary neurons and also agree with the dramatic loss of SV clusters following injection of anti-SynI antibodies in giant reticulo-spinal axons of the lamprey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par25">In the diseases associated with GAD65 and amphiphysin autoantibodies, several findings have shown the pathogenic role of the autoantibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Since both intracellular antigens are involved in the SV exo-endocytotic cycle, one possibility is that they get transiently exposed to the extracellular environment during synaptic activity. This model could also account for SynI antibody uptake. Such a mechanism has been proposed for the nerve terminal uptake of Botulinum neurotoxins that bind to the intraluminal domains of the integral SV proteins SV2 and synaptotagmin that become exposed during exocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. However SynI, similarly to GAD and amphiphysin, is not an integral membrane protein and coats the cytosolic side of the SV membrane, so that it should never get exposed to the extracellular space during the SV cycle. Although the highly hydrophobic C domain of SynI partially penetrates the hydrophobic core of the SV membrane, it is highly unlikely that it can cross the whole membrane thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In addition, the SynI autoantibodies found in limbic encephalitis and clinically isolated syndrome patients are directed to the hydrophilic and highly immunogenic COOH-terminal domain that has a permanent cytosolic exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It is noteworthy to mention that the SynI COOH-terminal D-domain, target of epileptogenic mutations in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, plays a key role in SynI function: it participates in dimerization and hosts two CaM kinase II sites, whose phosphorylation regulates SynI binding to actin and SVs, as well as its phase separation properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par26">The etiology and pathogenesis of autoantibody-mediated brain diseases is only partially understood, as far as the antibody production trigger in the non-paraneoplastic cases and the antibody effects are concerned. It is possible that the intrathecal production of SynI autoantibodies is triggered by neuronal damage or by extracellular release of SV-bound SynI via exosomes under conditions of high neuronal activity or oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. While their presence may be an epiphenomenon of cell damage induced by the underlying neuronal pathology, the secondary production of SynI autoantibodies can play a role in disease progression and pleiotropy clinical symptoms (see refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> for review). Our work has the limitation of a small number of human samples and this frequently occurs in the earliest description of new clinical findings. However, our report provides a first proof of principle for the detrimental effects of anti-SynI antibodies in autoimmune diseases and may provide new insights in other forms of neurological pathologies associated with autoantibodies to intracellular self-antigens.</p>

Protein concentration of the samples was determined by the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad) and equivalent amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-SynI (5297, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-synaptophysin (10101, Synaptic System), rabbit anti-β-tubulin III (T2200, Sigma-Aldrich) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, USA). The presence and efficient immunoprecipitation of SynI-mAb was directly revealed by incubation of the nitrocellulose membrane with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Bands were revealed with the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Thermo Scientific) and quantified by densitometric analysis of the fluorograms.</p>

<title>Indirect proximity ligation assay (PLA)</title>
<p id="Par33">The in situ PLA was performed on WT and SynI KO neurons treated daily for 3 days (11–14 DIV) with a medium containing either 1.5 μg SynI-mAb antibody or vehicle. Cells were fixed PBS-4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature (RT), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. DuoLink PLA technology probes and reagents (DUO92008, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Two affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against SynI were used to recognize endogenous SynI: SynI G143 (directed against the SynI 3–13 peptide in the A domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>; SynI G115 (directed against the SynI 587–609 peptide in the D domain of SynI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Coverslips were mounted with Duolink mounting media with DAPI. Proximity ligation assay imaging was performed within 6 h using a confocal microscope (SP8, Leica Microsystems) at 63× (1.4 NA) magnification. The number of puncta per image was calculated using ImageJ (ver. 1.51 k). For each set of experiments, all images were acquired using identical exposure settings.</p>

<title>GFP-SynI protein expression and purification</title>
<p id="Par34">The expression vector for GFP-tagged rat SynI (a-isoform; GFP-SynI) was kindly donated by H.-T. Kao (Brown University, Providence, RI). GFP-Syn I was expressed in HEK293T cells using calcium phosphate (40 μg GFP-SynI for 3.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/150 mm dish). HEK293T cells were routinely cultured in IMDM (Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Life Technologies). HEK293T cells were lysed in buffer that contained 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Tris-2-carboxyethyl-phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), and protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF/1 mM pepstatin; Sigma-Aldrich). The lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 17,000 g, followed by affinity purification of GFP-SynI using GFP-Trap A (Chromotek, Germany) for 2 h. After extensive washes in washing buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP), bound proteins were eluted by 250 μL of 0.2 M glycine pH 2.5 followed by 30 s incubation under constant mixing and centrifugation. The supernatant was immediately neutralized by adding 25 μL of Tris-base (pH 10.4) and stored at −80 °C until use.</p>

<sec id="Sec19">
<title>Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p id="Par35">Droplets of GFP-SynI (1 μM) were prepared in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 3% PEG 8000 (Fluka Chemicals) in a final volume of 100 μl. Control CSF, patient CSF or water, in volumes equivalent to 3 μg patient’s IgG, was added to a final volume of 120 μL. For total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), the final mixture was immediately pipetted on 35 mm-glass bottom dishes (P35G-0-14-C, MatTek Corp, USA) pre-coated with poly-L-lysine (1 mg/ml, Sigma). TIRFM images were acquired at RT using AF6000LX/TIRF MC at ×100 magnification (PL FLUOTAR HCX N.A. 1.30-0.60 OIL 1.4 NA) (Leica) and processed using Image J software (ver. 1.51 k).</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p id="Par36">Results are presented as means ± SEM. All experiments were independently performed at least twice. No statistical methods were used to determine the sample size for experiments. Outliers were determined via Grubb’s test. Normal distribution of data were assessed using the Kolmogorov−Smirnov test. The two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare two normally distributed sample groups, while either one- or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test was used to compare more than two normally distributed sample groups. For datasets of non-normal distribution, Mann–Whitney test or Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s post hoc comparison were used. A <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was carried out using SigmaStat 13 (Systat Software).</p>
