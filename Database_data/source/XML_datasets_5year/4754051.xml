<abstract>
<p>Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons potentially present a powerful new model to understand corticogenesis and neurological disease. Previous work has established that differentiation protocols can produce cortical neurons, but little has been done to characterize these at cellular resolution. In particular, it is unclear to what extent <italic>in vitro</italic> two-dimensional, relatively disordered culture conditions recapitulate the development of <italic>in vivo</italic> cortical layer identity. Single-cell multiplex reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to interrogate the expression of genes previously implicated in cortical layer or phenotypic identity in individual cells. Totally, 93.6% of single cells derived from iPSCs expressed genes indicative of neuronal identity. High proportions of single neurons derived from iPSCs expressed glutamatergic receptors and synaptic genes. And, 68.4% of iPSC-derived neurons expressing at least one layer marker could be assigned to a laminar identity using canonical cortical layer marker genes. We compared single-cell RNA-seq of our iPSC-derived neurons to available single-cell RNA-seq data from human fetal and adult brain and found that iPSC-derived cortical neurons closely resembled primary fetal brain cells. Unexpectedly, a subpopulation of iPSC-derived neurons co-expressed canonical fetal deep and upper cortical layer markers. However, this appeared to be concordant with data from primary cells. Our results therefore provide reassurance that iPSC-derived cortical neurons are highly similar to primary cortical neurons at the level of single cells but suggest that current layer markers, although effective, may not be able to disambiguate cortical layer identity in all cells.</p>

<body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Investigating the cellular basis of neurological diseases, especially those affecting the central nervous system (CNS), is rendered particularly challenging by the inaccessibility of the tissues involved. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based models have the potential to allow <italic>in vitro</italic> investigation of these tissues in human samples from patients affected by such diseases and, importantly, how disease progresses over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C1">1</xref>). Protocols have been developed capable of generating cortical cells from human iPSCs, which appear to adopt specific cortical layer identities and develop functional synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C6">6</xref>).</p><p>Most transcriptomic studies of iPSC-derived cortical neurons have examined expression in samples pooled from a whole population of cells so would miss potential cell type-specific or layer-specific effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C8">8</xref>). The development of single-cell gene expression platforms, such as microfluidic chips, as well as evolving chip-free single-cell RNA-seq technologies, make such studies a viable method to investigate iPSC-derived cortical neuron cultures at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C10">10</xref>). This has the advantage that the relative abundance of different cell types may be discerned, and so comparisons between iPSC-derived and primary tissues can be made at the level of individual cells.</p><p>A core set of cortical layer markers has been used within the stem cell research community to establish the presence of neurons with different layer identities in iPSC-derived cortical neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C11">11</xref>). However, many of these markers were inferred from studies of mouse brain or immunohistochemistry of human fetal brain, so the robustness of such markers in assigning layer identity to single neurons by single-cell transcriptomics approaches is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C13">13</xref>).</p><p>The degree of heterogeneity present in cortical neurons derived from iPSCs is a critically important aspect of <italic>in vitro</italic> models to understand. Layer-specific and phenotypic cellular identity is particularly relevant prior to applying such models to address disease-specific hypotheses.</p><p>Cortical neurons derived from iPSCs using such methods have been used to study a wide variety of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions, and recapitulate disease-relevant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C1">1</xref>). In the case of Alzheimer's disease, iPSC-derived cortical neurons displayed aberrant Aβ secretion and tau phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C14">14</xref>). iPSC lines from autism spectrum disorder patients showed abnormalities in deep cortical layer formation and resulted in overproduction of GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C15">15</xref>). Studying the effect of disease pathology at a single-cell level is an attractive approach as it may allow identification of cellular processes that cause cell type or layer-specific vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C16">16</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used single-cell transcriptomic methodologies to investigate the extent to which iPSC-derived cortical cells express key neuronal genes relevant to cortical function. We also sought to examine whether iPSC neurons recapitulate normal cortical layer identity and to thereby assess the applicability of widely used cortical layer markers to the single-cell transcriptome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Single-cell RT-qPCR neuronal identity</title><p>We generated cortical neurons using a well-established protocol with small molecule dual SMAD inhibition for neural induction followed by plating of neuroepithelial cells for final differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C2">2</xref>).</p><p>Over the course of neuronal differentiation, cultures showed the expected decrease in expression of pluripotency genes and increased expression of neuronal genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV637F1">1</xref>A).

Cells were dissociated into a single-cell suspension, and single cells (178 cells from AH017-3, 153 from AH017-7 and 75 from NHDF1) were sorted into polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plates using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv637/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>). Multiplex single-cell reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was carried out on 96 genes previously implicated as important for neuronal function or cortical layer identity, housekeeping genes and negative control genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C19">19</xref>).</p><p>Of the 478 wells into which a single cell had been sorted, 406 (85.3%) wells were positive for expression of the housekeeper gene <italic>GAPDH</italic>. Of these, 380 (93.6%) expressed markers of neuronal identity (<italic>MAP2</italic>, <italic>NCAM1</italic> or <italic>TUBB3</italic>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv637/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>). The majority of these also expressed genes related to glutamatergic synapse function (e.g. <italic>GRIA1</italic> was detected in 63.9% of neurons, <italic>DLG4</italic> in 70.3% and <italic>SYN1</italic> in 67.6%).

This suggests that there is a considerable effect of <italic>in vitro</italic> maintenance on cellular transcriptomes. However, future protocols may refine this similarity, and so we analysed our single-cell RNA-seq in order to identify functional pathways that showed significant differences between primary neurons and iPSC-derived cortical neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV637F4">4</xref>). Genes identified as significantly more highly or lowly expressed in primary brain cells than in iPSC-derived cortical neurons by Monocle were submitted to DAVID for gene ontology analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C22">22</xref>).

As expected, there was considerably less expression of synaptic or ion channel-related pathways in iPSC-derived neurons than in adult cortical neurons, indicating that these cells remain electrophysiologically immature compared with mature brain tissue.

These cells accurately recapitulated the single-cell transcriptomic signature of human fetal cortical neurons, and expressed many genes associated with neuronal and synaptic function. Widely used cortical layer markers were able to assign the majority of cells unambiguously to deep or upper layer identity, but a considerable minority of cells co-expressed deep and upper layer markers.</p><p>Previous studies have compared bulk transcriptomic profiles of iPSC-derived cortical neurons to primary brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C24">24</xref>). When iPSC-derived cortical neurons were compared with donor-matched post-mortem brain, the similarity between iPSC-derived and primary cells increased with extended time in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C23">23</xref>). Another group showed that iPSC-derived neurons closely resembled fetal brain and that the equivalent ‘age’ of the cultured cells was increased by changing from a two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) <italic>in vitro</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C24">24</xref>). However, any comparison between cultured cells and primary tissue will be hampered by alterations in the ratios between different cell types. For example, the size of the glial population in fetal brain will change markedly overtime, and so the eventual production of glia in iPSC-derived cultures could well increase the apparent similarity of cultured cells to more mature primary tissue without any change in the underlying neuronal transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C4">4</xref>). Single-cell transcriptomics offers a method of assessing the similarity of iPSC-derived cells to primary tissue with the ability to remove the confounding introduced by cellular heterogeneity. Our study shows that even at the level of individual cells, there is marked similarity to human fetal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C21">21</xref>).</p><p>There are clearly still transcriptomic differences between iPSC-derived cortical neurons and primary fetal cells, as highlighted by our differential gene analysis. iPSC-derived cortical neurons show higher expression of genes related to glycolysis and catabolism of amino acids than is the case for fetal neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, which may be a result of the abnormality of <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. Similarly, the lack of structured cell migratory pathways <italic>in vitro</italic> was clear from the transcriptomic signature of iPSC-derived cells, with markedly lower expression of <italic>DCX</italic>, <italic>ROBO2</italic> and other genes involved in neuronal motility. Relatively simple 2D adherent monolayer neuronal cultures are more amenable for high-throughput screens, but potentially more organized, 3D models may improve matters. However, without a morphologically defined ventriculo-pial gradient <italic>in vitro</italic>, there may still be deficits in differentiation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C24">24</xref>). The fact that iPSC-derived cortical neurons cluster distinctly from adult cortical neurons may result in issues when attempting to model neurodegenerative disorders using these systems. This means that care should be taken when making molecular inferences regarding adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases from studies in iPSC-derived systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C25">25</xref>). This is supported by the lack of detectable expression of many adult markers of cortical neurons and suggests that iPSC-derived cortical neurons are relatively immature compared with primary brain neurons. Regional specification of the iPSC-derived cortical neurons is also difficult to assess, as some of the key markers of neocortical regions are transcription factors that are expressed at relatively low level and may therefore be missed by a single-cell transcriptomic approach. Our gene ontology enrichment analysis suggested that the expression of some key genes involved in neuronal development was lower in iPSC-derived cortical neurons than in primary adult or fetal neurons (e.g. <italic>CDK5R1</italic>, <italic>LPPR4</italic>, <italic>PTPRZ1</italic>, <italic>BCL11B</italic>, <italic>MAP1B</italic>, <italic>ROBO2</italic>, <italic>NRXN1</italic>, <italic>DCX</italic>, <italic>GAS7</italic>, <italic>RPS27A</italic>). Hopefully attention to these pathways may help guide improvements to existing differentiation protocols. Despite these limitations, stem cell-derived models of corticogenesis are still likely to represent the best <italic>in vitro</italic> human model amenable to molecular manipulation of cells for the foreseeable future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C26">26</xref>).</p><p>Many of the canonical layer markers used to infer cortical layer identity in iPSC-derived cortical neurons have been informed primarily by rodent models of corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C12">12</xref>). It is perhaps therefore surprising that they were able to assign the majority of single-cell transcriptomes generated from iPSC-derived neurons to either deep or upper layer identity. However, there was clearly a subpopulation of neurons that had mixed layer identity.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this appeared also to be the case when we examined layer identity in available single-cell RNA-seq data from 21-week post-conception fetal and adult cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C21">21</xref>). This may represent neurons with truly mixed deep and upper layer identities, or alternatively, the cortical layer markers widely used to assess layer identity do not function well in a minority of cells. For the primary neuron data, it is also possible that there was spill-over between C1 capture sites in the primary brain single-cell RNA-seq experiments, but we feel this is unlikely to be the case because two empty C1 capture sites had no detectable expression of any of the presumptive layer markers. This would also not explain the co-occurrence of deep and upper layer markers in our multiplex RT-qPCR dataset, which was obtained by FACS.</p><p>Longitudinal bulk transcriptomic data obtained from cortical neurons-derived from human embryonic stem cells have shown that genes regarded as upper layer markers actually appear to peak early in differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C27">27</xref>). Whether or not this gene expression signature is driven by neurons is impossible to ascertain from bulk transcriptomic approaches. Our single-cell data and analysis of published data suggest that some single cortical neurons can co-express multiple layer markers. When we extended the duration that the cells remained in culture out to 180 days (∼25 weeks), we detected a high proportion of mixed layer identity, suggesting that this is not simply a transitory state in neuronal differentiation, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>. In fact, we found that the proportion of different subpopulations of cells detected did not vary significantly between 81 and 180 days. We feel that the few non-neuronal cells detected in our cultures are likely to be neural progenitors.</p><p>Many fetal layer markers show reciprocal regulation, and in rodent models of corticogenesis, mixed layer identity may indicate aberrant neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C29">29</xref>). Later stages of fetal corticogenesis demonstrate defined distributions of layer-specific markers as detected by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C13">13</xref>). Whether this co-expression is detectable at the protein level in human cortex is unclear and should be examined in future studies. However, we observed the translation of layer marker co-expression into protein in iPSC-derived cortical neurons. This may represent neurons with truly mixed deep and upper layer identities, or alternatively, the cortical layer markers widely used in iPSC-derived cortical neuron cultures to assess layer identity do not function well in a minority of cells.</p><p>Mixed cortical layer identity is a potential limitation to consider when modelling neurological diseases, particularly those in which layer identity is important, such as Alzheimer's disease and many neurodevelopmental conditions, since, unlike <italic>in vivo</italic>, spatial distribution cannot be used as a proxy for cortical layer identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C31">31</xref>). Our findings suggest that layer identity may be better established by combining single-cell transcriptomics with functional read-outs such as electrophysiology than by relying on the expression of single transcription factors.</p><p>iPSC-derived cortical neurons appear to recapitulate accurately the transcriptome of human fetal corticogenesis but are distinct from adult neurons. Canonical layer markers traditionally used to assign cells to cortical layers are capable of assigning the majority of cells unambiguously to either deep or upper layer identity. However, a subpopulation of cells shows mixed layer identity both at the level of RNA and protein expression. A degree of mixed layer identity also appears to be present in primary cortical neurons. Overall, our findings suggest that protocols to derive cortical neurons from iPSCs are a good model of fetal corticogenesis and produce cells that accurately mimic <italic>in vivo</italic> fetal cortical neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The human hiPS cell lines derived for this study were derived from human skin biopsy fibroblasts, following signed informed consent, with approval from a research ethics committee: National Health Service, Health Research Authority, NRES Committee South Central—Berkshire, UK, who specifically approved this part of the study—REC 10/H0505/71.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Derivation of iPSCs</title><p>iPSC lines were derived from skin biopsy fibroblasts in the James Martin Stem Cell Facility, University of Oxford, and all cultured under standardized protocols to minimize any potential variation attributable to laboratory differences and/or handling.

Additional single-cell RNA-seq data were downloaded from Pollen <italic>et al.</italic> (Accession Number SRP041736) and Darmanis <italic>et al.</italic> (Accession Number GSE67835) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X100. These were then incubated with blocking buffer before applying the primary antibody. After washing with PBS, fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied. This was further washed and mounted using Dako fluorescence mounting medium on a glass slide for confocal microscopy. Antibodies were used as detailed in Shi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C2">2</xref>). The specificity of these antibodies was tested by staining undifferentiated iPSC and demonstrating no detectable signal withantibodies against NANOG as a positive control. Analysis of layer marker co-expression was performed by Cytospin (Thermo Scientific) preparation of dissociated iPSC-derived cortical neurons as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C2">2</xref>) followed by the counting of five fields of view stained by DAPI and for various combinations of layer markers. Results are presented as mean proportions ± standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>A coverslip containing iPSC-derived cortical neurons was placed in a recording chamber mounted onto the stage of an upright microscope, and the somata of cortical neurons were targeted for recording using IR-DIC optics.

In accordance with guidelines on single-cell RT-qPCR analysis, Ct values were analysed without adjusting for housekeeping gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C9">9</xref>). Genes with detectable expression were defined as those with a Ct value of &lt;30. A well was defined as containing a cell that had been successfully reverse transcribed if there were detectable levels of <italic>GAPDH</italic> (Ct &lt; 30). We tested primer efficacy with single-cell cDNA by conducting a dilution series and found good linear amplification for detectable genes (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.98 ± 0.03; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv637/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S7A</ext-link>). Genes were excluded from downstream analysis if these showed poor inter-chip reliability (the same single-cell cDNA analysed on different chips). There was excellent correlation of gene expression between technical replicates (median <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.96 ± 0.05; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv637/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S7B</ext-link>). Ct values were adjusted between batches by the difference in mean <italic>GAPDH</italic> and <italic>ACTB</italic> expression relative to the first replicate of AH017-3. Cells were classified as neurons if there was detectable expression of <italic>MAP2</italic>, <italic>NCAM1</italic> or <italic>TUBB3</italic>. Cortical layer identity was established through the expression of candidate layer markers: deep layer markers: <italic>BCLB11</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic>; upper layer markers: <italic>CUX1</italic>, <italic>POU3F2</italic> and <italic>SATB2</italic>. Internal controls were also used to estimate the magnitude of technical variation between Biomark analysis runs. The significance of PCA clustering was calculated by applying a Wilcoxon test to the distance between individual centroid locations for each group of points to be analysed compared with the distance to the centroid for the pooled points of both groups. Co-expression was analysed by calculating correlation coefficients on the original dataset for pairs of cortical layer markers and then randomly permuting these Ct values 10 000 times. An empirical two-tailed <italic>P</italic>-value was estimated from this distribution and corrected for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.</p><p>RNA-seq reads were processed using Trimmomatic with the arguments ‘LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:50’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C41">41</xref>). Trimmed reads were aligned against the hg19 UCSC genome assembly using Tophat2 (version 2.0.13, arguments ‘-p 8 -G &lt; genome bt2 index &gt;−1 &lt; forward reads &gt;−2 &lt; backward reads&gt;’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C42">42</xref>). Overall alignment rates for iPSC-derived cortical neurons were ∼67% with ∼4000 detectable genes per cell. Fragments were assigned to UCSC known genes with Rsubread (version 1.16.1, arguments ‘isGTFAnnotationFile = TRUE, GTF.featureType=‘exon’, GTF.attrType=‘gene_name’, useMetaFeatures = TRUE, allowMultiOverlap = FALSE, isPairedEnd = TRUE, requireBothEndsMapped=thinsp;TRUE, checkFragLength = FALSE, nthreads = 8, strandSpecific = 0, minMQS = 0, countMultiMappingReads = FALSE, countChimericFragments = FALSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C43">43</xref>). Counts were adjusted for library sizes using DESeq (version 1.20.0, estimateSizeFactorsForMatrix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C44">44</xref>). Cells were removed during QC if the number of expressed genes was lower that the boxplot lower limit (i.e. an outlier), if the proportion of fragments aligning to mitochondrial genes was high (&gt;0.15 as suggested in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C45">45</xref>)) or if the cell was an outlier on initial PCA (single cells of the same type were analysed by PCA and were excluded if &gt;5 times the median absolute deviation from the centroid). A gene was considered detectable if at least one fragment with both paired reads uniquely mapped was assigned to it. PCA was illustrated for the top 300 genes explaining the first two principal components as well as for the whole transcriptome. Cells types of single cells from primary tissue datasets were provided by the respective study authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C21">21</xref>). Differential gene analysis of single-cell data was conducted using Monocle with an FDR threshold of 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C46">46</xref>). We only considered genes differentially expressed if the gene was detectable in &gt;10% of cells at a mean expression level FPKM &gt; 1 in at least one type of cell where the direction of change in the proportion of cells expressing the gene and the magnitude of mean expression were the same. Gene ontology analysis was conducted in DAVID using all detectable genes as the background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV637C22">22</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv637/-/DC1">Supplementary Material is available at <italic>HMG</italic> online</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Authors’ Contributions</title><p>A.E.H.: conception and design, financial support, provision of study material or patients, collection and/or assembly of data, data analysis and interpretation, manuscript writing, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>S.C.: provision of study material or patients, collection and/or assembly of data, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>T.L.: collection and/or assembly of data, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>E.W.: provision of study material or patients, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>J.V.: provision of study material or patients, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>A.G.: collection and/or assembly of data, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>K.A.: collection and/or assembly of data, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>P.S.: collection and/or assembly of data, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>M.N.: provision of study material or patients, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>R.B.: collection and/or assembly of data, financial support, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>S.C.: provision of study material or patients, collection and/or assembly of data, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>S.N.: provision of study material or patients, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>C.A.: provision of study material or patients, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>C.P.P.: data analysis and interpretation, financial support, manuscript writing, final approval of manuscript.</p><p>M.Z.C.: conception and design, financial support, provision of study material or patients, data analysis and interpretation, manuscript writing, final approval of manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Funding</title><p>This project was supported by StemBANCC funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking under Grant Agreement Number 115439, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the <funding-source>European Union's Seventh Framework Programme</funding-source> (<award-id>FP7/2007e2013</award-id>) and EFPIA companies in kind contribution.
