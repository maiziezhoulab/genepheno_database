<abstract>
<p>Aberrant chromatin regulation is a frequent driver of leukemogenesis. Mutations in chromatin regulators often result in more stem-like cells that seed a bulk leukemic population. Inhibitors targeting these proteins represent an emerging class of therapeutics, and identifying further chromatin regulators that promote disease progression may result in additional drug targets. We identified the chromatin-modifying protein CHD8 as necessary for cell survival in a mouse model of BCR-Abl+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This disease has a poor prognosis despite treatment with kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-Abl. Although implicated as a risk factor in autism spectrum disorder and a tumor suppressor in prostate and lung cancer, the mechanism of CHD8’s activity is still unclear and has never been studied in the context of hematopoietic malignancies. Here we demonstrate that depletion of CHD8 in B-ALL cells leads to cell death. While multiple B cell malignancies were dependent on CHD8 expression for survival, T cell malignancies displayed milder phenotypes upon CHD8 knockdown. In addition, ectopic expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain in a T cell malignancy partially alleviated the detrimental effect of CHD8 depletion. Our results demonstrate that CHD8 has a context-dependent role in cell survival, and its inhibition may be an effective treatment for B lymphoid malignancies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ B-ALL) accounts for approximately 20% of adult cases of leukemia in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref001">1</xref>]. This disease has a poor prognosis despite the development of multiple inhibitors targeting the BCR-Abl fusion tyrosine kinase that drives this disease. Patients initially respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) but quickly relapse, usually acquiring resistance due to mutations in the <italic>Abl</italic> kinase domain that prevent TKI binding, upregulation of drug efflux pumps, or activation of alternative signaling pathways such as SRC family kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref004">4</xref>]. Our group previously performed a large-scale RNAi screen in a mouse model of this disease to identify factors that promote cell survival in Ph+ B-ALL and could serve as novel drug targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref005">5</xref>]. This model expresses a human <italic>BCR-Abl</italic> transgene and a disrupted <italic>p19</italic>
<sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> locus, closely recapitulating the genetics of the human disease as approximately 50% of Ph+ B-ALL patients exhibit loss-of-function of the CDKN2A/B locus that contains <italic>p19</italic>
<sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref007">7</xref>]. In addition, most cells can give rise to disease in transplant experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref006">6</xref>], so this model is able to represent a highly complex RNAi library <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Among the list of screening hits were shRNAs targeting chromatin modifiers with established roles in cancer such as <italic>Sin3a</italic>, underscoring the importance of epigenetic regulation in leukemia progression. Inhibitors of chromatin modifiers represent an emerging class of therapeutics that holds great potential, and recent work has suggested that inhibiting these enzymes could help circumvent acquired resistance to existing drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref010">10</xref>]. Another chromatin modifier that arose as a candidate hit in this screen was <italic>Chd8</italic>. <italic>Chd8</italic> has been associated with autism spectrum disorder as well as cancer, but its mechanism of action is not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref017">17</xref>]. Several roles in transcriptional regulation and target gene sets have been proposed, but a consensus on the precise function of CHD8 has yet to emerge.</p>
<p>CHD8 was discovered in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a β-catenin binding partner that inhibits transcription of β-catenin target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref018">18</xref>]. A proposed role of CHD8 is negative regulation of p53 and Wnt pathway activity through chromatin compaction at target genes during early embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref020">20</xref>]. Other studies have demonstrated a role of CHD8 in cell cycle regulation including promoting transcription of E2F target genes involved in the G1/S transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>While multiple groups have measured higher CHD8 expression in cancer cells than normal adult tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref023">23</xref>], other groups have observed loss of expression in gastric and colorectal cancers and deletion in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref024">24</xref>]. It is intriguing that CHD8 appears to act in a pro-proliferative or pro-survival manner in most contexts but as a tumor suppressor in other malignancies, perhaps through inhibition of Wnt signaling. Further investigation is needed to determine the context in which CHD8 inhibition would be detrimental to the tumor and thus advantageous to patients. For this reason we pursued further investigation into the pro-survival function of CHD8 in BCR-Abl+ B-ALL cells.</p>
<p>We characterized <italic>Chd8</italic> as a pro-survival gene in this model of BCR-Abl+ B-ALL, confirming the RNAi screening results. Depletion of CHD8 resulted in cell death, but without a preceding cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, we found differing requirements for CHD8 expression between B and T cell malignancies. T-ALL cells expressing the intracellular domain of Notch (ICN) were less dependent on CHD8 expression, and ectopic expression of ICN in K-ras driven T-cell lymphoma cells partially rescued the dependency of these cells on CHD8 expression. We conclude that CHD8 is a context-dependent pro-survival factor, and that constitutive Notch signaling is able to compensate for CHD8 loss through mechanisms that are not yet fully understood.</p>

<title>CHD8 depletion is detrimental to growth of BCR-Abl+ B-ALL cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
</title>
<p>To validate that the deleterious effect of the original shRNA targeting <italic>Chd8</italic> in the screen is due to knockdown of the intended target, additional constructs targeting <italic>Chd8</italic> were designed and tested by GFP competition assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In these assays, a population of cells is partially transduced with a retroviral vector expressing an shRNA linked to a GFP marker to allow identification of shRNA-expressing cells by flow cytometry. As with the original shRNA identified by the screen, an additional shRNA also led to a significant decrease in CHD8 expression at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Consistent with an on-target effect, both constructs led to depletion of transduced B-ALL cells over time, both in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Depletion of sh<italic>Chd8-</italic>expressing leukemic cells was observed in all lymphatic tissues examined (spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood). These results indicate that the detrimental effects of CHD8 knockdown are cell-autonomous and independent of the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, while sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-0 appears to confer its deleterious phenotype more rapidly than sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, cells expressing sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-1 deplete to a similar extent when examined over a longer period of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143275.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The model of BCR-Abl+ B-ALL utilized in this study is very aggressive, giving rise to terminal disease in less than two weeks following tail vein injection of 2 million cells into immunocompetent syngeneic mice. We predicted that CHD8 depletion in transplanted B-ALL cells would increase time to disease due to attenuation of cell viability and tumor growth. Cells expressing sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-1 or a GFP vector control were sorted to obtain pure GFP+ populations. Very low numbers of cells were transplanted by tail vein injection into each of 30 C57BL/6 mice (15 per cohort), and time to morbidity was monitored. Time to terminal disease was indeed extended significantly in mice injected with CHD8-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Disease penetrance was decreased as well, with only 2 mice in the sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-1 cohort succumbing to disease, compared with 10 mice in the control cohort. When mice reached morbidity, cells from the spleen and peripheral blood were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP expression. Interestingly, cells collected from mice in the control cohort were polyclonal and expressed GFP, but cells harvested from mice injected with CHD8-depleted cells were GFP-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). These results indicate that disease onset in these mice was caused by the outgrowth of a small number of GFP-negative cells contaminating the injected population.</p>
<p>As additional confirmation that the detrimental effects of these shRNAs are due to depletion of CHD8, we performed gene editing using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. B-ALL cells expressing the tdTomato fluorophore were transfected with one of three single-guide sequences cloned into a CRISPR-Cas9 vector. Single cell clones were generated and tested for gene editing and loss of CHD8 protein expression (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143275.s002">S2</xref>). These cells were mixed with unlabeled control B-ALL cells to carry out <italic>in vitro</italic> growth competition assays. We observed depletion of tdTomato+, <italic>Chd8</italic>-edited B-ALL cells relative to control cells in these assays, confirming that loss of CHD8 is detrimental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, B-ALL cells transduced with guide sequences targeting Renilla luciferase, which is not expressed in these cells, expressed normal levels of CHD8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143275.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) did not deplete in similar growth competition assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In addition, mice were injected with low numbers of B-ALL cells grown from these CHD8-deficient or control clonal populations (10 mice per cohort). All 20 mice injected with control B-ALL cells succumbed to disease by Day 39 after injection, but only 6 out of 40 mice injected with cells deficient for CHD8 developed disease within 11 weeks of injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>An inducible RNAi vector allows examination of gene function in a temporally controlled manner</title>
<p>In order to study the downstream molecular effects of <italic>Chd8</italic> knockdown in a temporally controlled manner, an shRNA targeting <italic>Chd8</italic> was cloned into the doxycycline-inducible retroviral vector TRMPVIR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref026">26</xref>]. This vector utilizes a Tet-On system to control transcription of an shRNA.

When transduced into B-ALL cells, TRMPVIR-sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-1 leads to a marked reduction of CHD8 expression by 12 hours following treatment with doxycycline, while CHD8 levels in cells transduced with TRMPVIR expressing a Renilla luciferase shRNA (shRen) are not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>CHD8 depletion leads to cell death without a preceding cell cycle arrest</title>
<p>Others have found that CHD8 depletion leads to a decrease in expression of <italic>CCNE2</italic> and <italic>TYMS</italic> and a subsequent cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref021">21</xref>]. We examined <italic>CCNE2</italic> as well as <italic>CCNE1</italic> expression by qPCR in B-ALL cells expressing TRMPVIR-sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-1 or the shRen control. Surprisingly, mRNA expression levels of <italic>CCNE1</italic> and <italic>CCNE2</italic> were found to be slightly higher in CHD8-depleted cells after 48 hours of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This result seemed counter to the expected outcome in that a decrease in cyclin expression rather than an increase would be expected to be detrimental to cell cycle progression. To determine if this change in <italic>CCNE1</italic> and <italic>CCNE2</italic> levels correlated with a change in cell cycle profile, cell cycle analysis was carried out on these populations. Flow cytometry analysis revealed no significant change in the cell cycle profile upon CHD8 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), indicating that dysregulation of <italic>CCNE1</italic> and <italic>CCNE2</italic> transcription upon CHD8 depletion does not lead to a G1/S arrest in B-ALL cells.</p>
<p>However, these results do not preclude the possibility that CHD8 depletion leads to a prolonged doubling time in these cells, lengthening each stage of the cell cycle rather than arresting in a particular stage. CHD8 depletion could also lead to cell death without a preceding cell cycle arrest. To test this possibility, we retrovirally infected cells with a puromycin-selectable vector expressing one of two sh<italic>Chd8</italic> constructs or a vector control. Following puromycin selection, 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> live cells per construct were plated in triplicate, and the total numbers of live and dead cells were quantified at 24-hour intervals. Both sh<italic>Chd8</italic> constructs caused a decrease in the apparent growth rates of B-ALL cells and an increase in the percentages of dead cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>). Taken together, these results argue that the depletion of sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-expressing cells observed in the growth competition assays is due to cell death rather than slowed proliferation.</p>
<p>Notably, this death may not be due to canonical apoptosis as treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk simultaneously with doxycycline did not prevent CHD8 knockdown-mediated cell death an in <italic>in vitro</italic> growth competition assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143275.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). In addition, no evidence of caspase 3 cleavage was seen by western blot at 12, 24, 48, or 72 hours after doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143275.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Ectopic expression of CHD8 N-terminal domains</title>
<p>Given that a number of CHD8 domains have been shown to interact with specific binding partners including p53, β-catenin, CTCF, and methylated H3K4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref029">29</xref>], we reasoned that determining the domains necessary for CHD8 function in B-ALL cells might inform important pro-survival roles. Previously, others have found that overexpression of a 110 kDa truncated N-terminal isoform of murine CHD8 called Duplin was able to rescue cells from p53-mediated apoptosis as effectively as full-length CHD8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref019">19</xref>]. Duplin contains the first of the two chromodomains in CHD8, but not other identified functional domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref029">29</xref>]. We hypothesized that overexpression of this truncated isoform might be able to rescue the sh<italic>Chd8</italic> phenotype in B-ALL cells. <italic>Duplin</italic> cDNA was PCR-amplified from B-ALL cDNA and cloned into an MSCV-IRES-GFP (pMIG) retroviral vector. Transduction of B-ALL cells with pMIG-<italic>Duplin</italic> led to high expression of the protein as expected, however endogenous expression of Duplin was not observed in untransduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Previous studies did not measure Duplin expression in blood, so it is possible that only the full-length isoform is expressed in murine lymphoid cells. However, we were also unable to detect expression of multiple isoforms of <italic>Chd8</italic> by qPCR in other murine tissues including brain, liver, lung, and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Although this isoform may not normally be expressed, we reasoned that if the domains found in Duplin are important for CHD8 function in B-ALL cells, Duplin overexpression would still be able to prevent depletion of sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-expressing cells in growth competition assays. sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-1 was selected for use in rescue experiments as it is specific for the full-length isoform. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, exogenous expression of Duplin was unable to prevent depletion of sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-expressing cells, suggesting that the domains found in Duplin are not sufficient to rescue the effects of CHD8 depletion. While a full-length cDNA control that does rescue the CHD8 knockdown phenotype would make these results more conclusive, the large size of this cDNA (7.75 kb) made it challenging to clone and express in B-ALL cells despite several attempts.</p>

<title>Differential requirement for CHD8 expression in hematopoietic malignancies</title>
<p>While CHD8 expression is required in untransformed pre-B cells, malignancies with different genetic backgrounds or within different developmental contexts may have mechanisms that allow cell survival in the absence of this protein. We reasoned that identifying a context-specific survival requirement could shed light on CHD8 function. To determine whether dependency on CHD8 extends to other hematopoietic malignancies, we first tested another cancer of the B cell lineage, a murine model of Burkitt’s lymphoma. In this model, c-<italic>myc</italic> is under the transcriptional control of the μ immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (Eμ-<italic>myc</italic>), mimicking the t(8;14)(q24;q32) chromosomal translocation that causes this disease in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref032">32</xref>]. We transduced these cells with shRNAs targeting <italic>Chd8</italic> and confirmed decreased protein expression by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). As with BCR-Abl+ B-ALL cells, Eμ-<italic>myc</italic> cells expressing these shRNAs deplete in <italic>in vitro</italic> growth competition assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), and pure populations of shRNA-expressing cells display decreased proliferation rates and increased numbers of dead cells compared with cells expressing vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent study into vulnerabilities of drug-resistant T-ALL cells uncovered a number of epigenetic regulators that became essential upon acquisition of drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref008">8</xref>]. CHD8 was one of several epigenetic regulators found to be preferentially required for survival by γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI)-resistant cells over syngeneic, GSI-sensitive cells. These resistant cells exhibited a lower level of Notch signaling than the sensitive population, suggesting that high Notch pathway activity may somehow compensate for CHD8 loss. In agreement with these results, we found that a T-ALL cell line that constitutively expresses the intracellular domain of Notch (“Top Notch”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref033">33</xref>], and thus exhibits constitutive activation of the Notch pathway, is less dependent on CHD8 expression for survival than the B cell malignancies tested. Top Notch cells expressing sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-1 did not deplete in <italic>in vitro</italic> growth competition assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<sup><italic>LSL/LSL</italic></sup> mouse (hereafter referred to as KP).

KP lymphoma cells deplete upon CHD8 knockdown in growth competition assays, but to a lesser extent than B cell malignancies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0143275.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The distinction between CHD8 dependencies in these two T cell populations could shed light on the mechanism of CHD8 activity. To determine if constitutive Notch signaling could rescue the CHD8 knockdown phenotype, KP lymphoma cells were transduced with the Notch intracellular domain (ICN) linked to a GFP marker, or a GFP marker alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0143275.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref036">36</xref>]. Ectopic ICN expression is lethal to B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref037">37</xref>], so they could not be used for these experiments. Transduced KP cells were sorted to obtain pure GFP+ populations, then partially transduced with one of two sh<italic>Chd8</italic> constructs linked to a tdTomato marker, or a vector control. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to assess the change in percentage of tdTomato+ cells in each population.

This result indicates that constitutive Notch signaling can attenuate the detrimental effects of CHD8 knockdown in KP lymphoma cells, possibly overriding a reduction in survival or growth signals caused by CHD8 depletion that other oncogenic signaling pathways are unable to compensate for.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that CHD8 is necessary for survival of B lymphoid malignancies. This dependency exists in both the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings, indicating that CHD8 functions in a cell-autonomous manner and its depletion does not alter interactions of B-ALL cells with their microenvironment. When we examined the effects of CHD8 depletion on leukemic cell proliferation, we uncovered a cell death phenotype not preceded by cell cycle arrest. Others have shown that CHD8 knockdown in cervical carcinoma cells leads to G1 arrest facilitated by downregulation of <italic>CCNE2</italic> and <italic>TYMS</italic>, genes required for transition into S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref021">21</xref>]. However, when we examined cell cycle profiles of B-ALL cells upon CHD8 knockdown, we observed no difference between control and CHD8-depleted cells. It is possible that the differences between our results and those of Rodriguez-Paredes <italic>et al</italic>. are due to the distinct signaling contexts in the two cell types used.</p>
<p>Several early studies observed expression of a truncated N-terminal CHD8 isoform termed Duplin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref019">19</xref>]. We found that exogenous expression of Duplin did not compensate for CHD8 knockdown, suggesting that domains unique to full-length CHD8 are crucial for its function in B-ALL cells. The second chromodomain, absent in Duplin, has been shown to enable binding to histone H3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref021">21</xref>], and the BRK domains at the C-terminus have been demonstrated to interact with the chromatin insulator CTCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref029">29</xref>]. It is curious that, unlike results of previous studies, endogenous Duplin expression was not found in B-ALL cells or in normal mouse tissues by qPCR. Bioinformatics databases currently show truncated isoforms of CHD8 only in rat, so it is likely that murine Duplin is an experimental artifact not physiologically expressed.</p>
<p>Previous work by our group has highlighted genes whose effect on survival is context-specific between B and T cell malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref005">5</xref>]. For example, the chromatin regulator PHF6 is required for survival of B-ALL cells, but loss-of-function is selected for in T-ALL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref038">38</xref>]. Factors such as HES1 that promote T lineage development are often lethal when ectopically expressed in the B cell lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref037">37</xref>]. We found that Top Notch T-ALL cells are significantly less dependent on CHD8 expression than the B cell malignancies tested. The results of the ICN rescue experiment indicate that constitutive Notch signaling can partially compensate for CHD8 knockdown in a T cell malignancy, consistent with results of a recent screen for chromatin regulators that are essential in GSI-resistant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0143275.ref008">8</xref>]. CHD8 was among the proteins found to be necessary for survival of resistant cells but not syngeneic GSI-sensitive cells that continued to exhibit high levels of ICN and a more open chromatin conformation. These results suggest that CHD8 and high Notch signaling are able to compensate for each other’s absence through mechanisms that are currently unclear. It is possible that CHD8 compensates for chromatin compaction upon Notch inhibition by promoting transcription. Alternatively, CHD8-mediated chromatin compaction could promote survival of GSI-resistant cells that have downregulated Notch signaling. Additional investigation is needed to determine the lineage-specific mechanism of CHD8’s pro-survival activity.</p>
<p>A growing body of literature shows that inhibition of chromatin-modifying proteins is a promising field of investigation and drug development. Inhibiting these factors may correct global transcriptional deregulation instigated by events such as Myc overexpression. Our work suggests CHD8 is a potential drug target in B cell malignancies provided toxicity in normal hematopoietic cells is not limiting. Our results and those of others indicate that inhibiting CHD8 would not be as effective in T cell malignancies driven by Notch signaling, and could be counter-productive in certain solid tumors. However, CHD8 inhibition could synergize with γ-secretase inhibitors in cells that have become resistant through epigenetic mechanisms. When compared to our knowledge of other chromatin-modifying proteins, our understanding of the function of CHD8 is relatively incomplete. Nonetheless, it is clear that CHD8 has critical roles in cell survival, and additional investigation should be conducted to better define its place within central signaling pathways.</p>

The percentage of Venus<sup>+</sup>dsRed<sup>+</sup> cells was assessed every two days by flow cytometry, and the fold change from time of plating to the end of the assay (eight days) was calculated. Shown are averages and SD of triplicate wells.</p>

<title>Caspase 3 cleavage is not observed upon induction of sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-1.</title>
<p>A pure population of BCR-Abl+ B-ALL cells expressing TRMPVIR sh<italic>Chd8</italic>-1 was plated with or without doxycycline and collected at the indicated times. Protein lysates were generated and analyzed by western blot for the presence of cleaved (17 kDa) and pro-caspase 3 (53 kDa). Actin was used as a loading control. Image cropped to align discontinuous lanes from the same membrane.</p>
