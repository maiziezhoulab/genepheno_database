<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Developmental eye anomalies, including anophthalmia (absent eye), microphthalmia (small eye) and coloboma (gap in the eye structure) (AMC) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders affecting 11.9 per 100,000 live births<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Increasing numbers of causative genes have been identified for these anomalies, including <italic>SOX2</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, <italic>OTX2</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, <italic>BMP4</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, <italic>BMP7</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and <italic>STRA6</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Recently, Williamson <italic>et al</italic>. reported two large pedigrees each containing multiple individuals with developmental eye anomalies which were inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. In both families they identified co-segregating heterozygous nonsense mutations in <italic>YAP1</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In addition to the eye anomalies, affected members of one family also exhibited variable extraocular features including hearing loss, intellectual disability, haematuria and orofacial clefting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Further screening of <italic>YAP1</italic> in a large cohort of individuals with eye anomalies identified an additional four variants classified as of unknown pathogenicity for various reasons: being inherited from an unaffected parent (1 case), parental DNA being unavailable (2 cases), or as the mutation was a copy number variant affecting multiple genes, including <italic>YAP1</italic> (1 case)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Similarly, Oatts <italic>et al</italic>. identified a novel heterozygous mutation in a family with coloboma and microphthalmia with evidence of incomplete penetrance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Finally, Fossdal <italic>et al</italic>. identified a mutation of TEAD1, a cofactor of YAP1, as a cause of helicoid peripapillary chorioretinal degeneration. The mutation occurs in a potential binding site for YAP1, leading them to postulate that the change alters the ability of YAP1 to bind TEAD1, affecting the expression of other genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">YAP1 is a transcriptional co-activator, and in combination with TAZ (encoded by <italic>WWTR1</italic>), is a major effector of the Hippo pathway to regulate organ size, binding TEAD1-4 to promote transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). Activation of the Hippo pathway results in phosphorylation of YAP1 and TAZ, causing their migration from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting their effect on transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. <italic>YAP1</italic> expression is positively correlated with that of <italic>SOX2</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, reduction in <italic>SOX2</italic> expression also correlates with decreased expression of multiple targets of YAP/TEAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. <italic>YAP1</italic> is directly regulated by SOX2, which is able to bind a CpG island 5′ of exon 1, as well as to exon 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. YAP1 also binds β-catenin and therefore may affect β-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Zebrafish <italic>Y</italic>

Typically, deficiency in RPE mainly occurs in the posterior part of the eye, but also affects the lateral and ventral surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Interestingly, medaka (Japanese rice fish) <italic>Yap hir</italic> mutants have a flattened body shape and mislocalisation of the lens to outside of the eye, due to loss of the filopodia normally tethering them to the retina. Therefore, Yap is essential for tissue tension and body shape in medaka<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. <italic>YAP1</italic> and <italic>TAZ</italic> have also been shown to be expressed in the human adult cornea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a large number of genes and proteins in the pathways with which YAP1 interacts have been implicated in AMC or eye function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cartoon illustrating the pathways with which YAP1 interacts.

<title>Patient screening</title>
<p id="Par5">A UK cohort with ocular anomalies, principally anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and coloboma (AMC), was recruited as part of a national ‘Genetics of Eye and Brain anomalies’ study (REC study number 04/Q0104/129). In total, 258 UK patients were screened for variations in the coding region and flanking sequences of <italic>YAP1</italic> using LightScanner high resolution analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> with subsequent validation by Sanger sequencing. A novel heterozygous single base pair deletion variant was identified in exon 7 of case 1 (NM_001130145; exon7; c.1160delA; NP_001123617; p.Asn387Thrfs*16), observed by sequencing in both orientations. This variant was not present in the databases dbSNP147, ExAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> or gnomAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Parental DNA samples were sequenced for both strands of exon 7, and the variant was identified in the heterozygous state in the asymptomatic father (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). This variant occurs at chr11:102,223,749 (GRCh38/hg38) within the coding region of <italic>YAP1</italic>. There are nine known splice variants of <italic>YAP1</italic> encoding proteins of between 326 and 508 amino acids. All contain exon 7 and are predicted to have a frameshift in the presence of the variant, resulting in a premature termination codon, 16 codons after that in which the deletion occurs, leading to the loss of 118 amino acids that form part of the transactivation domain of the protein, the region required for the binding of other proteins. However, the premature termination codon is located 69 nucleotides upstream from the final exon-exon junction and therefore it could cause the nonsense mediated decay of all transcripts of <italic>YAP1</italic> containing it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, the c.1160delA occurs four nucleotides from the 3′ end of exon 7 and therefore could potentially affect splicing of the mRNA. Analysis of the mutation using the online tool Human Splicing Finder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.umd.be/HSF3/index.html">http://www.umd.be/HSF3/index.html</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> indicated that the variant might alter <italic>YAP1</italic> splicing by alteration of an exonic splicing enhancer or suppressor site, or by activation of a cryptic donor site.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Identification of a novel <italic>YAP1</italic> frameshift mutation in a patient with developmental eye disorders.

<title><italic>Y</italic><italic>A</italic><italic>P</italic><italic>1</italic> expression in Case 1</title>
<p id="Par6">To determine whether the c.1160delA variant does alter splicing or cause nonsense mediated decay, RNA was obtained from a Case 1 saliva sample using Oragene RNA kits and cDNA generated by reverse transcription. PCR of the cDNA for 45 cycles using forward and reverse primers in <italic>YAP1</italic> exons 7 and 9, respectively, resulted in a strong primary band of the expected size of 549 bp and a weak secondary band of approximately 350 bp. No bands were present in control PCRs using the products of reverse transcription reactions lacking reverse transcriptase, indicating the results were not due to genomic DNA contamination. Gel purification and sequencing of the stronger band revealed the presence of transcripts both with and without the c.1160delA variant, whereas sequencing for the secondary band failed. RNA was unavailable for either of Case 1’s parents. Thus, the mutation does not lead to either alternate splicing or nonsense mediated decay.</p>

<title>Case description</title>
<p id="Par7">The case presented is a 9 year old boy born via a normal delivery at 42 weeks’ gestation with a birth weight of 8 lb 6 oz. He has bilateral microphthalmia with a corneal diameter of 8mm on the right and 4mm on the left. This was associated with bilateral chorioretinal coloboma more marked on the left, bilateral posterior embryotoxon, nystagmus and a small left convergent squint. His developmental milestones were normal, but he was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome at age 5 years. His growth parameters are within normal range, although tracking along the lower centiles, with his height between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> centile, his weight on the 25<sup>th</sup> centile and his head circumference between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> centile at 9 years of age. Urine analysis was normal. Karyotyping and array CGH results were normal. No other systemic abnormalities were observed. Both parents had a normal eye examination.</p>

<title><italic>Y</italic><italic>A</italic><italic>P</italic><italic>1</italic> expression during human development</title>
<p id="Par8">As microphthalmia and coloboma are due to aberrations during eye development, we examined <italic>YAP1</italic> expression in human embryonic brain and eye. Furthermore, as haematuria has been reported in some patients with <italic>YAP1</italic> mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, we also examined expression in the human embryonic kidney. Nonradioactive RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation was performed on human embryo sections at Carnegie Stages (CS) 15, 17, 21 and 22<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Human embryos were obtained from the MRC/Wellcome Trust Human Developmental Biology Resource, UCL, with full ethical approval. <italic>YAP1</italic> expression was observed in multiple structures at CS15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a,b,e–h</xref>). Of immediate relevance to the phenotype of Case 1 was expression in the developing eye, including the retina. Further expression was found in the ectoderm forming Rathke’s pouch, which advances during development to form the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary). <italic>YAP1</italic> was also expressed in the otic vesicle (primitive ear), the region surrounding the ventricle of the diencephalon, which forms part of the forebrain, the tissue of the rhombencephalon (hindbrain), as well as the trigeminal ganglion. In contrast, by CS17 the most prominent expression was observed in the retina, diencephalic superventricle, neural tube, and the primordium of the lateral palatine process (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c,d,i–l</xref>). Expression in the retina continued to be observed at CS21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3m,n</xref>), and was also observed in the renal tubules of the developing kidney at CS22 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3o,p</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par9">In this study we identify a novel frameshift mutation in a boy with bilateral microphthalmia and bilateral chorioretinal coloboma, inherited from his unaffected father. We show that this mutation does not affect splicing and does not lead to nonsense mediated decay of the mRNA. We demonstrate that <italic>YAP1</italic> is expressed in multiple structures in the developing human embryo, including the retina, brain and kidney.</p>
<p id="Par10">Mutations in <italic>YAP1</italic> have been associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic forms of developmental eye disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that this is related to whether the variant affects a single or multiple transcripts of the gene, with the former being related to the nonsyndromic form, and the latter to a syndromic phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, the p.Asn387Thrfs*16 frameshift reported here is located within exon 7 of <italic>YAP1</italic> and is predicted to affect all known splice forms, yet with the exception of Asperger’s syndrome the patient has no extraocular phenotype. This novel frameshift mutation was inherited from an asymptomatic parent. However, variable expressivity in relation to <italic>YAP1</italic> mutations has been previously reported in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, as well as in zebrafish models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, it is possible that the case contains a modifying mutation within a second gene which would account for the difference in phenotypes between father and child. Alternatively, it is possible that the mutation arose <italic>de novo</italic> in the father as a mosaic alteration, accounting for his lack of an AMC phenotype. Unfortunately, DNA was unavailable from the paternal grandparents to test this hypothesis. Our <italic>in situ</italic> data identified sequential expression of <italic>YAP1</italic> in relevant structures of the developing human eye, to our knowledge the first time this has been shown. Expression within the developing retina is consistent with the chorioretinal colobomas reported in Case 1, as well as those in previously described families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This is further supported by data showing that optic vesicle progenitor cells in zebrafish <italic>Yap1</italic> mutants lose their ability to form RPE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Interestingly, given the presence of haematuria and deafness in one previously reported family with a <italic>YAP1</italic> nonsense mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, we also identified expression within the developing kidney and otic vesicle, consistent with its relevance to these additional phenotypes. The presence of Asperger’s syndrome in Case 1 is intriguing, given reports of intellectual disability in other families with <italic>YAP1</italic> alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and our demonstration of <italic>YAP1</italic> expression in multiple regions of the developing human brain. However, due to the genetic complexity of autism spectrum disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, such correlations must still be approached with caution. Finally, the <italic>YAP1</italic> phenotypes observed in Case 1 and those previously reported are less severe than for mutations in <italic>SOX2</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. SOX2 is able to directly regulate <italic>YAP1</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, indicating that as a downstream gene the range of its effects is less, consistent with more moderate phenotypes. Therefore, this study contributes to the evidence for the role of <italic>YAP1</italic> mutations as a rare cause of developmental eye disorders and demonstrates its expression in multiple tissues during human development, highlighting the importance of screening this gene in patients with other phenotypes, including deafness and haematuria.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="Sec9">
<title>Cohort Description</title>
<p id="Par11">A UK cohort with ocular anomalies, principally AMC, was recruited as part of a national ‘Genetics of Eye and Brain anomalies’ study with ethical approval from the Regional Ethics Committee Cambridge East (REC study number 04/Q0104/129). Participant informed consent was obtained according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were screened by indication in known AMC genes. From this cohort 258 individuals without a genetic diagnosis were screened for variants in <italic>YAP1</italic>. Of these, 32 individuals had bilateral anophthalmia or unilateral anophthalmia with contralateral microphthalmia, 43 had bilateral microphthalmia (+/−coloboma), 146 had unilateral anophthalmia/microphthalmia (+/−contralateral defects), and 37 had other phenotypes, including anterior segment dysgenesis. All subsequent experiments utilising the patient samples were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.</p>

<title>Mutation Analysis</title>
<p id="Par12">All nine coding exons of <italic>YAP1</italic> (NM_001282101.1), the alternate second exon of NM_001195045.1, and flanking sequences were screened for mutations by high resolution melting curve analysis on a LightScanner® (Idaho Technology Inc). PCRs for LightScanner melt curve analysis consisted of 10ng of template DNA, and final concentrations of 0.25 µM of each primer, 1x HotShot Diamond Master Mix (ClentLife) and 1x LCGreen Plus Dye (BioFire Diagnostics Inc) in a total volume of 10 µl. PCRs were typically one cycle of 5 minutes 95 °C, 45 cycles of 95 °C 30 s, annealing temperature 30 s and 72 °C 45 s, followed by a final denaturation step of 95 °C for 30 s. PCRs were performed in Framestar® 96 (4titude) 96-well plates with a 20 µl mineral oil overlay. Melt curves were generated on a LightScanner® (Idaho Technology Inc) using autoexposure, a starting temperature of 75 °C and a stop temperature of 98 °C. Data was analysed using the LightScanner® Instrument &amp; Analysis Software (Idaho Technology Inc). Melt curves were normalised prior and post the major melt transition and aberrant curves detected using the autogroup function and manual inspection. Samples with an initial fluorescence of less than 600 were excluded from analysis, while those with a starting fluorescence less than 800 were not included during normalisation. Samples with aberrant melt curves were analysed using Sanger sequencing (primers available upon request) and sequence data analysed using CodonCode Aligner (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA) or Chromas (Technelysium).</p>
