<p id="Par1">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) results, beside muscle degeneration in cognitive defects. As neuronal function is supported by astrocytes, which express dystrophin, we hypothesized that loss of dystrophin from DMD astrocytes might contribute to these cognitive defects. We generated cortical neuronal and astrocytic progeny from induced pluripotent stem cells (PSC) from six DMD subjects carrying different mutations and several unaffected PSC lines. DMD astrocytes displayed cytoskeletal abnormalities, defects in Ca<sup>+2</sup> homeostasis and nitric oxide signaling. In addition, defects in glutamate clearance were identified in DMD PSC-derived astrocytes; these deficits were related to a decreased neurite outgrowth and hyperexcitability of neurons derived from healthy PSC. Read-through molecule restored dystrophin expression in DMD PSC-derived astrocytes harboring a premature stop codon mutation, corrected the defective astrocyte glutamate clearance and prevented associated neurotoxicity. We propose a role for dystrophin deficiency in defective astroglial glutamate homeostasis which initiates defects in neuronal development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common muscular dystrophy worldwide, is caused by mutations in the X-chromosome positioned <italic>DMD</italic> gene. DMD is characterized by progressive skeletal and cardiac muscle weakness, causing death in the second or third decade of life. In ± 30% of subjects, neurocognitive defects are also present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The mean full-scale intelligence quotient of DMD subjects is ~1 standard deviation below normal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and DMD subjects exhibit variable degrees of neurocognitive difficulties and display specific learning disorders, such as dyslexia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, a higher incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Unlike the loss of muscle function, cognitive defects are not progressive and they do not correlate with the severity of the muscle disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">Given the critical role of dystrophin as an essential link between the dystrophin associated protein complex (DAPC) at the sarcolemma and the cytoskeleton, studies suggested that the loss of functional dystrophin in the brain may cause defective synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Subsequent studies suggested a number of possible mechanisms that might underlay defective central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, a mouse model for DMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Expression of dystrophin is controlled by three upstream promoters, which produce the full-length dystrophin isoform (Dp427) and four internal promoters that regulate production of shorter dystrophin isoforms (Dp260, Dp140, Dp116, and Dp71). In the CNS, the dystrophin isoforms Dp427c, Dp140, and Dp71 are expressed mostly in blood vessels and astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. While indirect evidence exists, linking the loss of different dystrophin isoforms with varying phenotypic outcomes such as, neuromuscular synaptic dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, decrease in whole brain volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and altered cerebral architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, all leading to cognitive issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, no causal molecular and cellular basis have been described to date. Whereas the majority of post-mortem brain studies in autism have focused on uncovering neuronal abnormalities, recent evidence has demonstrated alterations in both microglial and astrocytic markers within the autistic brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, the overlapping features between DMD-associated cognitive phenotypes and those reported for other syndromic cerebral pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and cognitive dysfunctions, including learning and memory, suggest that defects in DMD astrocytes may affect neuronal circuitry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are not merely passive bystanders of nervous system development and maintenance. Besides being fundamental to neuronal nutrition via glycogen synthesis, storage and release, astrocytes also dictate the molecular homeostasis of the CNS by ion buffering, and neurotransmitter recycling (e.g. glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Astrocytes are morphologically complex, and tightly integrated into neural networks. Although neurogenesis precedes astrogenesis in the cortex, neuronal synapses only begin to form after astrocytes have been generated, concurrent with neuronal branching and process elaboration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In the case of the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS, Glutamate, its excess in the synaptic and extra-synaptic space leads to neuronal hyperexcitation and subsequent neuronal death, in a process known as “glutamate excitotoxicity”, which accompanies several inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, unused glutamate during synaptic transmission must be rapidly cleared from the extracellular space. The mission of glutamate clearance is achieved, primarily, by astrocytes and is mediated by glutamate uptake transporters (EAAT-1 and EAAT-2 (known in rodents as GLAST and GLT-1))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Of note is also the astrocytic release of trace amounts of glutamate to the adjacent neurons, which help to synchronize their firing and modulate their excitatory or inhibitory transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Accordingly, by controlling the balance between glutamate uptake and release, glutamate homeostasis is achieved in CNS.</p>
<p id="Par5">Overall, astrocytes are essentially brain “homeostatic cells” wherein, extracellular signals (inflammatory response, neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters etc.) from astrocytes orchestrate a carefully balanced formation of neural circuits by powerfully controlling synapse formation, function, and elimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Alterations and loss of these critical astroglial functions have thus been hypothesized to contribute to most if not all cerebral pathologies. The modifications of astroglia in neuropathology are multifaceted, often disease-specific and may undergo a spectrum of differential metamorphoses during the course of pathological evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. As both synaptogenesis disruption and neuroinflammation are reported in autism, a role for astrocyte (and microglia downstream) involvement in the pathophysiology of autism has begun to receive an increasing amount of attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">Therefore, we hypothesized that dystrophin-deficient astrocytes may cause neuronal dysfunction that contribute to the neurocognitive or neuropsychiatric defects observed in DMD patients. To test this hypothesis, we created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from six DMD subjects, from which we differentiated cortical as well as astrocytic progeny. DMD astrocytes displayed an abnormal activated-like morphology, defects in Ca<sup>+2</sup> handling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, nitric oxide (NO) signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Transcriptome analysis and functional studies demonstrated that DMD astrocytes display defective glutamate handling, including decreased removal and release of glutamate causing defective neurite outgrowth, which could be blocked by either ionotropic glutamate transporters/receptor blockers or <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Studies wherein iPSCs from a DMD subject with a premature stop codon mutation were treated with read-through molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, demonstrated not only partial restoration of dystrophin expression in iPSC-derived astrocytes, but also correction of the defective glutamate handling and associated neural toxicity.</p>

<p id="Par7">The protocol to obtain blood or fibroblasts for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from DMD subjects and normal donors was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospitals Leuven (Clinical Trial Center (CTC), UZ Leuven, Campus Gasthuisberg #S55438, 31 Jul 2013). Consent was obtained from the DMD subjects’ guardian and an assent from the DMD subject himself to donate 5–10 cc of blood; while for D2, a skin biopsy was obtained as a source of fibroblasts for reprogramming. The blood samples as well as the skin biopsy were immediately transferred to Stem Cell Institute Leuven (SCIL) on ice.

<title>Derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells</title>
<p id="Par13">For reprogramming with Sendai viral vectors, Cytotune 1 and Cytotune 2 non-integrating Sendai virus kits were purchased from Thermo Fisher, US and reprogramming was carried out per the kit’s instructions. In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from five donors with yields varying between 0.43–4.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mL with 88–98 % cell viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. For D2, cryopreserved fibroblasts were utilized for reprogramming. Fibroblasts were thawed at passage 2 and grown to 60% confluence before initiating the reprogramming protocol. Both the fibroblast and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were transduced at a density of 250,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate (Corning, USA) at a multiplicity of infection of 3. Approximately 1 week after transduction, the first morphological changes were observed. The first fully reprogrammed iPSC colonies were picked on D29, based on morphology. D1 and D2 were initially derived on mouse embryonic fibroblasts feeder layer, and subsequently adapted to a feeder-free culture system. Cells from D3 to D6 were directly derived as feeder-free iPSCs on hESC‐qualified matrigel (Becton Dickinson, BD, Belgium) and Essential 8 Medium (in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C)). Once established and following quality control, all iPSCs were maintained in 6-well plates, fed with fresh media daily, and passaged every 7–8 days, and then frozen for further analysis.</p>

<title>Generation of NSCs, cortical neurons, and astrocytes from hPSCs</title>
<p id="Par14">To induce NSCs, PSCs were cultured to 100% confluence on BD matrigel in Essential 8 medium, then switched to a N2B27-based neural induction medium (NIM), which is Neural maintenance medium (NMM) supplemented with the small molecules SB431542 (10 μM, Stemgent, US) and Dorsomorphin (2 μM, Stemgent) for “dual-SMAD inhibition” for 14 days, based on previously described methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. NMM consisted of 1:1 mix of DMEM/F12 and neurobasal media, supplemented with N2 (1:200), B27 (1:100), glutamax (1:100), NEAA (1:200), β-mercaptoethanol (1:2000), Pen/Strep (1:200) (all from ThermoFisher Scientific) and 2.5 µg/ml of insulin (Sigma Aldrich, Belgium). On day 12–14, neuro-epithelial like cells were detached using dispase (Sigma Aldrich) and replated on polyornithine-Laminin (both from ThermoFisher Scientific) coated surfaces. NMM was now supplemented with 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) (Peprotech, UK) and 5 µg/ml Heparin (Sigma Aldrich).

<title>Dystrophic astrocytes manifest features typically seen in DMD myocytes</title>
<p id="Par43">Dystrophin, as part of a scaffolding complex, is well known to affect morphological and cytoskeletal features of muscle cells. Therefore, we examined if loss of dystrophin from astrocytes might affect their morphological characteristics. On DIV120, morphometric analysis of phalloidin stained F-actin cytoskeleton in astrocyte progeny demonstrated an increased cell area (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref> i) and a significantly larger cell volume for DIV120 DMD astrocyte progeny (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref> ii). This was further confirmed by a Sholl analysis, revealing a greater degree of branching of DMD compared to ND astrocyte progeny (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref> i and 2B ii), which might be due to the lack of dystrophin protein. On DIV120, we also noted that DMD astrocyte progeny displayed a more unorganized cell monolayer with no preferred polarity/cell orientation, whereas ND astrocytes clearly aligned in a preferential manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Loss of dystrophin from astrocytes presents defects typically also seen in DMD myocytes.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Morphometric parameters to describe the cytoskeletal organization in ND (ChiPSC6B, Bj1-iPSCs, H9-ESCs) and DMD (D1, D2, D3, and D5) astrocyte progeny.

<p id="Par44">Next, we determined if, aside from the differences in DMD astrocyte morphology, other defects described in DMD skeletal myofibers, such as aberrant Ca<sup>+2</sup> handling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, decreased NO production, increased ROS accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, and increased mitochondria-specific ROS production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, were also found in DMD astrocyte progeny.</p>
<p id="Par45">Astrocytes are known to respond to synaptic release of glutamate and ATP through increased intracellular Ca<sup>+2</sup> levels. Using the Fluo-4 dye, we assessed spontaneous astrocyte Ca<sup>+2</sup> cycling in DIV120 DMD and ND PSC-derived astrocytes. While spontaneous Ca<sup>+2</sup> transients, identified by change in Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity, were observed in DMD and ND astrocytes, the transient frequency was significantly elevated. That is, in DMD compared to ND astrocyte progeny (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>) the frequency and amplitude of transient rise and oscillations in cytoplasmic calcium concentration over a given period of time. Moreover, DMD astrocytes were observed to be more robustly able to respond to a 1-mM ATP biochemical stimulus with a larger amplitude than ND astrocytes (Fig S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3D</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par46">Further metabolic studies involving calcium, ROS and glutamate measurements, indicated that DIV120 DMD astrocytes contained significantly less NO, as assessed by the formation of the highly fluorescent triazolofluorescein (DAF2AM) derivative from its non-fluorescent original diaminofluorescein (DAF) state upon NO binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). Moreover, significantly higher levels of cellular ROS were detected in DMD than in ND astrocytes, as shown by DCFDA staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). Finally, we observed reduced ROS buffering capacity in DMD astrocytes. A significantly greater resting mitochondrial ROS level was observed, as well as an increased susceptibility of DIV120 DMD astrocytes to mitochondrial stress, demonstrated by the ratio between mitochondrial ROS levels (MitoSox) and ROS-independent, generic mitochondrial dye (Mitotracker) following addition of either Rotenone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref> (i)) or direct oxidative stress by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> application (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref> (ii)). Although Rotenone toxicity, via inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, could be blocked by the anti-oxidant <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a putative free-radical scavenger, in both ND and DMD astrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref> (i)), NAC significantly decreased mitochondrial ROS only in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated ND astrocytes, while DMD astrocytes remained highly ROS positive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref> (ii)).</p>
<p id="Par47">Thus, DMD astrocytes appeared to have a defective cell cytoskeleton, and displayed aberrant Ca<sup>+2</sup> handling, decreased NO, elevated ROS levels and increased mitochondrial susceptibility to ROS- inducing agents, such as Rotenone and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, all hallmarks of dystrophin-deficient DMD myofibers.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing identified dysregulated pathways in DMD astrocytes that otherwise maintain astroglial homeostasis</title>
<p id="Par48">To gain further insights in differences between DMD and ND astrocyte-progeny we performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of 2 biological replicates of DIV120 astrocyte progeny from ND ChiPSC6B-iPSC and of 4 DMD iPSC harboring a spectrum of known mutations i.e. a large exon deletion (D1-Δ49-52, D3-Δ16-17, D4-Δ51-55 and D5-Δ46-51) and a point mutation in exon 36 (D2-c.4996C&gt;T). We first compared the transcriptome of ND and DMD PSC-astrocytes with the published transcriptional signature of primary brain cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref> (i)). The iPSC-derived astrocytes clearly clustered far from other in vivo neuronal cell transcriptomes, except astrocytes. As expected, they were instead positioned between fetal and mature in vivo astrocytes. Moreover, when compared to transcriptomes obtained from cultured glial (and glioma cells), as expected, PSC-astrocytes derived in this paper, regardless of genotypic category, associated closer to NSC derived in vitro progeny than cultured primary isolated glial cells (ii). Lastly, compared between themselves, the ND and DMD astrocytes segregated away from each other (iii). CIBERSORT based deconvolution demonstrated that the transcript profiles of all PSC-derived astroglial progeny most closely resembled those found in cultured fetal astrocytes, with a less significant contribution of mature-astrocyte-like transcripts, and negligible transcripts associated with other neuronal cell types (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Global gene expression profiling demonstrates significant dysregulation among solute carrier family of genes and processes involving cell membrane and mitochondrial membrane in DMD astrocytes.</title><p><bold>a</bold> 3D PCA plots of ND/DMD astrocyte profiles as compared to published transcriptomes of CNS cell types. unbiased clustering of ND (Bj1-iPSC) and DMD (D1, D2, D3, and D6) DIV120 astrocytes using t-SNE correctly shows their distinct clustering in an in vivo context of multiple CNS cell types (i), in an in vitro setting of other published PSC-derived astrocyte and glioma cell transcriptomes (ii), and between ND and DMD astrocytes from the current study (iii). <bold>b</bold> CIBERSORT RNA deconvolution of all transcripts detected at logFC &gt; 1.

<p id="Par49">Subsequently, differential gene expression analysis was performed using a web-based R-dependent application, iDEP. A total of 13,755 genes were mapped to the reference genome. We found that 1055 genes were significantly upregulated and 1480 genes significantly downregulated in DMD compared to ND astrocyte progeny (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). To explore dysregulated pathways and gene set enrichment, we used built-in scripts from iDEP and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), respectively. When comparing ND and DMD astrocyte progeny, key pathways that were altered included: presynapse cellular components, molecular activity of ligand-gated ion channel and most importantly, neurotransmitter regulation around the synaptic space (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). Moreover, at a systems level, the differentially expressed genes underline coherent alterations in groups of co-expressed genes, as detected via the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">4A</xref>), which revealed that the differentially expressed gene set is composed of four major modules. qRT-PCR confirmed the differential expression of genes identified by RNAseq between DMD and ND astrocyte progeny (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). Thus, RNAseq indicated that glutamatergic synapse processes, including neuro/glio transmission, amino acid transport across membrane in DMD astrocytes and synapse regulation were disturbed transcriptionally. The Turquoise and Blue modules identified by WGCNA also highlighted pathways involved in synaptic transmission and synaptic extracellular matrix, respectively (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">4B</xref>). We also investigated if the deranged gene expression in DMD astroglial progeny converged on common biological processes associated with risk for ASD, using a set of 155 ASD genetic risk candidates from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) AutDB database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.

In the context of shared gene families, the two transcriptomes also showed convergent pathways associated with elements of axonal guidance signaling and GABA/Glutamate receptor signaling, among other neuro-metabolic clusters (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">4D</xref>).</p>

<p id="Par52">We performed a set of experiments to address the repercussion of the excess glutamate in DMD ACM on neurons (summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). We assessed neurite outgrowth of DIV30 ND iPSC (ChiPSC6 line) derived cortical neuronal progeny when cultured with 50% ACM from DIV120 DMD or from ND astrocytes. We prepared low-density DIV30 cortical neuron progeny cultures to visualize individual neurons, followed by staining with antibodies against <italic>microtubule associated protein 2</italic> (MAP2), presynaptic protein inhibitory synapse (GEPHRIN), and the excitatory presynaptic protein, vGLUT1, 12–14 h following incubation with ND and DMD ACM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>). Neurite outgrowth and dendritic complexity was quantified using 2D traced digital reconstruction of neurons in ImageJ. DMD ACM caused a significant decrease in neurite complexity, leading to significantly decreased Euclidean distance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref> i), reduced number of bifurcation junctions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref> ii) and less branches compared to neurons treated with ND ACM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref> iii). However, the maximum branch number (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref> iv) was not significantly affected by DMD ACM.</p>
<p id="Par53">To prove that excess glutamate in DMD ACM was responsible for the aberrant dendritic phenotype, we first added 0–1000 μM glutamate to ND ACM and re-examined the dendrite formation of ND iPSC neural progeny (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">5A</xref>). The dendritic morphology of neurons treated with ND ACM containing increasing concentration of glutamate, phenocopied, at a concentration of 1 µM glutamate, what we observed following addition of DMD ACM. As expected, addition of NMDA agonists to ND ACM triggered dendritic deformities (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">5B</xref> (i)). Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was used as positive control for neuronal toxicity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref> i). When the specific NMDA receptor antagonist D-(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5) was added to DMD ACM, we could completely block the effects of DMD ACM on neurite outgrowth (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">5B</xref> (ii)). This was not the case when we used the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor AMPA/kainate receptor (CNQX) inhibitor alone (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">5B</xref>(ii)). Moreover, in combination with AP-5, CNQX prevented the neuroprotective effect of AP-5 alone. Thus, defective function of the NMDA receptor in DMD astrocytes is responsible for the excess glutamate in DMD ACM, causing neurite outgrowth defects.</p>
<p id="Par54">To investigate the effect of DMD ACM on the electrophysiological response of ND neural networks, we plated ND iPSC-derived cortical neurons in 96-well MEA plates and recorded spontaneous extracellular field activity at DIV90 with or without ACM and other pharmacological treatments, added for 30 min. In addition, agonist and antagonist pairs, also described above, were applied acutely to neurons once baseline activity was recorded for 60 sec. NMDA application increased both the spike and burst frequency, as expected, which could be inhibited by the NMDA receptor antagonist, AP-5. Similarly, addition of glutamate-induced increased spike and burst frequency, which could be inhibited by AP-5, indicating that glutamate acts via the NMDA receptor Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref> (i) and (ii)). By contrast, the antagonist for the AMPA receptor, CNQX, failed to prevent NMDA/glutamate-induced neuronal hyperexcitation. This was an exact reflection of the hyper-excitatory phenotype that was observed when DIV90 ND neurons on MEA were treated with DMD ACM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref> (i) and (ii)).</p>
<p id="Par55">Finally, to assess the astrocyte/ACM specificity of the observed perturbations in the PSC neuronal networks, we evaluated the synapse forming ability of both ND and DMD neurons upon treatment with either ND or DMD ACM. After 30 days of maturation (further to initial 30 days to differentiation/derivation), we observed synaptic density as being dependent on neuro-supportive factors from astrocytes (ACM): addition of ND ACM increases while DMD ACM (D1, D2) decreased synaptic density of both ND and DMD neurons defined as the number of mature (colocalizing synapsin and PSD-95 staining) synaptic sites regardless of neuronal genotype i.e. on both ND and DMD DIV60 neuronal network (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref> (i) and (ii)).</p>

<title>Premature stop codon read-through mediated increase of dystrophin corrects astrocyte mediated neuronal dysfunction</title>
<p id="Par56">In a final set of studies, we used the small molecules/compounds (Readthrough compounds, RTC), gentamicin, G418 and PTC124 (Ataluren®), that were shown to allow read-through of premature termination codons (PTCs) in mutant genes (including in cystic fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> and DMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>), and hence re-establish protein levels of the gene products cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> or dystrophin, respectively, near levels in non-mutant cells. Preliminary experiments using high-throughput screening (HTS) in 96-well plates on an Operetta imaging system were performed to test RTC-mediated cytotoxicity (calcein/ethidium bromide staining) (not shown) and assess the RTC dose-responsive effect on astrocyte morphometry. We demonstrated a correction (mutant cell morphology/area reduced to normal range) only in the DMD line, DMD D2, with a premature termination codon mutation, in response to gentamicin (100 μg/mL or higher). Most importantly, this was associated with a significant increase in significantly increased dystrophin expression (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6A, B</xref>). Based on these results, and as PTC124 is used in DMD clinical trials and can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) we selected to proceed with PTC124 as the ideal RTC, for rest of the experiments.</p>
<p id="Par57">To further characterize the effectiveness of PTC124 to rescue dystrophic phenotypes in DMD PSC astroglial progeny, we first added three different concentrations of PTC124 to both DIV120 ND and DMD astrocytes and assessed cell area using ImageJ.

(Scale bar, 100 μm). Abbreviations: ND—Healthy control ACM, D—DMD ACM. In lieu of RTC treatment, all ND ACM samples were treated with DMSO</p></caption><graphic id="d29e1610" xlink:href="41398_2019_535_Fig5_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par58">Moreover, when we re-tested the concentration of glutamate in ACM from DIV120 DMD-D2 astrocytes treated with gentamicin, G418 and PTC124 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>), a significant decrease in glutamate was measured similar to those in ND ACM (ChiPSC6B and BJ1), with the most pronounced effects noted for PTC124.</p>
<p id="Par59">We next applied medium pre-conditioned on either ND, D2 or PTC-treated DMD-D2 Astrocytes for 24 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref> (i) and (ii)). Compared to basal levels of spontaneous spike rate and burst spike rate i.e. under brainphys condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, acute application of DMD-D2 ACM lead to an instantaneous increase in spike rate (and Burst spike rate). Not surprisingly, given that the excess glutamate in DMD-D2 ACM is likely the cause of induced hyperactivity, supplementation with AP-5 decreased the spike/burst rate down to levels comparable to Brainphys and ND ACM. Most importantly, treatment with PTC124 reversed the hyperactive spike/bust response. In addition, PTC treatment also restored altered gene expression of <italic>GFAP</italic>, <italic>GLAST</italic>, and <italic>GLT-1</italic> (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">7</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par60">To further demonstrate that the observed rescue with PTC124 was due to its RTC nature, i.e. restoration of dystrophin protein levels in otherwise dystrophin-deficient DMD-D2 astrocytes, we performed western blotting. Consistent with the initial immunostaining (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6SA, B</xref>), treatment with PTC124 restored expression of the major dystrophin isoform (Dp427) in DMD-D2 astrocytes (harboring a stop-codon point mutation in exon 36), where it was absent before treatment. By contrast, as expected, Dp427 was not detected in DMD-D1 astrocytes (harboring a large deletion of exons 49-52) following treatment with PTC124 relative to untreated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par61">These studies demonstrated thus that read-through compound-mediated restoration of dystrophin levels greatly reversed the defective astrocyte phenotype. We observed reversal to normal astrocyte morphology, we also observed a normalization of the abnormal glutamate handling and the subsequent hyperexcitability induced by DMD-D2 ACM on neuronal networks.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par62">Formation of glutamate requires astrocytic pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and astrocytic tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. Return of glutamate to neurons and continued release of glutamate depend on astrocyte glutamine synthetase (GS/<italic>GLUL</italic>) activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The dynamic metabolic fluxes in astrocytes and cellular localization of metabolic processes determine metabolic formation and degradation of glutamate. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that loss of dystrophin in DMD astrocytes causes defects in astrocyte glutamate handling (glutamate–glutamine shuttle), likely due to abnormal functionality of either <italic>GLUL</italic> and/or <italic>EAAT</italic> glutamate transporters (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>SC(ii)). The increased glutamate levels in ACM conditioned medium caused compromised dendritic growth and this resultant neuronal defect was reversed when neuronal glutamate receptors were blocked by antagonists. Importantly, defects in glutamate handling and subsequent neuronal defects were also reversed when dystrophin levels were restored using stop codon read-through drugs in the astrocytes from subject D2, definitively demonstrating a role of defective dystrophin levels in aberrant glutamate mediated neuronal defects. These new pathogenic insights in how neuronal functions can be affected by loss of astrocytic dystrophin in DMD patients open potential perspectives for management of the neurocognitive defects seen in DMD subjects.</p>
<p id="Par63">In DMD, ±30 % of patients have different forms of neurocognitive defects, ranging from decreased IQ to ASD, ADHD, and OCD like phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying these defects are ill understood. Neurocognitive defects can be caused by a number of genetic mutations, including mutations that affect the cell cytoskeleton, interfering with neurite outgrowth, sprouting and synapse formation of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. In addition, evidence for astrocyte dysfunction/activation has also come from a post-mortem brain investigation in autism demonstrating increased mRNA levels of GFAP and observations of astrogliosis in the cerebellar white matter and subcortical white matter within the frontal lobe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par64">Exploiting iPSC technology, we created cortical neuron and astrocyte progeny from ND and DMD PSCs. DMD cortical neuronal progeny did not display obvious intrinsic functional differences compared to ND cortical neuronal progeny (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>), including electrophysiological features on DIV90, assessed by MEAs. This is consistent with the fact that neurons do not express the major dystrophin isoform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). Although astrocyte generation was not impaired, we found significant morphometric abnormalities in DMD astrocytes, which is in line with defects seen in myofibers lacking dystrophin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). In addition, we found that DMD iPSC-derived astrocytes displayed other defects similar to those found in dystrophic myofibers, including defects in Ca<sup>+2</sup> homeostasis, NO signaling, ROS accumulation and increased mitochondria-specific ROS accumulation in response to mitochondrial toxicants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). In addition to these ‘DMD myofiber-like’ phenotypes, we discovered that DMD iPSC-derived astrocytes also displayed significant defects in glutamate handling, and that the decreased glutamate uptake/consumption and increased <italic>de novo</italic> production by astrocytes caused neuronal defects, including aberrant neurite outgrowth and hyperexcitability. It is well known that extracellular glutamate controls several important neurological processes, including neuronal and glial cell differentiation and migration during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. The concentration of glutamate in the extra-synaptic space is controlled by glutamate transporters, such as EAAT1 and EAAT2 on astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par65">An association between the loss of the either Dp427 and/or Dp140 dystrophin protein isoform in DMD subjects and cognitive impairment has been suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. In addition, in DMD patients, altered glutamate levels have been identified in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>, as well as neuronal hyperexcitability. However, a direct causal link between loss of dystrophin protein and aberrant glutamate levels and subsequent neuronal defects has not been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. Recent studies demonstrated in other disorders with a high incidence of ASD, such as fragile X syndrome or Rett syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>, that abnormal glutamate handling may at least in part underlie the observed neuropsychiatric defects. Likewise, in the absence of dystrophin, we observed a pathological profile that is characterized by both loss of glutamate homeostatic function and shades of reactive astrogliosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Dystrophin-deficient astrocytes in vitro seem to undergo remodeling where cell hypertrophy and downregulated expression of inward rectifying Kir4.1 channels is prominently observed. Furthermore, we detected up-regulation of intermediate filaments such as GFAP and vimentin, key features of reactive astrogliosis. We here demonstrate that DMD astrocytes released sufficient amounts of glutamate to induce widespread toxicity in cultured ND PSC-derived neuronal progeny. At the molecular level, sufficient DMD cell-released glutamate was present to activate NMDA and AMPA/KA receptors on cortical neurons, as an aberrant dendritic tree formation was evident when ACM was applied for 12 h on ND cortical neural progeny. The cause of the impaired glutamate handling by DMD cells, both removal/consumption and production, remains, however, to be determined. In addition, excess glutamate present in DMD ACM caused decreased neurite outgrowth by ND cortical neurons, as well as neuronal hyperexcitability. We demonstrated that this is directly correlated with absence of intact dystrophin, as glutamate handling was restored to ND-PSC astrocyte levels in DMD-D2 astrocytes, following treatment with the read-through molecule PTC124<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Moreover, our observation that ASD genes and pathways are enriched in the DMD-astrocyte transcriptome and that treatment with glutamate-rich DMD ACM induces increased neuronal network hyperactivity and abnormal neuronal morphology, lead us to speculate that increased susceptibility of the developing neuronal circuitry in DMD, might be caused by aberrant DMD astrocyte signaling leading to dysregulated synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par66">Although in the current study we demonstrate a causal link between absence of Dp427 and aberrant glutamate production and subsequent neuronal defects, we have not proven that there is a direct interaction between dystrophin and glutamate channels. Nevertheless, there is evidence that dystrophin associates with multiple channels and transporters in the cell membrane through syntrophin, for instance for AQP4 and Kir4.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>. Membrane proteins such as AQP4, harbor a PDZ binding motif which associates with the PDZ domain on the syntrophin peptides, allowing for proper localization into the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In line with this, the glutamate channels, EAAT1 and EAAT2, also contain a PDZ binding domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup> (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">8</xref>). Hence, we hypothesize that loss of dystrophin, and therefore the dystrophin scaffolding complex, may deregulate not only the function of Kir4.1 (also shown here to be reduced on the cell membrane of astroglial progeny) and AQP4, but also glutamate channels.</p>
<p id="Par67">In DMD, most pharmacological treatments available or under investigation, focus on the skeletal/ respiratory/cardiac muscle component of the disease. However, little to no attention has been paid to neurocognitive or behavioral symptoms. Our finding that glutamate channel inhibitors or NMDA receptor blockers such as Memantine, could selectively inhibit the toxic effects of DMD ACM on neuronal morphology and function (neurite outgrowth and excitability) suggests that these inhibitors might hold exciting translational prospect to tackle the neurocognitive defects seen in DMD and other subjects. In addition, for the subpopulation of subjects with stop codon causing point mutations currently treated with PTC124, it will be of great interest to determine if this therapy also influences neurocognitive function.</p>
