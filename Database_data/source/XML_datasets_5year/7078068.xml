<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Precision medicine is one of the recent and powerful developments in medical care, which has the potential to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, allowing earlier interventions using advanced diagnostics and tailoring better and economically personalized treatments. Identifying the best pathway to personalized and population medicine involves the ability to analyze comprehensive patient information together with broader aspects to monitor and distinguish between sick and relatively healthy people, which will lead to a better understanding of biological indicators that can signal shifts in health. While the complexities of disease at the individual level have made it difficult to utilize healthcare information in clinical decision-making, some of the existing constraints have been greatly minimized by technological advancements. To implement effective precision medicine with enhanced ability to positively impact patient outcomes and provide real-time decision support, it is important to harness the power of electronic health records by integrating disparate data sources and discovering patient-specific patterns of disease progression. Useful analytic tools, technologies, databases, and approaches are required to augment networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory and public health systems, as well as addressing ethical and social issues related to the privacy and protection of healthcare data with effective balance. Developing multifunctional machine learning platforms for clinical data extraction, aggregation, management and analysis can support clinicians by efficiently stratifying subjects to understand specific scenarios and optimize decision-making. Implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare is a compelling vision that has the potential in leading to the significant improvements for achieving the goals of providing real-time, better personalized and population medicine at lower costs. In this study, we focused on analyzing and discussing various published artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, approaches and perspectives, aiming to advance academic solutions in paving the way for a new data-centric era of discovery in healthcare.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Over the centuries, quests for answers have led us to take giant leaps. It was only in the last century that the discovery of antibiotics freed us from many of the dreaded diseases of the past. Still, in the context of recent published literature (e.g. accessible through PubMed), over 138 000 studies discuss medication errors, and over 450 000 include delayed treatment (date accessed 10 October 2019, using search query keywords including ‘medication error’ and ‘delayed treatment’). Still, the problem of people dying from medical care gone wrong has been vastly underappreciated and not well recognized. Today, we stand on the threshold of the new medical revolution, just as big and far-reaching. Despite all of our scientific knowledge, much of medicine is still based on the treatment of symptoms and performing learned trials based on treatments, which works for most patients to bring symptom relief, reduce the risk of complications and improve survival chances, but not for all. To get new insights into disease taxonomy, etiology and pathogenesis, it is important to understand how diseases are related to each other. Breakthroughs in prescription medication, surgical treatment and mental health interventions are among the reasons we live longer. However, providing the correct in-time treatment plan for patients with knowledge about their current medications and drug allergies is currently a tedious and error-prone task [1]. The widespread growth of prescribing and consuming medications has increased the need for applications that support medication reconciliation. Furthermore, living healthcare issues include misdiagnosis, overtreatment, decreased productivity, under-utilized clinical data handling, significant cost and spending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). These miscalculations can be reduced to a great extent with the use of advancements in information technology at every level of care.</p>

<p>Medical error is the third leading cause of death after heart failure and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). According to recent studies, approximately 180 000 to 251 000 people are dying every year in the USA due to medical errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). This number has been rising due to increasing complexity and reduced quality of our current medical system, which includes communication breakdown, misdiagnosis, poorly coordinated care and growing cost. In recent years, the concept of precision medicine has evolved as a central innovation pillar for leading research in transforming health and holds great promise in patient treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Precision medicine has the potential to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine by intelligently integrating multi-omics profiles with clinical, imaging, epidemiological and demographic details to allow a wide range of earlier interventions for advanced diagnostics and tailoring better and economical personalized treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). This requires a progressive healthcare environment that can enable clinicians and researchers to gain a complete picture of the patient to deepen their understanding, using additional basic details from healthcare data e.g. phenotypic information, life style factors and social determinants that can impact treatment decisions. It is primarily based on ‘4Ps’—Predictive, Preventive, Personalized and Participatory—treatment of each individual patient and aims to enable clinicians to efficiently understand how personalized clinical data variations can contribute to health and accurately diagnose and predict the most appropriate course of action for a patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). While the complexities of diseases at the individual level have made it difficult to utilize healthcare information in clinical decision-making, some of the existing constraints have been minimized by technological advancements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). To implement effective personalized and population health with enhanced ability to positively impact patient outcomes, it is important to harness the power of electronic health records (EHR) by integrating disparate data sources and discovering patient-specific patterns of disease progression to provide real-time decision support. The significance of healthcare data mining cannot be denied, but the challenges of big data management loom large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the years, biotechnology has evolved immensely. Computers are becoming faster in speed and micro in size, heterogeneity is increasing in datasets and their volume is growing robustly. These expansions are fueling the engine of artificial intelligence (AI) for discovering many technical refinements to solve complex problems in almost every field of life, including science and medicine. AI is the branch of computer science with the capability of a machine to imitate and even enhance intelligent human behavior. One of the expected roles in life and medical sciences is to deal with extensive research studies aimed at supporting real-time decision-making and producing solutions to complex problems through knowledge and data intensive computational and simulated analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Healthcare data includes information about a patient’s lifestyle, medical history, encountered visits with practices, laboratory and imaging tests, diagnoses, prescribed medications, performed surgical procedures and consulted providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Adequate, analytical and intelligent access to healthcare data has the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine by improving the quality and transition of care, improving outcomes by reducing cost, detecting diseases at earlier stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) and developing a better understanding of biological mechanisms by modeling complex biological interactions through a holistic integration and analysis of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). The ability to stratify patients, understand scenarios and optimize decision-making would consistently improve based on the myriad data obtained during the care-delivery process. Innovative and robust big data platforms are necessary to improve the quality and transition of healthcare by analyzing heterogeneous healthcare, which can be of huge volume, velocity, variety and veracity.</p>
<p>To effectively implement healthcare data analytic processes, various big data management challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) have to be overcome, which include inadequacy of analyzable clinical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>); existence of multiple data standards, structures, types and formats; rapid growth in heterogeneous data; understanding of analysis algorithms for clinical data interpretation, exploration and drawing inference; unavailability of effective open-source tools that combine various approaches to model biological interactions; integration of clinical and analytic systems; interdisciplinary field barriers; high cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>); implementation of secure frameworks for data collection, simplification, conversion from raw form to knowledge, management and distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>); automatic cleansing of faulty and error-prone EHRs; correctly identifying prescription medication; and implementing predictive diagnostics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). It is not possible to easily track and prospectively follow the clinical progress and outcomes in patients over time (e.g. having a critical predictor of future clinical events where a patient may show the disease months or years down the road). In past decades, various systems have been developed in both commercial and academic sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) for this purpose. Academic systems put significant values on analytics, while commercial systems focus on supporting clinical operations. However, independently utilizing traditional approaches, both sectors are unable to identify problems by their effects and significantly help in clinical decision-making. However, major concerns include handling and evaluation of electronic medical records (EMR), and repetitive tasks; patient medication adherence; inefficient therapeutic treatment for cancer and other critical diseases; cost ineffectiveness; and addressing ethical issues related to AI and ML implementation in healthcare.</p>

<title>2. AI &amp; ML in health intelligence, precision medicine and resource management</title>
<p>Intelligent big data platforms are necessary to improve the quality and transition of healthcare by expediting investigation of active hidden factors in clinical data with machine learning algorithms to obtain actionable gap-based information about patients for early detection and prevention of constitutional disorders like cancer, and streamlining data sharing by developing efficient communication across healthcare units and scientific laboratories. Its application in healthcare could be another great leap in medicine and a transformational force for guiding personalized and population medicine with several computational benefits. In the recent past, multiple AI and ML-based efforts have been made for deciphering diseases to facilitate predictive diagnosis and thereby guide treatment factors, e.g. drawing disease relationships using clinical manifestations, EHR and data generated using wearable technology. To get a detailed overview of available academic solutions, we reviewed contributions and compared various AI and ML claimed solutions, approaches and discussions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TB1">Table 1</xref>), and real-time examples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TB2">Table 2</xref>) published within the last 5 years [31–63]. Our focus here was to discuss valued contributions of all mentioned AI and ML algorithms (section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec37">Theoretical background of AI, ML and examples</xref> in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec37">healthcare</xref> and approaches. We provide detailed and individualized overview of presented approaches. Overall, the review study and the contributions of AI and ML are divided into three categories: Health Intelligence, Precision Medicine, and Healthcare Resource Management and Ethical Challenges.</p>

<title>3. Health intelligence approaches</title>
<p>Health intelligence can play a vital role at various levels of clinical research and analytics that can lead to significant improvements in achieving goals for the provision of better personalized and population healthcare. In the past decade, various operational and research-based healthcare data management and analytic systems have been developed in both academia and commercial sectors. Our interest includes comprehensive solutions that implement healthcare data analytics process; provide features to manage, analyze, visualize and share EHR in de-identified form; help in automatically capturing information about patient demographics, scheduled appointments, pre-exam questionnaire results, consulted providers, conducted lab tests, diagnoses, treatment plans, objective test results, medications, surgical procedures and claims; support the clinical decision-making process with AI techniques to create classifiers, which can be trained on structured clinical data generated from different clinical activities and can learn similar groups of subjects, associations between subject features and outcomes of interest; and apply natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract information from unstructured clinical data e.g. narrative text, such as physical examination, clinical laboratory reports, operative notes and discharge summaries.</p>
<sec id="sec4">
<title>3.1. AI in healthcare for better prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>)</title>
<p>The authors emphasized the idea of embracing changes with the advancement in technology with the potential integration of AI into the field of healthcare in a way that is beneficial to each healthcare worker. They focused in utilizing AI to obviate repetitive tasks to enhance patient–physician relationship and increase practice of empathy and emotional intelligence. Authors focused on deep learning algorithm implementation with increased data flow that allows machines to self-develop a complex function with improved predictability, as long as a large amount of data is fed as input. They developed a deep convoluted neural network for skin cancer detection, image analysis for diabetic retinopathy evaluation, smartphone-based AI platform to measure adherence in patients on direct oral anticoagulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>) and patient’s visit length reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>). The strengths of this study include the potential to augment healthcare access in areas where specialists might not be physically available, and medication can still be prescribed utilizing the combined efforts of AI and a primary care physician, especially in developing countries. However, one missing aspect is to address the loss of privacy, as well as possibilities of patient data exploitation. The potential for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protection is likely feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5">
<title>3.2. ML in medicine with better patient–provider interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>)</title>
<p>This approach is focused on examining the essential structural changes in the healthcare systems that are necessary to unleash the full potential of ML in medicine. It emphasizes developing the concepts of ML in medicine, which may be centralized around the idea of personalized diagnosis and treatment on the basis of all known information about the patient and collective experience. Giving rationale, authors highlighted proof-of-concept models that have been tested so far, e.g. difficulties in finding a relationship between current ML models and traditional statistical models, need for a tremendous amount of data to train ML classifiers for establishing general and complex associations and training clinicians in AI for accurate data interpretation. Furthermore, they effectively debated about consumption of physicians’ valuable time due to increased features (e.g. check boxes) in EHRs for administrative and billing purposes, which might prevent them from providing the best quality care for their patients. At the same time, they claimed that the integration of ML in EHRs may lead to potential fear of overreliance as well as decreased vigilance of errors and automation bias. Authors claimed a training ML classifier at EHRs for pattern detection to allow physicians to anticipate future events in high-risk patients, to obtain accurate and comprehensive diagnosis and provide with a quick search engine in locating the pertinent information within a patient’s chart, less clicking, voice dictation and better predictive typing.</p>

<p>Overview and implementation of AI and ML in healthcare for the extraction of big data, and aiding clinicians in providing better care delivery were recently highlighted by authors. They discussed use of support vector machine (SVM)- and deep learning-based model development for physiological data segmentation and analysis, disease progression prediction and diagnosis in radiology. Authors discussed processes, which include designing effective models to aid in the diagnosis based on the information that resemble certain diseases, image analysis and interpretation to improve the decision-making performance of clinicians.

<p>A study analyzed different AI applications in healthcare and discussed their potential future outcomes. Authors argued that currently AI research in healthcare is mainly focused on only a few health conditions, e.g. cancer, neural disease and cardiovascular disease. They criticized that existing healthcare systems do not provide incentives for data sharing and have no structure for the implementation of AI. Further classified applications of AI consist of ML algorithms to extract and cluster useful information from a large patient population to assist in making real-time inferences for health risk alerts and health outcome predictions, perform principal component analysis and reduce diagnostic and therapeutic errors; SVM to determine model parameters and identify imaging biomarkers; NLP for text processing and classification; and deep learning for diagnostic imaging and electronic diagnosis.</p>

A group of researchers used an ML algorithm for structured and unstructured big data analysis to identify a wide range of medical conditions and diagnosis from the large-scale EHR database, including information about test results, historical information, management plans, and billing codes, etc. Authors initially applied their algorithm for the identification of potential predictors and keyword associations in the EHR to find presence of pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF) by using NLP, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The reported outcomes were based on positive and negative predictive values of the algorithm, which were also validated by the glaucoma specialists.

According to a team of researchers, cognitive computer systems can support physicians by providing rapid access to accurate information and treatment procedures, assisting in decision-making. Such systems have the potential to distribute cancer knowledge into clinical practice and remote areas worldwide, by optimizing clinical research and trials with reduced bureaucracy and cost. They presented the possibilities of AI in future cancer care and research, which includes developing international cancer networks, identifying beneficial therapies for rare and highly aggressive cancers, observing different therapeutic outcomes by different parameters, analyzing associations of cancer with other disease-specific attributes, discovering new cancer etiologies, incorporating pertinent patient and cancer characteristics into clinic-based uses, conducting economic broad-based cancer trials, uncovering genomic and molecular events sensitive to existing or new treatments and analyzing and developing new treatment pathways.

Supporting this claim, this overview presented some examples of running and accomplished research projects, e.g. Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) Program and Health Maintenance Organization Research Network’s Virtual Data Warehouse Project. The authors also discussed multiple caveats in existing healthcare systems e.g. inaccurate data entry in EHRs; incomplete patient information in EHRs; incorrect diagnosis and medication codes (e.g. ICD, National Drug Code (NDC)), and their conversion into research descriptions and vice versa; data extraction and integration from clinical notes in to EHR; multiple data sources in EHRs affecting data provenance; mismatches of data granularity with comparative research; and differences in research protocols and clinical care.</p>

This study highlights the background, workflow and challenges of deep learning with its successful implementation of digital image analysis, and some examples like analyzing fundus images of the retina to predict cardiovascular disease and identifying images for melanoma, basal and squamous cell carcinoma by matching sensitivity criteria. They suggested developing and training classifiers based on the deep neural network to make predictions on big clinical datasets by using the nonlinear features for modeling regularities.

A research study highlighted one important aspect that could be one of the ML drawbacks and that is the utilization of most of the ML algorithms to solve clinical problems when they were originally proposed for other matrices. The authors of the study provided some examples to justify their claim and discussed that the primary purpose of operational EHR systems development is to not support any kind of ML implementation for predictions. Due to the lack of robust and structured clinical data, authors showed uncertainty in achieving high-quality results with the use of ML.

<p>A quantitative review of the health informatics field uncovers the scientific growth in this field. As discussed, despite a long period of progress, there is still no proper characterization of the knowledge and no common language, which necessitates illumination of the knowledge structures, text mining methods, scientometric analysis, tracking tools, Internet of Things-based decision support systems and social network visualization to identify hidden patterns. The study conducted produced six clusters and nine research themes to support health information technology by improving patient safety by reducing medication errors, and associating decision support, knowledge representation, telehealth innovations and professional behavioral changes in medicine.

<p>Various healthcare systems are generating heterogeneous data of significant volumes which demands exploitation of healthcare data for resource optimization, patient satisfaction, improved care quality and health outcomes. Recommended use of AI and ML for advanced health data analytics with the arrangement of active partners in the healthcare processes requires ubiquitous services, therapeutic decision support, ethnographic health surveillance, integration of health-related data sources, personalized and predictive medicine by learning non-linear associations and drawing causal relationships among inherent data elements. A team of scientists designed a health data analytics process involving a methodical order of data processing, modeling, and analysis steps categorized as data- and knowledge-driven methods for Decision, Predictive, Descriptive, Optimization, Comparative, Prescriptive and Semantic analysis.

<p>ML can be applied to detect key features by predictive modeling of complex and heterogeneous datasets for progression and treatment of cancerous conditions, risks and outcomes. Many research groups have highlighted the implementation of different ML algorithms in cancer research for estimating unknown dependencies to predict new outputs of the system, including artificial neural network, Bayesian network, SVMs, graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) and decision tree. There are numerous ML real-world applications. The artificial neural network has been established for breast cancer by analyzing mammographic and demographic data with <italic>k</italic>-fold cross-validation rate and lung cancer by analyzing clinical and gene expression data; SVM has been used for analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with leave-one-out cross-validation for multiple myeloma, with <italic>k</italic>-fold cross-validation for breast cancer and with <italic>k</italic>-fold cross-validation for breast cancer by analyzing clinical and population data; the Bayesian network can efficiently analyze clinical and pathologic data with cross-validation for colon carcinomatosis and with <italic>k</italic>-fold cross-validation for oral cancer by analyzing clinical and imaging tissue genomic; blood genomic data; SVM hold-out for breast cancer by analyzing clinical, pathologic and epidemiologic data and for cervical cancer by analyzing clinical and pathologic data; graph-based SSL algorithm with <italic>k</italic>-fold cross-validation for colon cancer; breast cancer by analyzing protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and gene expression data and <italic>k</italic>-fold cross-validation for breast cancer by analyzing Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER); SVM with cross-validation for oral cancer by analyzing clinical and genomic data; SVM with leave-one-out cross-validation for breast cancer by analyzing genomic data; Bayesian network with hold-out for breast cancer by analyzing clinical, microarray data; decision tree with cross-validation for breast cancer by analyzing SEER; SSL co-training algorithm with <italic>k</italic>-fold cross-validation for Breast cancer by analyzing SEER. Authors acknowledged the active contributions of ML in accurate cancer susceptibility, recurrence and survival predictions.

<title>4. Precision medicine approaches</title>
<p>The underlying assumption here is that precision medicine will provide tailored healthcare to patients and will yield lower rates of associated adverse outcomes. A classic example of precision medicine is the customization of disease treatment for a single individual which in the old paradigm was a one-size-fits-all medicine; an effective treatment is the treatment known to benefit most of the target population. However, a certain treatment may actually yield benefit to only a few individuals. The rest of the population will not benefit from the treatment and may even incur adverse effects. This exemplifies the need for AI and ML-based systems bridging multiple domains in a secure environment for heterogeneous healthcare data analysis and visualization.</p>

<title>4.1. Precision medicine with EMR analysis for prevention and treatment of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>)</title>
<p>Different healthcare institutions do not necessarily utilize the same EMR system with the possibilities of effectively communicating with each other, which makes it difficult for physicians to track patients’ overall medical history. A team of authors brought about the importance of population perspective and need of foundation platforms for precision medicine, which can support large-scaled clinical data integration, and communication between different EMRs accessible to patients through different health centers. Authors proposed a universal EMR platform development by integrating population perspectives for the establishment of protocols to identify subgroups that fit distinct clinical phenotypes of complex disease and provides avenue for different treatment methods. Authors suggested an additional fifth ‘P’—Population-wise Perspective—to the existing 4P precision medicine concept. They justified this claim by examining a study about identification of a type 2 diabetes subgroup through a topological analysis of a population’s EMR and determined three major distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>). Authors also suggested that it might be difficult to implement ML divisions, which include supervised learning (SVM, discriminant analysis, Naïve Bayes, nearest neighbor and neural network), unsupervised learning (linear &amp; logistical regression, decision tree, cluster analysis and neural network) and deep learning. Authors recommended multi-cluster environment implementation for analyzing patterns within the subset of populations, which might present similar clinical phenotypes of complex diseases with the assumption that the treatment based on one cluster might not be as effective for another subgroup.</p>

Authors proposed three-factor-based approaches, which include point of care, large-scaled clinical datasets for training classifier and analytics and finally building foundations for precision medicine. The author’s combined deep learning prediction with human pathologist’s diagnosis resulted in a success rate of 99.5% and reduced human error by 85% at an early stage.

<p>There has been a lot of debate over the current state of clinical decision support and how it can be improved in providing precision medicine. Many scholars have discussed involving ML in healthcare settings for the diagnosis and better treatment of chronic disease in clinical, translational and public health. Furthermore, they have highlighted the significance of big data management, privacy, de-identification and data sharing. Focus on early diagnosis of chronic conditions through proper extraction of clinical insights and utilization of <italic>in silico</italic> datasets could allow the replacement of animal and human models when conducting clinical trials by generating virtual patients with specific characteristics that enhance the outcome of each study. According to them, 25% of drug discovery occurs by chance, which can be highly accidental. They signify using predictive, proactive intervention in healthcare through AI and clinical decision support system development for leveraging big data analysis to make better predictions on the potential outcome of patients, ultimately supporting better decision-making by the physicians.</p>
<p>Authors have reviewed and reported analysis of the different clinical decision support states, improvements in patient outcome and various limitations and challenges in Laboratory, Medication, Diagnosis, Radiology, Pathology, Clinical Evidence &amp; Outcomes, and Procedures, based on the availability of different data structures and standards in healthcare systems. Challenges in the laboratory mainly involve incorporation of genetic results into EMR in a searchable way; tests conducted at external labs cannot be incorporated due to lack of standardization, not encoding lab tests with Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), missing genetic information in EHR. Challenges in Medication include over time and ineffective drug combination. Challenges in Diagnosis surround handling of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, as not all codes are not billable and some diagnoses are not even encoded. Challenges in Radiology are of metadata mostly not formatted according to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), and reports are unstructured. Challenges in Pathology hold generation of unstructured reports, and frequent utilization of unstandardized nomenclature. Challenges in Clinical Evidence &amp; Outcomes consist of insufficient data types, and unavailability of universally adopted data models. Challenges in Procedures mainly cover the process for approving new procedural codes. Authors have discussed the evolution of EHR to effectively delivering personalized treatment. With discussion of two case studies, they emphasized the implementation of precision medicine for the personalized delivery of care based on patient-specific patterns of disease progression and determination of precise therapies.</p>

<p>Personalized medicine is a broad and rapidly advancing field in healthcare, primarily based on disease-related clinical, genomic, metabolomics and environmental information. However, failure to correctly identify disease is one of the major reasons for misleading diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for the patient. A research group presented essential components (pattern recognition, knowledge base, ontology and patient profile) for accurate disease examination needed for successfully integrating personalized medicine into everyday clinical practice. Utilizing ML approaches for pattern recognition and development of statistical models (sample size and effect size), creating a knowledgebase of all existing phenotype categories and disease, organization of clinical datasets of population size and open software platform development for statistical analysis of high-dimensional healthcare and multi-omics data are crucial for practical realization of precision medicine.</p>

Overcoming the visual limitation of such techniques for leading different classifications of a given sample by different individuals, a group of authors discussed ML as a precise solution for accurate diagnosis by analyzing molecular data. A previous study trained an ML classifier at a maximum number of images of tumors that were classified by physicians, as it is not possible to get precise conclusions, especially when tumor is histologically indistinguishable. Authors discussed the application of supervised ML for analyzing central nervous system (CNS) tumor-type genome-wide methylation data to identify methylation patterns.

They discussed advancements in the era of big data for computer-aided diagnosis, and a recent concept of precision medicine for providing care for clinical, environmental and genetic characteristics. Authors emphasized developing new ML algorithms for computational analysis of genomic data to systematize the process of finding genetic similarities among patients with similar prognosis, or response to a treatment. They also stressed the need of implementing intelligent procedures to ensure the privacy of data, as they believe that data anonymization is not enough to guarantee unidentifiability due to auxiliary information. They discussed some existing solutions, which includes de-identification by data suppression, k-anonymization, learning from noisy data, homomorphic encryption, multi-party computation, cryptographic hardware and protecting genomic databases. Authors acknowledged the current contributions of ML but with the expectations for substantial improvements to address clinical data security problems and development of new significant ML models to address the challenges of gene variations and similarities among patients.

This is a review on the perspective applications of data science current problems in healthcare, which includes the need of significant computational power to contribute to solving data optimization problems, overfitting in experimental designs, lack of data standardization, large-scaled datasets for training ML classifiers and other concerns in clinical laboratories, e.g. protected health information challenges, financial limitations and ethical concerns. Authors discussed the concept that data science and AI mimics human processes and improves the process of decision-making. They reasoned the use of predictive modeling for better collaboration between hospitals without sharing data and complying privacy regulation through ML (supervised and unsupervised learning) for healthcare data (clinical data, imaging, laboratory tests) mining, analysis and optimization, identification of large patient clusters with certain disease characteristics, reducing medical errors and cost and improving efficiency of staff and resources. Data science has its own applicability and ethical challenges especially related to AI integration. AI encompassing data science when adopted can even improve human thought processes in efficient decision-making with different ML algorithms, data mining, knowledge discovery, improving complex analytical tasks and calculating clinical pathways. Authors of a study acknowledged success stories of ML in healthcare (radiology, pathology, dermatology and genomics), weather forecasting, structural recognition, NLP, games, analyses of financial transactions and improvements in industrial processes by finding patterns, discovering inefficiencies, predicting outcomes and taking factual decisions. They provided examples of ML application in healthcare for the detection of cervical cancer (neural networks), prediction of histological diagnoses (artificial neural network-based decision-support scoring systems) and radical hysterectomies with gene expression analysis (neuronal network), DNA (epigenetic modifications) and RNA (messenger, long non-coding or double-stranded) data analysis. ML is contributing to better personalized treatment by monitoring patient activities (analyzing data received by sensors for continuous measurement, e.g. glucose); analyzing molecular biomarkers; predicting drug efficacies, treatment responses and disease pathways; and identifying molecular factors and genetic variants. The authors presented an ML framework, which includes defining tasks, matrices, models and datasets. They showed concerns regarding implementation of human rights by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the 1948 United Nations General Assembly for data privacy, protection, de-identification and encryption for data handling, collection and sharing.

<title>6. Theoretical background of AI, ML and examples in healthcare</title>
<p>AI aimed to improve the intellectual capabilities and performances of machines to solve complex and big data-oriented problems by classifying interaction patterns among variables, learning from experiences, strategizing and predicting better orientations. AI has been in business for almost over 50 years, and its applications are heavily demanded in numerous fields of life, science, technology and medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref>). AI developments are based on supervised, unsupervised and reinforced learning principles, which include computational command line, desktop, web-based, robotics and smartphone applications with different analytics capabilities, e.g. machine translation, speech recognition, NLP, data mining, risk modeling, image recognition, machine vision, knowledge bases, expert systems and agent-based systems. AI is categorized in four main types for decision-making, which are reactive machines (based on the current situation without learning from experiences), limited memory (based on short memory, and learning from experiences), theory of mind (based on humanlike capabilities and abilities to attribute mental states) and self-awareness (based on human-level consciousness).</p>

<p>ML is a branch of AI that utilizes and proposes different algorithms for learning from numerous data variables and revealing multifaceted relationships among data features to predict accuracies in different contexts and support decision-making processes. The overall ML process starts with the manifestation of either or both data and labels, training classifier to learn and model using an algorithm and then performing data evaluation and analysis to estimate final results. ML is mainly categorized in three learning approaches: classification, cluster, and regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Classification and regression are based on supervised learning, while clustering involves unsupervised learning. Classification predicts discrete, categorical response values by using labels and parameters, e.g. determining if a biopsy sample is cancerous or not (positive/negative). Cluster is to partition data into sub-groups, e.g. what is the prevalence of disease recurrence (positive/negative) in a certain population due to pollution or chemical spill (common relationship between dataset). Regression predicts continuous-response numeric values to identify distribution trends, e.g. how long before a patient is readmitted to the hospital following his/her discharge (positive/negative).</p>

Its ML benefits include modeling nonlinear class boundaries, unlikely overfitting, reduced computational complexity to quadratic optimization problems and controllable complexity of decision rule and frequency of error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref109">109</xref>). However, the complex structure of this algorithm is its limitations leading to slow data processing speed, and difficulties in determining optimal parameters especially when training dataset is not linearly classified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref>).</p>
<p>Deep learning is a dominant approach based on artificial neural network. It was inspired by the ability of the brain to learn complicated patterns, and one of the most popular ML algorithms in healthcare today, aiming to advance clinical medicine and care delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). The artificial neural network base gives its several nested layers of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref110">110</xref>) to learn complex relationships between features and labels from heterogeneous clinical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). Deep learning has four categories: deep belief network, deep neural network, convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>) for implementing pattern recognition and predictive modeling at high-dimensional big data sets. It is fundamentally a uniquely different paradigm in ML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">111</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">112</xref>) and its capabilities include multitasking, automatic construction of complex features, digitization of EHR and image-based data, integrating heterogeneous data sets assembled from diverse sources, combining with wearables for remote monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). Its ML benefits include application in classification or regression with ability to represent Boolean functions (AND, OR, NOT), handling noisy inputs and classifying instances for more than one output. However, its limitations include difficulties in understanding structures of algorithms, possibility of too many overfitting attributes and its optimal network structure which can only be created by experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref>). Deep learning is one of the most widely used algorithms in medicine for analyzing different types of images from various healthcare disciplines but especially oncology, e.g. thoracic (lung cancer); abdominal and pelvic (computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)); colonoscopy (colonic polyps); mammography (microcalcifications); brain (brain tumors); radiation oncology (segmenting tumors for radiation, and quantifying specific radiographic characteristics by analyzing 3D shape of a tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref114">114</xref>)); dermatology (skin cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref115">115</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref>)); pathology (digital whole-slide of biopsy samples) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref115">115</xref>); prostate (cancer tumors by analyzing ultrasound of biopsy cores); malignant lung nodules by analyzing radiographs; glioma by analyzing histological imaging and genomic marker data; and DNA and RNA sequencing (RNA-binding and DNA-binding proteins). Furthermore, deep learning has been applied for the diagnosis of several other diseases, e.g. nodular BCC, dermal nevus and seborrheic keratosis in dermatopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref116">116</xref>); diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>); type 2 diabetes subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>); diabetic retinopathy by analyzing retinal images; histological prediction in women with cytological abnormalities; measure medication adherence via camera interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>); and cardiac anomalies and congestive heart failure by analyzing images of MRI of heart ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref117">117</xref>).</p>
<p>Logistic regression is a statistical method to assess the relationships between various predictor categorical and continuous variables and dichotomous binary outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref118">118</xref>). It has been applied in the fields of medicine (clinical practice, surgery), epidemiology and biochemistry to perform predictive and explanatory modeling by obtaining odds ratios and risk factors explaining variations in specific outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref119">119</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref120">120</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref121">121</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref122">122</xref>). Its examples of real-time implementation in the field of medicine include risk assessment of complex diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref123">123</xref>) (e.g. tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref124">124</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref125">125</xref>)), predicting patient survival rate and diagnosing coronary heart disease (CHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref123">123</xref>), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma diagnosis with multivariable logistic regression modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref126">126</xref>), and identification of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) by analyzing prognostic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref127">127</xref>). Its ML benefits include concurrent multiple explanatory variables analysis with reduced effect of confounding factors and modeling categorical dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref128">128</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref129">129</xref>). However, its limitation lies in handling continuous explanatory variables with more than two levels as it is based on variables with a constant range of values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref122">122</xref>), difficulties in understanding odds and probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref119">119</xref>), right predictor variable selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref118">118</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref122">122</xref>), reference group setup and managing relationships between input and output variables.</p>
<p>Discriminant analysis is a widely applied technique in medical studies for pattern recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref130">130</xref>). Discriminant analysis is used to predict and classify group members by building one or multiple functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref131">131</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref132">132</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref133">133</xref>) based on normal distribution and equal variance–covariance of independent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref134">134</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref135">135</xref>). Its real-time applications include identifying surgical and operative factors to accurately classify patients for surgical procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref136">136</xref>), predict the clinical diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref137">137</xref>), patients’ symptom-relief satisfaction data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref138">138</xref>), prediction of depression elements in cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref135">135</xref>), classification of BOLD fMRI response to naturalistic movie stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref139">139</xref>), identify protein coding regions of rice genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref140">140</xref>), Parkinson’s disease symptoms recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref141">141</xref>), risk assessment for chronic illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref142">142</xref>), diagnosis of hypercalcemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref143">143</xref>) and predicting patient care visits by identifying discriminatory characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">144</xref>). Its ML benefits include robustness, reduced dimensionality, easy implementation as it requires fewer parameters to be estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref137">137</xref>). However, its limitations include over-fitting to dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref131">131</xref>), limit performance at novel datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref145">145</xref>) and lack of cross-validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref137">137</xref>).</p>
<p>The decision tree utilizes a tree structure modeling approach with conditional control statements for establishing an efficient decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref146">146</xref>). The decision tree is based on the concept of classification rules, following paths from root to leaf. Its internal nodes represent ‘test’ on an attribute, branch represents the outcome of the test and leaf represents decision taken after computing all attributes. Its ML benefits include ease of understanding, order of training algorithm instances with no effect, and no overfitting problem while pruning, allowing predictive model implementation with high precision, permanence and ease of clarification, well-mapped non-linear relationships and suitability for both classification or regression problems. However, its limitations include mutually exclusive classes, dependency on order of attribute selection, being error-prone when training on excessively complex decision tree, time-consumption and branching of missing values for an attribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref>). It has been well applied in the field of medicine for real-time healthcare monitoring, medical decision support system, anomaly detecting and sensor and a data mining model for pollution prediction. A few real-time examples include supporting clinical decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref147">147</xref>), strategies for alternating therapies in oncology patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref148">148</xref>), collaborative clinical decision-making in mental health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref149">149</xref>), identifying predictors of health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref150">150</xref>), finding factors related to hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref151">151</xref>), discovering factors associated with pressure ulcers (PUs) among elderly people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref152">152</xref>), identifying the potential recipients of telehealth services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref153">153</xref>), patient data stratification for interpretable decision-making for precision medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref154">154</xref>), content analysis for patient aids decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref155">155</xref>), diabetic foot amputation risk analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref156">156</xref>) and support understanding of antenatal lifestyle interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref157">157</xref>).</p>
<p>Random forest is also known as the random decision forest, a combination of algorithms to build predictive models for classification and regression problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref158">158</xref>). Its classifier generates a set of decision trees based on training of randomly selected subsets to aggregate the elects from different decision trees to get final object. Its ML benefits include overcoming the problem of overfitting, less variance, not requiring input data preparation, flexibility and high accuracy even with missing large portions of the data. However, its limitations include its complexity, difficulty in implementing, requirements for additional computational resources, less intuitiveness and more time consumption than most other algorithms. Nevertheless, it has been applied in the field medicine for data mining, real-time patient monitoring, disease classification, implementation in wearables and personal devices and modeling big data based on engine recommendations. Some of its reported contributions include diagnosing mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref106">106</xref>), detecting knee osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref159">159</xref>), monitoring medical wireless sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref160">160</xref>), diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref161">161</xref>), predicting metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref162">162</xref>), predicting outcomes of a patient’s encounter with behavioral health providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref163">163</xref>), healthcare cost prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref164">164</xref>), mortality prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref165">165</xref>), classification of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref166">166</xref>), identifying social and economic factors to study social determinants of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref167">167</xref>), predicting disease risks from imbalanced data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref168">168</xref>), identifying associates of diabetic peripheral neuropathy diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref169">169</xref>), predicting the risk of emergency admission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref170">170</xref>), detecting patients ready to discharge from intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref171">171</xref>), nonparametric estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref172">172</xref>), diagnosing sleep disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref173">173</xref>) and predicting depression in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref174">174</xref>).</p>
<p>Linear regression is an ML approach to model relationships between dependent and independent variables using linear predictor functions to identify errors of prediction in a scatter plot and characterize relationships among multiple factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref175">175</xref>). Linear regression has been applied in the field of medicine for many computational analyses and predictions, from identification of prognostically relevant risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref175">175</xref>), predicting hand surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref176">176</xref>), monitoring treatment prescribing patterns and ensuring its appropriateness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref177">177</xref>), averaging decision-making in healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref178">178</xref>), reducing high costs of the health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref179">179</xref>), analyzing skewed healthcare cost data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref180">180</xref>) and understanding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref181">181</xref>).</p>

Naïve Bayes is well applied in the field of health performing predictive modelling for different diseases (brain, asthma, prostate, and breast cancer etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref184">184</xref>), predicting risk using censored and time-to-event data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref185">185</xref>), detecting Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref186">186</xref>), predicting Alzheimer’s disease from genome-wide data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref187">187</xref>), measuring quality healthcare services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref188">188</xref>), finding audit targets in performance-based financing in health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref189">189</xref>), modeling medical diagnosis for decision support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref190">190</xref>), classifying EHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref191">191</xref>), classifying and genetic scoring for risk prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref192">192</xref>), and designing a decision support system for heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref183">193</xref>). Its ML benefits include modelling based on statistical foundation, ease to understand and train algorithm, and usefulness across multiple domains. However, its limitations include difficulties in handling redundant attributes, distribution of statistically independent attributes, and management of class frequencies affecting accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref>).</p>
<p>KNN is also a supervised learning-based algorithm used for classification and regression in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection by classifying points to given categories from a training dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref194">194</xref>). Its ML benefits include implementation of instances for fast non-linear data classifications, robustness in addressing irrelevant or novel attributes, well-handled instances with noise and missing attribute values and applicability for both regression and classification. However, its limitations include languidity in updating description concept, expecting similar classifications and relevancy from instances with similar attributes and increase in computational complexity with the number of attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref>). KNN has been used in many scientific fields but with limited applications in the field of medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref195">195</xref>). Some of real-time examples include modeling diagnostic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref195">195</xref>), preserving privacy of medical diagnosis in e-Health cloud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">196</xref>), medical dataset classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref197">197</xref>), classification of lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref198">198</xref>), pattern classification for breast cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref199">199</xref>), pattern classification for health monitoring applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref200">200</xref>) and pancreatic cancer prediction combining published literature and EHR data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref201">201</xref>).</p>
<p>HMM was originally proposed to solve speech problems by making complex and instinctive probabilistic models for finding and processing hidden states and paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref202">202</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref203">203</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref204">204</xref>). Since the late 1980s, it has been effectively applied in the field of life sciences, especially in biology for analyzing sequence data (e.g. predicting exons and introns, identifying ORFs, insertions, deletions, substitutions, functional motifs in proteins, aligning two sequences and switching from exon to intron in a DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref205">205</xref>)) by capturing hidden information from observable sequential symbols. Later, it was well adapted in the field of medicine and its real-time contributions include modeling ‘Healthy’ and ‘Unhealthy’ unobserved health states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref206">206</xref>); analyzing time-series data on personal health check-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref206">206</xref>); improving length of hospital stay prediction and reducing health care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref207">207</xref>); mining adverse drug reactions from online healthcare forums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref208">208</xref>); monitoring, modeling and clustering medical inpatient journeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref209">209</xref>); analyzing healthcare service utilization after transport-related injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref210">210</xref>); monitoring circadian in telemetric activity data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref211">211</xref>); predicting patients entering states with a high number of asynchronies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref212">212</xref>); and analyzing subject-specific seizure and automatic segmentation of infant cry signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref213">213</xref>). However, its modeling limitations include computing probability of sequence observation, choosing an accurate corresponding state, adjusting parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref214">214</xref>) and dealing with correlations between residues due to the underlying decency assumption problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref215">215</xref>).</p>
<p>The genetic algorithm was inspired by Charles Darwin’s theory of natural evolution to solve constrained and unconstrained data optimization and standardization problems by repeatedly modifying a population of individual solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref215">215</xref>). Primarily, it is based on heuristic search with three active rules: selection of data elements (parents), crossover rules for two parents from children and mutation for random change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref216">216</xref>). Its ML benefits include easier implementation than other algorithms; application for feature classification, selection and optimization; and relative success. However, its computational limitations include development of non-trivial scoring function, complications in training classifiers of given data, and its being not the best method to find optima. It has been vigorously involved in the fields of life and medical sciences for benefitting analytics, development in radiology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, pediatrics, surgery, pulmonology, infectious diseases, radiotherapy, rehabilitation medicine, orthopedics, neurology, pharmacotherapy, health care management, obstetrics and gynecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref217">217</xref>).

<title>7. Discussion</title>
<p>AI and its application in healthcare could be another great leap in medicine and a transformational force for guiding personalized and population medicine with several computational benefits. The extent of its popularity in healthcare can be easily determined by the number of AI related published work in medicine. At the time of the study (09 April 2019), a total of 16 166 AI and ML papers were available through PubMed. The growth of scientific literature in AI increased in the last 10 years with 14 469 papers (2009–2019), and more than 70% work was published in the last five years. While the growing importance and relevance of AI in healthcare is indisputable, to improve public sector clinical practice, there is a critical need for development of intelligent frameworks to connect operational and analytical healthcare systems in a way that experts from multiple domains can perform measurement and predictive analysis. AI has the potential to play a vital role at various levels of clinical operations, research and analytics to achieve significant improvements in providing better individualized and population healthcare at lower costs, and together with better work-life style for clinicians and staff. The major barriers in successfully implementing AI in healthcare include gaps in AI building blocks and infrastructures; low quality data availability; business model sustainability; regulations and policies for data collection, usage and sharing; disruption in the physician–patient relationships; integration to operational health systems; reduced evidence and reproducibility; selection of most appropriate ML algorithm; lack of understanding of AI and ML processes to predict; hazard of dehumanization of healthcare data and job insecurity threat; conflicts of interest and impartial access; accountability exploitation of AI; ‘sanity’ check to minimize any bias; handling of misleading and erroneous results; and data privacy, ethics, consent and ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref238">238</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref239">239</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref240">240</xref>).</p>
<p>Determining which AI approach to use for which task is a challenge in itself. Classifying tasks based on available predictor variables is a key step to correctly addressing the problem. Traditional AI models can be used for simple prediction tasks while complex tasks require more complex models. The next step is to consider how the model will be used in practice. Setting rules to identify if a task needs to pre-process data before execution or if a complex task can be broken down into simple tasks is amenable to a traditional model. Creating and updating these rules is very time-consuming but is very useful. Availability of training data is another key factor in intelligent automation. Simple models can work with little data and few variables, but complex models require huge amount of data with multiple examples and scenarios as it is expected to remove noisy data and learn to identify complex statistical patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). Numerous approaches have been proposed recently to successfully target current challenges of implementing AI and ML. We studied and reviewed contributions and variability analysis of various approaches in healthcare. We defined 15 different features to assess the potential of discussed approaches (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TB3">Table 3</xref>). These features are (i) intelligent interface development; (ii) next-gen radiology and imaging tools development; (iii) global expansion of medical resources; (iv) automated ETL, linkage and data mining in HER; (v) risk prediction and containment of antibiotics resistance; (vi) pathology image analysis; (vii) AI in machines and medical devices; (viii) smart solutions and methods for cancer treatment; (vix) EMR analysis for accurate risk predictors; (x) wearable devices for monitoring patients health; (xi) smartphone applications as diagnostic tools; (xii) AI-based clinician decision-making; (xiii) search engine for healthcare data flow; (xiv) data privacy and security; and (xiv) personalized treatments.</p>

<p>Although many AI and ML-based approaches have embraced the data gold rush in biomedicine, many concerns remain, which include integration of biomedical data located in heterogeneous data sources; handling extensively available irrelevant, error-prone and missing data; unnecessary follow-up diagnosis and treatment as a result of overloaded health information; loss of data privacy and reimagining of confidentiality; ethical strain of gaining industrial profits with clinical decision-support systems without informing the users; possibilities of patient data exploitation, employment insecurity due to governance and management of big data; regulation of healthcare data analysis according to principles of bioethical law; evidence-based observational data analysis and screening, slow data processing speed and difficulties in determining optimal parameters; difficulties in understanding structures of algorithms; possibility of too many overfitting attributes and its optimal network structure; handling continuous explanatory variables with more than two levels; difficulties in understanding odds and probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref119">119</xref>); correct predictor variable selection, reference group setup, and managing relationships between input and output variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref118">118</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref122">122</xref>); error-prone branching of missing values for an attribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref>); lack of data availability on social determinants of health; difficulties in handling redundant attributes, distribution of statistically independent attributes and management of class frequencies affecting accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref>); increased computational complexity with increasing number of attributes; computing probability of sequence observation; choosing accurate corresponding states and adjusting parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref214">214</xref>); dealing with correlations between residues due to underlying decency assumption problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref215">215</xref>); and prediction modeling with biases in confounding, causal inference, complexity-based model selection, benchmark development and pragmatic interoperability including reproducibility and generalizability.</p>
<p>Potential solutions to these concerns are based on design and implementation of healthcare IT infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>); EMR documentation and automation of repetitive tasks with ML algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>); deep learning to mine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), train (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>) and learn complex relationships between features and labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>); ML algorithms to effectively link data between different platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>); development of effective clinical decision support systems (CDS) through the utilization of ML algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>); translation of local languages into EHRs and cloud-based data sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>); deep learning for integrative EMR analysis from diverse sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>); computer vision algorithms to identify accurate indigestion of medications for patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>); deep learning for speech recognition, image interpretation and language translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>); AI algorithms for diagnostic disease modeling and computer-aided design (CAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>); ML models to create knowledge base systems of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>); ML algorithms to predict outbreak patterns and surveillance for new emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>); integrative approach to help decision-making processes between physicians and AI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref89">89</xref>); ML algorithms to enhance and optimize cancer treatment and development of new drug treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>); ML algorithms to perform longitudinal population studies for analyzing the effects of treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>); ML-based hybrid model classifier to enhance overall healthcare predictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref>); and ML algorithms to transform clinical research into a much higher capacity and lower cost information processing care service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref>).</p>
<p>We also considered most adaptable traditional (statistical) AI and ML algorithms (SVM, deep learning, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, decision tree, random forest, linear regression, naïve Bayes, KNN, HMM and genetic algorithm) in healthcare and justified their contributions with living examples for different clinical applications, e.g. deep neural network for diagnosing eye diseases (diabetic retinopathy) by analyzing retinal images; diagnosing cardiac anomalies by analyzing MRI images of heart ventricles; detecting malignant lung nodules by analyzing radiographs; grading prostate cancer tumors by analyzing ultrasound of biopsy cores; and producing glioma survival predictions by analyzing histological imaging and genomic marker data. Some other non-traditional algorithms were used, e.g., ‘Watson for Oncology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref241">241</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref242">242</xref>) and ‘CURATE.AI’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref243">243</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref244">244</xref>), for analyzing EHR of cancer patients and recommend treatments and drug doses; TREWScore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref245">245</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref246">246</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref247">247</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref248">248</xref>) for analyzing EHR for predicting septic shock risk and analyze CT brain scans for three-dimensional convolutional neural network neurological disorder classification; ‘PowerLook Density Assessment 3.4’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref249">249</xref>) for analyzing mammogram images for breast density assessment; ‘OsteoDetect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref250">250</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref251">251</xref>) for detecting distal radius fractures in the wrist; cloud-based deep neural network algorithm for diagnosing cardiac anomalies and segmentation of lung and liver tumors by analyzing CT scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>); and AI system for breast cancer prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref252">252</xref>). Furthermore, major clinical oncological developments with the implementation of different AI and ML applications and algorithms include Chatbot; breast MRI interpretation; breast lesion classification; colorectal polyp classification; identification of colorectal cancer biomarkers in cell-free blood assays; gastric mucosal disease classification; detection of lung nodules in low-dose lung CT screening; prediction and evaluation of risk and malignancy and classification of dysplastic nevi, spitz nevi and basal and squamous cell carcinoma; detection of esophageal cancer; and identification of pancreatic cancer biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>).</p>
<p>The goal of this study is to highlight recent contributions and effectiveness of AI and ML in the development of computational systems towards better healthcare and precision medicine. We have reviewed and discussed multiple AI and ML-based approaches (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TB1">Tables 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="table" rid="TB2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="TB3">3</xref>) and algorithms with variable colors. Deep learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref253">253</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref254">254</xref>) has proven to be one of the most trending algorithms today, but this does not undermine the importance of other machine learning algorithms. We believe that a right approach and algorithm should be chosen for the development of the most effective solutions to the targeted problems. In spite of various traditional and AI-based solutions, current limitations and challenges by the healthcare community include uneven distribution of resources towards the future of digital healthcare; business model unsustainability; disruption in the physician–patient relationships; hazards of dehumanization of healthcare data and job insecurity threat; prevention of early adopters for dragging down to the lowest common technology denominator; inconvenient adoption of digital processes for healthcare interoperability; shortages in development of customized IT infrastructure for data science; global unavailability of de-identified healthcare data for research; understanding of how healthcare data of different people relates to one another; need to harmonize big data with the definitions of the clinical phenotypes and diagnosis; limited EHR systems for assimilating operational and analytics interests; EHR offering limited patient participation; unavailability of high-quality open-source EHR systems inviting third-party extensions and assertions; and inflexible EHR database schemas not geared for precision medicine.</p>
<p>To effectively meet the goals of healthcare data analytics, while dealing with the aforementioned community, and traditional and AI-based challenges, significant efforts are required from experts in multidisciplinary sciences. To facilitate and improve public sector clinical research and practice, there is a critical need for academic frameworks that can connect operational and analytical systems in a way that experts from multiple domains can perform measurement and descriptive analysis, even without strong computational background. There is a need to develop standalone, user-friendly, standardized, open-source, and comprehensive solutions, which implement healthcare data analysis by connecting all kinds of patient data generated from any of the existing commercial EHR systems at any level, which includes patient’s demographic information, personal life style, medical history, recent visits to the practices, providers attended, diagnosis performed, lab tests conducted, longitudinal images, medications and procedures, samples taken for wet and dry lab experimentations for research and treatment of disease with no cure. Furthermore, the ideal system should be capable of automatically linking and communicating with similar systems.</p>
<p>Unmet clinical research and operational data analytics needs development of intelligent and secure systems to support practice transformation for implementing precision medicine at a global level. Overarching goals include new multi-functional platforms founded on the clinical, AI and scientific premise that integrates and analyzes heterogeneous clinical data received from multiple platforms. We need to implement and train AI classifiers at available structured clinical dataset of over a million subjects to help in early detection and diagnosis of common, frequently occurring and rare diseases and predicting the performance of provided treatments. We need to further explore AI methodologies to design models segregating disorders, identify causative medical conditions and determine the best drug therapies, especially when adjusted for age, race and gender. The goal should be to accelerate clinical care and discovery by satisfying research aims, improving quality and transition of care, obtaining actionable care gap-based information about patients and developing communication and coordination across hospitals, specialists, community-based providers, sub-acute care, nurses, quality inspectors, management, researchers and analysts. We need to strive to address possible challenges that continue to slow the advancements of this breakthrough treatment approach.</p>
<p>Along with AI- and ML-based methodological developments, it is important to address the issues related to healthcare data privacy and security. In most of the cases, academic and applied research environments do not have access to the healthcare data. The major reason is secure handling of protected health information (PHI) and lack of trust by the healthcare institutions in providing access to their medical records. We need to develop secure research-based HIPAA-compliant frameworks for efficient PHI storage, pre-processing, de-identification and integration to serve a large community of users, support organizational policies and provide efficient access and connectivity. It is mandatory to implement HIPAA rules for system user data security, which includes application and data criticality, risk management and analysis, information system activity review, contingency plan, device and media controls, disaster recovery plan, data backup plan, emergency mode operations plan, device and media controls, access controls, security incident procedures, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, physical security, business associate agreements, polices and procedures, evaluation, audit, assignment of responsibility sanctions, workstation use and security. Furthermore, it is important to provide an external layer to the overall healthcare data analytics systems for placing clinical data in a distributed centralized structure; administering security by encrypting data as well as offering a multi-user-based graphical interface with controlled access; and supporting data backup with redundant data management plans.</p>

<title>8. Conclusion</title>
<p>Precision medicine is progressing but with many challenges lying ahead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref255">255</xref>), which require addition of useful analytic tools, technologies, databases and approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) to efficiently augment networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory and public health systems, as well as address ethical and social issues related to the privacy and protection of healthcare and omics data with effective balance. This will also require more efficient management of massive amounts of generated data, as well as earlier mined consensus and actionable data. Most efforts involved currently are manual and time-consuming, whether it is extraction of healthcare data from operational clinical systems, identification of common and rare functional variants, metabolite penetrance using listed features and abnormalities, examining relations between genomic variations and metabolite levels, analyzing biochemical pathways in metabolites with patterns of multimodal distributions for candidate genes and management and assimilation of healthcare, along with epidemiological and omics data generated at each step of entry, production and analysis. Cutting-edge, new AI and ML-based big data platform development has the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine and improve the quality and transition of healthcare by intelligently analyzing structured clinical data available in great count and volume, posing unprecedented challenges in data storage, processing, exchange and curation, and developing a better understanding of biology.</p>
