<abstract>
<p id="P1">With its ease of availability during adolescence, sweetened ethanol (‘alcopops’) is consumed within many contexts. We asked here whether genetically based differences in social motivation are associated with how the adolescent social environment impacts voluntary ethanol intake. Mice with previously described differences in sociability (BALB/cJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ and MSM/MsJ strains) were weaned into isolation or same-sex pairs (postnatal day 21), and then given continuous access to two fluids on postnatal days 34–45: One containing water and the other containing a ascending series of saccharin-sweetened ethanol (3-to-6-to-10%). Prior to the introduction of ethanol (postnatal days 30–33), increased water and food intake was detected in some of the isolation-reared groups, and controls indicated that isolated mice also consumed more ‘saccharin-only’ solution. Voluntary drinking of ‘ethanol-only’ was also higher in a subset of the isolated groups on postnatal days 46–49. However, sweetened ethanol intake was increased in all isolated strain-by-sex combinations irrespective of genotype. Surprisingly, blood ethanol concentration was not different between these isolate and socially housed groups 4 hours into the dark phase. Using lickometer-based measures of intake in FVB mice, we identified that a predominance of increased drinking during isolation transpired outside of the typical circadian consumption peak, occurring ≈8.5 hours into the dark phase, with an associated difference in blood ethanol concentration. These findings collectively indicate that isolate housing leads to increased consumption of rewarding substances in adolescent mice independently of their genotype, and that for ethanol this may be due to when individuals drink during the circadian cycle.</p>
