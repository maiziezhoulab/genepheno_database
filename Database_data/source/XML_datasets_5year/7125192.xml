<p id="Par1">Human and mouse oocytes’ developmental potential can be predicted by their mechanical properties. Their development into blastocysts requires a specific stiffness window. In this study, we combine live-cell and computational imaging, laser ablation, and biophysical measurements to investigate how deregulation of cortex tension in the oocyte contributes to early developmental failure. We focus on extra-soft cells, the most common defect in a natural population. Using two independent tools to artificially decrease cortical tension, we show that chromosome alignment is impaired in extra-soft mouse oocytes, despite normal spindle morphogenesis and dynamics, inducing aneuploidy. The main cause is a cytoplasmic increase in myosin-II activity that could sterically hinder chromosome capture. We describe here an original mode of generation of aneuploidies that could be very common in oocytes and could contribute to the high aneuploidy rate observed during female meiosis, a leading cause of infertility and congenital disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Meiosis in human females is error prone, resulting in aneuploidy, and as such is the leading cause of miscarriage and developmental disabilities such as trisomies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It was recently shown that human and mouse oocytes developmental potential is accurately predicted by mechanical properties within hours after fertilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In previous studies, we have deciphered how cortex tension is regulated in mouse oocytes and embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we showed that the nucleation of a cortical F-actin thickening by the Arp2/3 complex in meiosis I excludes myosin-II from the cortex, decreasing cortical tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This change in cortex mechanics amplifies an initial imbalance of potential pulling forces exerted by myosin-II at the actin cage surrounding the microtubule (MT) spindle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, the forces being probably stronger at the pole closest to the cortex because of the initial slight asymmetry of spindle position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Spindle motion is slow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> but is amplified by the progressive deformation of the cortex, made possible by lowering of cortical tension. This reduced cortex tension allows the recruitment of filaments between the cortex and the spindle, and therefore potential amplification of initial forces. The change in cortex mechanics is required for spindle migration from the oocyte center to its cortex, generating an asymmetric division in size after anaphase. The asymmetry in size of the meiotic division allows the preservation of maternal stores accumulated during oocyte growth and required for embryo development. Although the drop in cortex tension is required for spindle migration in oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, spindle migration is also prevented by a too low tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, the geometry of the division depends on a narrow window of cortical tension, regulated by myosin-II cortical localization, itself fine-tuned by actin nucleation. Defects in cortical tension affect the geometry of oocyte divisions, potentially impacting on their developmental potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In this study, we address the origin of early developmental failure due to cortical tension defects in the oocyte other than perturbation in the geometry of the division. We focused on extra-soft oocytes, which represent the most common case in a natural population of human and mouse oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. To specifically enrich in this subpopulation to be able to analyze a large number of cells, we generated extra-soft oocytes by using two constructs promoting a decrease in cortical tension when expressed in mouse oocytes. First, we used the cortical verprolin-homology coflilin-homology acidic (cVCA) construct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> that forces Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation at the cortex of oocytes, chasing myosin-II from the cortex, leading to cortical tension decrease and apparent softening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Second, we designed a construct that induces ectopic actin assembly by the FH1FH2 nucleating domain of formin 2 at the cortex of oocytes. We show that expression of this construct also induces myosin-II cortical displacement and reduces cortical tension.</p>
<p id="Par4">Using these two approaches, we observe impaired chromosome alignment and aneuploidy in extra-soft oocytes, despite normal spindle assembly and dynamics as assessed by MT density and growth measurements. By performing laser ablation experiments, we show the presence of forces applied by F-actin on the spindle and transmitted to the chromosomes. Even though the intensity of these forces appears reduced in extra-soft oocytes, they do not seem to contribute to chromosome misalignment. Rather, a cytoplasmic increase in myosin-II activity appears as the main cause of chromosome misalignment, potentially sterically hindering chromosome capture, as decreasing myosin-II activity in extra-soft oocytes rescues alignment. In this work, we describe a possible mode of generation of aneuploidies that could be very common in female gametes. Indeed, 36% of oocytes are measured as too soft in a natural population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. A fraction of these naturally soft oocytes might present chromosome alignment defects impeding on their future development after fertilization, contributing to the high aneuploidy rate measured in female meiosis, a leading cause of infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>

<p id="Par5">Extra-soft oocytes are the most represented case in a natural population of mouse and human oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. To specifically enrich in this subpopulation and be able to analyze a large number of cells, we developed tools able to decrease cortical tension.</p>
<p id="Par6">The first one is the cVCA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>), a construct that forces branched Arp2/3-dependent nucleation of F-actin at the cortex, chasing cortical myosin-II and leading to a decrease in cortical tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. As a consequence, cVCA-expressing oocytes (named cVCA oocytes hereafter) are extra soft. We followed chromosome alignment and segregation by live spinning-disk microscopy during meiosis I in cVCA oocytes. Whereas chromosomes are aligned on the metaphase I plate in controls, cVCA oocytes display chromosome alignment defects before anaphase I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). We defined oocytes with misaligned chromosomes before anaphase I as having one or several chromosomes away from the metaphase plate. Using this criterion, 48% of cVCA oocytes present chromosomes that are not aligned before anaphase I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref> right gray bar) compared with 15 % in controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref> left gray bar). cVCA oocytes still undergo anaphase on time, despite having misaligned chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This leads to aberrant chromosome segregation at anaphase I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref> red asterisk) and aneuploidy (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">1</xref> 80% of oocytes are euploid in controls vs. 37.5% in cVCA oocytes and Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>), as measured on intact oocytes using Monastrol spreads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (see Methods). To further characterize the phenotype of cVCA oocytes, we developed an automated and blind approach to discriminate statistically significant features different between control and extra-soft oocytes. This was achieved using an unbiased computational imaging approach to automatically threshold the stacks of images (control and cVCA oocytes 30 min before anaphase I) and extract the features differing the most between controls and extra-soft oocytes (as in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>). The aspect ratio was the most significantly different feature between the two conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). This feature is defined by the ratio of the minor axis length to the major axis length. When this ratio is 1, both axes are equal and the shape is close to a circle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref> red circle on the right). On the opposite, when the ratio is close to 0, the minor axis is much smaller than the major axis and the shape is flat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref> red ellipse on the left). For controls, the aspect ratio was close to 0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref> black curve bars), showing that the chromosomes were aligned. In cVCA oocytes, aspect ratios formed a bimodal distribution between 0 and 1, arguing that some of the oocytes displayed chromosomes that were aligned as in the controls but others displayed chromosomes that were misaligned (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref> blue curve bars). This computational approach allowed us to quantify and validate the chromosome alignment defect we observed in cVCA oocytes, and allowed us to find an easy criterion to measure it in an unbiased manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). This criterion was then applied manually in the rest of the study by drawing the bounding boxes around the chromosomes and measuring their width as a readout for chromosome alignment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Extra-soft oocytes have chromosome alignment defects in metaphase I.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Scheme of the cVCA construct. <bold>b</bold> Representative time-lapse movies of chromosomes (black, (H2B)-GFP) in control and cVCA oocytes starting 1 h 30 min before anaphase I (10 independent experiments).

<p id="Par7">To exclude the possibility that impaired chromosome alignment was specific to cVCA-expressing oocytes, we designed another tool able to decrease cortical tension, the cFH1FH2. This construct was obtained by fusing the FH1FH2 domain of formin 2 to ezrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>), forcing linear actin nucleation at the cortex of mouse oocytes. Similar to the cVCA, the cFH1FH2 localizes specifically to the oocyte cortex (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">2A</xref> bottom left panel). Unlike the cVCA and probably due to the difference in the nature of the network nucleated (branched for cVCA vs. linear for cFH1FH2), oocytes expressing the cFH1FH2 (named cFH1FH2 oocytes hereafter) do not nucleate a cortical actin thickening (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">2A</xref> bottom right panel and quantification in <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2B</xref>). Surprisingly, expression of the cFH1FH2 construct is associated with a reduction in cortical myosin-II levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">2C</xref> and quantification in <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2D</xref>). These data show that overnucleation of linear actin by FH1FH2 at the cortex of oocytes is sufficient to chase myosin-II. It suggests that myosin-II can be chased by steric hindrance and not by preferential binding to one type of actin network (linear vs. branched) at the cortex of mouse oocytes. Finally, cFH1FH2 expression induces an eight-fold decrease in cortical tension measured by micropipette aspiration (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">2E</xref>, 3.58 ± 1.1 nN per μm for controls and 0.41 ± 0.2 nN per μm for cFH1FH2 oocytes). Thus, cortical myosin-II removal in cFH1FH2 oocytes leads to cortex softening as for cVCA oocytes. Similar to what was observed with the cVCA construct, meiosis I spindle length is comparable to controls in cFH1FH2 oocytes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">2F</xref>), but its migration is impaired (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">2G</xref> and quantification in <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2H</xref>), consistent with the fact that cortical tension impacts meiosis I spindle migration in mouse oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Very interestingly, cFH1FH2-expressing oocytes also display chromosome alignment defects (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>). In controls, chromosomes are aligned on the metaphase plate at the end of meiosis I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> upper panels), whereas chromosomes in cFH1FH2 oocytes do not form a proper plate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> bottom panels). In particular, 61% of cFH1FH2 oocytes have misaligned chromosome before anaphase against 21% of controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>). To further quantify chromosome alignment, we measured the width of the bounding box encompassing the metaphase I plate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref> yellow square and yellow dash line). If chromosomes are misaligned, the bounding box width should be larger than when chromosomes are tightly aligned. Indeed, the bounding box width is increased before anaphase in cFH1FH2 oocytes (13.37 ± 3.1 µm; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref> magenta dots) compared with controls (11.23 ± 1.4 µm; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref> black dots). cFH1FH2 oocytes still undergo anaphase and first polar body extrusion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">2I</xref>), despite having misaligned chromosomes, leading to aberrant chromosome segregation at anaphase I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> red asterisk).</p>

<title>Too soft oocytes, smaller, have normal cytoplasmic activity</title>
<p id="Par9">As observed before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, cVCA oocytes display strong shape deformations inherent to their decrease in cortical tension (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">3A</xref>). The same is true for cFH1FH2 oocytes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">2A, C</xref>). These deformations are stable at long time scales (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">3B</xref> spanning 1 h 30 min) and at short time scales, as observed by high-frequency video microscopy (Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>). The presence of deformations in cVCA oocytes prompted us to precisely measure their volume. For this, we took advantage of the fluorescence exclusion measurement (FXm) method initially described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, to measure the volume of control and cVCA oocytes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">3C</xref>). The mean volume of cVCA oocytes is reduced by 9.45% compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">3D</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par10">We then wondered what could be the consequences of this volume reduction of about 10%, and in particular if it could impact cytoplasmic activity. Cytoplasmic activity represents the movement of the cytoplasm within a cell. The cytoplasmic motion translates into the movement of all intracellular organelles, as has been observed in Prophase I mouse oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. One could imagine that extra-soft oocytes with a reduced volume would have a more viscous cytoplasm, reflected by a lower cytoplasmic activity, impairing chromosome movement and resulting in chromosome misalignment. To test this hypothesis, we assessed oocyte cytoplasmic activity by tracking the movement of vesicles using high-frequency spinning-disk microscopy (Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>), as previously described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We measured the mean square displacement (MSD) of the vesicles, representing the space they explore, obtained by averaging the square of the distance traveled per unit of time. The MSD plots describing vesicle movement in the cytoplasm are similar, suggesting that the cytoplasmic activity is not impaired in cVCA oocytes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">3E</xref>). In conclusion, chromosome misalignment in cVCA oocytes is not due to a difference in cytoplasmic activity.</p>

<title>Too soft oocytes transmit weaker forces to chromosomes</title>
<p id="Par11">Defects in chromosome alignment could be due to altered forces transmitted from the cortex to the chromosomes. We first directly tested whether forces are mechanically transmitted to chromosomes in control oocytes and then whether a decrease in cortical tension results in aberrant forces, potentially impairing chromosome alignment in extra-soft oocytes.</p>
<p id="Par12">In control oocytes, chromosomes migrate from the oocyte center to its cortex. This migration depends only on F-actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and not on the presence of astral MTs as in mitotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, as oocytes are devoid of centrioles and astral MTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Actin is organized in a cytoplasmic network including an actin cage around the MT spindle, which is connected to the subcortical actin network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4A</xref>). The force generator element for spindle migration is likely myosin-II, which seems to exert pulling forces on the actin cage surrounding the MT spindle as shown using inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, there is no direct evidence that forces are applied on the spindle by actomyosin networks in oocytes. We assessed qualitatively these forces by performing laser ablation. The F-actin cytoplasmic network was cut between the spindle pole and the closest cortex at the end of meiosis I, 6 h 30 min after nuclear envelope breakdown (BD + 6 h 30 min) on several Z stacks spanning the entire thickness of the metaphase plate (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4A</xref> yellow dotted line, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4B, C</xref>, and Supplementary Movies <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Laser ablation did not damage oocytes, as they all extruded a polar body and arrested in metaphase II normally following ablation. After laser ablation, the response of Histone(H2B)-GFP labeled chromosomes was monitored by live microscopy during 1 min. MTs were visualized using very low doses of EB3-GFP to follow the spindle and make sure that the ablation was not performed within the spindle but away from spindle poles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4B, C</xref> and Supplementary Movies <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Before laser ablation, the chromosomes are clustered and aligned on the metaphase plate in control oocytes at BD + 6 h 30 min (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4B</xref> upper left panel <italic>t</italic> = 0 min). One minute after laser cutting, the metaphase plate shrinks (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4B</xref> upper middle panel). To quantify this effect, we measured the width of the bounding box encompassing the metaphase plate before and after laser ablation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4B</xref> in plain and dotted yellow lines, respectively). The width of the bounding box decreases progressively after ablation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4B</xref> upper panels and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4D</xref> black curve) arguing that the actomyosin networks exerts forces on the chromosomes. In contrast, when we performed laser ablation at BD + 3 h before spindle-cortex attachment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, we did not see an impact on chromosome behavior (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4E</xref> and Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">6</xref>). In addition, we never observed progressive decrease in the width of the bounding box without laser ablation in oocytes at BD + 6 h 30 min (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4F</xref> and Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">7</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the actomyosin network exerts forces on the chromosomes, which are indeed responsible for the motion of the spindle to the cortex in mouse oocyte.</p>
<p id="Par13">Previous work showed that spindle migration is impaired in extra-soft oocytes, suggesting that the forces applied on the spindle are altered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This was also predicted by a theoretical model, but never directly tested experimentally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In cVCA oocytes, chromosomes are scattered on the metaphase plate before ablation at BD + 6 h 30 min (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4B</xref> bottom left panel <italic>t</italic> = 0 min). After cutting of the spindle-cortex connection, the chromosomes remain scattered on the metaphase plate, which stays stable in width (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4B</xref> bottom panels, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4D</xref> blue curve, and Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">4</xref>). This suggests that, at that stage, the intensity of the forces applied on the chromosomes is reduced in cVCA oocytes compared with controls. Our results validate the mathematical modeling of spindle migration predicting that the intensity of forces transmitted to the spindle are diminished in extra-soft oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. We then wondered whether the decrease in forces applied to the meiotic spindle could have consequences on chromosome alignment.</p>
<p id="Par14">To test this, we turned to another type of oocytes, the <italic>Fmn2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> oocytes, which have reduced forces applied on their spindle.

This variation is a measure of chromosome alignment efficiency: if it is negative, it means that the ellipse shortens reflecting chromosome gathering. In control and cVCA oocytes, the variation is positive between NEBD and BD + 2 h, indicating that the ellipse elongates, corresponding to chromosome condensation and individualization (as described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>). Starting between BD + 2 h and 2 h 30 min, the variation becomes negative in the controls (black curve), showing that the ellipse shortens, suggesting that chromosomes are converging/aligning. In cVCA oocytes, the variation is close to 0 and significantly different from the controls at BD + 3 h and BD + 3 h 30 min (blue curve), showing that the ellipse does not vary, suggesting that chromosome alignment is less efficient or slower.

Levels of cytoplasmic myosin-II are comparable 2 h after cRNA injection in all conditions (control, cVCA, cFH1FH2, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">5B</xref>). Nine hours after cRNA injection, extra-soft oocytes have 1.9 (for cFH1FH2) and 2.5 (for cVCA oocytes) times more myosin-II in their cytoplasm compared with control oocytes at the same stage (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">5B</xref>).

Active myosin-II localizes in the cytoplasm and is enriched on the spindle and at the cortex facing the spindle at BD + 6 h 30 min in control oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref> left panels). This staining is specific, as it disappears in oocytes treated with the ML-7 inhibitor, a drug that inhibits myosin-II activation by MLCK phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref> right panels). Active myosin-II is also localized in the cytoplasm and enriched on the spindle at BD + 6 h 30 min in cVCA oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref> middle panels). By quantifying active myosin-II fluorescent intensity, we show that the levels of active myosin-II in the cytoplasm and spindle are higher in cVCA oocytes compared with controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b, c</xref>, 1.6 times more active myosin-II in the cytoplasm and 1.4 more in the spindle in cVCA oocytes), reinforcing our hypothesis. Next, we inhibited the activation of myosin-II in extra-soft cVCA oocytes and tested whether it was sufficient to rescue chromosome alignment. cVCA oocytes present chromosome misalignment in metaphase I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref> bottom panels, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref> bottom panels, and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref> top panels). However, these chromosome defects are no longer observed when they are treated with ML-7: chromosomes are well-aligned on the metaphase I plate until anaphase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref> bottom panels). We quantified it by measuring the bounding box surrounding the metaphase I plate width. The bounding box width is larger in cVCA oocytes (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>, 14.61 ± 3.25 µm for cVCA oocytes compared with 10.67 ± 1.90 µm for controls). Remarkably, the bounding box width is significantly rescued in ML-7-treated cVCA oocytes and is comparable to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>, 11.81 ± 2.04 µm for cVCA oocytes treated with ML-7). These results argue that an excess of active myosin-II in the cytoplasm impairs chromosome alignment in extra-soft oocytes.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Active myosin-II accumulates in extra-soft oocytes and decreasing its activity rescues chromosome misalignment.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Cropped images of representative control, cVCA, and ML-7-treated oocytes stained for active phosphorylated myosin-II (pMLC2, gray) at BD + 6 h 30 min.

<p id="Par23">In addition, we tested whether reducing myosin-II activity in control oocytes could improve chromosome alignment, as basal rates of chromosome misalignment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c, g</xref>) and aneuploidy (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">1</xref>) are observed in control populations of mouse oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The bounding box width is reduced in control oocytes treated with ML-7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>, 11.41 ± 1.58 µm for controls compared with 10.48 ± 1.37 µm for controls treated with ML-7). This trend reinforces the hypothesis that too much active myosin-II in the cytoplasm/spindle hampers chromosome alignment in oocytes.</p>
<p id="Par24">At last, we quantified chromosome alignment in stiff oocytes. For that, we treated control oocytes with U0126, an inhibitor of the MEK1/2 kinases that mimics a <italic>mos</italic><sup>−/−</sup> phenotype by inhibiting the nucleation of the Arp2/3-dependent subcortex, leading to retention of myosin-II at the cortex and high cortical tension, as we show in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par25">In this study, we show that chromosome alignment is impaired by artificial reduction of cortex tension in mouse oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), leading to errors in chromosome segregation and aneuploidy (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">1</xref>). It is usually thought that changes in cortical tension are transmitted mechanically to the MT spindle. In particular, F-actin is known to impact MT architecture and dynamics, potentially acting on chromosome behavior in oocytes and other systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. There is also evidence showing that myosin-II is involved in MT functions and thus potentially in chromosome behavior. Myosin-II localizes to the spindle and is implicated in kinetochore-MT flux in metaphase I carne fly spermatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. It is also localized to chromosome arms and to the spindle in PtK1 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In addition, myosin-II is required for proper spindle assembly and positioning in mitotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> and mouse cardiac myocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Another interesting example is the mechanosensitive role of cortical myosin-II on MT growth in endothelial cells, where inhibition of myosin-II activity prevents mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK)-mediated MT growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Finally, myosin-II was shown to interact directly with kinesins in astrocytes, which is essential for their migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Here we show using laser ablation experiments that changes in cortical tension are transmitted mechanically to the MT spindle, but that they do not impact chromosome alignment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">4</xref>). We propose that the signal transduction between a strong decrease in cortical tension and chromosome alignment may rather be biochemical. With decreased cortical tension, myosin-II dissociates precociously from the cortex and thus its global concentration increases in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). This could sterically hinder chromosome capture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>), leading to chromosome misalignment and segregation defects. This is reminiscent of starfish oocytes where an actin structure can sterically block kinetochore-MT attachments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Other examples of biochemical signaling between the cortex and the chromosomes are emerging, such as the coordination by Cdk1 of cortical tension maintenance and SAC inactivation at anaphase onset in mitotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. We lack proper tools to investigate precisely how excess of myosin-II presence and/or activity in the cytoplasm could sterically hinder chromosome capture in our model. However, phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin-II not only increases its ATPase activity but also promotes assembly of myosin-II bipolar thick filaments (for review, see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>), which could sterically perturb the local capture of kinetochores by MTs. In the future, it would be interesting to address it by computational modeling or using in-vitro models as described in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par26">Our results potentially describe an original mode of generation of aneuploidies that could be very common in female gametes. Indeed, 36% of mouse and human oocytes are measured as too soft in a natural population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and lower levels of cortical active myosin-II and lower cortical tension are associated with post-ovulatory aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Thus, some of these naturally soft oocytes could also present chromosome misalignment impeding their future development after fertilization, contributing to the high aneuploidy rate measured in female meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Measures of cortical mechanical properties could serve as a minimally invasive technique to assess oocyte developmental potential for assisted reproductive technology, as already explored for tumors (for reviews, see refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>).</p>
<p id="Par27">Finally, aberrant cortical tension, and especially cortex softening, are found in a variety of cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Deregulation of myosin-II activity levels has also been described in several human disorders impacting neurons and vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Interestingly, overexpression of myosin-II is implicated in cancer progression and metastasis, and myosin-II regulatory pathway genes are increasingly found in disease-associated copy-number variants, particularly in neuronal disorders such as autism and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, stressing the importance of its regulation. A recent study identified genes involved in mitotic cell rounding, most of which affect cortical myosin-II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. The mechanisms described in our study could therefore be relevant for somatic cells in normal and pathological contexts.</p>

Measurements were made in PDMS chambers that consisted in a simple straight 113 μm high channel. A 2 mm diameter inlet and a 0.5 mm diameter outlet were punched on either side of the channel. The chambers were irreversibly bound to glass-bottomed Petri dishes (Fluorodishes) by plasma treatment. To prevent cell adhesion of the cell and allow reusing the chamber for successive measurements on different cells, chambers were coated with PLL-g-PEG (1%). Before starting the experiment, the chamber was rinsed with M2 + BSA medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of 70 kDa FITC-Dextran (Sigma, Ref FD70S). Oocytes were measured one by one. Each time, the cell was deposited with a mouth-pipette in the inlet. To aspirate the oocyte into the middle of the chamber in a controlled manner, a 250 μl glass syringe was plugged to the outlet via an ~30 cm-long polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube previously filled with 100 μl of the M2 + BSA dextran solution.

<title>Cytoplasmic activity measurements</title>
<p id="Par44">The total vesicles stained with Nile red contained in oocytes at BD + 6 h 30 min were imaged every 500 ms with the stream acquisition mode of Metamorph on excitation at 491 nm. Nile Red-labeled vesicle tracking and MSD quantification was performed as described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> as follows. After subtracting the background, time-lapse videos were realigned using the rigidbody algorithm of the stackreg plugin in Fiji and then denoised on Metamorph using the Safir denoising program (Roper Scientific). Stacks were then corrected for bleaching using the Histogram Matching algorithm in Fiji and thresholded on Metamorph to generate a binary stack of vesicles. Tracking was then performed on these binary vesicle videos with the TrackMate plugin in Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/TrackMate">http://fiji.sc/TrackMate</ext-link>) using DoG detector with a detected object diameter adjusted according to the pattern of vesicles, a thresholding of 1 and sub-pixel localization, and the following settings for gap closing in the simple LAP tracker: linking maximum distance of 1 µm, gap closing maximum distance of 1 µm, and a maximum gap of two frames allowed. Tracks were filtered according to their duration, considering only tracks lasting for more than 25 s. The results of the tracking, including the diameter and the velocities of the vesicles, were provided as Excel and xml files. The velocities values correspond to the mean velocity of a vesicle within a track. For MSD analysis of vesicles trajectories, we used the @msdanalyzer MATLAB class described in: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bradleymonk.com/matlab/msd/MSDTuto.html">http://bradleymonk.com/matlab/msd/MSDTuto.html</ext-link>.

<title>Cortical tension measurements</title>
<p id="Par45">Cortical tension was measured by micropipette aspiration as described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Briefly, the zona pellucida of prophase I arrested oocytes was removed by incubating oocytes into M2 + BSA medium supplemented with 0.4% pronase. Oocytes were loaded onto a chamber equilibrated with M2 + BSA medium. A glass micropipette of a diameter five times smaller than the oocyte diameter was connected to a water reservoir of adjustable height to apply a defined aspiration pressure. Zero aspiration pressure was set before each experiment by checking the absence of visible flow inside the pipette. Observations were made through an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss) equipped with a ×40 immersion oil objective (Neofluar 1.3 NA) and connected to a CCD camera (XC-ST70CE, Sony). For every applied pressure, we monitored the length <italic>L</italic> of the oocyte portion aspirated in the pipette after 30 s and measure at which pressure <italic>L</italic><bold>/</bold><italic>R</italic> = 1, <italic>R</italic> being the internal radius of the micropipette.

<title>Microtubule growth speed and density</title>
<p id="Par46">Oocytes were microinjected with cRNAs encoding EB3-GFP, with or without cRNAs encoding EzTD-mCherry-VCA. Oocytes were allowed to proceed into prometaphase. At BD + 1 h 30 min, oocytes were incubated in M2 medium supplemented with 100 μM Monastrol for 30 min. MT growth speed was assessed through imaging a single <italic>Z</italic> plane for 5 s every 250 ms. EB3-GFP comets were tracked with Mosaic plugin for ImageJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Only the unidirectional tracks with comets visible for ten frames or more were selected and the oocytes included in the analysis had five or more of such tracks.</p>
<p id="Par47">The monoaster size and brightness were assessed on a maximum brightness projection image from stacks covering the whole volume of the monoaster. The monoaster size was measured by manually fitting an oval around the brightest part of the aster. The fluorescence intensity of EB3-GFP was measured within the central part of the monoaster and normalized by the background fluorescence in the oocyte cytoplasm.</p>

<title>Laser ablation</title>
<p id="Par48">Laser ablation was performed as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. We used a 355 laser and i-LAS<sup>2</sup> module (Roper Scientific) coupled to a Leica DMI6000B microscope enclosed in a thermostatic chamber (Life Imaging Service) equipped with a Retiga 3 CCD camera (QImaging) coupled to a Sutter filter wheel (Roper Scientific) and a Yokogawa CSU-X1-M1 spinning disc using a Plan-APO ×40/1.25 NA objective. Metamorph (Universal Imaging) was used to process the data. After calibrating the system, the ablation zone (region of interest, ROI) was determined. It consisted of a line of 15 ±1 μm in length positioned after the spindle pole in the cytoplasm of the oocyte. To perform the laser ablation, the spindle must be oriented with its long axis parallel to the observation plane. The laser ablation parameters used were as follows: 350 nm laser <italic>Z</italic> thickness 10 μm, dZ 1 μm. Oocytes were then images after ablation with the following parameters: 491 nm laser power during 500 ms, acquisitions every 20 s for 2 min, on one plane. Metaphase plate width was measured by performing bounding boxes containing all the chromosomes with the Fiji (NIH) software. The Microsoft Excel software was used to normalize the data.</p>

<title>Quantitative image analysis</title>
<p id="Par49">Computation of chromosome shapes 30 min before anaphase I: detections were obtained from manually cropped region of interest around the chromosomes using the Phansalkar thresholding method with radius 130 available in Fiji. All pixels of the detection were subsequently used to compute a covariance matrix. Eigenvalues <italic>L</italic><sub>min</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>max</sub> were obtained after diagonalization of this matrix and the aspect ratio (<italic>L</italic><sub>min</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>max</sub>), that is the ratio of the minor axis length to the major axis length, was reported for each cell.</p>

<title>Quantifications</title>
<p id="Par50">- Metaphase plate width was measured on oocytes expressing Histone(H2B)-GFP by performing bounding boxes with the Fiji (NIH) software. Measurements were done 30 minutes before anaphase only on spindles parallel to the imaging plane.</p>
<p id="Par51">- Myosin-II cortical enrichment was quantified by measuring the ratio of the cortical and cytoplasmic SF9-GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> fluorescence intensities. Oocytes expressed SF9-GFP alone (controls) and together with the cFH1FH2 construct for five hours in Prophase I. The background was removed from all images analyzed using Metamorph software. Cytoplasmic and cortical integrated fluorescence intensities were measured randomly six times in each compartment (cortex and cytoplasm) per oocyte using the same square ROI of 0.12 μm<sup>2</sup> (region smaller than the cortex width). Measurements were taken on one focal plane (corresponding to the oocyte longest diameter). The cortical fluorescence intensity per square pixels was then divided by the cytoplasmic one.</p>
<p id="Par52">- For myosin-II cytoplasmic accumulation over time, oocytes expressed SF9-GFP alone (controls) and together with the cFH1FH2 or cVCA constructs for nine hours in Prophase I. The background was removed from all analyzed images using Metamorph software. Integrated fluorescence intensities 2 h and 9 h after cRNA injection were measured randomly six times in the cytoplasm per oocyte using the same square ROI of 80 μm<sup>2</sup>. Measurements were taken on one focal plane (corresponding to the oocyte longest diameter).</p>
<p id="Par53">- Cortical thickness measurements were performed as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Briefly, cortical thickness, consisting of the cortical outer layer (stable throughout meiosis I) and the cortical inner layer (absent in Prophase I and progressively nucleated after NEBD in controls) was measured manually using Fiji software. Oocytes expressed GFP-UtrCH alone (controls) and together with the cFH1FH2 construct for three hours in Prophase I. Four measures per oocyte were randomly taken along the cortex on one focal plane (corresponding to the oocyte longest diameter). The difference between the cytoplasmic and cortical GFP-UtrCH signals was strong enough to discriminate between the two actin networks and to detect the cortical actin network boundary.</p>
<p id="Par54">- Spindle migration was quantified by measuring distances between the centroid of the oocyte and the centroid of the spindle (oocytes were incubated in SiR-Tubulin at 0.1 μM) using the Fiji (NIH) software. Measuring the distance traveled between the centroid of the spindle relative to the centroid of the oocyte allows discriminating between oocyte movement and spindle movement. Measurements were performed at two timepoints: 4 h before anaphase I when the spindle has not yet started to migrate to the cortex and 30 min before anaphase I when the spindle has almost reached the cortex in the controls. Analyses were done on a <italic>Z</italic>-projection of 8 stacks of 4 μm, allowing to get the entire spindle. Only spindle parallels to the plane of observation were quantified.</p>
<p id="Par55">- The spindle length measurements were performed using Metamorph software. Spindle length was measured as the distance between poles in spindles parallel to the imaging plane only.</p>
<p id="Par56">- The pMLC2 (active phosphorylated myosin-II) and F-actin levels were measured using Metamorph software. Three measures per oocyte were randomly taken within the spindle, and six measures per oocytes were taken within the cytoplasm on a projection of 20 focal planes.</p>

For comparisons between two groups, the normality of the variables was checked (D’agostino–Pearson’s normality test) and parametric Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests (with Welch’s correction when indicated) or non-parametric comparison tests were performed with a confidence interval of 95%. For chromosome alignment experiments, repartitions were analyzed for statistical significance using Fisher’s test with a confidence interval of 95%. For volume measurements, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to compare the mean of the two conditions. For the time evolution of SF9-GFP cytoplasmic intensity, a One-way analysis of variance test was performed with a family-wise significance and confidence level of 0.05 (95% confidence interval).</p>
