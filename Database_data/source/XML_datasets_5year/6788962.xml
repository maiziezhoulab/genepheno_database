<p id="P2">The 3q29 deletion confers increased risk for neuropsychiatric phenotypes including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and a &gt;40-fold increased risk for schizophrenia. To investigate consequences of the 3q29 deletion in an experimental system, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce a heterozygous deletion into the syntenic interval on C57BL/6 mouse chromosome 16. mRNA abundance for 20 of the 21 genes in the interval was reduced by ~50%, while protein levels were reduced for only a subset of these, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. Mice harboring the deletion manifested behavioral impairments in multiple domains including social interaction, cognitive function, acoustic startle, and amphetamine sensitivity, with some sex-dependent manifestations. Additionally, 3q29 deletion mice showed reduced body weight throughout development consistent with the phenotype of 3q29 deletion syndrome patients. Of the genes within the interval, <italic>DLG1</italic> has been hypothesized as a contributor to the neuropsychiatric phenotypes. However, we show that <italic>Dlg1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice did not exhibit the behavioral deficits seen in mice harboring the full 3q29 deletion. These data demonstrate the following: the 3q29 deletion mice are a valuable experimental system that can be used to interrogate the biology of 3q29 deletion syndrome; behavioral manifestations of the 3q29 deletion may have sex-dependent effects; and mouse-specific behavior phenotypes associated with the 3q29 deletion are not solely due to haploinsufficiency of <italic>Dlg1</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">3q29 deletion syndrome is caused by heterozygous deletion of a 1.6 Mb interval containing 21 protein coding genes. Individuals with the deletion are at increased risk for intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), generalized anxiety disorder, and schizophrenia (SZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In the largest association study of copy number variation and SZ to date, the 3q29 deletion emerges as one of only 8 loci achieving genome-wide significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Separate analyses have shown that the 3q29 deletion confers an exceptional risk for SZ, with an estimated effect size of &gt;40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This large effect size, coupled with the relatively low complexity of the interval and the high synteny between the human and mouse genomes, make this variant an ideal candidate for the development of a mouse experimental system. This is further aided by CRISPR/Cas9 technology facilitating engineered genomic rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Collectively, the 3q29 deletion is a compelling region to study because it provides an opportunity for genetic dissection of complex neuropsychiatric phenotypes.</p>
<p id="P4">Of the 21 genes within the interval, <italic>DLG1</italic> and <italic>PAK2</italic> have received attention as attractive candidates contributing to neuropsychiatric phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). DLG1 (a.k.a. SAP97) is a scaffolding protein that interacts with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA type glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Suggestive evidence for association between <italic>DLG1</italic> and neuropsychiatric phenotypes comes from sequencing studies where SZ cases are enriched for <italic>DLG1</italic> variants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). An expression study of post-mortem tissue found decreased DLG1 in the prefrontal cortex in SZ patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). PAK2 is implicated by its function as a regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics. Based on the current evidence for their possible involvement in neuropsychiatric phenotypes, mouse models have been created for both <italic>Dlg1</italic> and <italic>Pak2</italic> deficiency. A brain-specific conditional <italic>Dlg1</italic>-deletion mouse displays some sex-specific behavioral phenotypes, including subtle cognitive and motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). A <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mouse model displays autism-related behaviors and neuronal deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Drosophila models also support involvement of <italic>dlg</italic> and <italic>pak</italic>, but behavioral and molecular phenotypes are only seen when <italic>dlg</italic> and <italic>pak</italic> are simultaneously reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">We undertook a two-step approach to better understand the neuropsychiatric consequences of the 3q29 deletion and the possible contribution of <italic>DLG1</italic> to these phenotypes. First, we created a mouse harboring a heterozygous 3q29 deletion (henceforth referred to as B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice [nomenclature adapted from Mouse Genome Informatics, MGI:6241487]), and assessed gene expression, protein abundance, developmental weight trajectories, and behavioral changes associated with the deletion. Second, we used <italic>Dlg1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice to test the hypothesis that <italic>DLG1</italic> haploinsufficiency alone is sufficient to manifest B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup>-associated phenotypes. We performed parallel analyses in both B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> and <italic>Dlg1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. Our results allow for integration of existing data from mouse models of other 3q29 interval genes and pave the way for careful and rigorous dissection of the genetic drivers for neuropsychiatric phenotypes within the 3q29 interval.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Mouse strains and alleles</title>
<p id="P6">All mouse work was performed under the approved guidelines of the Emory University IACUC. To generate the 3q29 deletion in the mouse, two CRISPR gRNAs were designed at the syntenic loci in the mouse genome. The Emory Transgenic and Gene Targeting core injected 50ng/l of each gRNAs and 100ng/l Cas9 RNA into single-cell C57BL/6N zygotes. Embryos were cultured overnight and transferred to pseudopregnant females. Resulting pups were screened for the deletion via PCR and for an absence of genomic rearrangements by Southern blot (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Materials</xref> for primer sequences used for genotyping and probe details). The founders used (#127, #131) were backcrossed to C57BL/6N and analysis commenced in the N4 generation. All mice were maintained on a C57BL/6N background sourced from Charles River Laboratories. The <italic>Dlg1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice [MGI:3699270] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) were obtained from Dr. Jeffrey Miner (Washington University in St Louis) on a mixed 129/C57BL/6J background. The mice were backcrossed using marker-assisted breeding (DartMouse™, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dartmouse.org/">https://dartmouse.org</ext-link>) to obtain N6 Dlg1<sup>+/−</sup> mice that were 99% congenic on a C57BL/6N background (henceforth referred to as B6.<italic>Dlg1</italic><sup>+/−</sup>). Number of animals used in experiments is indicated in figure legends.</p>

<title>Gene and protein expression in mouse brain tissue</title>
<p id="P7">RNA was isolated from forebrain samples from 16–20 week-old mice (N=4 for each genotype) and gene expression was measured by real-time quantitative PCR (3 technical replicates per sample). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref> for list of Taqman assay IDs. Protein was isolated from forebrain samples from 16–20 week-old mice according to standard procedures and protein levels were measured by Western blot. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 2</xref> for antibodies.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Behavior Tests</title>
<p id="P8">Mice were on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and were given food and water <italic>ad libitum.</italic> Mice were between the ages of 16–20 weeks when behavioral testing commenced. All equipment was cleaned using Virkon. No method of randomization was utilized in the behavior studies.</p>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Social Interaction and Morris water maze:</title>
<p id="P9">The three-chambered social interaction paradigm was adapted from Yang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The Morris water maze was conducted using the same paradigm as Chalermpalanupap et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Prepulse Inhibition (PPI):</title>
<p id="P10">The San Diego Instruments (La Jolla, CA) SR-LAB startle response system was used to perform PPI. We used a two-day paradigm. On day one, we tested the ability of the mouse to startle to a series of increasing tones. On day two, we subjected each mouse through the prepulse inhibition paradigm. PPI was calculated as a percentage using the following equation: ((startle-startle.PP/startle))*100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Amphetamine induced locomotor activity:</title>
<p id="P11">The assay was performed in a locomotor chamber (San Diego Instruments), which consisted of a plexiglass cage (48×25×22cm) containing corncob bedding that rested between an apparatus containing infrared beams. The mice were given an injection of either saline or amphetamine (2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg, i.p.), and post-injection ambulations were measured for 2 hours. All treatments were spread over 3 weeks and were counter-balanced such that not all of the mice received the same injection in a given week. For the 7.5mg/kg amphetamine dose, a subset of mice was video recorded between the 30–60 minute post-injection time point. These videos were scored for stereotypy using the criteria as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) by an experimenter blinded to genotype.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<sec id="S11">
<title>Gene expression:</title>
<p id="P13">Data were analyzed by two-way, repeated measures ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons with Sidak’s correction, where appropriate (i.e. only when a significant [p&lt;0.05] genotype effect or interaction was detected).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S12">
<title>Behavioral Tests:</title>
<p id="P14">All behavior tests were analyzed following these parameters unless otherwise specified. Behavior was analyzed by unpaired t-test (when comparing 2 groups) or two-way, repeated measures ANOVA (when comparing more than 2 groups). followed by multiple comparisons with Sidak’s correction where appropriate (i.e. only when a significant [p&lt;0.05] genotype effect or interaction was detected).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S13">
<title>Amphetamine-induced Locomoter Activity:</title>
<p id="P15">All analyses performed in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Because the ambulation data were not normally distributed, the inverse normal function was used to transform the data to an approximately normal distribution. Proper transformation of the data was confirmed with the Shapiro-Wilk normality test implemented using the stats package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Linear mixed-effects models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation were implemented using the lme4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). All models included subject ID and timepoint as random effects; males and females were analyzed separately. Models tested for the main effects of genotype and treatment (saline, 2.5 mg/kg amphetamine, and 7.5 mg/kg amphetamine), and for an interaction between genotype and treatment. Saline was set as the reference treatment and WT was set as the reference genotype for all analyses. P values were calculated using Satterthwaite’s method using the lmerTest package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p>

<title>Confirmation of deletion using CRISPR/Cas9</title>
<p id="P17">To generate mice that recapitulated the 3q29 deletion, we took advantage of several features of the syntenic region on mouse chromosome 16. The mouse and human regions are almost identical with all 21 genes present in the same order (<italic>Bex6</italic> present in the mouse, not human). The mouse syntenic region is inverted; inversion breakpoints are identical to the SZ and ID-associated deletion breakpoints. The mouse region is also slightly smaller compared to the human region, 1.26 MB vs. 1.6 MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). To generate B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice, we mimicked the 3q29 deletion breakpoints by designing CRISPR gRNAs proximal to <italic>Bdh1</italic> and distal to <italic>Tfrc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). We performed PCR to confirm the presence of the heterozygous deletion in potential founder animals. To investigate whether the double strand breaks during CRISPR/Cas9 editing created additional genomic rearrangements in the region, we performed a Southern blot using a probe centromeric to the proximal breakpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). The radiolabelled probe hybridized to a wild-type 5.2kb XbaI fragment on the intact, non-deleted chromosome and a 6.2 kb XbaI fragment on the deleted chromosome. Of the 23 potential founders, we identified 7 (30%) animals that appeared to be properly targeted. The PCR products across the deletion were sequenced to determine the precise breakpoints for the two founders used [#127 and #131] (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Materials</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">We analyzed the expression of the 19/22 genes (<italic>Slc51a</italic> and <italic>Zdhhc19</italic> are not expressed in brain; <italic>Bex6</italic> is mouse-specific and not present in the human interval<italic>)</italic> using forebrain tissue from both adult female and male B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice. Using real-time PCR (RT-PCR), we found that expression of 18/19 genes tested was 50% reduced in female (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Figure 1a</xref>) and male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>) B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice compared to B6.WT littermates. The exception was <italic>Tfrc,</italic> which was not significantly reduced in female B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice, and only 30% reduced in male B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p id="P19">We then examined protein expression of eleven of the highest-expressed genes by Western blot. In both females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Figure 1b–c</xref>) and males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d–e</xref>), we found that only 6 of 11 proteins (DLG1, UBXN7, PAK2, PCYT1A, WDR53, and BDH1) were found to be significantly reduced in B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mouse forebrain tissue compared to B6.WT littermates; no genotype differences were detected for TFRC, SENP5, RNF168, FBXO45, and NCBP2. Thus, while the transcripts for 18 genes in the interval have decreased expression in a manner consistent with their haploinsufficiency, the corresponding protein levels are not always changed in B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice. These data demonstrate that B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice recapitulate the genetic lesion in 3q29 deletion syndrome and suggest leads for phenotypic driver genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S17">
<title>B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> display growth deficits</title>
<p id="P20">Individuals with the 3q29 deletion demonstrate reduced weight at birth, and this may persist throughout childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). To assess whether the B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice display a growth phenotype, we generated cohorts of female and male B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice along with wild-type (B6.WT) littermate controls. We weighed mice weekly over 16 weeks (starting at P8) and found that female B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice weighed on average 2.24 g less than WT littermates (p&lt;0.0001) and male B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> weighed on average 1.61 g less than WT littermates (p&lt;0.0005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a–b</xref>). These data indicate that the B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice recapitulate the reduced growth observed in study subjects with the 3q29 deletion.</p>
<p id="P21">We then assessed B6.<italic>Dlg1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice for weight deficits over 16 weeks (starting at P8). Female B6.<italic>Dlg1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice weigh an estimated 0.78 g less than WT (p&lt;0.05). The weight effect was not seen in male B6.<italic>Dlg1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c–d</xref>). The effect sizes for the orthologous 3q29 deletion are significantly larger than the effect sizes for the <italic>Dlg1</italic> heterozygote for females (p&lt;0.0005). Taken together, these data indicate that the growth phenotype in B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice is not due to heterozygosity of <italic>Dlg1</italic> alone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S18">
<title>B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice have smaller brains, but normal brain architecture</title>
<p id="P22">We examined whole brains in B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice for gross structural or anatomical changes. Both female (t<sub>21</sub>=7.316, p&lt;0.0001) and male (t<sub>15</sub>=5.231, p&lt;0.0005) B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> brains are <italic>smaller</italic> compared to B6.WT littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplemental Figure 2a</xref>). However, when we normalized the brain weight to body weight, we found that the brain:body weight ratio was <italic>increased</italic> in female (t<sub>21</sub>=3.876, p&lt;0.001), but not male (t<sub>15</sub>=0.4154, p&gt;0.05), B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> brains compared to B6.WT littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplemental Figure 2b</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P32">Here we report engineering a 3q29 deletion mouse model, and show it displays growth and behavioral deficits relevant to human 3q29 deletion syndrome phenotypes. Both female and male B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice weigh significantly less than their B6.WT littermates, over the course of postnatal development and into adulthood, consistent with a prior study of humans with 3q29 deletion syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In contrast, female but not male B6.<italic>Dlg1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice weigh significantly less than their B6.WT littermates suggesting that haploinsufficiency of <italic>Dlg1</italic> may be a partial contributor to the growth phenotype in female B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice. We found multiple behavioral differences in B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice that are endophenotypes of the neuropsychiatric disorders observed in 3q29 deletion study subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Male B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice demonstrated social and cognitive impairment in the three-chambered social interaction and MWM tests, respectively, consistent with ASD and intellectual disability seen in humans with 3q29 deletion syndrome. Female B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice showed an increased startle response consistent with reported hypersensitivity to acoustic stimuli in ASD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Female and male B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice showed attenuated sensitivity to amphetamine-induced locomotor activity at a high dose of drug, suggesting perturbations in the dopaminergic system and demonstrating a shared behavior phenotype. Disruptions in dopamine signaling have been shown to confer risk for both ASD and SZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We also demonstrated that B6.<italic>Dlg1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice did not share any of the behavioral phenotypes that are observed in B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice. These data indicate that B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice display 3q29-related phenotypes that are not due solely to haploinsufficiency of <italic>Dlg1</italic>.</p>
<p id="P33">The finding that the B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mouse recapitulates aspects of 3q29 deletion at the genetic and phenotypic levels strongly suggests that the genetic drivers are <italic>within</italic> the 3q29 interval. The major difference between the mouse and human intervals is that the syntenic regions are inverted. This inversion occurred within the great ape lineage, as chimpanzees and humans have the same (derived) orientation of the region, but rhesus macaques have the inverted (ancestral) orientation that is present in mice. A copy-number neutral inversion of the region has been identified in humans, with no apparent phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). This implies that the critical event for the phenotype is the deletion itself, not a misregulation of a gene outside the deletion region. The fact that all 21 genes in the human 3q29 region are conserved in mouse and single gene mutations of each are being analyzed on the same genetic background through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium argues the region is ripe for genetic dissection. The B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mouse provides an entry point for such genetic dissection and ultimately, understanding of the circuitry and molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes. Towards this goal, the behavioral deficits provide clues to which brain regions may be most affected by the 3q29 deletion: the MWM is a hippocampal-dependent task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), social interaction is a striatum-dependent task, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), and startle response is dependent on the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Thus, the observed deficits in B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice that we observed in the MWM are potential disruptions in these respective brain regions. Such relationships provide a starting point for evaluating the circuitry that may be disrupted in the B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice, which may also be relevant for human 3q29 deletion patients.</p>
<p id="P34">While this current work focused on specific symptoms exhibited by 3q29 deletion patients, the mice have the potential to inform other 3q29 deletion phenotypes. The ongoing Emory 3q29 Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.emory.edu/3q29/">http://genome.emory.edu/3q29/</ext-link>) has an active component where human study subjects participate in a comprehensive set of clinical evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Phenotypic data from the B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice can inform human phenotyping protocols and downstream analyses. For example, we observed sex-specific differences in our behavioral assertation of the B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice but only limited patient phenotypes have been evaluated in a sex-specific way. We suspect that the sex-based differences we observed in the mice are due to intrinsic biological differences between females and males. Certainly, sex-specific differences are exhibited in other neuropsychiatric diseases, notably ASD where four times as many males as females are affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Though purely speculative in relation to the 3q29 deletion, our behavior data demonstrates differences between B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> females and male mice, which could be due to sex-specific molecular phenotypes. While the formal possibility exists that the variability in estrous stage contributed to the sex differences we observed, we think this is an unlikely explanation. The females were group-housed, minimizing any such variation. Furthermore, male mice display as much variability in behavioral assays as female mice without estrous control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). These sex-specific differences are significant as they underscore the importance of studying both sexes in mice and humans.</p>
<p id="P54">Our <italic>Dlg1</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> analyses argue that haploinsufficiency of <italic>Dlg1</italic> alone is not sufficient to explain the phenotypes associated with the B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice, and points to either a different gene or a combination of genes within the interval that may or may not include <italic>Dlg1</italic> driving phenotypes. These data highlight the power of our approach. Recently, a neuron-specific deletion of <italic>Dlg1</italic> was reported to produce cognitive deficits in the males and motor learning deficits in the females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). While this work identified differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus, the transcriptional profile is likely much different when only one copy of <italic>DLG1</italic> is deleted as in 3q29 deletion patients. The tissue-specific complete deletion of <italic>Dlg1</italic> also focuses on the role in neurons, but other cell types, such as glia, may contribute to 3q29 deletion associated phenotypes.</p>

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, single <italic>pak−/+</italic> or <italic>dlg</italic>−/+ mutants showed no phenotype but compound <italic>pak</italic>−/+; <italic>dlg</italic>−/+ flies showed decreased number of neuromuscular boutons indicating a genetic interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). While this interaction remains unexamined in mouse, male <italic>Pak2</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice are impaired on several social tasks including the three-chamber social interaction protocol used in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Diminished <italic>Pak2</italic> likely contributes to the social impairment we observed in the B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> male mice.</p>
<p id="P36">Several behavioral assays performed in the present study did not reveal phenotypes in the B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mice. Based on the known manifestations of 3q29 deletion in humans, we hypothesized that some of these phenotypes would be apparent, such as anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). It is possible that more complex human life experiences such as early life stress contribute to these phenotypes. Alternatively, our mouse studies were conducted on the C57BL/6N inbred strain, which may have obscured modifying genetic elements. Thus, examining the Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> on different genetic backgrounds could reveal additional impairments. It is also entirely possible that the distinctions in phenotype reflect fundamentally different biology between mice and humans. Nonetheless, the B6.Del16<sup>+/<italic>Bdh1-Tfrc</italic></sup> mouse will be an important tool to move forward and explore these issues and to systematically generate sub-deletions to genetically dissect the regions of the 3q29 interval driving the observed phenotypes. This 3q29 deletion mouse provides an excellent tool to continue the quest of unraveling the puzzle of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
