<abstract id="ABS1">
<p id="P4">One fundamental, but understudied mechanism of gene regulation in disease is allele specific expression (ASE), the preferential expression of one allele. We leveraged RNA-seq from human brain to assess ASE in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). When ASE is observed in ASD, the allele with lower population frequency (minor allele) is preferentially more highly expressed than the major allele, opposite than the canonical pattern. Importantly, genes showing monoallelic expression (MAE) in ASD are enriched in those down-regulated in ASD postmortem brain and in genes harboring <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in ASD. Two regions, 14q32 and 15q11, containing all known orphan C/D box snoRNAs, are particularly enriched in shifts to higher minor allele expression. We demonstrate that this allele shifting enhances snoRNA targeted splicing changes in ASD-related target genes in idiopathic ASD and 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome. Together, these results implicate allelic imbalance and dysregulation of orphan C/D box snoRNAs in ASD pathogenesis.</p>

<p id="P5">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by deficits in social interaction and repetitive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and has a global prevalence of approximately 1 case per 68 people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Although genetic factors contribute to a substantial proportion of disease liability the genetics of ASD are complex with contributions from both rare and common alleles, including <italic>de novo</italic> mutations and polygenic inheritance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Despite this heterogeneity and polygenicity, we have previously identified a reproducible shared pattern of gene expression alterations in human postmortem cortex from subjects with idiopathic ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and replicated this signal in independent subjects with idiopathic ASD and dup15q<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This gene expression signal may be mediated by epigenetic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, such as DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> or histone modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, in addition to underlying genetic variation.</p>
<p id="P6">Allele specific expression (ASE) is a form of genetic regulation in which expression of mRNA at a specific locus is biased towards a specific allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. An extreme case of ASE is genomic imprinting, whereby a particular allele is completely silenced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. But, most ASE represents more subtle shifts in the allelic ratio rather than complete silencing of one allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> as evidenced by the observations of preferential reduced expression of mutant disease alleles, and a substantial proportion of cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) are mediated by ASE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Indeed, cis-eQTL and ASE are complementary mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. One advantage of analyzing ASE in patient tissues is that it is less influenced by genetic, environmental, and technical confounders because ASE relies primarily on within-subject expression comparisons, rather than comparisons between subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">A number of diseases can be attributed to abnormalities in ASE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. For example, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are rare neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from deletions within the highly-imprinted region, 15q11-q13. Conversely, recurrent maternally-derived duplications of this region lead to dup15q, a rare, but penetrant syndromic form of ASD comprising approximately 1% of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Although duplications generally increase gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, varied patterns are observed across genes in the region impacted by dup15q due to complex local regulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">In addition to known imprinted regions, ASE extends to over 5% of autosomal genes and is especially enriched in transmembrane receptors and cell surface molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. When not associated with parent-of-origin imprinting, such monoallelic expression (MAE) is random MAE (RMAE), which may be important for cell-type specific gene dosage effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that RMAE is involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, as recently observed for developmental dyspraxia caused by RMAE in <italic>FOXP2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In this case, ASE may contribute to disease susceptibility by exacerbating the deleterious effects of a mutation via haploinsufficiency, or mosaic somatic expression.</p>
<p id="P9">Except for one notable study, which showed that ASE in several specific genes may play a role in a subset of ASD cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, the role of genome-wide ASE has not been explored in a sufficiently powered cohort. The overall paucity of ASE studies in brain disorders, such as ASD, is likely due to several challenges including limited access to human brain tissue, small sample sizes, incomplete transcriptome-wide genotyping data, and reference bias in mapping transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Reference bias is attributable to reduced mapping of alternative-allele-containing RNA-seq reads (due to a greater number of mismatches) and can generate up to 40% false positive signals if not properly addressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, when these issues are properly addressed, ASE can be a highly robust approach to investigate the relationship between epigenetic variation and gene expression underlying diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Here, we applied an optimized ASE pipeline in a relatively large sample of postmortem brains from idiopathic ASD and control subjects. We found that most loci showing ASE are shared between ASD and control, which is contrast to ASE between the two brain regions, cerebral cortex and cerebellum, which shows large differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. A small proportion of loci do manifest significant reproducible ASE changes between ASD and controls, which may represent a novel form of genetic regulation related to disease pathogenesis.</p>

<title>ASE identification in brain</title>
<p id="P10">We first developed an optimized ASE identification pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>; Methods) to overcome potential challenges, such as reference bias in mapping transcripts, lack of transcriptome-wide genotyping data, and allelic expression bias introduced by ethnicity. We collected 263 postmortem brain tissue samples from frontal cortex (Brodmann area (BA)9), temporal cortex (BA41-42-22 (BA41)), and cerebellar vermis from 96 individuals (40 controls and 56 ASD cases including 8 cases with dup15q). Gene expression profiling was performed using RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and genotyping was conducted on arrays (Methods).</p>
<p id="P11">To overcome reference bias, we generated a novel reference genome masked for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could contribute to mapping bias. We compiled ~40 million possible variants based on the union of SNPs called from RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) and SNPs already identified from microarray probe sets and the 1000 Genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (Methods). We prepared a custom human reference genome after masking these SNPs (Methods). Using this masked reference, we identified and removed 11.13% of SNPs that showed biased mapping from a simulated dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (Methods). To collect transcriptome wide genotyping data from our brain samples, we performed imputation from genotyping array and RNA-seq based genotyping (Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">1c</xref>), and ancestry was identified for all samples (Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">For investigation of group-level ASE patterns across cases and brain regions, 1,163,249 heterozygous SNPs in 21,929 genes were used following quality control (Methods), and their significance was quantified using a linear mixed model to account for sample variation and covariates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>; Methods). The values of excluded covariates showed balanced distributions between control and ASD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>; Methods).</p>
<p id="P13">We filtered out all SNPs showing ancestry-associated variation to avoid any potential effects of population stratification (Methods). ASE was also assessed within each individual sample for quality-controlled SNPs using Fisher’s exact test (Methods). Both individual and group-level ASE studies underwent multiple testing correction for independent SNPs after linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based SNP pruning (Methods). Among the alleles showing ASE, we also filtered out reference biased SNPs related to proximal indels (Methods). As expected, SNPs within the same haplotype blocks show similar allelic expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">1g</xref>).</p>

<title>Common ASE patterns in brain tissues</title>
<p id="P14">For external validation, we performed two analyses. First, we compared genes with evidence of ASE with those in dbMAE, an integrated database compiled from ASE analyses across human and mouse tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Although this database contains data from mostly non-neural tissues, genes manifesting ASE in our study showed significant overlap with those in dbMAE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, although assessed separately in each brain region, there was strong concordance in common ASE genes between regions in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). For example, the overlap between genes showing ASE in the two cortical regions, BA9 and BA41 is extremely high (odds ratio (OR)=221.00 and p-value&lt;2.2e-16; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), whereas the degree of overlap between two more developmentally and evolutionarily distinct brain regions, cortex and cerebellum, is substantial, but lower than in the two more similar cortical regions (between BA9 and vermis: OR=49.00 and p-value&lt;2.2e-16; between BA41 and vermis: OR=72.54 and p-value&lt;2.2e-16). This is consistent with recent GTEx data analysis showing that the cerebellum has a distinct ASE pattern relative to other brain tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P15">For further external validation, we applied the specific methods and pipeline used in the primary analysis of GTEx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Both the GTEx pipeline and our modified approach showed similar patterns of distinct ASE between the cortex and cerebellum. In the GTEx data, the mean of ASE rates from the two cerebral cortical regions and cerebellum show significant correlation with our data (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9995 and p-value=0.0098; Methods).</p>
<p id="P16">The distribution of expression of imbalanced alleles was significantly shifted lower than balanced alleles (Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, p-value&lt;2.0e-16, the means of log<sub>2</sub>(RPSM): 0.37 vs 0.71; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). ASE was also enriched at known imprinted genes including the targets of RNA binding proteins, FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, ELAVL1 (HuR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and RBFOX1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; Methods). Genes showing evidence for ASE were also preferentially enriched for neuronal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and astrocyte markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). Consistent with a strong neuronal signal, they were also enriched for genes encoding proteins of the postsynaptic density (PSD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, similar to previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Remarkably, across all three brain regions, ASE genes are enriched for genes previously shown to be down-regulated in postmortem brain from patients with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). In cerebral cortex, genes down-regulated in ASD postmortem brain were enriched among those showing ASE. Those up-regulated in ASD were depleted in those showing ASE; 37% of down-regulated genes were subject to ASE. In cortex, genes up-and down-regulated in ASD were 448 and 503, respectively. However, among ASE genes, 84 and 181 genes were respectively up-and down-regulated in ASD (OR=1.92 and p-value=7.03e-06). Both ASE genes and those down-regulated in ASD are involved in synaptic transmission and vesicular transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, consistent with their enrichment in PSD and targets of FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, HuR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and RBFOX1 genes previously implicated in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Importantly, genes showing ASE also showed significant enrichment in genes harboring <italic>de novo</italic> ASD risk variants identified in two different studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>; Methods). However, genes manifesting ASE did not show any significant enrichment with GWAS data from several major psychiatric diseases including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, bipolar disorder (BPD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, major depression disorder (MDD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, schizophrenia (SCZ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>ASE patterns shared across idiopathic ASD cases and controls</title>
<p id="P17">Similar to controls, idiopathic ASD cases showed tissue specific ASE across the three brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Since the two cortical regions showed strong overlap in ASE and cortical manifestations of transcriptional dysregulation in ASD are more prominent than those in cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, we focused on the cerebral cortex for most of the subsequent case-control comparisons. We found that SNPs showing ASE are broadly and evenly distributed throughout the genome in both control and idiopathic ASD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The majority of genes exhibiting ASE (70.41%) are shared across the case and control groups providing further confidence in the reproducibility of these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Nevertheless, fewer genes showing ASE are observed in idiopathic ASD compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), and this was recapitulated when studying the rate of ASE at the level of each individual sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Comparing biological pathway enrichment in cases and controls revealed overlap and differences in ASE gene function. Genes exhibiting ASE in both idiopathic ASD and control are enriched in phosphoprotein, RNA splicing, and neuron projection pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Genes exhibiting control-specific ASE are significantly enriched for pathways related to growth cone and synapse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Though there are fewer idiopathic ASD-specific ASE genes than control-specific ASE genes, those showing idiopathic ASD-specific ASD are significantly enriched for pathways involved in transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Genes exhibiting ASE in both idiopathic ASD and controls show significant enrichment in genes harboring <italic>de novo</italic> ASD risk variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>; OR=1.68, p-value=5e-04 for ASD1; OR=3.83, p-value=0.001 for ASD2). However, control-specific and idiopathic ASD-specific ASE genes do not show any enrichment with either the rare <italic>de novo</italic> ASD risk variants or common variants from GWAS data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Quantitative allelic imbalance in idiopathic ASD</title>
<p id="P19">ASE is not always completely monoallelic and may involve subtle shifts in allelic balance, whereby one allele is quantitatively favored over the other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. To investigate this full spectrum of ASE in control and idiopathic ASD, we compared the distributions of the minor allele expression fraction for SNPs in which these calls are high quality (Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). As expected, the majority of heterozygous alleles show no evidence of ASE (herein called “balanced”) with the fraction near 50%. A much smaller number of alleles show complete MAE and accordingly their fractions are either 0% or 100%. Finally, we define “imbalanced” alleles as those that lie between the balanced and MAE distribution ranges. Controls had a higher density of balanced alleles than ASD cases while idiopathic ASD cases showed more imbalanced alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). However, controls showed significantly more major allele MAE for low frequency alleles (minor allele frequency (MAF)&lt;0.05) compared to idiopathic ASD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). These patterns were recapitulated in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the chromosome X (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">We next investigated whether the differential ASE pattern was related to the MAF genome-wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). The disease specific patterns (balanced alleles: control &gt; idiopathic ASD; imbalanced alleles: control &lt; idiopathic ASD) were largely stable across the range of MAFs. However, we observed that complete MAE was strictly limited to rare alleles. Furthermore, preferential major allele expression becomes stronger as the minor allele frequency decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Major alleles exhibiting MAE are enriched in genes that are more tolerant of loss of function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (LoF; Methods) and missense mutations compared to those showing balanced expression (chi-square test p-value=0.0134; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). This suggests that a bias towards the major allele expression may provide a buffer against the consequences of potentially deleterious mutations. Remarkably, this preferential pattern of major allele expression shows a significant interaction with idiopathic ASD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). On average, minor alleles are preferentially more highly expressed in idiopathic ASD than in controls (Minor/major allele ratio: 0.79 in ASD and 0.75 in control; chi-square test p-value=7.33e-11). Together, these results indicate that rare and potentially pathogenic alleles are more likely to be unmasked in idiopathic ASD brain by the patterns of ASE.</p>

<title>Monoallelic expression occurs primarily from the major allele</title>
<p id="P21">Overall, we observed a strong bias towards expression of the major allele for sites in genes harboring rare minor alleles and MAE alleles. However, unlike global ASE patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) MAE patterns differed between cases and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Although MAE SNPs were observed across the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), there was an approximately 2-fold enrichment on chromosome 15 harboring a number of known imprinted loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Reasoning that this could provide a convergent mechanism underlying the co-occurrence of dup15q syndrome and idiopathic ASD, we next investigated MAE in 8 cases of dup15q. We observed a substantial enrichment of minor allele MAE in ASD and dup15q compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>; 2.5 and 2.7fold, respectively). This genome-wide enrichment pattern persisted when SNPs were analyzed at individual genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">6b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">Overall, minor allele predominant MAE was significantly enriched on chromosomes 14 and 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>) with ASD and dup15q showing stronger patterns compared to controls. Compared to chromosome 14, chromosome 15 exhibited a substantially higher minor allele MAE fraction in both ASD and dup15q than controls (3.9- and 1.6-fold, respectively; chi-square test p-values&lt;2.2e-16 and 0.0184, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Chromosomes 3, 6, and 7 also showed higher fractions of minor allele MAE in ASD and dup15q subjects than controls, of which only chromosome 3 was significant in both (4.2- and 9.8-fold, respectively; chi-square p-values=0.0022 and 8.89e-08, respectively). However, we focused on the chromosome 14 and 15 for further analysis since chromosome 3 had an overall lower degree of minor allele MAE.</p>
<p id="P23">Pathway analysis of minor allele MAE genes showed strong enrichment for known imprinted genes, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Interestingly, these MAE genes were enriched for distinct pathways from typical ASE genes that favor major allele expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) suggesting that orthogonal biological processes are involved. For example, genes showing minor allele MAE showed no overlap with astrocyte markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, PSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, or ASD-specific down-regulated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). However, they did show enrichment for genes harboring known rare mutations increasing risk for ASD (SFARI genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>; Methods) whereas other classes of genes showing ASE did not. Like genes that manifest ASE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), major allele MAE genes show significant enrichment with genes associated with the rare <italic>de novo</italic> ASD risk variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>). However, MAE genes in control and ASD showed some enrichment with common variants from GWAS data of BPD and SCZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>

<title>Allele shift regions enriched in minor allele MAE in ASD and dup15q and snoRNAs</title>
<p id="P24">We have so far demonstrated that ASD and dup15q are associated with an increased rate of genes showing minor allele MAE that are enriched on chromosomes 14 and 15 and overlap known ASD risk genes, especially those harboring deleterious mutations that act via haploinsufficiency. Interestingly, the genomic regions showing MAE allele shifts from major to minor allele in both ASD and dup15q relative to controls are located on just a few chromosomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1b</xref>) and overlap regions known to harbor ASD-associated CNVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Among commonly existing MAE alleles, the frequencies of the allele shift in ASD and dup15q are 15.52% and 2.62%, respectively. To understand the effect of this apparent MAE allele shift in ASD, we compiled a set of high confidence genomic regions which we called “allele shift rich regions”. We defined these regions as having such allele shifts in both ASD and dup15q relative to controls. This analysis identities only two genomic regions, 14q32 (chr14:101302,638–101,544,745) and 15q11 (chr15:25,223,730–25,582,395), which are known imprinted loci that have many small splice junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) and show continuous high expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) as single transcript units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Both regions also contain tandem repeats of multiple orphan C/D box snoRNA genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, which are located within repeated introns of <italic>MEG8</italic><sup>40</sup>, <italic>SNURP-SNFPN</italic>, and <italic>SNHG14</italic> transcripts. Indeed, all known orphan C/D box snoRNA genes are located within these two regions, including <italic>SNORD113</italic> and <italic>SNORD114</italic> at 14q32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), and <italic>SNORD64</italic>, <italic>SNORD107</italic>, <italic>SNORD108</italic>, <italic>SNORD109</italic>, <italic>SNORD115</italic>, and <italic>SNORD116</italic> at 15q11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). These snoRNA genes are highly expressed in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and control alternative splicing of specific target genes without complementarity to rRNA within their sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P25">To begin to understand the impact of the allele shift at the regions, we next assessed whether they were differentially expressed in ASD or dup15q cases versus controls. Analysis of RNA-seq data showed regional downregulation of 15q11 in ASD (p-value=0.0016; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). <italic>SNORD116–24</italic> downregulation was observed in ASD and dup15q from small non-coding RNA-seq data (sncRNA-seq) data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> (p-values=0.0347 and 0.0019, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). As snoRNA genes regulate the splicing of downstream targets, allele shifts would change potential binding and may alter the splicing patterns of snoRNA targets. To test this hypothesis, we used a known splicing target list<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> of the snoRNAs to investigate whether these genes show splicing changes based on RNA-seq data from postmortem ASD brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The accuracy of these splicing target predictions has been confirmed in previously published studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> providing experimentally validated snoRNA targets including some studies in neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. From receiver operating characteristic analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, the splicing target prediction showed a 90–100% true positive rate within a 0.02–0.3% false positive rate range. Indeed, we find that the snoRNA target genes show more splicing changes in ASD and dup15q compared with controls (Fisher’s exact tests: OR=1.40 and 1.72, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). The snoRNA targeting sites were located significantly proximal to alternatively spliced junctions of their target genes in ASD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>), and their splicing changes show significant correlations with the expression changes of their specific snoRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">8c</xref>). When one snoRNA has two different targets, their splicing changes also show strong correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">Furthermore, among snoRNA targets, genes showing altered splicing changes in ASD and dup15q are significantly enriched for known ASD risk genes (SFARI) and genes encoding PSD proteins compared with the other target genes without splicing changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>; Methods). These results are consistent with the bioinformatic predictions above and potentially implicate disruption of snoRNA-mediated splicing of synaptic ASD risk genes in the pathophysiology of ASD. Moreover, the shared patterns of MAE allele shifting in ASD and dup15q provide a potential convergent biological mechanism linking idiopathic ASD and dup15q syndrome. Like ASE genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), the splicing changing snoRNA targets in ASD and dup15q showed significant enrichment with two different datasets of <italic>de novo</italic> ASD risk variants (in ASD, OR=2.30 (p-value=0.04) for the first and OR=7.42 (p-value=0.005) for the second; in dup15q, OR=2.14 (p-value=0.05) for the first and OR=5.97 (p-value=0.02) for the second; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P27">This study provides the first large-scale, genome-wide investigation of ASE patterns in human brain samples from subjects with ASD and dup15q. We identify different patterns of ASE in ASD than in controls including overall fewer sites showing ASE in ASD. However, when ASE does occur, ASD subjects show a preferential minor allele predominance, rather than the usual pattern of major allele predominance particularly in instances of pure monoallelic expression. Genes exhibiting ASE were also enriched in genes that harbor <italic>de novo</italic> ASD risk variation, consistent with the expectation that such genes could be highly dosage sensitive. It follows from this that ASE could increase ASD risk from the <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in highly dosage sensitive genes. Moreover, since snoRNA target genes showing splicing changes are enriched in genes showing ASE and <italic>de novo</italic> ASD risk variation, snoRNA mediated splicing changes could enhance ASD risk in dosage sensitive genes that harbor <italic>de novo</italic> risk variants. In ASD, loci showing minor allele MAE were enriched for known ASD-risk genes and the post-synaptic density genes. Furthermore, we identified two orphan C/D box snoRNA rich regions at 14q32 and 15q11 strongly enriched for ASD-related MAE change. These loci were also enriched for minor allele MAE in dup15q demonstrating convergence between known genetic risk factors and DNA methylation changes in brain. The allele shift towards minor allele MAE in ASD highlights the importance of understudied mode of gene regulation in ASD pathogenesis, and the snoRNA-mediated splicing changes point to novel potential biological disease mechanisms in brain.</p>
<p id="P28">Our results were enabled by an optimized pipeline that we developed to perform a large-scale genome-wide ASE investigation in ASD overcoming multiple potential challenges. To maximize transcriptome-wide SNP collection, we combined results from multiple methods including SNP array, imputation, and RNA-seq based genotyping. This is especially important for identifying SNPs with MAE, which often are missed by RNA-seq based genotyping. We generated a masked reference genome to filter out all potential reference biased SNPs during mapping to increase the accuracy of ASE measurement and to reduce false positive results. We further filtered SNPs showing association with ethnicity to identify generalizable ASE patterns across populations. We used the largest number of human postmortem brain samples from subjects with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> including multiple brain regions per individual to bolster reproducibility of results. Finally, we employed a novel linear mixed-model approach that accounts for sample-level variation in order to quantify ASE patterns across ASD and control groups. This optimized work-flow can guide future large-scale genome-wide ASE studies in disease.</p>
<p id="P29">Preferential major allele expression is the most common pattern observed in most cases of MAE presumably because it can provide a buffer against unexpected, potentially deleterious rare SNP risks that might increase risk for disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Consistent with this interpretation, rare SNPs show more preferential major allele expression than common SNPs. Common SNPs, in general, show more balanced expression patterns as expected for non-deleterious alleles that have been through the filter of natural selection. Since rare alleles are more likely to be deleterious than common alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, the decrease in preferential major allele expression in ASD and dup15q, which could protect against the effect of deleterious rare alleles, could contribute to the risk of developing ASD. This is supported by the overlap of genes showing this pattern in ASD postmortem brain with genes harboring known ASD risk alleles.</p>
<p id="P30">We found a notable convergence between idiopathic ASD and dup15q, both of which show enrichment of allele shift from major allele MAE to minor allele MAE at specific loci on chromosomes 14 and 15. 15q11-q13 duplication causes hypermethylation at 15q11-q13<sup>19</sup> as well as a genome-wide increase of minor allele MAE. Both idiopathic ASD and dup15q have increased minor allele MAE compared to control and the same trends of regional and snoRNA expression changes at the two regions showing a high frequency of shifts from the major to minor alleles. Idiopathic ASD shows extensive allele shifting at the 15q11 locus, which suggests that strong allele-specific methylation may be regulating gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> in a similar fashion as the 15q11-q13 duplication itself. Because idiopathic ASD and dup15q share similar expression patterns within both of the allele shift rich regions, the splicing changes targeted by snoRNA may be strongly related to disease pathogenesis.</p>
<p id="P31">An allele shift rich region was identified at 14q32 which also contains two dense clusters of over 50 miRNAs within the delta-like 1 homolog-type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase (DLK1-DIO3) domain locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. These clusters are maternally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) and share an upstream imprinting control region with the other genes at the allele shift rich region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Several of these miRNAs have been shown to be down-regulated in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, and their targets are enriched in axon guidance pathways. This could represent a point of convergence between ASD and schizophrenia, which are known to have significant phenotypic and genetic overlap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P32">These analyses highlight preferential minor allele expression and orphan C/D box snoRNA mediated splicing changes as two novel forms of genetic regulation altered in ASD. Our novel ASE identification approach incorporates both allele frequencies and quantitative measures of allelic imbalance. We identified strong enrichment of minor allele containing transcripts in ASD, which were further enriched for known ASD risk genes, including PSD components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, RBFOX1 targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, HuR targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and FMRP targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, we recognize that the studies of PSD components, and FMRP and RBFOX1 targets rely on postnatal data. Prenatal studies could identify other pathways, including chromatin modifiers. However, we note that even using these postnatal data, we did identify overlap with <italic>de novo</italic> mutation containing ASD risk genes, which include chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, we identify evidence supporting orphan C/D box snoRNA mediated splicing changes in ASD brain providing the first evidence of an association between snoRNA and ASD.</p>
<p id="P33">Among all forms of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), miRNA have received the most focus as a target for ASD and other psychiatric diseases studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Although the orphan C/D box snoRNA is a small family of snoRNAs existing only at chromosomes 14q32 and 15q11, this family controls the splicing of a unique set of about 400 target genes that are distributed across genome. Although we could not find enrichment for common ASD risk in these targets, it may be due to simple lack of power of current GWAS studies in ASD. The most recent ASD GWAS contained over 45,000 subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and yet identified an order of magnitude lower significant loci than a similar size study of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, consistent with substantially less power in ASD. Once larger more conclusive GWAS results are available, future studies can identify whether this group of genes is enriched in common variation that could contribute to polygenic risk for ASD. The allele shift rich regions in both idiopathic ASD and dup15q are directly overlapping with these orphan C/D box snoRNA repeat loci. Remarkably, we identified splicing changes in the downstream targets of these snoRNA genes providing a potential mechanistic link between genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic changes in ASD. These results highlight novel genetic and epigenetic regulations in ASD identifying novel biological mechanisms warranting further investigation.</p>

A total of 263 brain samples were collected from BA9, BA41, and vermis of 40 controls and 56 ASD cases including 8 cases with dup15q syndrome.

<title>Preparing masked reference and RNA-seq data mapping.</title>
<p id="P35">To avoid reference bias, we first prepared a masked reference genome after collecting all possible SNPs. We compiled the set of SNPs (39,683,000 SNPs) from multiple sources including those present on SNP arrays (Omni2.5 SNP: 2,372,783 SNPs; Affymetrix: 905,721 SNPs), those present in 1000 Genomes (38,270,182 SNPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and those identified in the brain samples from RNA-seq based SNP calling (3,163,431 SNPs).</p>
<p id="P36">RNA-seq based SNP calling was performed using: GATK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> and Samtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. To increase their SNP calling accuracy, we optimized bam files following the recommended GATK pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). After updating mapping quality scores, we added group headers and read groups. Once reordering chromosomes and marking duplicate reads, we recalibrated quality scores. Possible false positive SNP calling data was filtered out based on the common outputs of GATK and Samtools. We removed indels and retain only single base variants (e.g., SNPs). When multiple SNPs were present at the same genomic coordinate, we randomly kept only one for downstream analysis. Using these collected SNPs, we masked the hg19 reference sequence with randomly selected third alleles to minimize systematic mapping bias. We mapped all RNA-seq data to this masked reference genome using TopHat2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> with Ensembl v73 annotations and the following parameters:

In this study, we excluded dup15q samples from the other ASD case since they had clear structural chromosome alteration that causes ASD. We called the other ASD cases as idiopathic ASD for which the causes are unknown. Control brain samples were from someone who were not diagnosed as ASD and whose structural chromosome alternations were unknown.</p>
<p id="P43">First, we collected SNPs if “good” SNPs were present in 80% of samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

The SNP area length is calculated as (read length X 2) - 1, and mapped reads can reach a SNP within the SNP area.</p>
<p id="P45">For each group, ASE was quantified at SNP level using a linear mixed model (log<sub>2</sub>(RPSM) ~ allele + age + sex + sequencing batch + RNA integrity number (RIN) + brain bank + ancestry, rand = ~1|biolrep/subject). Fixed effects included allele, age, sex, sequencing batch, RIN, brain bank, and ancestry. Biological replicate (biolrep) and subject were included as random effects. Biological replicate is RNA-seq data replicates. To ensure if groups were balanced with respect to these covariates, we removed samples based on age (≦7), brain banks (The UK Brain Bank for Autism and Related Developmental Research and the MRC London Neurodegenerative Diseases Brain Banks), and SNP annotation (mysterious) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. We removed the other possible covariates (PMI, brain mass, and GC contents) that did not affect this ASE study. GC content was tested using AT and GC dropout values from Picard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The AT and GC dropout values are the percentage of misaligned reads at low GC (GC&lt;50%) or high GC (GC&gt;50%) conditions, respectively. In BA9 samples, the distributions of the covariate values were balanced between control and ASD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). When we identified ASEs from additional linear mixed model including the covariates, the covariates did not show significant p-values without affecting the ASE results.</p>
<p id="P46">We investigated both autosome and chromosome X. For no PARs on chromosome X, we considered only female data. PARs were defined as: PAR1(chrX:60,001–2,699,520, chrY:10,001–2,649,520), PAR2 (chrX:154,931,044–155,260,560, chrY:59,034,050–59,363,566), and PAR3 (chrX:88,400,000–92,000,000, chrY:3,440,000–5,750,000)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P47">Based on the p-values of the ancestry covariate from the linear mixed model regression, we filtered out SNPs showing ethnicity biased allele expression. After LD based SNP pruning using PLINK (R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> cutoff=0.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, we counted the number of LD-independent SNPs and identified ASE SNPs by Bonferroni correction.</p>
<p id="P48">To filter out potential indel-inducing reference bias from the identified ASEs, we considered 1,450,137 imputed indels identified during the above genotyping step. Among them, we selected only accurate 1,040,318 indel outputs from Mach/Minimac (deletions (≦3 bp) and inserts (1 bp)). We further filtered them out by the imputation quality (R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>&lt;0.5 and score value&gt;score digit ± 0.2), HWE (p-value&lt;1.0X10<sup>−6</sup>), missing genotype ratio (&lt;0.05), and MAF (&lt;0.01) to yield high quality imputed indels. To test indel-inducing reference bias, we selected 457,817 indels that show heterozygous types at least one sample.</p>
<p id="P49">Based on the masked reference genome, we generated a simulated RNA-seq dataset (50mer fastq file), which overlaps each indel area. It contains both indel containing and not containing sequences. We aligned the fastq file to the masked reference genome using TopHat2 and identified possible indel-inducing reference biases (chi-square test p-value≦0.05) from their proximal SNPs (read depth≧10). Once SNPs show the reference biases from at least one sample that has heterozygote genotypes from both indels and SNPs, we filtered them out from the ASE results. To genotype SNPs, we integrated SNP array, imputation, and RNA-seq based genotyping as described above.</p>
<p id="P50">To compare ASE across groups, Manhattan plots were generated with the p-values of the allele covariate from the linear mixed model regression using the qqman R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qqman/">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qqman/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). If ASE SNPs were located in gene bodies, we called the genes as ASE genes. The ASE genes were compared using area-proportional Venn diagrams<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>

<title>Individual based ASE identification.</title>
<p id="P51">We next studied ASE within individual samples comparing differences in allele counts for heterozygous SNPs. We used only “good” SNPs in at least 80% of samples (as defined above) without considering the present filter. P-values for each SNP were calculated using Fisher’s exact test. After LD-based SNP pruning, ASE SNPs were identified by Bonferroni correction (as described above). We filtered out indel-inducing reference biased SNPs as described above.</p>
<p id="P52">For each cortical sample, ASE rates were calculated per chromosome as the number of ASE SNPs / total number of tested SNPs. Differences in the ASE rate was tested using Wilcoxon rank sum test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>

<title>Evaluation of identified ASE.</title>
<p id="P53">To test ASE identification accuracy, we identified haplotype blocks using PLINK with the SNPs showing no ethnicity biased allele expression. We calculated deviations of log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) values (the beta values of allele covariate from the group based ASE identifications) per haplotype block in cortex and compared their distributions with normal distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">1g</xref>). For further validation, we compared ASE genes identified in our study with those present in dbMAE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mae.hms.harvard.edu/">https://mae.hms.harvard.edu/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> using Fisher’s exact test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Of note, dbMAE mostly includes non-neural tissues, and we considered its human and mouse data. Nevertheless, we observe strong overlap between them providing validation of our ASE genes. For additional external validation, we generated data as following GTEx data analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Like the method of GTEx data, we considered only heterozygote SNPs and followed the same p-value cutoff of GTEx data. We considered the ASE SNPs once their p-values are below 0.005 at the previous individual based ASE identification. Like GTEx data, we calculated ASE rates per tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). To compare the GTEx data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> with our data, we compared the mean of ASE rates from the tissues.</p>

<title>ASE and expression comparison.</title>
<p id="P54">We calculated less expressed allele expression fraction per each heterozygote SNP from a sample, UMB5303 (tissue: BA41). The fraction is a2 / (a1 + a2). a1 is more expressed allele read count, and a2 is less expressed allele read count. If the SNP has more than 10 mapped reads, we calculated log<sub>2</sub>(RPSM). Based on the less expressed allele expression fraction, we grouped the SNPs as imbalance and other groups. The fractions of the imbalance group were equal or less than 30%. The fractions of the other group were greater than 30%.

<p id="P77">A schematic of the pipeline for analysis of ASE. RNA-seq data were generated from 263 brain samples across three brain regions from subjects with 56 ASDs and 40 controls. After preparing a masked reference file, RNA-seq data were mapped, and reference biased SNPs were removed (Methods). Genotyping data from SNP array, imputation, and RNA-seq based genotyping were used for ancestry identification and heterozygous SNP identification for ASE investigation. Group based ASE was investigated across case and control groups using a linear mixed model within each brain region separately. Individual based ASE analysis was performed within each individual sample using Fisher’s exact test. The results underwent LD pruning followed by multiple test correction (Bonferroni). As post hoc analysis, we filtered out reference biased SNPs generated by proximal indels.</p>

The GWAS datasets were considered for ADHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, BPD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, MDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, SCZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Here, among ASD GWAS datasets, ASD1 and ASD2 represent the Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and Grove et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, respectively. If significant, the plots show FDR corrected p-values for GWAS (Methods). Dup is dup15q patients. For (a), (b), (d), and (e), RNA-seq sample numbers of control, ASD, and dup15q are 69, 62, and 15, respectively.</p>
