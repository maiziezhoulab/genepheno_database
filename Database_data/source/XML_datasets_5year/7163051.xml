<p>The blood-tumor barrier limits the delivery of therapeutic drugs to brain tumor tissues. Selectively opening the blood-tumor barrier is considered crucial for effective chemotherapy of glioma. RNA-binding proteins have emerged as crucial regulators in various biologic processes. This study found that RNA-binding Fox-1 homolog 1 (RBFOX1) was downregulated in glioma vascular endothelial cells derived from glioma tissues, and in glioma endothelial cells obtained by co-culturing endothelial cells with glioma cells. Overexpression of RBFOX1 impaired the integrity of the blood-tumor barrier and increased its permeability. Additionally, RBFOX1 overexpression decreased the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5. Subsequent analysis of the mechanism indicated that the overexpression of RBFOX1 increased musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma protein basic leucine zipper [bZIP] transcription factor F (MAFF) expression by downregulating LINC00673, which stabilized MAFF messenger RNA (mRNA) through Staufen1-mediated mRNA decay. Moreover, MAFF could bind to the promoter region and inhibit the promoter activities of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5, which reduced its expression. The combination of RBFOX1 upregulation and LINC00673 downregulation promoted doxorubicin delivery across the blood-tumor barrier, resulting in apoptosis of glioma cells. In conclusion, this study indicated that overexpression of RBFOX1 increased blood-tumor barrier permeability through the LINC00673/MAFF pathway, which might provide a new useful target for future enhancement of blood-tumor barrier permeability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0010">Glioma is a primary intracranial tumor with rapid progression and invasiveness. Despite continuous improvement of treatments, the median survival time of patients with high-grade gliomas is still less than 15 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Chemotherapy is an essential part of glioma therapy. The presence of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) severely limits the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to tumor tissues and affects the efficacy of chemotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"><sup>2</sup></xref> Specialized brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) in glioma tissues are the structural basis for BTB permeability. Therefore, selectively opening of the BTB is considered one of the effective means to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy for glioma.</p>
<p id="p0015">Although there is a large repertoire of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) present in tumor cells, little is known about the functional role of RBPs in endothelial cell biology. The RBP Quaking (QKI) has been shown to regulate the development of embryonic blood vessels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3"><sup>3</sup></xref> Additionally, RBP HuR has been shown to inhibit Sirtuin 1 mRNA stabilization to repress the endothelial inflammatory response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"><sup>4</sup></xref> RNA-binding Fox (RBFOX) protein is involved in many RNA metabolism processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"><sup>5</sup></xref> RBFOX1, also known as A2BP1 or FOX1, with a high affinity with the (U) GCAUG domain, plays a crucial role in regulating RNA metabolism during mammalian development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"><sup>6</sup></xref> In addition, RBFOX1 regulates mRNA stability, translation, and microRNA (miRNA) processing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"><sup>5</sup></xref> RBFOX1 has been shown to profoundly inhibit glioma tumorigenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"><sup>7</sup></xref> However, the expression level of RBFOX1 in glioma endothelial cells (GECs) and its potential role in the regulation of BTB permeability remain unclear.</p>
<p id="p0020">Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are ncRNAs with transcripts of more than 200 nt. Studies have reported that lncRNA can regulate the biological processes of cells at the level of epigenetics, transcription and post-transcription.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"><sup>8</sup></xref> Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA673 (LINC00673), located in human chromosome 17q25.1, is upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><sup>9</sup></xref> Moreover, LINC00673 is highly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and enhances the risk of disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><sup>10</sup></xref> Also, recent data indicate that LINC00673 is upregulated in gastric cancer and acts as an oncogenic function in the progression of gastric cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><sup>11</sup></xref> However, little is known about its expression in GECs. Bioinformatics software (RBPDB) predicts that LINC00673 harbors a binding site of RBFOX1. Accordingly, the potential interaction of the two above factors and their roles in the regulation of BTB permeability have attracted our interest.</p>
<p id="p0025">Small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma protein (sMaf) is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that plays a crucial role in gene regulation, differentiation, tumorigenesis, and in the development of many organisms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"><sup>12</sup></xref> Musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma proteins (MAFs) are divided into large MAFs (MAF, MAFA, MAFB, NRL) containing activation domains, and small MAFs (MAFF, MAFG, MAFK) lacking active activation domains.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"><sup>13</sup></xref> Small MAFs exert transcriptional activation through forming heterodimers by binding to other factors of the bZIP family; inversely, by forming homodimers themselves, they play a transcriptional inhibitory role to further affect gene expression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"><sup>14</sup></xref> Recent studies have shown that MAFF transcripts are highly expressed in the myometrium and are involved in the regulation of uterine genes at the beginning of labor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15"><sup>15</sup></xref> Moreover, MAFF is downregulated in type I diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"><sup>16</sup></xref> However, the expression and function of MAFF in GECs remain unclear. Analyses using bioinformatics software (RepeatMasker and IntaRNA) suggest that both LINC00673 and MAFF 3′ UTRs contain the Alu elements. Also, the binding site between LINC00673 and MAFF detected by bioinformatics information provides further impetus to study the mechanism of the interaction between LINC00673 and MAFF.</p>
<p id="p0030">Tight junction-related proteins (TJPs) are essential molecular basis for BTB function, including the primary component proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"><sup>17</sup></xref> The adhesion protein ZO-1 forms the basis of support structure for TJPs; the transmembrane protein occludin directly participates in the formation of TJPs on microvascular endothelial cells; and claudin-5 is abundant in brain endothelial cells and exerts an important role in regulating their permeability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18"><sup>18</sup></xref> ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 are crucial proteins that explicitly define the paracellular pathways affecting BTB permeability, while their expressions are downregulated when BTB permeability increases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19"><sup>19</sup></xref>
<italic>In silico</italic> analysis using JASPAR reveals that there are binding sites between MAFF and the respective promoters of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5, which indicates that MAFF may regulate the expression of these three genes at the transcriptional level.</p>
<p id="p0035">In this study, we first investigated the expression of RBFOX1, LINC00673, and MAFF in GECs and their effects on BTB permeability. Furthermore, we determined their interaction in the regulation of BTB permeability. Therefore, this study aims to explore the mechanism on selectively opening the BTB as well as to provide new theoretical and experimental evidence for improving the efficacy of treatment against glioma.</p>

<sec id="sec2.1">
<title>Expression of RBFOX1 in Glioma Vascular Endothelial Cells</title>
<p id="p0040">According to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis, RBFOX1 had low expression levels in glioma tissue, and the patients who had relatively lower levels of RBFOX1 had poor overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A). Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) is capable of isolating cells of interest from archived paraffin-embedded tissue specimens, and it permits microscopic localization of cells at the site of a pathological process. Thus, LCM could permit cells to be isolated from that site and sites not involved in the pathological process for further comparative studies. To study the BTB at the molecular level, RBFOX1 mRNA expression was detected at first in brain microvessels captured from a panel of surgical human brain specimens of brain tissues (normal brain tissues [NBTs]), low-grade glioma (LGG, World Health Organization [WHO] grade I–II), and high-grade glioma (HGG, WHO grade III–IV) by using LCM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B, we captured microvessels from NBT, LGG, and HGG using LCM. Subsequently, after isolating the RNAs from cells, we conformed qRT-PCR assay to detected RBFOX1 mRNA expression. The results showed that the RBFOX1 mRNA expression was downregulated in the captured brain microvessels from LGG and HGG compared with NBT. Additionally, RBFOX1 expression was significantly downregulated in the captured brain microvessels from HGG compared with those from LGG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>C). Thus, RBFOX1 was also represented in glioma microvessels, and the expression of RBFOX1 was negatively correlated with the pathological grades of glioma. Furthermore, after <italic>in vitro</italic> BTB models were established, western blot and qRT-PCR analyses showed that the expression of RBFOX1 in GECs was significantly downregulated compared to astrocyte-exposed endothelial cells (AECs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E). Thus, we hypothesize that RBFOX1 might regulate the function of GECs as tumor suppressor genes.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Upregulation of RBFOX1 Increased BTB Permeability in GECs and Inhibited the Expression Levels of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-5</p><p>(A) The expression levels of RBFOX1 in glioma and patient survival were analyzed through TCGA database.

<title>Overexpression of RBFOX1 Increased the Permeability of the BTB and Decreased the Expression of the Tight Junction-Related Protein in GECs</title>
<p id="p0045">To explore the functional role of endothelial RBFOX1 in BTB permeability, we established GEC lines with stable overexpression or silencing of RBFOX1 successfully. Subsequently, the transendothelial electric resistance (TEER) value and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) flux were used to test the integrity and permeability of the BTB, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"><sup>20</sup></xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>F and 1G show that the TEER value was significantly decreased whereas HRP flux was significantly increased in the RBFOX1 overexpression (OE) group compared with vector group. However, the opposite results were observed in the short hairpin (sh)RBFOX1 group. Those results indicated that overexpression of RBFOX1 in GECs impaired BTB integrity and increased BTB permeability. ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 are members of tight junction-related proteins. Then, we focused on these three proteins to explore the mechanism of action of RBFOX1 on BTB permeability. The western blot analysis showed that the expression of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 was significantly decreased in the RBFOX1 OE group compared with vector group in GECs. However, the expression of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 increased in the shRBFOX1 group compared with the shNC group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>H) in GECs. Subsequently, immunofluorescence staining further confirmed that RBFOX1 overexpression suppressed ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 expression, with discontinuous distribution on the boundaries of GECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>I). The above results indicate that RBFOX1 overexpression increased BTB permeability.</p>

<title>LINC00673 Was Upregulated in GECs, and LINC00673 Knockdown Increased the Permeability of BTB and Reduced the Expression of the Tight Junction-Related Protein in GECs</title>
<p id="p0050">Accumulating studies have demonstrated that RBPs may exert their biological functions through mediating lncRNAs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22"><sup>22</sup></xref> lncRNA array analysis was performed in GECs with overexpression of RBFOX1. The results showed that LINC00673 and TNRC6C-AS1 were two of the most downregulated lncRNAs in the RBFOX1 OE group. Meanwhile, qRT-PCR analysis showed that expression of LINC00673 and TNRC6C-AS1 was downregulated, and the LINC00673 expression level was lower than that of TNRC6C-AS1 in GECs with upregulation of RBFOX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>A). Accordingly, we selected LINC00673 to perform the subsequent analyses. In addition, the expression and location of LINC00673 in AECs and GECs were investigated by qRT-PCR and fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH). LINC00673 was significantly upregulated in GECs compared with AECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>C). In addition, the quantitative expression of TNRC6C-AS1 is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>D. Also, LINC00673 was located primarily in the cytoplasm of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>B).

<p id="p0055">The significant upregulation of LINC00673 in GECs prompted us to explore the essential function of LINC00673 in GECs by investigating the effects of LINC00673 knockdown or overexpression on BTB integrity and permeability.

The efficiency of LINC00673 is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>B.

Additionally, the TEER value was decreased whereas HRP flux was increased in the shLINC00673 group, compared with the short hairpin negative control (shNC) group. These results suggest that LINC00673 knockdown could impair BTB integrity and increase BTB permeability. To further explore the mechanisms in regulating BTB permeability, the expression levels of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 were detected by western blot. The results indicated that the expression levels of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 were significantly increased in the LINC00673 OE group, whereas they were significantly decreased in shLINC00673 group, compared with the vector and shNC groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>F).

<title>MAFF Bound to the Tight Junction-Related Proteins ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-5 and Inhibited Promoter Activities</title>
<p id="p0085">Having confirmed that MAFF overexpression reduced the expression of the tight junction-related proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 at the mRNA and protein levels, we hypothesized that MAFF may directly regulate the expression of tight junction proteins at the transcriptional level. In the present study, the sequences of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 promoters were selected using the bioinformatics database DBTSS. At the same time, the positions of the transcription start site (TSSs) of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 were predicted by DBTSS. Moreover, we identified the sites to which MAFF bound by analyzing the DNA sequence 2,000 bp upstream of the TSS and its 200-bp downstream sequence. Then, dual-luciferase reporter gene analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were used to verify the activity and binding effects of MAFF combined with the ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 promoter-binding sites, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>A and 6C, the activities of the ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 promoters were significantly reduced in the pEX3 MAFF group, compared with those in the pEX3 empty vector group. Also, a series of DNA fragments was constructed and ligated into the pGL3 basic vector. Wild-type and deletion constructs and putative MAFF binding sites were indicated. Upon co-transfection with pEX3-MAFF, ZO-1 promoter activity was downregulated by the −683 site region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>A), occludin promoter activity was downregulated by the +100 site region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>B), and claudin-5 promoter activity was downregulated by the −462 site region, but there was no significant change by the −789 site region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>C).

A number of studies indicate that lncRNAs are demonstrated to be necessary to regulate BTB permeability and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) angiogenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41"><sup>41</sup></xref> Meanwhile, several studies have reported that lncRNA LINC00673 is involved in the progression of tumors and considered as a potential novel biomarker for early diagnosis of lung cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42"><sup>42</sup></xref> In this regard, it is urgent to ascertain the underlying mechanism of LINC00673 dysregulation in tumors. It has been reported that LINC00673 is triggered by the transcription factor SP1 and directly targets LSD1 and EZH2, and that it acts as a scaffold to inhibit the expression of KLF2 and LATS2, thereby promoting the growth and invasion of gastric cancer cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><sup>11</sup></xref> In the present study, we screened out several lncRNAs after downregulation of RBFOX1 in GECs, and finally we verified the LINC00673. Subsequently, the expression and location of LINC00673 in GECs, as well as the detailed function of LINC00673, were further detected. Our results indicated that knockdown of LINC00673 reduced ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 expression, destroyed the integrity of the BTB, and increased the permeability of the BTB. Meanwhile, restoration of RBFOX1 dramatically reduced the LINC00673 expression and increased BTB permeability. Accordingly, whether there is a supervisory relationship between RBFOX1 and LINC00673 has attracted our attention. Recent studies have demonstrated that RBPs affect biological function via regulating RNA in a variety of ways. RBP NFAT5 positively regulates the expression of lncRNA SBF2-AS1 and promotes GBM angiogenesis through the miR-338-3p/EGFL7 pathway.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43"><sup>43</sup></xref> HuR promotes tongue cancer by increasing the stability of lnc-Sox5.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44"><sup>44</sup></xref> Also, HuR enhances the stability of lncRNA NEAT1, inhibits the expression of miR-124-3p, and promotes ovarian cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45"><sup>45</sup></xref> In this study, our results indicated that the RBP RBFOX1 plays a functional role in regulating the permeability of the BTB by decreasing the stability of LINC00673. Furthermore, accumulating evidence shows that RBFOX1 acts in the regulation of the stability of target genes. RBFOX1 downregulation results in a decrease of mRNA stability by encoding the synaptic transmission protein MARK2 and induces the occurrence of Alzheimer’s disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46"><sup>46</sup></xref></p>
<p id="p0110">MAFF is deregulated in various cells and plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes, such as emergency signals, hematopoiesis, central nervous system function, and tumorigenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47"><sup>47</sup></xref> Additionally, MAFF expression is decreased in endothelial progenitor cells derived from the circulating bone marrow of patients with type I diabetes, which inhibits cardiovascular production and tissue regeneration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"><sup>16</sup></xref> Our data demonstrated that MAFF was downregulated in GECs and located in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Overexpression of MAFF reduced the expression of tight junction-related proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 and increased the permeability of the BTB.</p>
<p id="p0115">It was predicted that the transcription factor MAFF mRNA 3′ UTR processed a binding site for LINC00673 by using the bioinformatics software IntaRNA, and we further verified the fact of binding between LINC00673 and MAFF-3′ UTR. Moreover, inhibition of LINC00673 markedly prolonged the half-life of MAFF mRNA. Furthermore, the silencing of LINC00673 increased the permeability of the BTB by elevating MAFF mRNA stability. There are numerous ways in which lncRNAs exert biological effects. Accumulated evidence has indicated that lncRNAs directly regulate the expression of downstream target genes at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels through the “sponging” of miRNAs or by altering the stability of RNAs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48"><sup>48</sup></xref> Additionally, a study has reported that lncRNAs could regulate the stability of target genes, for example, lncRNA AC132217.4, increasing the stability of IGF2 mRNA to accelerate the metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma by binding to IGF2 3′ UTR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49"><sup>49</sup></xref></p>
<p id="p0120">SMD is one of the means of regulation of mRNA degradation in mammalian cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26"><sup>26</sup></xref> In the SMD process, the double-stranded binding protein STAU1 targets the STAU1 binding site (SBS) formed by lncRNAs with target gene mRNAs via their Alu elements to recruit ATP-dependent helical UPF1, resulting in the degradation of the target mRNA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50"><sup>50</sup></xref> In this study, we found that LINC00673 overexpression destabilized MAFF mRNA, whereas STAU1 or UPF1 knockdown increased the stabilization of MAFF mRNA. Furthermore, STAU1 or UPF1 knockdown rescued MAFF mRNA and protein expression downregulated by LINC00673 overexpression. MAFF and LINC00673 were co-transfected, and MAFF knockdown significantly reversed the effect of promoting BTB permeability by LINC006673 alone knockdown. Thereby, LINC00673 knockdown increased the BTB permeability and decreased the expression of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 by reducing MAFF mRNA degradation in an SMD manner. In line with our results, recent studies also demonstrated that the SMD pathway plays an important role in the regulation of varieties of biological effects. For example, during the process of adipogenesis, the abundance of PNRC2 or STAU1 was increased and UPF1 was hyperphosphorylated, and hyperphosphorylated UPF1 forms a stable complex with PNRC2, resulting in KLF2 mRNA destabilization and promoting the process of adipogenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51"><sup>51</sup></xref></p>
<p id="p0125">Accumulating studies have demonstrated that transcription factors regulate the target genes through binding to their promoters. A recent study has suggested that the transcription factor Twist1, regulated by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) through SMD, binds to the SNCG promoter, which promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration and invasion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52"><sup>52</sup></xref> Furthermore, MAFF leads to perinatal lethality through targeting the US2 motif of the oxytocin receptor (OTR) promoter specifically, activating US2 transcriptional activity and promoting the OTR expression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53"><sup>53</sup></xref> In the tumor microenvironment, the transcription inhibitor MAFF binds to mutP53, inhibits SIL-1Ra promoter activity, and facilitates the progression of malignancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54"><sup>54</sup></xref> In the present study, we demonstrated that MAFF bound to the promoter of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 and inhibited their transcriptions.</p>
<p id="p0130">Owing to the partially intact BTB, the treatment of brain glioma remains a great challenge. The BTB limits most chemotherapeutics in their delivery to tumors. Different methods, including focused ultrasound (FUS), leukotriene C4, and bradykinin, have been used and have had promising outcomes. However, these methods have been either invasive, non-targeted, or required the function of new drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55"><sup>55</sup></xref> In the present study, RBFOX1 overexpression increased BTB permeability, and LINC00673 knockdown increased BTB permeability, and these results revealed the methods of opening the BTB from the molecular level. Recent research reported that diphtheria toxin (DT)<sup>270–326</sup> significantly increased the permeability of the BTB <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the combination of DT<sup>270–326</sup> with Dox significantly enhanced the loss of cell viability and the apoptosis of glioma cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56"><sup>56</sup></xref> In the present study, we demonstrated that RBFOX1 overexpression combined with LINC00673 knockdown promoted Dox delivery across the BTB. In conclusion, the present study for the first time reveals the significance of the interaction among RBP RBFOX1, lncRNA-LINC00673, and transcription factor MAFF in the regulation of BTB permeability, and the underlying mechanisms presented. The results of the study not only provide a new theoretical and experimental basis for functional regulation of BTB, but they also provide new ideas for the comprehensive treatment against glioma.</p>
