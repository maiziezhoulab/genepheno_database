<abstract>
<p>Severe burns may lead to intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress resulting in intestinal barrier damage and gut dysfunction. In the management of severe burns, therapies are needed to attenuate whole-body inflammatory responses and control the burden of oxidative stress. In this study, we evaluated the effects of oral glutamine (Gln) with probiotics on burn-induced intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress using a Wistar rat burn injury model. We then explored potential molecular mechanisms for the effects of glutamine and probiotics on intestinal tissue inflammation and oxidative stress. We found that glutamine and probiotics together significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) content; reduced levels of the inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8; and altered expression of oxidative stress factors including reactive oxygen species and superoxide dismutase. We found that the apoptotic proportion of intestinal epithelial cells in severely burned subjects was notably decreased following treatment with glutamine plus probiotics. We also found that glutamine and probiotics given together markedly reduced NO content by down-regulating the expression of iNOS in blood and intestinal tissue. These findings indicate that regulation of the iNOS gene plays a pivotal role in inflammation and oxidative stress in the response to severe burns in the Wistar rat. We then further investigated the mechanism by which combined therapy with glutamine and probiotics might reduce expression of iNOS and found that this treatment resulted in increased methylation of the iNOS gene. The methylation level of the iNOS gene was found to be regulated via differential expression of DNMT1 and Tet1. Collectively, our results suggest that combined therapy with glutamine and probiotics can markedly reduce the synthesis of NO, suppressing intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress in the Wistar rat burn injury model.</p>
