<title>Summary</title>
<p>Human autoantibodies to contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) are often associated with neuropathic pain, and CASPR2 mutations have been linked to autism spectrum disorders, in which sensory dysfunction is increasingly recognized. Human CASPR2 autoantibodies, when injected into mice, were peripherally restricted and resulted in mechanical pain-related hypersensitivity in the absence of neural injury. We therefore investigated the mechanism by which CASPR2 modulates nociceptive function. Mice lacking CASPR2 (<italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) demonstrated enhanced pain-related hypersensitivity to noxious mechanical stimuli, heat, and algogens. Both primary afferent excitability and subsequent nociceptive transmission within the dorsal horn were increased in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Either immune or genetic-mediated ablation of CASPR2 enhanced the excitability of DRG neurons in a cell-autonomous fashion through regulation of Kv1 channel expression at the soma membrane. This is the first example of passive transfer of an autoimmune peripheral neuropathic pain disorder and demonstrates that CASPR2 has a key role in regulating cell-intrinsic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron excitability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0030">Autoantibodies against contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2-Abs) have been linked to a number of clinical syndromes. These include neuromyotonia, in which there is clinical and electrophysiological evidence of excessive motor unit activity due to enhanced motor axon excitability; Morvan’s syndrome, in which neuromyotonia is associated with autonomic and CNS dysfunction (particularly insomnia); and limbic encephalitis, which is characterized by cognitive impairment and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Irani and Vincent, 2016</xref>). A common feature described in patients seropositive for CASPR2-Abs is the presence of neuropathic pain, and in some patients this was the sole presenting symptom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irani et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klein et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lancaster et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, immunosuppression to reduce levels of CASPR2-Ab can lead to a reduction in neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klein et al., 2012</xref>). Whether CASPR2 has a direct role in nociceptive signaling and the mechanisms by which such CASPR2-Abs could drive neuropathic pain are unknown.</p>
<p id="p0035">CASPR2 is a neuronal adhesion molecule of the neurexin superfamily that is known to form a protein complex with shaker-type voltage-gated potassium channels (such as Kv1.1 and Kv1.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horresh et al., 2008</xref>). CASPR2 is, therefore, one of a group of proteins that form the voltage-gated potassium channel complex (VGKCC) that also includes LGI1 and contactin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irani et al., 2010</xref>). Antibodies to the VGKCC are not directed against Kv1 channels themselves but to proteins with which they form a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irani et al., 2010</xref>). Of the components of this complex, it is particularly antibodies to CASPR2 that have been associated with neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irani et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klein et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0040">The extracellular domain of CASPR2 binds to Contactin-2 and is required for the correct longitudinal localization of Kv1 channels to the juxtaparanode (JXP) of myelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>). In mice lacking CASPR2 or Contactin-2, Kv1 channels were no longer clustered at the JXP. The functional implications of this mislocalization have hitherto been unclear because, in the naive state, Kv1 channels at the JXP are electrically isolated from the node of Ranvier and paranode by compact myelin, and axonal excitability was reported to be unaltered in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>). Following injury to myelin or the distal axon, however, Kv1 channels (and CASPR2) are redistributed to the paranode and can suppress axonal hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Calvo et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rasband et al., 1998</xref>). Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 also have important roles in modulating somatic excitability of DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gold et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). However, although CASPR2 is known to regulate longitudinal clustering of Kv1 channels along myelinated fibers, its function in trafficking Kv1 channels to the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) soma membrane and the effects on excitability are unknown.</p>
<p id="p0045">CASPR2 has also been identified as a synaptic protein with a role in synapse development/maintenance and has recently been linked to neurodevelopmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodenas-Cuadrado et al., 2014</xref>): humans with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>CNTNAP2</italic> (the gene encoding CASPR2) develop epilepsy and developmental delay with a number of core features of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Strauss et al., 2006</xref>). Mice lacking CASPR2 have been shown to develop autistic traits at a behavioral level, associated with deficits in the migration of cortical inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peñagarikano et al., 2011</xref>). Somatosensory abnormalities have recently been recognized as a common feature of ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cascio, 2010</xref>) and are now part of diagnostic criteria. Given the reported association of CASPR2-Abs with pain as well as the increasing recognition of somatosensory abnormalities as a core feature of ASDs, we undertook a detailed characterization of the role of CASPR2 in the regulation of sensory function.</p>

<title>Patient CASPR2-Abs Cause Pain-Related Hypersensitivity in Mice</title>
<p id="p0050">To investigate the potential pathogenicity of CASPR2-Abs, we injected mice with patient-derived purified IgG (obtained from two CASPR2-Ab-positive patients with neuropathic pain who had received plasma exchange treatment) and assessed pain-related behavior. Patient 1 had Morvan’s syndrome with typical features of neuromyotonia, dysautonomia, pain, and severe insomnia. He improved considerably with plasma exchange (that reduces circulating antibody levels by &gt;80%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liguori et al., 2001</xref>). Patient 2 presented with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathic pain that was particularly localized to the feet; there was, however, no clinical or electrophysiological evidence of neuromyotonia (patient 2 information shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Data S1</xref>). The antibodies in patient 1 were originally identified by radioimmunoprecipitation of VGKC complexes from rabbit brain tissue, but were then shown to be directed against CASPR2 using a live cell-based assay (CBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irani et al., 2010</xref>). Both patients 1 and 2 had very high titers of CASPR2 IgG in their sera, plasmas, and purified IgG preparations (1:62,500 or higher; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A). Antibodies to LGI1, the other main VGKC complex protein, were only just detectable (1:20) in patient 1 IgG and negative in patient 2 IgG.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Passive Transfer of Human CASPR2-Abs Causes Pain-Related Hypersensitivity in Mice</p><p>(A) CBA showing binding of antibodies from patient plasma using an anti-human IgG secondary antibody (red) to HEK cells transfected with human CASPR2-EGFP.

Mice did not, however, develop a clear thermal hypersensitivity using the Hargreaves testing method (D and F). For (C) and (D), n = 8, and for (E) and (F), n = 9.</p><p>Data shown as mean ± SEM, <sup>∗</sup>p &lt; 0.05, <sup>∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.01 versus control IgG group. See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="p0055">We gave mice systemic injections of purified patient IgG or IgG from a healthy control for either 14 or 22 days (dosing and behavioral testing regime is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B). At the end of the experiment, the CASPR2-IgG-treated mice had very high CASPR2 titers (maximal binding at 1:100, titrating out to 1:12,500 or higher). No LGI1 antibodies were detected in the mice. Over the course of the experiment, there was no significant weight loss compared to baseline or between groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S1</xref>A and S1D). Mice treated with purified IgG from patient 1 developed a significant delayed-onset mechanical hypersensitivity when compared to control IgG-treated mice, beginning after 11 days of injections (withdrawal threshold to von Frey hair of 0.58 ± 0.04 g control IgG versus 0.41 ± 0.09 g patient 1 IgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>C), with a greater effect seen after 14 days (0.6 ± 0.05 g control IgG versus 0.31 ± 0.05 g patient 1 IgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>C). Mice treated with purified IgG from patient 2 also developed a delayed-onset mechanical hypersensitivity, which was significantly different from the control IgG group 15 days after the initial injection (0.6 ± 0.1g control IgG versus 0.32 ± 0.07 g patient 2 IgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>E). Although a significant reduction in thermal withdrawal thresholds was seen for mice treated with patient 2 IgG at day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>F), in general thermal thresholds were similar to those of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>D and 1F). We found no difference between treatment groups in spontaneous locomotor activity or rearing behavior in the open field test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S1</xref>B and S1E, and S1C and S1F, respectively). We did not observe any spontaneous nocifensive behavior such as licking, biting, or paw-lifting.</p>

No immunoreactivity for human IgG was found in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>A), suggesting that patient IgG did not cross the blood-cord barrier. We did see some human IgG deposited in the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>A), but did not see any specific binding to the JXP. A previous study using patient CASPR2-Abs also did not see binding to axons in intact nerve, suggesting that Abs are unable to cross the tight junction at the paranode to access their target within the JXP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manso et al., 2016</xref>). This is in stark contrast to permeabilized frozen nerve sections, where clear binding in the JXP can be seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>B). At the level of the DRG, however, CASPR2 is more easily accessible on the neuronal soma and clear binding of human IgG can be seen on the surface of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>B); this suggests that the ability of CASPR2 to increase pain-related behavior in mice could be due to its action in the peripheral nervous system, particularly at the level of the DRG.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Patient CASPR2-Abs Bind <italic>In Vivo</italic> but Do Not Cause Gross Inflammation or Nerve Damage</p><p>(A and B) Representative image of a spinal cord (A) and DRG (B) section from a mouse treated with patient IgG.

<p id="p0065">CASPR2-Ab could cause neuropathic pain as a consequence of neuro-inflammation. To address this, we assessed cellular infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, using the markers Ly6G, IBA1, and CD3, respectively, in the DRG. There was no difference in any of these markers between control and patient IgG-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>D–2F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S2</xref>D–S2F). Additionally, there was no difference in IBA1-positive cells in the sciatic nerve between treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S2</xref>C). We also measured the expression of a number of cytokines and chemokines in the DRG and nerve using qPCR and saw no significant differences between animals treated with patient IgG versus control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0070">Similarly, we did not observe a significant inflammatory response within the spinal cord. There were no Ly6G-positive cells in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S3</xref>A and S3B). Counts for CD3-positive cells were low and no difference was found between treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S3</xref>C and S3D). We also saw no evidence of astrocytosis as measured using GFAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S3</xref>E and S3F). Although we observed a small but significant increase in the density of IBA1-positive microglia in the spinal cord in mice treated with patient 1 IgG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S3</xref>G), we did not see any differences for patient 2-treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S3</xref>H). Recent work has shown that exposure of mice <italic>in utero</italic> to CASPR2-Abs can cause microglia activation in specific brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coutinho et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we assessed microglia in the primary somatosensory cortex, but saw no difference in microglia in terms of both cell density and morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S3</xref>I–S3O). These data, coupled with lack of weight loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S1</xref>A and S1D), suggest that patient autoantibodies did not cause a gross inflammatory response.</p>
<p id="p0075">To investigate possible Ab-mediated neural injury, we measured intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) in the paw that did not differ between animals treated with IgG from either healthy control or CASPR2-Ab-positive patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>G and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S2</xref>G). This is in line with patient data describing normal IENFD density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Data S1</xref>). Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is upregulated by sensory neurons following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsujino et al., 2000</xref>). No difference was found in DRG neuronal ATF3 expression from control and patient 2 IgG-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>H); a small but significant increase in ATF3 immunoreactive DRG profiles was found in mice treated with IgG from patient 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>H) and may explain the small increase in microglial density observed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S3</xref>G. We also assessed the structure of peripheral nerve in more detail using electron microscopy (EM). We saw no evidence of autoantibody-mediated demyelination. G ratios were the same between the control and patient IgG-treated groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S4</xref>A–S4C and S4E), and there were no significant differences in axon diameter or the total number of axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S4</xref>D, S4F, and S4G; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S2</xref>). We also studied the organization of nodal sub-domains. No differences were seen in the total number of nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S4</xref>H and S4K), or in those nodes containing CASPR2 or Kv1.1 comparing between treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S4</xref>I, S4J, S4L, and S4M). However, when CASPR2 and Kv1.1 immunostaining was assessed there was a significant reduction in the immunopositive area in those animals treated with patient IgG when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>I, 2J, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S4</xref>N, and S4O). Therefore, it seems that the pain-related phenotype seen in mice treated with patient IgG was not due to any gross structural injury or inflammation of the peripheral or CNS. The patient autoantibodies did, however, reduce the levels of CASPR2 and Kv1.1 protein found clustered in the JXP of axons. This reduction was observed despite the fact that we did not detect direct binding of patient-IgG to the JXP <italic>in vivo</italic>; we did observe patient-IgG binding at the level of the neuronal cell body within the DRG that could deplete the total protein available. Given the lack of Ab-mediated injury, we hypothesized that CASPR2-Ab may regulate sensory function by reducing CASPR2 protein levels leading to increased excitability in peripheral sensory neurons.</p>

<title>CASPR2 Expression in DRG Neurons</title>
<p id="p0080">Because CASPR2-Abs were restricted to the periphery and clearly deposited in the DRG, we initially analyzed the expression of CASPR2 within sensory neuron sub-types. RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) showed that &gt;99% of mouse primary sensory neurons from lumbar DRG (defined as those cells that had a signal greater than the mean background signal plus 2 SDs) expressed CASPR2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S5</xref>A). It was clear, however, that sensory neurons expressed CASPR2 to varying degrees. Large diameter DRG cells expressed higher levels of CASPR2 than small diameter DRG cells, consistent with its known expression within myelinated nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S5</xref>B). A combination of ISH and immunohistochemistry analyses showed that the highest level of CASPR2 expression was in cells that express NF200 (a marker of myelinated afferents including Aβ and Aδ afferent mechanoreceptors) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S5</xref>C and S5D). Peptidergic and non-peptidergic small diameter afferents (principally C-fiber nociceptors) can be identified through expression of CGRP and binding of the lectin IB4, respectively. Both of these populations clearly expressed CASPR2, albeit at a lower level than the NF200 population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S5</xref>C and S5D). Very low levels of expression were seen in neurons immunopositive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of non-nociceptive C-fibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S5</xref>C and S5D).</p>

<title>CASPR2 Regulates Pain-Related Hypersensitivity in Mice</title>
<p id="p0085">We next investigated whether a loss of CASPR2 might alter pain-related behavior using mice that no longer express the full-length (FL) version of CASPR2 (<italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>). Although a short isoform lacking the majority of the extracellular domain is still expressed in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), we found that the loss of FL-CASPR2 resulted in pain-related hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were hypersensitive to von Frey hair application, demonstrating a significantly lower withdrawal threshold compared to wild-type (WT) littermates (<italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> 0.64 ± 0.06 g versus <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> 0.37 ± 0.04 g; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>A). <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were also hypersensitive to noxious pinprick application, which causes a rapid reflex withdrawal response mediated by Aδ fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arcourt et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>B). We also assessed the response to dynamic mechanical stimuli, but saw no differences between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>C). There was no difference in withdrawal latency to a radiant heat source (Hargreaves method) or the hot plate set at 50°C when comparing <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>D and 3E). However, when the hotplate was set at 53°C there was a significant difference between groups, with <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice having a shorter latency to response (<italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> 10.0 ± 0.5 s versus <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> 8.3 ± 0.4 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>F). This suggests that a loss of CASPR2 results in hypersensitivity to supra-threshold noxious heat. Sensitivity to cold temperatures, measured with a thermal preference paradigm, was unchanged between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>G). We also tested mechanical and thermal sensitivity in mice heterozygous for the loss of FL-CASPR2 (<italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/−</sup>).

<p id="p0090">Sensitivity to chemical algogens was also assessed. In <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, intraplantar injection of capsaicin produced a significantly augmented pain response versus WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>H and 3I).

<p id="p0095">Using immunohistochemical markers, we saw no differences in the populations of sensory neuron subtypes within the DRG or IENFD (where the majority of fibers are nociceptors) from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice compared to control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S6</xref>C–S6F). Given previous reports of a reduced number of cortical inhibitory interneurons in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peñagarikano et al., 2011</xref>), we looked at CASPR2 expression within the spinal cord and saw that many Pax2-positive neurons (a marker of inhibitory interneurons) expressed CASPR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S6</xref>G and S6H). We also confirmed its expression within inhibitory interneurons using glycine transporter 2-EGFP reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zeilhofer et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S6</xref>I).

<title>CASPR2 Regulates Sensory Neuronal Excitability and Membrane Kv1 Channel Expression</title>
<p id="p0100">We next used <italic>in vivo</italic> intracellular calcium imaging as a measure of primary sensory neuron activity to see whether CASPR2 impacted neuronal excitability at the level of the cell soma. <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and WT littermates were given intrathecal injections of an AAV9 delivery vector encoding the calcium indicator GCaMP6. DRG neuronal activity was indicated by a change in fluorescent signal from baseline levels that occurred following the application of sensory stimuli to the hindpaw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A). For our analysis, we separated neuronal responses by cell profile area and found that on average both small- (&lt;500 μm<sup>2</sup>) and medium (500–1,000 μm<sup>2</sup>)-sized DRG neurons from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited larger increases in intracellular calcium following sensory stimulation. Medium-sized DRG neurons were significantly hyper-responsive to mechanical stimulation, both brush and noxious pinch, applied to the hindpaw when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>B and 4C). Small-sized DRG neurons from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> were also more responsive to pinch application, as well as noxious heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>D). We also measured the activity of sensory neurons following capsaicin application and observed that a population of medium-sized neurons from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> was activated by capsaicin in contrast to zero cells from WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>E). Calculation of the median cell profile size of a capsaicin responder showed this had shifted from 234.8 μm<sup>2</sup> in controls to 438.8 μm<sup>2</sup> in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice with a statistically significant shift in the population distribution (p &lt; 0.0001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).

<p id="p0110">Kv1 channels contribute to I<sub>KD</sub>, a slowly inactivating voltage-dependent potassium current that activates at potentials more negative than the action potential threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Madrid et al., 2009</xref>), positioning these channels as important regulators of neuronal excitability. Due to their interaction with CASPR2, we hypothesized that effects on these channels may underlie the hyperexcitability phenotype observed in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons. We focused on potassium currents in medium diameter DRG neurons as the hyperexcitability was most apparent in these neurons. <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> neurons displayed a slowly inactivating outward current upon membrane potential depolarization that was highly sensitive to α-dendrotoxin (DTX, a selective Kv1 channel inhibitor) and therefore represents I<sub>KD</sub> carried partially by Kv1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Madrid et al., 2009</xref>). I<sub>KD</sub> was significantly reduced in medium diameter <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons compared control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>C). When tested at +40 mV, the DTX-sensitive component of this current was also reduced in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>C) (<italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> 143.8 ± 17.1 pA/pF versus <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> 78.6 ± 10.8 pA/pF, p &lt; 0.01, Student’s t test), suggestive of decreased Kv1 current. One possibility for the decrease in sensitivity to DTX is that CASPR2 is important not only for the longitudinal movement of these potassium channels along axons, but also their trafficking to the cell membrane, something it has been shown to do for other ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varea et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore assessed the expression of Kv1.2 in culture and found clear membrane staining of Kv1.2 in DRG neurons from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice that is lost following ablation of FL-CASPR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>D). Profile plots show the intensity of Kv1.2 immunoreactivity across the cell body and were used to define positive membrane expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>D). Quantification of these showed that 25.8% ± 3.9% of total DRG neurons from control mice were defined as having Kv1.2 membrane expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>E). In agreement with electrophysiological findings, Kv1.2 expression was significantly reduced to 11.3% ± 2.5% of DRG neurons in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>E). Note that the mRNA expression of <italic>Kcna2</italic> (and <italic>Kcna1</italic>) in DRG did not differ between <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0115">We also investigated whether CASPR2 overexpression could reverse hyperexcitability in medium DRG neurons. We observed that in comparison to acutely cultured WT DRG neurons (1 day <italic>in vitro</italic> [DIV]), WT neurons cultured for 5 DIV lost their Kv1.2 membrane expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S7</xref>A) and became hyperexcitable, with a significant reduction in their rheobase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>G); interestingly, we also noted reduced mRNA expression of <italic>Cntnap2</italic> over the same time course (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S7</xref>B). We therefore set out to rescue this phenotype by overexpressing CASPR2. In addition to FL-CASPR2, we studied the effects of the shorter isoform (SH-CASPR2) that lacks most of the extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>F). qPCR showed that SH-CASPR2 is still expressed in DRG from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, but expression in WT DRG is 10-fold lower than that of the main FL-CASPR2 isoform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S7</xref>C and S7D). DRG cells were electroporated with plasmids containing either FL-CASPR2 or SH-CASPR2, both tagged with EGFP in the cytoplasmic domain, or an EGFP plasmid control. Overexpression of FL-CASPR2-EGFP resulted in membranous EGFP staining in a subset of DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S7</xref>E). At 5 DIV, SH-CASPR2-EGFP overexpression had no effect on the rheobase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>G). By contrast, FL-CASPR2-EGFP overexpressing cells had a significantly higher rheobase than EGFP-expressing cells at the same time point (EGFP 255.8 ± 32.5 pA versus FL-CASPR2-EGFP 605.4 ± 88.9 pA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>G), and this effect was lost with DTX treatment, suggesting that it was due to enhanced activity of Kv1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>I). Overexpression of SH-CASPR2 had no effect on I<sub>KD</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>H), whereas I<sub>KD</sub> was greater in the FL-CASPR2-EGFP versus EGFP cells after 5 DIV and was similar to the levels seen after 1 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>H). Again, the effect was significantly prevented by DTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>J). The lack of effect of SH-CASPR2 is most likely due to its diminished ability to be expressed at the membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S7</xref>F). Interestingly, patient CASPR2-Ab only bound to the FL-CASPR2 isoform, and not the SH-CASPR2 isoform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S8</xref>A–S8C). These data therefore suggest that the FL isoform of CASPR2 has a cell-autonomous effect on a population of small-/medium-sized DRG cells through its regulation of Kv1 channel membrane expression.</p>

<title>CASPR2 Is Required for Normal D-Hair Primary Afferent Excitability</title>
<p id="p0120">In order to study the effects of CASPR2 on the transduction properties of peripheral sensory terminals in the hindpaw glabrous skin, we used the tibial nerve-skin nerve preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Milenkovic et al., 2014</xref>) and, given the behavioral findings from both the CASPR2-Ab-treated and <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, focused on mechanotransduction. Evoked responses to mechanical and electrical stimuli were assessed. We recorded from Aβ low-threshold rapidly adapting and slowly adapting mechanoreceptors (RAM and SAM, respectively), Aδ low-threshold mechanoreceptors (D-hair afferents; note that these are present <italic>in plantar</italic> paw skin; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3">Discussion</xref>), Aδ mechano-nociceptors (A-Ms), C-mechano-nociceptors (C-Ms), and polymodal C-mechano-heat-nociceptors (C-MHs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>A). Consistent with previous findings in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>), we did not find changes in the conduction velocities of any primary afferent subtype in mice lacking FL-CASPR2 compared to <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>B). When using an increasing velocity or an increasing force protocol (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4">STAR Methods</xref>), we observed no changes in the stimulus-response functions of RAMs, SAMs, A-Ms, C-Ms, or C-MHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S6</xref>). We did, however, find markedly enhanced excitability in D-hair primary afferents. The mechanical stimulation protocol for D-hairs consisted of a ramp and hold phase and the typical response of a D-hair from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>D. As D-hairs characteristically respond only to moving stimuli, we initially analyzed the velocity stimulus-response function during the ramp phase only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S9</xref>A). D-hair primary afferents are exquisitely sensitive to slow-moving stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lechner and Lewin, 2013</xref>). <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> D-hairs show significant hyperexcitability to slow stimulus velocities compared to <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> D-hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>E, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S9</xref>B, and S9C). We next analyzed the firing frequency of D-hairs during the entire stimulus. Compared to <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup>mice, D-hairs from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed markedly impaired adaption and continued to fire during the static phase of the stimulus at velocities of 75 μm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>F) and 150 μm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>G). It is unusual for D-hair mechanoreceptors to fire during the hold phase of the stimulus. However, the <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> D-hair firing frequency was strikingly and significantly increased during the stimulus hold phase compared to <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> D-hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>H and 6I). On average, only 24.29% ± 6.0% of WT D-hairs responded during the hold phase of the stimulus while 60.0% ± 7.95% of <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> D-hairs responded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>J). Finally, to rule out a developmental role of CASPR2 on target innervation, we assessed D-hair innervation in both glabrous and hairy skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S9</xref>D and S9E). TrkB is expressed by low-threshold mechanosensitive afferents and can be used to mark D-hair lanceolate endings in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2011</xref>). We saw no differences between genotypes in the number of TrkB-positive lanceolate endings in both glabrous and hairy skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S9</xref>D and S9E). The loss of CASPR2, therefore, alters the stimulus response of a surprisingly selective population of primary afferent terminals, the D-hairs, resulting in enhanced responses to low-threshold mechanical stimuli and markedly impaired adaption.<fig id="fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Genetic Deletion of FL-CASPR2 Results in Hyper-Excitable D-Hair Primary Afferents</p><p>(A) Diagram illustrating the cutaneous mechanoreceptor sensory endings that were identified and recorded from using the <italic>ex vivo</italic> skin nerve preparation</p><p>(B and C) Conduction velocity (B) and mechanical thresholds (C) were recorded from mechanoreceptors and nociceptors.

<title>Loss of CASPR2 Leads to Dorsal Horn Hyperexcitability</title>
<p id="p0125">Given the integration of sensory inputs at spinal level and potential synaptic role of CASPR2, we investigated the role of CASPR2 in dorsal horn processing of nociceptive stimuli. We performed <italic>in vivo</italic> extracellular recordings from wide dynamic range (WDR) dorsal horn neurons. Neurons were characterized from depths corresponding to the deep dorsal horn laminae (<italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, 650 ± 23 μm; <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, 602 ± 89 μm) and responded to mechanical and thermal stimuli in an intensity-dependent manner.</p>
<p id="p0130">The reduced mechanical withdrawal thresholds observed in behavioral assays were supported by enhanced neuronal response to punctate mechanical stimuli in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice compared to <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, most notably to noxious intensities of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>A). Heat-evoked responses were less affected by loss of CASPR2 with heat hypersensitivity only observed at supramaximal noxious intensities of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>B). This is consistent with the behavioral findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although there was a trend toward increased neuronal responses in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, we did not observe a statistically significant difference compared to control in response to dynamic brush stimulation of the receptive field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>C). No differences were observed between genotypes following application of innocuous (acetone) or noxious (ethyl chloride) evaporative cooling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>D). Receptive field maps were produced in response to a pinch stimulus applied to the skin; neurons characterized in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited similar receptive field sizes to neurons from WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>E). Electrical stimulation of the receptive field revealed reduced thresholds in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice for the activation of A- and C-fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>F). A train of supra-threshold electrical stimuli (3xC-fiber threshold) was delivered to the receptive field, and neurons from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited comparable levels of wind-up (the potentiated response and measure of postsynaptic hyperexcitability) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>G–7I). The cumulative total of neuronal events evoked by both A- and C-fibers was increased in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice compared to <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>G). Furthermore, the input (the non-potentiated response more indicative of pre-synaptic events) and post-discharge, a property of spinal neurons, were both elevated in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>G). These data demonstrate hyperexcitability within the pain-signaling pathway at the level of the spinal cord in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup>; the modality-specific changes, coupled with alterations in input, but not wind-up, suggest a pre- rather than postsynaptic locus of action for CASPR2 in regulating dorsal horn hyperexcitability. To further address this, we have used spinal cord slice preparations and recorded from dorsal horn neurons in Lamina II. We did not see any evidence of altered synaptic function due to loss of FL-CASPR2. There was no significant difference in the frequency or amplitude of either spontaneous or capsaicin-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) between genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S10</xref>A–S10C).

<title>Patient CASPR2-Abs Cause a Loss of Kv1 Channel Membrane Expression and Hyperexcitability in Sensory Neurons</title>
<p id="p0135">Finally, we used cultured mouse DRG neurons to see if plasma from CASPR2-Ab-positive patients could affect the properties of these cells in a similar manner to that seen following genetic ablation of FL-CASPR2. At the time of plating, DRG neurons were treated with complement-deactivated plasmas from the healthy control subject, patient 1, or patient 2. Initially, we confirmed the ability of patient Abs to bind sensory neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. Using the anti-human IgG antibody, we saw membrane staining in patient plasma-treated cells, but not in those treated with healthy control plasma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S8</xref>D–S8F). Furthermore, we confirmed the specificity of these patient autoantibodies for the FL version of CASPR2 by using DRG neurons cultured from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. No binding of patient IgG was seen on DRG neurons lacking FL-CASPR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S8</xref>G). Patient Ab binding was predominantly seen in NF200-positive cells. In line with experiments carried out on neurons from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, we went on to look at the membrane expression of Kv1.2 in cells treated with plasma for 24 hr at 37<sup>o</sup>C.

DRG neurons treated with plasma from both patient 1 and 2 also had a significant reduction in rheobase compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>D). Furthermore, DRG neurons treated with patient 1 plasma displayed significantly increased repetitive firing in response to supra-threshold stimuli compared to control cells, although this effect was not seen in cells treated with plasma from patient 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>E). These findings suggest that, as in genetic ablation studies, patient CASPR2-Abs increase the excitability of DRG neurons due to reduced Kv1 channel function, and the behavioral hypersensitivity is mediated via enhanced neuronal excitability rather than destructive or pro-inflammatory effects.<fig id="fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Patient CASPR2-Abs Reduce Kv1 Membrane Expression on DRG Neurons and Increase Their Excitability</p><p>(A) Representative images showing that Kv1.2 (green) membrane staining is decreased in NF200-positive (red) DRG neurons treated with plasma from CASPR2-Ab-positive patients when compared to control.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="p0140">The immune system is increasingly recognized as making an important contribution to persistent pain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMahon et al., 2015</xref>). Hitherto, studies of the immune system in neuropathic pain have focused on immune cells and cytokines while the role of autoantibodies in persistent pain is less well established. Autoantibodies against the VGKCC and in particular to CASPR2 have been linked to neuropathic pain and furthermore in some cases pain has been shown to improve following immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klein et al., 2012</xref>). These clinical findings, in combination with the phenotype seen in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, suggest that CASPR2-Abs contribute to pain in these patients. We used passive transfer of purified IgG from two patients with high titers of CASPR2-Abs and immunotherapy-responsive pain into mice and found that IgG was deposited in the peripheral, but not central, nervous system (consistent with a peripheral mode of action). Both IgG preparations induced mechanical pain-related hypersensitivity in mice confirming pathogenicity of these antibodies in driving pain-related behavior.</p>
<p id="p0145">Autoimmune neuropathies such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruts et al., 2012</xref>) are associated with a high incidence of neuropathic pain that occurs as a consequence of small fiber injury. We therefore considered whether CASPR2-Abs caused pain-related hypersensitivity as a consequence of direct injury to sensory neurons. We found that the IENFD was unchanged, and there was no evidence of axon loss or demyelination on detailed nerve morphometry. Autoantibodies from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and complex regional pain syndrome can cause abnormal pain behavior in mice through modulation of the inflammatory response and altered production of immune mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tékus et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wigerblad et al., 2016</xref>). We did not, however, find evidence of a significant inflammatory response within the peripheral or CNS in mice treated with CASPR2-Abs, and we hypothesized that CASPR2-Abs altered sensory function through the novel mechanism of an acquired channelopathy.</p>
<p id="p0150">We examined the expression of CASPR2 in sensory neurons and used <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice to study the effects of CASPR2 levels on pain-related behavior and primary afferent excitability. A recent study assessing a CASPR2 reporter line during embryonic development reported CASPR2 expression in neural circuits sub-serving multiple sensory modalities including somatosensory afferents projecting to footpad skin and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>). In adulthood, <italic>Cntnap2</italic> mRNA was broadly expressed by DRG neurons: it is present in small diameter DRG cells with unmyelinated axons with higher expression in those small diameter DRG cells that are presumptive nociceptors (IB4- and CGRP-positive) versus C low-threshold mechanoreceptors (TH-positive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2011</xref>). CASPR2 is expressed at higher levels in medium- to large-sized cells that are NF200 positive. To address the role of CASPR2 in sensory function, we initially studied the response of <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which lack the FL version of CASPR2 (FL-CASPR2), to a diverse range of sensory stimuli. <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice displayed robust hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli, enhanced response to supra-threshold noxious heat, and increased nocifensive behavior to the chemical algogens capsaicin and formalin.</p>
<p id="p0155">Humans with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>CNTNAP2</italic> demonstrate a number of core features of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Strauss et al., 2006</xref>), and somatosensory abnormalities are increasingly recognized in ASD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cascio, 2010</xref>). <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have been shown to have a number of behavioral features consistent with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peñagarikano et al., 2011</xref>). A number of other autism-related genes (<italic>Mecp2</italic>, <italic>Shank3</italic>, or <italic>Fmr1</italic>) have recently been shown to contribute to sensory disorders via specific roles within primary sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orefice et al., 2016</xref>). Given that genetic or immune-mediated ablation of CASPR2 could cause behavioral hypersensitivity, we examined the role of CASPR2 in regulating excitability within DRG cells.</p>
<p id="p0160">Using <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging of populations of DRG cells, we found an enhanced response (in both small- and medium-sized cells representing both C and Aδ fibers) to a range of sensory stimuli including noxious heat, brush, pinch, and the algogen capsaicin in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. These data were in agreement with patch-clamp analysis of dissociated DRG cells in which small- and medium-sized neurons demonstrated a reduced rheobase, indicating enhanced excitability. When examining the peripheral terminals of DRG cells in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, we focused on mechanical stimulus-response function given that this was the most striking behavioral finding. We observed changes in mechanosensitivity in a surprisingly selective population of primary afferents, the D-hair mechanoreceptors, which may indicate that CASPR2 has differential effects on DRG cells dependent on the compartment examined (i.e., soma versus peripheral terminal). D-hairs are Aδ low-threshold afferents that form lanceolate terminal endings around hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2011</xref>), arise from medium-sized neurons, and show high expression of Kv1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shin et al., 2003</xref>). Although thought to be present only in hairy skin, we do find D-hair afferents also in the glabrous skin of plantar hindpaw. D-hairs are the most mechanically sensitive of all primary afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lewin et al., 1992</xref>). In the <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse, they show increased firing frequency both in the ramp and hold phases of the mechanical stimulus. Thus, adaption that is normally very prominent in these afferents was impaired. In the “naive state,” it was proposed that D-hairs are involved in priming central mechanisms prior to stimulus detection from other mechanoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lechner and Lewin, 2013</xref>). Recent direct evidence for this arises from experiments in which optogenetic activation of TrkB expressing afferents (many of which are D-hairs) results in lowering of mechanical pain thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, in the context of pathological pain, D-hairs can contribute to the increased pain-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ventéo et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0165">Given the integration of sensory inputs at the level of the spinal dorsal horn, we undertook extracellular recordings of WDR neurons. There was an enhanced response in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, particularly to mechanical and noxious heat stimulation. These neurons also demonstrated a lower response threshold to A-fiber strength and C-fiber strength electrical stimulation. There was no significant difference in the “wind up” properties of these neurons; whereas the response to the initial sensory input was significantly greater suggesting that the locus of action could be pre- rather than a postsynaptic event. Consistent with this, we did not observe any change in capsaicin-evoked synaptic responses in recording from lamina II dorsal horn neurons in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. We subsequently investigated the mechanism by which CASPR2 can regulate primary afferent excitability.</p>
<p id="p0170">CASPR2 is known to associate with the shaker-type VGKCs. In <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, Kv1 channels no longer cluster at the JXP, and we found that treatment of mice with human CASPR2-Abs led to a reduction in the JXP expression of CASPR2 and Kv1.1. Using <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poliak et al. (2003)</xref> reported that there was no change in the conduction velocity or the refractory period. In agreement with this, when using single-unit recordings, we also found no change in the conduction velocity of sensory afferents in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. The lack of effect of altered Kv1 channel distribution in axons is a likely consequence of the fact that in normal circumstances juxtaparanodal Kv1 channels are electrically insulated from the node of Ranvier by compact myelin and do not modulate conduction characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rasband et al., 1998</xref>). We therefore investigated the function of CASPR2 in other neuronal compartments: DRG terminals and soma in which we do find a cell-autonomous effect of CASPR2 on neuronal excitability.</p>
<p id="p0175">In recordings from cultured DRG neurons, we found that a loss of the FL-CASPR2 isoform resulted in enhanced excitability particularly of medium-sized DRG cells. Reduced expression of Kv1.1 and 1.2 has been associated with increased DRG cell excitability and enhanced behavioral responses to both noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chi and Nicol, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). We found a large reduction in the DTX-sensitive outward current in neurons from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, indicating a reduction in the function of Kv1 channels. WT neurons become hyper-excitable after 5 days in culture co-incident with reduced CASPR2 expression. This hyper-excitability could be reversed in an isoform-specific manner: overexpression of FL-CASPR2, but not of the short isoform, suppressed this hyper-excitability in a Kv1 channel-dependent manner. Kv1.1 is known to be highly expressed by D-hair afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shin et al., 2003</xref>) that may partly explain why this specific population of afferents showed such enhanced mechanosensitivity of their terminals in the absence of FL-CASPR2. We also observed enhanced excitability in small DRG neurons from <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, although this was less marked than that seen in medium-sized cells. The relative expression of Kv1 α subunits differs in distinct DRG neuronal populations with higher expression of Kv1.1 and 1.2 in medium and large DRG neurons and higher expression of Kv1.4 in small cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rasband et al., 2001</xref>). To summarize, CASPR2 is not only important for the longitudinal movement of Kv1 channels to the JXP domain of myelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>), but FL-CASPR2 dynamically regulates the excitability of small- and particularly medium-sized DRG neurons. It is required for the expression of Kv1 channels at the soma membrane and in its absence these neurons become hyper-excitable.</p>
<p id="p0180">We observed deposition of human IgG in the DRG (but not in spinal cord), and we therefore investigated whether CASPR2-Abs were able to directly affect soma excitability. IgG from both patients bound DRG neurons and did indeed increase their excitability. Binding of IgG, which is divalent, causes target internalization, which is one of the major pathological mechanisms in neurological autoimmune conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ludwig et al., 2017</xref>). We found a reduction in Kv1 channel surface expression on DRG neurons following plasma treatment, consistent with this proposed mechanism. These autoantibodies, therefore, contribute to clinical pain by directly targeting neuronal molecules that regulate cell excitability. Although both patient IgGs reduced rheobase of DRG neurons, only patient 1 IgG enhanced repetitive firing in response to a supra-threshold stimulus. Given that both antibodies reduce surface expression of Kv1 channels, this difference is not easy to explain; however, multiple epitopes within CASPR2 have been shown to be recognized by CASPR2 autoantibodies that could contribute to heterogeneity in their functional effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olsen et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0185">Gene ablation of CASPR2 leads to enhanced pain-related behavior in response to noxious mechanical, thermal stimuli, or algogens. This occurs as a consequence of increased DRG soma excitability due to impaired Kv1 channel function, increased mechanosensitivity of D-hair terminals, and is also associated with hyper-excitability at a spinal level. This is a further example of an ASD-linked gene mutation causing altered sensory function due to altered transduction/transmission within DRG neurons. We show for the first time that passive transfer of human CASPR2-Abs to WT mice can enhance neuronal excitability in a cell-autonomous manner and produce a peripheral neuropathic pain state as a consequence of an acquired channelopathy. This demonstrates antibody pathogenicity and, given the potential reversibility of excitability changes, provides a rationale for the identification of CASPR2-Abs in chronic pain patients and the appropriate use of immunotherapy.</p>

<title>Experimental Model and Subject Details</title>
<sec id="sec4.3.1">
<title>Mouse lines and animal care</title>
<p id="p0200">All procedures were carried out in accordance with UK home office regulations and in line with the Animals Scientific Procedures Act 1986 at a licensed facility within the University of Oxford, following institutional review board approval. Animals were group housed in IVC cages in temperature and humidity controlled rooms where food and water was available <italic>ad libitum</italic>, with a 12 hour light dark cycle. The welfare of all animals was continually assessed throughout all procedures.</p>
<p id="p0205"><italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, were generated by E Peles and have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>). These mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J background. Heterozygous mice were bred together to obtain both <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>, Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> littermates. Genotyping of offspring was performed by PCR of genomic DNA using primers to detect either the wild-type (5′-TGCTGCTGCCAGCCCAGAACTGG-3′ to 5′-TCAGAGTTGATACCCGAGCGCC-3′) or mutated allele (5′-AGCAGCCGATTGTCTGTTGT-3′ to 5′-CTCACCCAATCTCACAAACAAG-3′) of <italic>Cntnap2</italic>. Glycine transporter 2-eGFP reporter mice have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zeilhofer et al., 2005</xref>). Both male and female adult <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>/Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/−</sup><italic>/Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice were used for experimental studies. For human IgG studies male C57BL/6J mice were used. For all behavior and tissue analysis studies, mice were aged between 8-16 weeks. For cell culture mice were aged between 4-8 weeks. This study conforms to the ARRIVE guidelines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.3.2">
<title>Cell culture</title>
<p id="p0210">Adult male and female mice of 4-8 weeks of age were sacrificed in a CO<sub>2</sub> chamber. The spinal column was rapidly removed and bisected to reveal the DRG. DRG were taken from all levels and placed directly into Hanks’ Balanced Salt solution (HBSS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Invitrogen). DRG were then subjected to enzymatic digestion using collagenase II (12mg/ml, Worthington) and dispase II (14mg/ml, Roche) diluted in HBSS for 1.5 hours at 37°C. DRGs were then washed in HBSS and mechanically dissociated using fire polished pipettes. Dissociated cells were suspended in culture medium (Neurobasal medium, B27, glutamax, GIBCO) supplemented with mouse NGF (50ng/μl, Peprotech) and GDNF (10ng/μl, Peprotech), and plated on to laminin/poly-D Lysine coated coverslips before being incubated at 37°C.</p>
<p id="p0215">Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured in Dulbeccos’s modified Eagles’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum (TCS Cellworks Ltd) in 6 well plates at 37°C. Penicillin G and streptomycin were added to the culture medium to prevent infection.</p>

<title>Method Details</title>
<sec id="sec4.4.1">
<title>IgG purification</title>
<p id="p0220">The IgG fraction was purified from the plasma of both CASPR2-Ab patients and the healthy control using protein G Sepharose beads (Sigma). The plasma was diluted 1:4 with Hartmann’s solution and passed through a column containing the Sepharose beads at a flow rate of ∼0.5ml/minute. Once the diluted plasma had passed through the column, additional Hartmann’s solution was used to wash the beads to ensure no non-specific proteins were present. The IgG was then eluted with 0.1M glycine solution (pH 2.3) and immediately neutralised with 1M Tris (pH 8). Coomassie Plus assay kit (Pierce) was used to determine the protein content of the eluted fractions. Fractions with high protein content were dialysed against Hartmann’s solution, concentrated using polyethylene glycol and filter sterilized. IgG concentration was determined by spectrometry. For Patient 1 the purified IgG was concentrated to 15mg/ml, for Patient 2 to 11mg/ml and for healthy control to 15mg/ml and 12.5mg/ml, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.4.2">
<title>Passive transfer</title>
<p id="p0225">C57BL/6 male mice (8-12 weeks of age) received daily intraperitoneal injections of sterile purified human IgG for either 2 or 3 weeks. All injections were given between 5-6pm and were therefore carried out subsequent to any behavioral testing that had occurred the same day. For experiments involving patient 1, mice received 6mg of purified IgG daily of either patient or healthy control IgG. For experiments involving patient 2, mice received 10mg of purified IgG daily of either patient or control IgG. Mice were closely observed throughout the dosing regime and their weight monitored. At termination of the injections, blood was taken for serology and tissue taken for histology as described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.4.3">
<title>Behavioral studies</title>
<p id="p0230">The same designated room was used for all behavioral studies and testing was performed at a consistent time of day. Mice were acclimatised to the testing equipment and baseline values were obtained by averaging data from 2-3 sessions. For human IgG studies, baseline values were used to allocate mice into matching groups prior to treatment. Sample sizes were chosen based on a power calculation using historical data relating to mechanical and thermal threshold responses (α error of 0.05 and a power of 80%). It was calculated that groups of 8 would be needed, using the assumption that an effect size of 25% would be biological meaningful. In total 45 <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> 7 <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice and 48 <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> littermates were used in behavioral studies (56 males and 44 females). Mechanical hypersensitivity was replicated in a second independent cohort of mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were used for all human IgG studies. In total 17 mice were injected with healthy control IgG, 8 with patient 1 IgG and 9 with patient 2 IgG. For all behavior experiments mice from different experimental groups were assessed at the same time. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed by placing mice in a Perspex box situated on top of a wire mesh. Calibrated Von Frey hairs (Ugo Basile) were then applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw and a reflex withdrawal response was used to calculate the 50% withdrawal threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chaplan et al., 1994</xref>). Dynamic mechanical allodynia was assessed using a recently published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). A small paintbrush (5/0, The Art Shop) was modified by trimming the tip to make it blunt. This was used to gently stroke the plantar surface of the paw. A scoring system was used as follows to determine a dynamic allodynia score, (0) (a none painful response) lifting of the paw for less than 1 s, (1) sustained lifting of the paw or a single flinch, (2) lateral paw lift above the level of the body or a startle like jump and (3) multiple flinching responses or licking of the affected paw. The response to a clear noxious mechanical stimulus was also assessed using the pin prick test as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arcourt et al., 2017</xref>). A dissecting pin was attached to a 1 g Von Frey filament and applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw to elicit a rapid withdrawal reflex. The latency to withdraw was recorded using an iPhone 6 (Apple) at 240fps (4.16ms per frame) and analyzed using the video editing program Avidemux. Thermal sensitivity was initially assessed using the Hargreave’s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hargreaves et al., 1988</xref>). Here using the Hargreave’s apparatus (Ugo Baslie) a radiant heat source was applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw and the latency to withdrawal was used to determine heat sensitivity threshold. Response to a suprathreshold heat stimulus was measured using the hot plate (Ugo Basile) assay. A metallic plate was set so that the surface temperature was at either 50°C or 53°C. Mice were then placed onto the plate and the latency until a response, in this case shaking, licking or biting of the paw, was measured. To assess cold sensitivity a thermal preference paradigm was used. The thermal preference equipment (Ugo Basile) consisted of two plates with a small connecting bridge. The plates were set at either 16°C or room temperature. Mice were then assessed over a 10 minute period and the percentage of time spent at 16°C was calculated. Pilot studies had identified this temperature scenario as optimal (data not shown). For assessment of capsaicin sensitivity, mice received an intraplantar injection of 1.5μg of capsaicin (Sigma) diluted in sterile saline with 1% ethanol and 0.5% tween in a volume of 10 μl. Mice were placed in a Perspex cylinder and the duration of pain-related behavior, biting/licking/paw lifting, was recorded over a 5 minute period. For the formalin test, mice received an intraplantar injection of 20 μl of 5% formalin diluted from formaldehyde solution (Sigma) in sterile saline. Again, mice were placed in a Perspex cylinder and the duration of pain-related behavior, biting/licking/paw lifting, was recorded over a 60 minute period. The behavioral response is biphasic and therefore further comparisons were made by pooling data in the first (0-15mins) and second (15-60mins) phases. Motor behavior was assessed using a RotaRod. Mice were placed on a rotating rod which was either accelerating from 4-32rpm or at a constant speed (28 rpm). The latency until the mouse could no longer stay on the rod was recorded. For the open field test, a black box displaying a grid system on the floor was used. Mice were placed in this box for 3 minutes and the number of boxes the mouse entered during this period was recorded. Proprioception was also assessed using the beam walk test as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carter et al., 2001</xref>). This test used a wooden beam of about 1 m in length which was elevated from the bench surface. Mice were filmed as they moved along the beam and the percentage of correct steps was calculated by counting the number of missed steps and comparing to the total number of steps taken for each run. All behavior studies were carried out with the experimenter blind to treatment group or genotype. No animals were excluded from the behavioral analysis.</p>

<title>Tissue preparation</title>
<p id="p0235">For immunohistochemistry and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization studies, mice were overdosed with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused, initially with sterile saline and then 20mls of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, 0.1M Phosphate buffer (PB)). Once dissected the glabrous skin and sciatic nerves were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 0.5 hours at RT, DRG for 2 hours and spinal cord overnight at 4°C. All tissue was dehydrated for cyroprotection in 30% sucrose (0.1M PB) at 4°C for at least 24 hours. Tissue was then embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium (Tissue-Tek) and stored at −80. Tissue was then placed into a solution containing only 30% sucrose before being embedded in OCT. Tissue was sectioned onto Superfrost plus slides (VWR) using a cryostat. For skin, gelatine treated slides were used. Sciatic nerve and DRG sections were cut at 10 μm, skin at 14 μm and spinal cord at 30 μm. The slides were then stored at −80.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.4.4.2">
<title>Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title>
<p id="p0240">Tissue sections were washed once in PBS and then blocked for 1 hour before being incubated overnight at RT with primary antibody diluted in PBS triton-X (0.3%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>). For nodal staining in the sciatic nerve, tissue sections were subjected to a mild antigen retrieval protocol. This involved placing slides containing tissue sections into an EDTA buffer (10mM tris Base, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween, pH9.0) at 60°C for 4-6 hours before blocking and primary Ab incubation. Primary Ab was washed off in PBS triton-X and tissue was then incubated with secondary antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>) at RT for 3-4 hours. Cultured DRG neurons were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 minutes, washed in PBS, and then incubated with primary Ab diluted in blocking solution (Goat or donkey serum, PBS-Tx 0.3%) overnight at 4°C. Coverslips were washed in PBS and incubated with secondary Ab for 2 hours at RT. Immunostaining was visualized using a confocal microscope (Zeiss) and images acquired using the Zen black software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.4.4.3">
<title>Skin whole-mount IHC</title>
<p id="p0245">Briefly, the hind paw hairy and glabrous skin of mice was dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hours. Following this, samples were washed in PBS and then bleached in Dent’s Bleach (33% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 13.3% DMSO, 53.3% methanol), for 24 hours at 4°C with rotation. Samples were blocked and incubated with antibodies in the same manner as mentioned above but with longer incubation times (primary antibodies 4 days, secondary antibodies, 2 days). Following antibody incubation the tissue was cleared using 50% 80% and 100% tetrahydrofuran(THF)/ddH<sub>2</sub>O for 30 minutes (100% for 1 hour) and then in 10% 25% 50% and 97% 2-2 Thiodiethanol (TDE)/PBS/ddH<sub>2</sub>O, for 2 hours at RT. Samples were stored in 97%TDE/PBS and embedded onto microscope slides using 460μm thick adhesive foam spacers. Immunostaining was visualized using a confocal microscope (Zeiss) and images acquired using the Zen black software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.4.4.4">
<title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization (ISH)</title>
<p id="p0250">Once cut, sections were air-dried in the cryostat for 0.5 hours and then stored in the −80°C. ISH was carried out using the RNAScope 2.5 RED chromogenic assay kit and by following the manufacturer’s instructions (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Briefly, tissue sections were removed from the −80, allowed to equilibrate to RT and re-hydrated in PBS. Pre-treatment required a hydrogen peroxide step at RT; followed by a protease treatment in a hybridization oven at 40°C. Slides were then incubated with the target or control probes at 40°C for 2 hours. For CASPR2 mRNA the probes were designed to target position 3708-5086 of NM_001004357.2. Following probe incubation, slides were subjected to 6 rounds of amplification and the probe signal was developed via a reaction with fast red. To combine with IHC, tissue sections were then washed with PBS-Tx (0.3%) and subjected to the standard IHC protocol.</p>

<sec id="sec4.4.4.5">
<title>Electron microscopy and analysis</title>
<p id="p0255">Animals which were either treated with purified IgG from either Patient 1, Patient 2 or healthy control were terminally anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital (Euthatal; 80 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed and 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB. A section of the sural nerve was taken and post-fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB) at 4°C overnight, washed in 0.1 M PB, osmicated, dehydrated, and embedded in epoxy resin (TAAB Embedding Materials). Ultrathin sections (90 nm) were taken using a Diatome diamond knife on the Leica UC7 ultramicrotome and mounted onto 200 mesh Cu grids. Sections were post-stained with Reynold’s lead citrate for 5 minutes, washed with degassed water and dried. Samples were transferred to a FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope and imaged at 120kV. Images were acquired using a Gatan OneView CMOS camera with Digital Micrograph 3.0 software. Full montages of grid squares were taken (∼25 pictures per mesh) and randomly chosen images from a given grid square were analyzed. The total number of axons, total number of myelinated axons, Schwann cell-myelinated axons, were counted from these montages of grid squares and normalized to the total area. To calculate G-ratios, axon diameters and non-myelinated axons with a diameter &gt; 1 μm, individual pictures at the same magnification were randomly chosen per animal; analysis was performed on all of the axons within each picture and axon diameter and G-ratio (axon diameter/fiber diameter) were calculated using AxioVision LE Rel. 4.2 Software. The examiner was blind to the treatment group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.4.4.6">
<title>Image Analysis</title>
<p id="p0260">Analysis of the signal intensity for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization studies on DRG was calculated using ImageJ software. In a single image of a section of either L4 or 5 DRG, neurons with a nucleus were circled and the percentage coverage of red signal for that cell profile area measurement was calculated. By eye the cell was then subpopulation defined by using primary antibodies against NF200, IB4, CGRP or TH and the appropriate secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>). For each marker at least 3 sections were imaged per animal. On each image a background reading was taken from an area of tissue not containing neuronal cell bodies. An average of this was calculated for each animal and any cell that had percentage coverage of greater than 2 standard deviations from the background mean were defined as being positive for CASPR2 mRNA. For spinal cord sections, CASPR2 mRNA positive cells were defined as those containing 4 or more red dots and the percentage of Pax2 expressing cells positive for CASPR2 mRNA was calculated. For analysis of neuronal activity following formalin (5%) injection, <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and control mice were perfused two hours post injection and tissue was incubated with a primary antibody against c-<italic>fos</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>). NeuN was used to mark neuronal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>). The average number of c-<italic>fos</italic> positive neurons in the dorsal horn was calculated from 3-5 sections per animal for both ipsilateral and contralateral sides. For the quantification of DRG neuron subpopulations in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, 3 sections of the L4 DRG were imaged and used for each animal with &gt; 100 cells counted for each subpopulation. The number of cells for each marker is shown as a percentage of the sum of NF200, IB4 and CGRP positive cells. For intraepidermal nerve fiber density counts, 3-4 sections of glabrous skin taken lateral to the proximal end of the most proximal walking pad were used and imaged for each animal. Nerve fibers were identified using a primary antibody against PGP9.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>). The numbers of free nerve endings in the epidermis were calculated using the EFNS guidelines which meant that only fibers that penetrated into the epidermis from the dermal layer were counted. For analysis of Pax2 positive inhibitory interneurons in <italic>Cntnap2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, tissue was incubated in primary antibody against Pax2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>) and 3 sections from the L4 segment of the mouse spinal cord were scanned. The number of Pax2 positive neurons in a 10μm depth across the dorsal horn was calculated and shown as the percentage of total neurons (NeuN positive). For human IgG binding studies sciatic nerve, DRG and spinal cord sections were analyzed. Sciatic nerve sections were incubated with a primary antibody against the paranodal marker CASPR, DRG sections with a primary antibody against NeuN to mark neuronal cell bodies and spinal cord sections with Nissl to mark neurons and DAPI for distinguishing cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>). Sections were then incubated in the appropriate secondary antibodies including anti-human IgG to visualize CASPR2-Ab binding <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>). Permeabilised (0.3% Triton-X) naive wild-type sciatic nerve sections were incubated with purified patient IgG and an antibody against CASPR (paranode) to show the ability of CASPR2-Abs to bind in the sciatic nerve when it has access to the JXP. For analysis of immune cell infiltration in mice treated with purified human IgG from either healthy control or CASPR2-Ab positive patients, primary antibodies against IBA1, Ly6G and CD3 were used to mark, macrophages, neutrophils and T lymphocytes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>). All of these markers were used to analyze DRG and spinal cord tissue and a primary antibody against NeuN was used to mark neuronal cell bodies. IBA1 was also used in sciatic nerve sections. Between 3 and 7 sections were imaged for each animal and the average number of cells per image calculated. Astrocyte activity was measured using a primary antibody against GFAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>). The intensity of the GFAP signal in the superficial dorsal horn was measured using the analysis tool in ImageJ and an average taken from 3-5 sections were animal. L4 DRGs were also used for ATF3 analysis. Tissue was incubated with a primary antibody against AFT3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>) and 3 sections per animal were imaged and the number of ATF3 positive cells was calculated as a percentage of total neurons using a nissl counterstain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>). For nodal counts 3 sciatic nerve sections were imaged for each animal. For the calculation of the number of total nodes, an antibody against CASPR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>) was used to mark the paranode. The number of CASPR positive nodes were counted and shown as the number of nodes per 1000μm<sup>2</sup> of sciatic nerve. Antibodies against CASPR2 and Kv1.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>) were used to mark nodes for these proteins and their amount was calculated as a percentage of total CASPR positive nodes. For analysis of the area of CASPR2 and Kv channel immunostaining in the JXP thresholding of the images was performed using the default setting in the ImageJ software. This helped to remove background noise and the area of immunostaining was then measured for the JXP region of each node, where a node was defined by being CASPR positive. For tissue analysis composite images are shown. All quantification was performed with the experimenter blind to treatment groups.</p>

<title>Brain tissue processing and microglia analysis</title>
<p id="p0265">Brains were removed and post-fixed for 24 hours at room temperature before transferring to 40% sucrose in PBS-azide (0.01%). Using a freezing stage sledge microtome, free-floating coronal sections were collected in 15 series at a thickness of 50 μm. Similar to that recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coutinho et al., 2017</xref>), reactive microglial cells were identified by immunofluorescence using rat anti-CD68 and rabbit anti-IBA1 primary antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S7</xref>) on free-floating sections.

Animals were initially anaesthetised with 3.5% v/v isofluorane delivered in 3:2 ratio of nitrous oxide and oxygen. Once areflexic, mice were secured in a stereotaxic frame and subsequently maintained on 1.5% v/v isofluorane for the remainder of the experiment. A laminectomy was performed to expose L3-L5 segments of the spinal cord. Extracellular recordings were made from deep dorsal horn wide dynamic range (WDR) lamina V/VI neurones with receptive fields on the glabrous skin of the toes using 0.127 mm 2 MΩ parylene-coated tungsten electrodes (A-M Systems). Neurones were characterized from depths relating to deep dorsal horn laminae (350-700 μm from surface of cord), and were selected on the basis of responses to dynamic brushing, and noxious mechanical and thermal stimulation. Electrical stimulation of WDR neurones was delivered transcutaneously via needles inserted into the receptive field. A train of 16 electrical stimuli (2 ms pulses, 0.5 Hz) was applied at three times the threshold current for C-fiber activation. Responses evoked by A- (0–50 ms) and C-fibers (50–250 ms) were separated and quantified on the basis of latency. Neuronal responses occurring after the C-fiber latency band were classed as post-discharge (PD). The input (I) and the wind-up (WU) were calculated as: Input = (action potentials evoked by first pulse) × total number of pulses (16), wind-up = (total action potentials after 16 train stimulus) − Input. The receptive field was also stimulated using a range of natural stimuli (brush, von Frey filaments – 0.4, 1, 4, 8 and 15 g and heat – 32, 37, 42, 45 and 48°C) applied over a period of 10 s per stimulus and the evoked response quantified. The heat stimulus was applied with a constant water jet onto the center of the receptive field. Acetone (Sigma) and ethyl chloride (50 μl) (Miller Medical Supplies) were applied to the receptive field, described previously as an evaporative innocuous cooling and noxious cooling stimulus respectively. Evoked responses to room temperature water (25°C) were subtracted from acetone and ethyl chloride evoked responses to control for any concomitant mechanical stimulation during application. Natural stimuli were applied starting with the lowest intensity stimulus with approximately 30 s between stimuli in the following order: brush, von Frey, cold, heat, electrical. Receptive fields were determined using a pinch stimulus. An area was considered part of the receptive field if a response of &gt; 30 action potentials over 5 s were obtained. A rest period of 30 s between applications was used to avoid sensitization. Receptive field sizes are expressed as a percentage area of a standardized paw measured using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda). Data were captured and analyzed by a Cambridge Electronic Design 1401 interface coupled to a computer with Spike2 software (CED, Cambridge, UK) with post-stimulus time histogram and rate functions.

ROIs to determine GCaMP fluorescence were chosen stringently, with minimal overlap to ensure less interference from surrounding somata. ROIs for calculation of neuronal cell body size were then chosen with less stringency, allowing for overlapping regions in which cells are in close proximity, to reflect a more accurate calculation of cell diameter.
