<title>Objective</title>
<p>High-throughput sequencing based on copy number variation (CNV-seq) is
commonly used to detect chromosomal abnormalities including aneuploidy. This
study provides evidence for the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities in
target populations.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A total of 160 samples, including 83 high-risk pregnancies, 37 spontaneous
abortions, and 40 suspected genetic disorders, were analyzed by CNV-seq.
Relationships between the incidence of these chromosomal abnormalities and
risk factors (e.g. advanced maternal age, abnormal pregnancy history, and
family history of congenital disease) were further analyzed by subgroup.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 37 (44.6%) high-risk pregnancies, 25 (67.6%) spontaneous
abortions, and 22 (55%) suspected genetic disorders had chromosomal
abnormalities including aneuploidy and CNVs. There was an increased risk
association between the prevalence of aneuploidy and pathogenic-relevant CNV
in the fetus or abortive tissue and advanced maternal age. Moreover, a
family history of congenital disease was also positively correlated with
fetal chromosomal abnormalities in high-risk pregnancies.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A relatively high prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities was detected in
high-risk pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, and suspected genetic
disorders, indicating the importance of CNV detection in such
populations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aneuploidy and copy number variation (CNV), referring to segmental deletion or
duplication ranging from thousands to millions of chromosomal bases, are the main
types of chromosomal abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060518818020">1</xref></sup> As an important source of genetic variation, chromosomal abnormalities are
considered to have biological importance in species evolution and genetic diversity.
For instance, Zarrei et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060518818020">2</xref></sup> identified CNV in around 10% of the human genome in a study involving
multiple races. Together with aneuploidy, CNV is considered a major cause for
several chromosomal disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060518818020">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060518818020">4</xref></sup> while aneuploidy is mostly
responsible for congenital birth defects and infertility. Therefore, it is necessary
to screen these birth defects and chromosomal disorders by detecting chromosomal CNV
changes.</p>
<p>Recently, the development of high-throughput sequencing techniques has extended the
detection of chromosomal CNV to karyotype analysis, fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH), chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) such as array
comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
array, as well as high-throughput-based CNV-sequencing (seq).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060518818020">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300060518818020"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060518818020"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060518818020">8</xref></sup> Although karyotype analysis is
not effective at analyzing small CNV with clinical importance because of its complex
procedures and low resolution of 5 Mb,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060518818020">9</xref></sup> it remains the golden standard for identifying chromosomal abnormality. In
contrast, FISH is simpler and more rapid, but the information that can be obtained
is limited by probe coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060518818020">10</xref></sup> CMA shows higher resolution compared with karyotype analysis, but requires
the preparation of microarray chips based on the chromosomal abnormality and
clinical information from public databases. Moreover, its efficiency is defined by
the screening of rare CNVs that are not included in the databases. Furthermore, its
application is hampered in developing regions because of high technical demands and costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060518818020">11</xref></sup> Recently, next-generation sequencing has offered high-throughput, higher
accuracy and sensitivity, and lower costs, so is increasingly used in clinical
research and detection, as well as in the screening of chromosomal CNVs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060518818020">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The detection of CNVs has been acknowledged in fetal screening, spontaneous
abortions, and diseases with no confirmed clinical diagnosis. In this study, we
aimed to investigate the efficiency of CNV-seq in the screening of these conditions
by analyzing the effects of pregnancy age, family history of congenital disease, and
abnormal pregnancy history on chromosomal CNV.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>A total of 162 subjects who presented to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin
Medical University from September 2015 to October 2016 were enrolled in the
study. Among them, 84 cases were high-risk pregnancies (aged 17–44 years) with a
gestational age of 17–31 weeks. These subjects underwent amniocentesis to obtain
amniotic fluid or umbilical vein puncture to obtain cord blood. Thirty-eight
cases (aged 22–41 years) underwent spontaneous abortions with a gestational age
of 7–37 weeks. The villus, umbilical cord, or fetal tissues were obtained under
sterile conditions. The other 40 cases with suspected genetic disorders (aged
1–38 years) underwent venous blood collection. Each subject or their parents
signed an informed consent form. The study protocols were approved by the
Ethical Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University
(No. 2015-research-185).</p>

<title>CNV-seq</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood &amp;Tissue Kit (Qiagen Inc.,
Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and measured
using the Qubit quantitative kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL,
USA) with a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) strictly
adhering to the protocols. A DNA library was constructed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060518818020">12</xref></sup> Briefly, 50 ng genomic DNA was fragmented to an average size of 300 bp,
and end-ligated with barcoded sequence adaptors. Tagged DNA fragments were
amplified using primers with partial adaptor sequences to generate sequencing
libraries. The CNV libraries were established after DNA purification, and
sequenced on the HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) to
generate approximately 5 million 36-bp single-end reads. The raw data were
analyzed to evaluate chromosomal copy number as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060518818020">12</xref></sup></p>

84 high-risk pregnancies, and one subject was excluded from 38 cases of
spontaneous abortions because of high noise background in the sequencing
analysis. Therefore, 160 samples (83 high-risk pregnancies, 37 spontaneous
abortions, and 40 suspected genetic disorders) were eventually analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300060518818020">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Of the 83 women with high-risk pregnancies who underwent prenatal testing, 37
(44.6%) showed aneuploidy or CNV; three cases had aneuploidy, 33 had CNV, and
one had both aneuploidy and CNV. These chromosomal abnormalities included four
pathogenic CNVs, four likely pathogenic CNVs, 16 CNVs of unknown clinical
significance, and 10 polymorphic CNVs.</p>
<p>For the 37 cases with spontaneous abortions, 25 (67.6%) showed aneuploidy or CNV;
15 cases had aneuploidy, eight had CNV, and two had both aneuploidy and CNV.
These chromosomal abnormalities include three pathogenic CNVs, no likely
pathogenic CNVs, four CNVs of unknown clinical significance, and three
polymorphic CNVs.</p>
<p>For those 40 patients with suspected genetic disorders, 22 (55%) had CNVs, with
no aneuploidy detected. Of these CNVs, six were pathogenic, two were likely
pathogenic, 12 had unknown clinical significance, and two were polymorphic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0300060518818020">
<title>High-risk pregnancies</title>
<p>CNV-seq showed that the frequency of pathogenic-relevant chromosomal
abnormalities (including aneuploidy and pathogenic and likely pathogenic CNVs)
in women with high-risk pregnancies was 14.46% (12/83). To investigate the
correlation between this frequency and clinical factors, we divided the 83
samples into subgroups according to the mother’s age, history of congenital
disease, history of aberrant pregnancy or delivery, and ultrasound examinations.
On this basis, a comparative analysis was carried out to identify potential
relationships.</p>
<p>Subjects were divided into the following groups: 20–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34
years, 35–39 years, and 40–44 years. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060518818020">Figure 2a</xref>, the proportions of
pathogenic-relevant chromosomal abnormalities were 9.09% (1/11), 10% (2/20),
14.81% (4/27), 16.67% (3/18), and 20% (1/5), respectively. The prevalence of
pathogenic-relevant chromosomal abnormalities showed an age-dependent increase,
especially in those aged ≥30 years who showed an increase of nearly 50% compared
with their younger counterparts.</p>

</fig>
<p>The 83 subjects were also divided into two groups depending whether they had a
family history of certain congenital disorders. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060518818020">Figure 2b</xref>, the proportion of
pathogenic-relevant chromosomal abnormalities was notably lower in those with no
family history of congenital disorders than in those with a family history
(11.54% (9/78) vs. 40% (2/5), respectively).</p>
<p>Additionally, subgroup analysis was performed based on a history of aberrant
pregnancy or delivery. Unexpectedly, the incidence of pathogenic-relevant
chromosomal abnormalities was lower in those with an abnormal pregnancy history
than in those without such a history (5.13% (2/39) vs. 20.45% (9/44),
respectively).</p>
<p>Finally, the 83 subjects were divided into two groups according to ultrasonic
findings. The incidence of pathogenic-relevant chromosomal abnormalities was
lower in those with normal ultrasonic findings than in those with aberrant
ultrasonic findings (11.36% (5/44) vs. 15.38% (6/39), respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060518818020">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>

<title>Spontaneous abortions</title>
<p>To investigate the correlation between fetal chromosomal CNVs and abortive tissue
CNVs, we divided the abortive tissue samples into subgroups according to the
mother’s age, history of an abnormal pregnancy, and ultrasonic findings. We also
compared the incidence of aneuploidy and CNV based on CNV-seq findings.</p>
<p>Subjects were divided into three subgroups according to age: 20–29 years, 30–34
years, and 35–41 years. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0300060518818020">Figure 3a</xref>, the incidence of
pathogenic-relevant chromosomal abnormalities was notably higher in subjects
aged 30–34 years and 35–41 years than in those aged 20–29 years (57.14% (8/14)
vs. 28.57% (4/14) and 66.67% (6/9) vs. 28.57% (4/14), respectively). This
indicated that the incidence of pathogenic-relevant chromosomal abnormalities in
the fetus was higher in women aged ≥30 years with a history of spontaneous
abortion.</p>

<p>We also divided the 37 subjects into groups based on an abnormal pregnancy

chromosomal abnormalities in those with an abnormal pregnancy history was
similar to that in those with no abnormal pregnancy history [40% (4/10) vs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Chromosomal CNVs are an important source of genetic variation, but are a major cause
of chromosomal disorders. CNV-seq is effective for the identification of chromosomal
CNVs, and contributes to the screening of neonate deficits and investigating genetic
or other potential causes of spontaneous abortions. In this study, CNV-seq was used
to analyze CNVs in the prenatal screening of high-risk pregnancies, spontaneous
abortions, and samples with suspected genetic disorders but no clinical
diagnosis.</p>
<p>For women with high-risk pregnancies and aberrant findings in their serum
biochemistry tests and/or ultrasonic examinations, CNV was confirmed in some cases
after the collection of amniotic fluid or cord blood. Previously, pathogenic CNV has
been used as a factor to terminate the pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060518818020">13</xref></sup> Moreover, age and congenital disease history of the mother were shown to be
associated with an increased risk of chromosomal disease in the fetus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060518818020">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060518818020">15</xref></sup> Our findings
were in agreement with this, with age and congenital disease history related to
chromosomal CNV in the fetus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060518818020">Figure 2</xref>). Additionally, we showed that the prevalence of
pathogenic-relevant chromosomal abnormalities had an age-dependent increase,
especially in those aged ≥30 years, while the risk of pathogenic CNV in the fetus
also increased with maternal age. This is in line with a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060518818020">16</xref></sup> For pregnant women with a congenital disorder or ultrasonic anomaly, the risk
of pathogenic CNVs in their fetus was even higher, implying that family history or
aberrant ultrasonic findings may be associated with an increased possibility of
chromosomal CNV changes. Interestingly, an abnormal pregnancy history was not
correlated with an increased risk of pathogenic-relevant chromosomal abnormalities
in the fetus (data not shown), which differed from findings of a previous study in
which a complete karyotype analysis was recommended for women with an abnormal
pregnancy history before their second pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060518818020">17</xref></sup> In future, more studies are needed to further investigate the correlation
between an abnormal pregnancy history and the increased risk of pathogenic-relevant
chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus.</p>
<p>Fetal chromosomal CNVs, especially aneuploidy, have been reported as the major cause
of spontaneous abortions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060518818020">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060518818020">19</xref></sup> Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that factors affecting fetal
chromosomal CNVs are also associated with spontaneous abortions. In this study,
almost half of abortive tissue samples were identified as aneuploid, resulting in a
prevalence that was significantly higher than that of pathogenic-relevant CNV (45.9%
(17/37) vs. 8.11% (3/37)). The age of the pregnant woman having spontaneous
abortions was also shown to be correlated with pathogenic-relevant chromosomal
abnormalities, with those aged ≥30 years showing an increased risk of
pathogenic-relevant chromosomal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0300060518818020">Figure 3a</xref>) and neonate deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060518818020">Figure 2a</xref>). Additionally,
women with an abnormal pregnancy history showed an increased risk of
pathogenic-relevant chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060518818020">Figure 2b</xref>). This implied that aneuploidy is
strongly associated with repeated abortions, which supports the findings of a study
by Bianco et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060518818020">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The detection of chromosomal abnormalities is important for the confirmation of
patients with no clinical diagnosis. In this study, no aneuploidy was identified in
40 suspected genetic disorders. This has relevance for women who undergo abortions
after the identification of severe manifestations induced by aneuploidy in clinical
practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300060518818020">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060518818020">22</xref></sup> Several pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were identified
from these subjects. According to a previous study, CNV may have a sex bias in some
diseases such as schizophrenia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300060518818020">23</xref></sup> olfactory system disorder related retardation and aponoia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300060518818020">24</xref></sup> and autism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300060518818020">25</xref></sup> Our data supported this, with an observed higher incidence of pathogenic or
likely pathogenic CNVs in women compared with men. In the future, we will
investigate the survival tolerance of female fetuses with pathogenic CNV
abnormalities.</p>
<p>When comparing clinical data with CNV data in previous publications, we found that
pathogenic deletions or duplications could effectively explain patient clinical
manifestations. For example, a deletion of 5.42 Mb (chr21: 42680001–48100000) was
identified during the follow-up of a neonate with language barriers. This CNV was
reported to be related to speech retardation, slight build, mental retardation, and
unusual facial expressions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300060518818020">26</xref></sup> Additionally, a female infant with wide-set eyes who was unable to walk or
crawl showed mosaicism of a 34.82 Mb (chr12: 1–34820000) duplication and normal copy
number (60.0%) on chromosome 12. Such duplication was reported to be associated with
congenital deformities of the face, moderate to severe psychomotor development, and hypotonia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300060518818020">27</xref></sup> and was characterized by mental retardation, blurred speech, poor
intelligence, and supravalvular aortic stenosis. Moreover, a female fetus with
Williams syndrome showed a 1.4 Mb deletion on chromosome 7 (chr7:
72720001–74120000). Williams syndrome was previously related to the deletion of such
a DNA fragment, and was characterized by a congenital cardiac anomaly, dysmorphic
facial features, mental retardation, a short attention span, mental retardation, and
microsomia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0300060518818020">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0300060518818020">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. First, its sample size was small and all subjects
were from a single center, which prevented us from drawing more concrete
conclusions. In the future, a multicenter study using a bigger sample size is
required. Second, although possible relationships between the incidence of
chromosomal abnormalities and clinical factors were examined, more data are required
to confirm these relationships.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This work provides insights into the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities in
high-risk populations, such as high-risk pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, and
suspected genetic disorders. These three study groups could represent the main
target population of CNV-seq technology, and indeed this study confirmed the
efficacy of CNV-seq in identifying chromosomal abnormalities including aneuploidy
and CNVs. The three groups all showed a relatively high prevalence of chromosomal
abnormalities, specifically, 44.6% in high-risk pregnancies, 67.6% in spontaneous
abortions, and 55% in suspected genetic disorders. Advanced maternal age is a major
factor increasing the risk of aneuploidy and pathogenic-relevant CNV in high-risk
pregnancies and spontaneous abortions, while a family history of congenital disease
may also play a role in the incidence of fetal chromosomal abnormalities in
high-risk pregnancies. These observed high prevalences of chromosomal abnormalities
shows the importance and need of CNV detection in such high-risk populations.</p>
