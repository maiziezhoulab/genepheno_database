<title>Summary</title>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a disease featuring devastating and therapeutically challenging neurological abnormalities. However, there is a lack of specific neural progenitor cell models for TSC. Here, the pathology of TSC was studied using primitive neural stem cells (pNSCs) from a patient presenting a c.1444-2A&gt;C mutation in <italic>TSC2</italic>. We found that <italic>TSC2</italic> pNSCs had higher proliferative activity and increased PAX6 expression compared with those of control pNSCs. Neurons differentiated from <italic>TSC2</italic> pNSCs showed enlargement of the soma, perturbed neurite outgrowth, and abnormal connections among cells. <italic>TSC2</italic> astrocytes had increased saturation density and higher proliferative activity. Moreover, the activity of the mTOR pathway was enhanced in pNSCs and induced in neurons and astrocytes. Thus, our results suggested that <italic>TSC2</italic> heterozygosity caused neurological malformations in pNSCs, indicating that its heterozygosity might be sufficient for the development of neurological abnormalities in patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by hamartomas in multiple organs with an incidence of approximately 1 in 6,000 at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Orlova and Crino, 2010</xref>). It is caused by mutations in either <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic>, which encode the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kandt et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">van Slegtenhorst et al., 1997</xref>). Hamartin and tuberin bind to each other to form a heterodimer that can inhibit the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Long et al., 2005</xref>). Despite reports implying that a second-hit mutation is sufficient for the development of TSC, loss of heterozygosity is difficult to demonstrate in brain lesions and was observed in only 4% of the cortical tubers and subependymal nodules assayed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Henske et al., 1996</xref>). Further investigation is needed to confirm whether <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> heterozygosity is sufficient for the development of neurological abnormalities.</p>
<p>Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can model the pathology of a specific disease, represent a promising resource for studying disease mechanisms, screening for novel drug compounds, and developing new therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ebert et al., 2009</xref>). The generation of expandable primitive neural stem cells (pNSCs) from iPSCs and their further differentiation into neuron and astrocyte lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yan et al., 2013</xref>) enables modeling of human neurological diseases at the cellular level.</p>
<p>During the last decade, it was demonstrated that a <italic>TSC1</italic> defect in embryonic neural progenitor cells caused CNS malformations similar to those observed in patients with TSC by using <italic>TSC1</italic><sup>Emx1−Cre</sup> conditional knockout animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Carson et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the isolation and molecular characterization of TSC-specific pNSCs would provide a powerful model for studying the abnormal neural development that occurs in TSC and the potential underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that forms two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and stimulates protein translation by activating downstream targets, including eIF4E/4E-binding protein and p70S6 kinase/ribosomal S6 protein. mTOR regulates neuronal proliferation, survival, growth, and function, which are critical for development, and deregulation of mTOR at any stage of development can have deleterious consequences. Cell populations expressing hyperactive mTOR show many structural abnormalities that support recurrent circuit formation, including somatic and dendritic hypertrophy, aberrant basal dendrites, and axon-tract enlargement. At the functional level, mTOR hyperactivation is commonly but not always associated with enhanced synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lasarge and Danzer, 2014</xref>). The mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus (an analog of rapamycin) is now recommended for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipoma in tuberous sclerosis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the development and pathologies of TSC is not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this study, we assessed the potential of iPSCs obtained from the peripheral blood of a proband of a TSC pedigree who presented with neurological abnormalities to develop a cellular model of <italic>TSC2</italic> deficiency. pNSCs, neurons, and astrocytes were differentiated from the iPSCs to study the cellular pathology and underlying mechanisms of TSC.</p>

<title>Clinical Characteristics of the Family</title>
<p>The patient was a 2-year-old boy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A) who was diagnosed with TSC when he was examined for epilepsy. He also had minor intellectual disability, facial angiofibroma, white macules, and, interestingly, an occipital patch of poliosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B). The cortical tubers and subependymal nodules were visible on a brain MRI scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>C). Except for his younger aunt, who died of epilepsy, his mother, elder aunt, and grandfather presented nearly normal intelligence and no epilepsy, but presented with facial angiofibroma, white macules, ungual fibroma, or a shagreen patch on the skin. His grandfather also presented with a kidney angiomyolipoma. An MRI scan of the brain of his elder aunt also showed subependymal nodules. A c.1444-2A&gt;C mutation in the <italic>TSC2</italic> gene (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0010" xlink:href="ncbi-n:NM_000548.4">NM_000548.4</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>D), which is predicted to cause a splicing error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kwiatkowski et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tyburczy et al., 2014</xref>), was detected in all family members by <italic>TSC1</italic>/<italic>TSC2</italic> gene mutation analysis.</p>

<title>Generation of iPSC Lines from the TSC Patient's Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells</title>
<p>The protocol used to obtain iPSCs from the patient's and unaffected control's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>A. Human embryonic stem cell-like colonies were picked on day 16 after transduction and passaged manually. The iPSC lines showed the typical morphology of human embryonic stem cells in feeder-free conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>B). These lines expressed pluripotency marker proteins including OCT4, SOX2, SSEA4, and TRA-1-81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S1</xref>A). During in vitro differentiation, the clones could produce three embryonic germ layers (i.e., the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) as revealed by the expression of AFP, SMA, and NESTIN, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S1</xref>B). The in vivo differentiation ability of these derived iPSC lines was assessed by teratoma formation assay. Teratoma-containing cells derived from the three embryonic germ layers were observed in non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S1</xref>C). The TSC iPSCs maintained normal karyotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S1</xref>D). <italic>TSC1</italic>/<italic>TSC2</italic> mutation analysis of the iPSCs derived from the TSC patient and an unaffected control showed that the TSC iPSCs had a c.1444-2A&gt;C mutation in the <italic>TSC2</italic> gene, while unaffected iPSCs did not have any detectable mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>A). Moreover, pS6 expression was substantially higher in TSC iPSCs than in the unaffected controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S3</xref>). Three iPSC lines from the TSC patient (TSC) and three iPSC lines generated from two sex-matched unaffected controls (CTL) (one of the unaffected control iPSC lines was a kind gift from Prof. Sun of The Third Hospital of Guang Zhou Medical University) were selected for further experiments on neural differentiation.</p>

<sec id="sec2.3">
<title>Derivation of pNSCs from iPSCs</title>
<p>Previous studies suggested that TSC tubers may arise from <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> deficiency in neural progenitor cells. To investigate the effects of <italic>TSC2</italic> deficiency in neural progenitor cells, TSC pNSCs were generated from TSC iPSCs and compared with unaffected control pNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>A). Cells from the second passage were dissociated and plated for neural stem cell (NSC) marker immunostaining. Most of the cells expressed NSC markers, including NESTIN, SOX1, and SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>B). These results were confirmed by flow cytometry. The vast majority of the cells expressed SOX1 and NESTIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D). In contrast with the control cells, TSC pNSCs highly expressed PAX6 (TSC versus unaffected control, 58.01% ± 6.97%; 12.96% ± 5.53%, p = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D). <italic>TSC1</italic>/<italic>TSC2</italic> mutation analysis of the pNSCs derived from the TSC patient and unaffected control showed that the TSC-patient-specific pNSCs had the same <italic>TSC2</italic> mutation as that found in the patient's blood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>A). In addition, variant transcripts amplified by primer sets targeting sequences around the <italic>TSC2</italic> c.1444_2A&gt;C mutation were found in TSC pNSCs compared with control pNSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>B). cDNA sequence chromatograms obtained by Sanger sequencing of <italic>TSC2</italic> exon13F/intron14R showed an mRNA sequence that was lengthened by 122 bp owing to intron retention in the TSC pNSCs compared with that in control pNSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>C). This mutation is predicted to encode a truncated protein (55.4 kDa, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0015" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/">http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/</ext-link>), which should result in reduced levels of the mutant transcript because of a mechanism known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jeganathan et al., 2002</xref>). To test that prediction, TUBERIN expression was detected using antibodies against epitopes of TUBERIN-N and TUBERIN-C. Both TSC pNSCs and control pNSCs expressed normal TUBERIN protein, but its expression was higher in control pNSCs than in TSC pNSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S2</xref>D). The 122-bp extension of the <italic>TSC2</italic> transcript owing to intron retention and the low expression level of TUBERIN protein in TSC pNSCs confirmed that the mutation in the <italic>TSC2</italic> gene directly causes TSC. Therefore, these cells can be used as a model to explore the pathogenesis of TSC.</p>

<sec id="sec2.4">
<title>High Proliferation and Activation of the mTOR Pathway in TSC pNSCs</title>
<p>As previously described, the growth characteristics of wild-type (WT), <italic>TSC2</italic> haploinsufficient, and <italic>TSC2</italic> knockout murine neuroepithelial progenitor cells were similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Onda, 2002</xref>). However, another study demonstrated that <italic>TSC2</italic> haploinsufficient embryonic telencephalic NSCs had a higher rate of self-renewal than the WT and mutant cells did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magri et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, to investigate the effects of <italic>TSC2</italic> deficiency in human pNSCs, CCK8 proliferation assay and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) staining were performed to measure their proliferation rate. Compared with CTL pNSCs, TSC pNSCs presented a higher growth rate (TSC versus control BrdU, 0.58 ± 0.02 versus 0.51 ± 0.02, p = 0.09). Moreover, rapamycin treatment decreased proliferation (TSC versus TSC + rapamcyin BrdU, 0.58 ± 0.02 versus 0.02 ± 0.10, p &lt; 0.001; CTL versus CTL + rapamycin BrdU, 0.51 ± 0.02 versus 0.18 ± 0.02, p &lt; 0.001), indicating that the increase in proliferation might be due to activation of the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>A–4C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S4</xref>). Phosphorylated S6 (pS6) and AKT (pAKT) are established biomarkers for the activation of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways, respectively. Increased expression levels of both pS6 and pAKT were observed (TSC versus CTL pS6, 0.20 ± 0.01 versus 0.11 ± 0.01, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting that both the mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways were activated. Moreover, phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) and phosphorylated AKT expression were increased as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>D–4F). There were no changes in AKT and mTOR expression. Rapamycin significantly decreased the expression of pS6, pAKT, and p-mTOR, which is consistent with previous findings in TSC tubers.</p>

<sec id="sec2.5">
<title>Morphological Effects of TSC2 Haploinsufficiency</title>
<p>Previous studies demonstrated that the TSC mTOR pathway regulates the growth and synaptic functions of neurons in mice and rats, which may partially contribute to the pathogenesis of TSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tavazoie et al., 2005</xref>). To demonstrate the effect of <italic>TSC2</italic> deficiency in human neurons, pNSCs were induced to differentiate into neurons, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). The vast majority of neurons expressed the neuronal markers TUJ1 and MAP2 but were devoid of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S5</xref>). Moreover, atypical neuronal morphology was observed, and the soma size was higher in TSC neurons versus control neurons (372.92 ± 19.66 versus 259.04 ± 22.77 μm<sup>2</sup>). The mean single neurite length and neurite length per neuron were significantly reduced in TSC neurons (21.53 ± 0.77 and 282.97 ± 22.42 μm, respectively) compared with those of control neurons (28.53 ± 1.21 and 769.49 ± 126.34 μm, respectively). Neurite width was also decreased in TSC neurons versus control neurons (2.29 ± 0.07 versus 2.60 ± 0.04 μm). The density of attachment points/endpoints increased (4.38 ± 0.13 versus 3.69 ± 0.14), which indicated more complex neurite branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>A–5G). In addition, pS6 expression was substantially higher in TSC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>H). As previously observed in mice and rats, <italic>TSC2</italic> haploinsufficiency in human neurons was sufficient to trigger the enlargement of cell somas and dendritic spines and to increase the expression of pS6.</p>

<sec id="sec2.6">
<title>Proliferation of TSC Astrocytes Differentiated from pNSCs</title>
<p>Although no difference was detected in saturation density between <italic>TSC2</italic> haploinsufficient and WT astrocytes, both <italic>TSC2</italic> knockout fibroblasts and <italic>TSC1</italic> knockout astrocytes formed foci when grown to confluence and exhibited a higher saturation density than did the controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Uhlmann et al., 2002</xref>). To determine whether <italic>TSC2</italic> heterozygosity presented the same growth advantage in human astrocytes, the <italic>TSC2</italic> pNSCs were induced to differentiate into astrocytes. Both differentiated astrocytes expressed GFAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S5</xref>). <italic>TSC2</italic> astrocytes were morphologically indistinguishable from control astrocytes. However, <italic>TSC2</italic> haploinsufficient astrocytes grew continuously after reaching confluency, while control astrocytes did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>A). To examine cell proliferation during differentiation, BrdU staining was conducted at day 7 when the cells reached confluency. <italic>TSC2</italic> astrocytes presented a higher growth rate (TSC versus CTL, 0.35 ± 0.02 versus 0.22 ± 0.02, p &lt; 0.001) and a higher level of pS6 (TSC versus CTL pS6, = 0.23 ± 0.01 versus 0.19 ± 0.01, p = 0.015) than did control astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>TSC is an autosomal genetic disorder attributed to mutations in <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> with complex genotype-phenotype linkage, as in the pedigree observed in our study. TSC neurologic and psychiatric symptoms cause the most significant patient morbidity. Understanding the abnormal brain development that occurs in TSC and the underlying molecular mechanisms may yield therapies for intellectual disability, developmental delay, autism, and seizures in patients with TSC. Previous studies unraveled multi-lineage abnormalities in murine models of TSC. However, <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic><sup>-</sup> knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts and heterozygous murine models failed to recapitulate tissue-specific features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Carson et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, CNS-specific TSC models that are able to reproduce specific features of the disease were generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magri et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, in our study, we chose a proband from a TSC pedigree showing typical neurological abnormalities, <italic>TSC2</italic> heterozygosity, and a lack of response to pharmacotherapies including rapamycin.</p>
<p>During the reprogramming of fibroblasts (data not shown) and PBMCs into iPSCs, iPSCs that carried the TSC defect expanded robustly in culture and were similar to control iPSCs in terms of their morphology and pluripotency. Thus, the generation of iPSCs from a TSC patient's cells provided access to pNSCs and neural cells to further explore the pathogenesis of the disease.</p>
<p>mTOR signaling functions in neural induction. Transcripts associated with mTOR (S6K1) were upregulated during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fathi et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the activation of mTOR upregulates the expression of PAX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Endo et al., 2009</xref>), which is important in various developmental processes in the CNS, including patterning of the neural tube, migration of neurons, and formation of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Curto et al., 2014</xref>). According to our results, the activities of mTORC1 and mTORC2, as assessed by evaluating S6 and AKT phosphorylation, were upregulated in TSC pNSCs. The hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway enhanced the expression of neuroectodermal markers, especially PAX6. Therefore, the mTOR signaling pathway has important functions in the proliferation and differentiation of pNSCs. mTOR includes two structurally and functionally distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Crino, 2011</xref>). Rapamycin can inhibit the activation of mTOR signaling through mTORC1, and it deregulated the proliferation of pNSCs in this study. Considering that <italic>TSC2</italic> deficiency caused cortical malformations early in pNSCs, while rapamycin decreased pNSC proliferation and the activation of the mTOR pathway, a preventive therapy for TSC would need to be administered to progenitor cells before the pNSC stage to reverse the neural and glial pathologies.</p>
<p>The TSC pathway regulates growth and synaptic functions in neurons. Perturbations in neuronal structure and function likely contribute to the pathogenesis and neurological symptoms of TSC in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tavazoie et al., 2005</xref>). The functions of the <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic> genes in mammalian neurons as well as the defects that arise from the hemizygosity of these genes are unknown. Notably, loss of <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> in mature post-mitotic hippocampal neurons in vitro causes enlarged somas, abnormal dendrites, and enhancement of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Loss of a single copy of <italic>TSC1</italic> was sufficient to perturb dendritic spine structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tavazoie et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, neurons differentiated from <italic>TSC2</italic> haploinsufficient pNSCs also presented with an enlarged soma, perturbed neurite outgrowth, complex neurite branching, and abnormal connections among neurons when compared with the WT neurons. Hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway supports recurrent circuit formation via stimulating neuronal changes, including somatic and dendritic hypertrophy, aberrant basal dendrites, and enlargement of axon tracts. In this study, mTOR was activated in neurons. Thus, <italic>TSC2</italic> haploinsufficiency was sufficient to induce changes in neuronal behavior resembling those that occur in TSC in vivo.</p>
<p><italic>TSC</italic> haploinsufficient astrocytes presented a high proliferation rate and an increased saturation density when compared with WT astrocytes. Similarly, the conditional disruption of <italic>TSC1</italic> in astrocytes using a human GFAP-Cre system was shown to produce mice that presented with astrocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Han and Sahin, 2011</xref>). Moreover, the increase in astrocyte proliferation may precede the neuronal abnormalities, resulting in hippocampal neuronal disorganization and seizures. Previous studies indicated that NESTIN-immunoreactive neural cells were less developed than mature astrocytes, raising the possibility that new neurons were generated from these NESTIN-positive progenitors, resulting in hippocampal neuronal disorganization. In addition, recent studies demonstrated that astrocytes could give rise to new neurons in the adult mammalian hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Seri et al., 2001</xref>). In our studies, we observed NESTIN and TUJ1 protein expression in differentiated astrocytes, while the differentiated neurons expressed TUJ1 and NESTIN (data not shown), but not GFAP. Thus, our results partially supported the hypothesis that hippocampal neuronal disorganization in TSC results from the aberrant differentiation of NESTIN-positive immature astrocytes into neurons. Further studies are warranted to confirm our results. In other studies, while both <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic> heterozygous mice exhibited an increased number of astrocytes in vivo, there was no increase in the saturation density of <italic>TSC2</italic> haploinsufficient astrocytes compared with that of WT astrocytes in vitro. In addition, <italic>TSC1</italic> knockout astrocytes and <italic>TSC1</italic> knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts presented a higher saturation density associated with decreased levels of p27<sup>kip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Uhlmann et al., 2002</xref>). The authors suggested that the non-cell-autonomous growth advantage conferred by <italic>TSC</italic> heterozygosity may involve p27<sup>kip1</sup> expression. However, no gross or microscopic evidence of morphological brain abnormalities was detected in the <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> haploinsufficient mice, while our patient presented with tubers in the brain. However, we did not study p27<sup>kip1</sup> expression in our patient's astrocytes. Further experiments on the relationship between <italic>TSC</italic> heterozygosity and brain abnormalities, tuberin/hamartin signaling, and p27<sup>kip1</sup> expression are required.</p>
<p>The current study has some limitations. First, we did not investigate further the link between mTOR hyperactivation and synaptic transmission and plasticity, which might influence neuronal excitability and trigger epileptogenesis. However, a recent study on neurons derived from <italic>TSC2</italic>-deleted pluripotent stem cells demonstrated that heterozygous and homozygous loss of <italic>TSC2</italic> led to altered synaptogenesis and transmission and that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 could ameliorate synaptic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Costa et al., 2016</xref>). Second, only the proband who was carrying <italic>TSC2</italic> gene mutation was compared with the normal control subject in our study. Identifying the possible role of <italic>TSC</italic> mutations in complex genetic and neural network processes pertaining to cell survival, structure, and function will provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of TSC-related neurological symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mayer et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Talos et al., 2008</xref>). Although our results may partially confirm the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the neurological manifestations in TSC, additional efforts must be undertaken to explore these mechanisms further.</p>
<p>In conclusion, abnormal pNSCs, neurons, and astrocytes differentiated from TSC iPSCs partially recapitulated the development of neurological abnormalities as observed in patients with mutations in <italic>TSC2</italic>, suggesting that <italic>TSC1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> haploinsufficiency might be sufficient to contribute to the neuropathology of TSC. Furthermore, these cells provide an unprecedented model for studying the abnormal neural development and the potential underlying mechanisms of TSC in vitro, screening novel drugs for personalized therapies, and potentially complementing/implementing mTOR-directed inhibitory approaches.</p>
