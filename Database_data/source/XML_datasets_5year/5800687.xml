<abstract>
<p>Intellectual disability (ID), one of the most common human developmental disorders, can be caused by genetic mutations in Cullin 4B (Cul4B) and cereblon (CRBN). CRBN is a substrate receptor for the Cul4A/B-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) and can target voltage- and calcium-activated BK channel for ER retention. Here we report that ID-associated CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> mutations abolish the interaction of the BK channel with CRL4, and redirect the BK channel to the SCF<sup>Fbxo7</sup> ubiquitin ligase for proteasomal degradation. Glioma cell lines harbouring CRBN mutations record density-dependent decrease of BK currents, which can be restored by blocking Cullin ubiquitin ligase activity. Importantly, mice with neuron-specific deletion of DDB1 or CRBN express reduced BK protein levels in the brain, and exhibit similar impairment in learning and memory, a deficit that can be partially rescued by activating the BK channel. Our results reveal a competitive targeting of the BK channel by two ubiquitin ligases to achieve exquisite control of its stability, and support changes in neuronal excitability as a common pathogenic mechanism underlying CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>–associated ID.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Our study first demonstrates intellectual disability associated proteins, CRBN and BK channel pore-forming α subunit, are targeted by SCF<sup>Fbxo7</sup> for ubiquitination and proteolysis, which can be further regulated by their binding to DDB1 and the expression of CRL4 complex. We also first find DDB1 or CRBN deletion in mouse brain causes similar spatial cognitive defects. By cellular electrophysiology, human ID-related mutation and genetic mouse model experiments, we confirm the role of this regulatory pathway in controlling BK channel activity and modulating learning and memory.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intellectual disability (ID), formerly known as mental retardation (MR), is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder defined as substantial impairment of cognitive and adaptive functions with a diagnosis of IQ score of less than 70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref001">1</xref>]. ID can occur as an isolated phenomenon or may frequently be accompanied by congenital malformations or other neurological features such as sensory impairment, seizures, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref002">2</xref>]. With an estimated 1% of the world’s population affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref003">3</xref>], ID has become a major social problem and resulted in an enormous economic burden in all countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Many inheritable genetic mutations have been identified in ID patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref008">8</xref>], but the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref009">9</xref>]. <italic>Cul4B</italic> was identified as one of the most frequently mutated genes in X-linked ID families by whole-exon sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref012">12</xref>]. Cul4B shares 80% sequence homology with Cul4A and they are functionally redundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref013">13</xref>]. Cul4A/B functions as a scaffold to bridge the RING finger protein Rbx1/Roc1 and the adaptor protein Damaged DNA Binding protein 1 (DDB1) to form the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, Cul4 RING ligase (CRL4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref014">14</xref>]. CRL4 targets diverse substrates to regulate cell cycle, DNA damage repair, and chromatin functions via substrate receptors called DDB1 and Cul4 associated factors (DCAFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Cereblon (CRBN), a DCAF protein, can recruit two ion channels to CRL4, the ClC-1 chloride channel for turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref017">17</xref>] and the BK channel for trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref018">18</xref>]. Based on the study designed to overexpress CRBN and BK channel in heterologous cells, wild-type (WT) CRBN can restrict excessive BK channel in ER for a balance of BK activity in cell membrane to prevent induced epileptogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref018">18</xref>]. However, whether genetic inactivation of CRBN can influence endogenous BK channel activity need further clearly addressed.</p>
<p>Mutations in both CRBN and BK channel have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ID. BK channel regulates the general excitability of neurons and the transmitter release at presynaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref019">19</xref>]. Some ID patients with ASD and epilepsy were found to harbor a loss-of-function mutation in α subunit (<italic>SLO1</italic>) of BK channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref020">20</xref>]. Inactivation of BK channel by transcriptional silencing of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene causes the most common inheritable ID, known as Fragile X syndrome (FXS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref022">22</xref>]. Autosomal recessive CRBN mutations have also been identified in ID patients in two unrelated families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref024">24</xref>]. Genetic deletion of <italic>Slo1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref025">25</xref>] or <italic>Crbn</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref026">26</xref>] in mouse brain leads to impaired spatial learning or conditioned fear memory, respectively. Given our recent finding that CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> ubiquitinates Slo1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref018">18</xref>], these human and animal studies suggest that the ubiquitination of BK channel may play an important role in learning and memory.</p>
<p>Here using DDB1 and CRBN mutant mouse strains, we found similar cognitive defects in them and by surprise found that the total BK channel level is significantly reduced in these mutant mice brains. We further identified the ID-associated CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> mutations redirect both CRBN and BK channel to another new Cullin E3 ligase, SCF<sup>Fbxo7</sup>, for ubiquitination and turnover. We finally demonstrated that BK channel activity is critical for restoring the learning and memory defects observed in CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>-deficient mice. Thus, our study offers a new regulatory point to control BK channel activity via two distinct ubiquitin ligase, which can be targeted for mitigating intellectual disability.</p>

<p>To investigate the role of CRL4 in cognitive function, we generated the <italic>Ddb1</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Camk2α-Cre</italic> mouse strain, in which DDB1 is conditionally deleted in postnatal neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref018">18</xref>].

<p>To investigate spatial learning and memory, we performed the Barnes maze and Morris water maze tests on these animals.

<title>CRBN deletion causes similar cognitive defects as well as DDB1 deletion</title>
<p>CRBN is a substrate receptor for CRL4 and its mutations are found in ID patients.

We generated whole-brain CRBN KO mutant <italic>Crbn</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice and verified this behavioral defect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), as well as the defect in DDB1 mutant mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Like the DDB1 mutant mice, <italic>Crbn</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice spent more time reaching the platform and showed less improvement over the trials during a 5-day training period in the Morris water maze test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

<title>ID-associated CRBN mutants fail to bind DDB1</title>
<p>A nonsense mutation in CRBN with a premature stop at amino acid 419, CRBN<sup>R419X</sup>, was identified in a large kindred to cause non-syndromic ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref023">23</xref>]. Recently, another missense variant in the CRBN, CRBN<sup>C391R</sup>, was identified in five individuals with severe ID from a consanguineous family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref024">24</xref>]. By immunoprecipitaion assays, we found that both CRBN<sup>R419X</sup> and CRBN<sup>C391R</sup> associated very weakly with DDB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Likewise, CRBN<sup>D249Y</sup>, a mutation located in close proximity to the DDB1 binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref029">29</xref>] and found in the lenalidomide-resistant ANBL-6 MM cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref030">30</xref>], completely abolished its binding to DDB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). A further truncation analysis revealed that CRBN truncations (residues 1–317 and 1–370) exhibited a similar DDB1-binding defect to CRBN<sup>R419X</sup>, while a different truncation (residues 1–429) showed binding to DDB1 as strong as the full length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). This result suggests that loss of a 10 amino segment (419–429) in the DDB1 C-terminus might adversely affect the CRBN domain structure critical for DDB1 interaction, as would be predicted by the structure of the human CRBN-DDB1-lenalidomide complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref029">29</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>DDB1-binding-defective CRBN is targeted by SCF<sup>Fbxo7</sup> for degradation</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism underlying the decreased CRBN level caused by DDB1 deletion, we performed protein stability assays using the DDB1-binding-defective CRBN mutants. Compared with the WT protein, these mutant CRBN protein levels were decreased but can be restored by treating the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). The cycloheximide (CHX) chasing assays confirmed a reduction of the protein stability of these CRBN mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s003">S3C and S3D Fig</xref>). These results suggest that the mutant proteins are targeted by proteasomal degradation. The reduced stability of CRBN<sup>R419X</sup> was also previously reported, but the CRL4 ligase was proposed to account for its turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref031">31</xref>]. Since mutant CRBN fails to bind CRL4 and the protein level can also be restored by MLN4924, a neddylation inhibitor of all Cullin ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s003">S3E Fig</xref>), we hypothesized that another Cullin family ubiquitin ligase other than CRL4 might target these mutants for degradation. Out of the seven human Cullins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref032">32</xref>], Cul1 was found to interact with CRBN, though much more weakly compared to Cul4, when overexpressed in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s003">S3F Fig</xref>). The CRBN-Cul1 interaction was greatly enhanced when CRBN was abolished of its interaction with DDB1 or stabilized by MG132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s003">S3G Fig</xref>). Cul1 forms the SCF complex (also called CRL1) with Skp1 and Rbx1 to modify a large variety of substrates using various F-box adaptor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref033">33</xref>]. It was reported that lenalidomide can increase CRBN stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref034">34</xref>] and also down-regulate the expression of a F-box protein Fbxo7, even to a greater extent than its down-regulation on IKZF1 and IKZF3 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref035">35</xref>]. We found that Fbxo7 bound to the CRBN mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s003">S3H Fig</xref>) and mediated the interaction of CRBN<sup>R419X</sup> with Cul1 and Skp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Overexpression of both Fbxo7 and Skp1 greatly enhanced the interaction between CRBN<sup>R419X</sup> and Cul1, and the ubiquitination level of CRBN<sup>R419X</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g003">Fig 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s003">S3I and S3J Fig</xref>). Conversely, knockdown of Cul1 decreased the ubiquitination level of CRBN<sup>R419X</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), and increased the steady-state level of CRBN<sup>R419X</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Taken together, we have identified a distinct E3 ligase that is not active on CRBN unless CRBN fails to bind DDB1. Considering DDB1 functions as a critical linker for CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase, these DDB1-binding defects in CRBN ID-associated mutations can disrupt their protein stability and the normal E3 function of CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> as well as DDB1 deletion. However, the question remains how DDB1 deletion or these CRBN mutations cause learning and memory defect.</p>

<title>Inactivation of CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> destabilizes the BK channel</title>
<p>Loss of the BK channel α subunit (Slo1) was reported to cause impairment in spatial cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref025">25</xref>]. Considering Slo1 is a direct substrate of CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>, we examined the Slo1 level in DDB1 or CRBN deficient mouse brain lysates. Slo1 protein abundance was statistically reduced in mouse brain with either DDB1 or CRBN depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). Consistent with the animal study, knockdown of DDB1 or Cul4A/4B expression in 293T cells dramatically reduced the abundance of exogenously expressed Slo1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). To further confirm the reduction by endogenous Slo1, we checked the expression of endogenous Slo1 in a series of cell lines, using glioma cells transfected with sgRNA for Slo1 as a negative control. As expected, Slo1 is not expressed in 293T and MM1S cells, but highly expressed in glioma cells such as U87mG and LN229 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). Knockdown of DDB1 led to reduced endogenous CRBN and Slo1 protein abundance in both U87mG and LN229 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Therefore, like CRBN, the steady-state level of Slo1 is also maintained by an intact CRL4 complex in cells and mouse brain.</p>

<p>To determine the role of CRBN and its ID-associated mutations in Slo1 regulation, we generated <italic>CRBN</italic> KO 293T cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s004">S4E Fig</xref>). Deletion of CRBN resulted in the dissociation of Slo1 from binding to CRL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and a profound decrease of the half-life of the exogenously expressed Slo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Re-introducing WT CRBN but not mutant CRBN<sup>R419X</sup> in these KO cells restored both the binding to CRL4 and the half-life of Slo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g004">Fig 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007165.s004">S4F Fig</xref>).

The BK currents were significantly decreased in CRBN-depleted cells compared to isogenic WT cells, and the difference was largely offset by treating the mutant cells with MLN4924 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), likely as a result from an increased expression of Slo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g005">Fig 5G</xref>).

<title>Dual ubiquitination of BK channel under physiological and pathological conditions</title>
<p>In a physiological context, BK channel is recruited by CRBN to the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitination and retention in the ER compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref018">18</xref>]. When this post-translational modification is disrupted in ID patients with CRBN mutations, BK channel is rerouted to an unrelated SCF<sup>Fbxo7</sup> ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitination and, instead of ER retention, proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007165.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). The differential targeting under normal and pathological conditions would ensure the limited distribution of the BK channel in the cell surface and thus the exquisite control of its activities and neuronal excitability. The dual ubiquitination of the same substrate is not an unusual mechanism for regulation of protein stability. For example, Myc oncoprotein can be ubiquitinated by the SCF<sup>β-TrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase to prevent its turnover by SCF<sup>Fbw7</sup>-mediated ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref042">42</xref>]. Cand1 can promote exchange of Fbw7 for β-TrCP in SCF complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref043">43</xref>], further modulating the cellular repertoire of SCF complex for control of Myc stability and cell proliferation. While many details on the differential targeting still need working out, it is clear that critical factors including BK channel and Myc are subjected to highly orchestrated regulation even just at the level of post-translational modification.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>SCF<sup>Fbxo7</sup> targets BK channel pore subunit for degradation</title>
<p>BK channel is composed of four α subunits (Slo1), which form the ion channel pore, and auxiliary subunits, including four regulatory β (β1–4) subunits that are expressed in various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref019">19</xref>]. The β1 subunit, primarily distributed in smooth muscle cells, controls cell surface trafficking by distinct domains of N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref044">44</xref>]. The β1 subunit is ubiquitinated for proteolysis in diabetes-like conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref045">45</xref>], which may weaken its ability to dynamically assemble with Slo1 at the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref046">46</xref>]. However, ubiquitination of BKβ1 alone may not necessarily cause a reduced level of Slo1, especially in brain cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref047">47</xref>]. Here we report for the first time that the protein level of the pore-forming Slo1 was directly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and that this post-translational destruction of Slo1 decreases BK current. It will be interesting to examine the effects and conditions of SCF<sup>Fbxo7</sup>-mediated ubiquitination and turnover of Slo1 in the alteration of the action potential (AP) shape and duration in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref048">48</xref>] as well as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref049">49</xref>].</p>

<title>CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> mutations cause ID by altering BK channel activity</title>
<p>ID is a clinically diverse disorder with heterogeneous genetic inheritance. We first prove that DDB1 is a critical regulator in learning and memory using mouse model. DDB1 and CRBN deletion in mouse brain can cause similar ID-like phenotypes. Then we provide mechanistic insight into ID pathogenesis in patients with CRBN mutations by demonstrating that they are DDB1-binding defective, which makes them unstable due to SCF<sup>Fbxo7</sup>-mediated degradation. At last, we identify that the protein levels and activities of the BK channel are dysregulated by mutant CRBN. Moreover, a BK channel opener can significantly improve the learning and memory impairment in CRBN mutant mice. Therefore, BK channel may be one of the several substrates of CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> that are disrupted by changes in protein ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref052">52</xref>], due to CRBN or Cul4B ID mutations. However, whether enhancing BK level in brain is efficient and sufficient to rescue ID-like phenotypes in CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> deficient mice, still remains to be further elucidated. Whether low BK channel activity is found in ID patients, particularly those with CRBN or Cul4B mutations, still needs in-depth clinical investigation. Since there is currently no effective treatment for ID, targeting BK channel activity might provide a potential therapeutic intervention for this neurological disorder.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Animals were bred in a pathogen-free and temperature-controlled barrier facility with a 12-h-light/dark cycle and free access to food and water. All mice were bred on a mixed 129×C57BL/6J background. Generation and characterization of <italic>Ddb1</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> and <italic>Ddb1</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Camk2α-Cre</italic> mice have been described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref027">27</xref>]. <italic>Crbn</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1007165.ref026">26</xref>] were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and crossed with <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> strains. The efficiency and specificity of CRBN deletion in the brain was confirmed by PCR (forward primer: 5’-CAG TCA GAT GGG TAA GGA GCA-3’; reverse primer: 5’-AAG CAG CTC CGT AAT GCT G-3’) and further confirmed by Western blotting. The homozygous KO mouse would generate a PCR product of 467 bp while the heterozygous and WT mouse had a 387 bp PCR product.</p>

The apparatus was a rectangular box made of Plexiglas divided by a partition into two environments. One compartment (14.5×27×26.5 cm) was dark (8–16 lux) and the other compartment (28.5×27×26.5 cm) was highly illuminated (400–600 lux) by a 60 W light source located above it. The compartments were connected by an opening (7.5×7.5 cm) located at floor level in the center of the partition. Mice were placed in the dark compartment to start the five minutes test. The time spent in the light compartment was recorded. Duration in the light compartment was used as indicator of anxiety-like behavior.</p>

<title>Vision testing</title>
<p>The visual cliff test provided a measure of visual acuity by evaluating the ability of <italic>Ddb1</italic><sup><italic>F/+</italic></sup><italic>;Camk2α-Cre</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 3 males and 2 females, 5 month) and <italic>Ddb1</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Camk2α-Cre</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 3 males and 2 females, 5 month) mice to see a drop-off at the edge of a horizontal surface. In this apparatus, there was the visual appearance of a cliff but in fact the Plexiglas provided a solid horizontal surface. If the animal saw the cliff, it would step down onto the “safe” side (the horizontal checkered surface) in most trials. A blind animal would just as often step down onto the “negative” side (the vertical appearing surface), i.e. make 50% correct and 50% incorrect choices. Each mouse was placed onto the center ridge, and the side onto which the animal stepped down was recorded. Six consecutive trials were used for each mouse and the percent of correct choices was calculated for each mouse.</p>

Individual animal was allowed to explore for 5 minutes in the present of objects. After two such trials (each separated by 1 minute in a holding cage), the mouse was tested by object novelty recognition test in which a novel object (C) replaced one of the familiar objects (B). All objects and the area were thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove odors. Behavior was video recorded and scored for contacts (touching with nose or nose pointing at object within 4 cm of object).</p>

Testing was performed in the absence of aversive stimulus. Conditioned animals, when exposed to the conditioned stimuli, were tended to refrain from all but respiratory movements by freezing. Freezing responses could be triggered by exposure to context in which the shock was received (context test) or conditioned stimulus (CS+ test). Conditioning took place in freeze monitor chambers housed in sound-proof boxes. The conditioning chambers (26×26×17 cm) were made of Plexiglas with speakers and lights mounted on two opposite walls. The chambers were installed with a shockable grid floor. On day 1, mice were placed in the conditioning chamber for five minutes in order to habituate them to the apparatus. On day 2, mice were exposed to the context and conditioned stimulus (30 seconds, 3000 Hz, 80 dB sound) in association with foot shock (0.70 mA, 2 second, scrambled current). Specifically, mouse received two shock exposures, both in the last 2 seconds of a 30 second tone exposure, during a 5.5-minute session. On day 3, contextual conditioning (as determined by freezing behavior) was measured in a 5-minute test in the chamber where the mice were trained (context test). On day 4, the mice were tested for cued conditioning (CS+ test). The mice were placed in a novel context for 3 minutes, after which they were exposed to the conditioned stimulus (tone) for 3 minutes. For this test, the chamber was disguised with new walls (black opaque plastic creating a triangular-shaped compartment in contrast to a clear plastic square compartment), a new floor (black opaque plastic in contrast to metal grid) and a novel odor (drop of orange extract under the floor). Freezing behavior, i.e. the absence of all voluntary movements except breathing, was measured in all sessions by a validated computer-controlled recording of photocell beam interruptions.</p>

<title>Barnes maze</title>
<p>The Barnes maze apparatus is an opaque Plexiglas disc 75 cm in diameter elevated 58 cm above floor by a tripod. Twenty holes, 5 cm in diameter, were located 5 cm from the perimeter and a black Plexiglas escape box (19×8 ×7 cm) was placed under one of the holes. Distinct spatial cues were located all around the maze and kept constant throughout the study. A training session was performed by placing <italic>Ddb1</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 11, 7 males and 4 females, 7–10 month) and <italic>Ddb1</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup><italic>;Camk2α-Cre</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 10, 5 of either sex, 7–10 month) mice in the escape box for one minute in the first day. Testing session started after the habituation period. At the beginning of each session, the mouse was placed in the middle of the maze in a 10 cm high cylindrical black start chamber. After 10 seconds the start chamber was removed to free mouse exploring maze with a buzzer (80 dB) and a light (400 lux) turning on. The session ended when mouse entered the escape tunnel or after 3 min elapse. When mouse entered the escape tunnel, buzzer was turned off and mouse was allowed to remain in the dark for one minute. If the mouse failed to enter the tunnel by itself it was gently put in the escape box for one minute. The hole to place underneath tunnel was fixed for the same mouse but randomly determined. Mice were tested once a day in a 9 days’ acquisition portion with video typing. Latency to escape, the number of errors made and strategies chosen per session were measured from record. Errors are defined as nose pokes and head deflections over any hole that does not have tunnel. Strategies were determined by examining each mouse's daily session and classifying it as either “Random”—localized hole searches separated by crossings through the center of the maze (no systematic search pattern), “Sequential”—systematic hole searches (every hole or every other hole) in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, “Random/Sequential”—systematic hole searches separated by crossings through the center of the maze, or “Spatial”—reaching the escape tunnel directly with both error and distance (number of holes between the first hole visited and the escape tunnel) scores of less than or equal to 3. For the 10th test (probe test), escape tunnel was removed and mouse was allowed to freely explore the maze for 3 minutes. The time spent in each quadrant was determined and the time spent in the target quadrant (the one originally containing the escape box) was compared with that in the other three quadrants.</p>

<title>Morris water maze</title>
<p>Morris water maze was comprised of a circular tank (150 cm diameter, 50 cm height) with 34 cm deep warm milky water (22±1°C), a platform submerged 1 cm below the water surface, a video camera and a computer. During the training phase, mice were placed facing the wall of the pool and permitted to swim for 60 or 90 seconds to locate the platform. If the mice failed, they were placed in the platform for 10 seconds to learn the location. 3–4 trials with different starting positions per day were performed for each mouse with recording of time to locate the platform. After training, test was repeated in the pool where the platform was removed on the probe day. Test parameters were listed as follows (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1007165.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec035">
<title>Lentivirual vector</title>
<p>WT and R419X <italic>CRBN</italic> sequences were subcloned into pcDNA3-YFP vector. Then YFP-CRBN (WT and R419X) sequences were subcloned into pLVX-IRES-Neo vectors (Clontech). The cloned pLVX vectors were transfected into 293FT cells along with psPAX2 and pVSVg using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for virus packaging. The viral supernatant was collected 72 hours later and condensed by ultra-centrifugation at 25,000 rpm at 4°C for 2 hours. <italic>CRBN</italic> KO U87mG cells were treated with 6 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) during the viral infection (MOI = 0.5). Two day after infection, cells were selected with 500 μg/mL G418 for 2 weeks. Stable cells were transferred into 96-well plates with limiting dilution. Single clones were expanded and collected for immunoblot analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec036">
<title>Q-PCR</title>
<p>RNA was extracted with trizol regent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcripted using PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara, RR036A). Relative expression level of Slo1 transcripts was determined by real time RT-PCR using SYBR Green (Life Technology) with GAPDH as internal control. Primers are listed below: F: GGCAGCAGTCTTAGAATGAGTAG; R: AAAGCCCACCACATGCGTT.</p>

<title>Patch clamping</title>
<p>Signals were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Conventional whole-cell and inside-out configurations of the patch-clamp technique were used in the electrophysiological study. Records were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. Patch electrodes were pulled from a horizontal micropipette puller (P-1000, Sutter Instruments) and flame polished to final tip resistance of 4–6 MΩ when filled with internal solutions. The pipette solution (130 mM potassium aspartate (Sigma-Aldrich), 10mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM EGTA at pH 7.3 (adjusted with KOH)) and bath solution contained (140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose at pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH)) were used for whole-cell recordings. For single-channel recordings, the pipette solution (extracellular) contained 120 mM KCl, 20 mM KOH, 11 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH), and the bath solution (intracellular) contained 120 mM KCl, 20 mM KOH, 11 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (22± 1°C). Data acquisition and analysis were carried out using pClamp 10.2 (Axon Instruments). Records were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. The whole-cell currents were elicited from a 0 mV holding potential to test potentials from −100 to +100mV in 10 mV increments (see inset). The BK currents were paxalline-subtracted currents and normalized to membrane capacitance. Single-channel events were analyzed by pclampfit 10.2 (single-channel search-in-analyze function). NPo, the product of the number of channels and open probability, was used to measure channel activity within a patch. In total, 50% threshold cross-method was used to determine valid channel openings.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Results were presented as mean±standard error of mean (SEM). Results for different groups were compared by the two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test with Welch’s correction. Results for Barnes maze, locomotor activity test and training days of Morris water maze were performed with two-way repeated-measures ANOVA tests. Asterisks in the Figures were used to indicate statistically significant differences (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01;***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
