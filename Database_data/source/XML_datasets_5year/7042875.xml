<title>Design, Setting, and Participants</title>
<p>This prospective cohort study examined genome-wide microarrays performed on blood-derived DNA to detect germline CNVs from September 1, 2005, through January 3, 2018. Multicenter accrual occurred from community and academic medical centers throughout North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. Participants included patients with <italic>PTEN</italic> hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) (n = 481), molecularly defined as carrying germline pathogenic <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations.

<title>Results</title>
<p>The study included 481 patients with PHTS (mean [SD] age, 33.2 [21.6] years; 268 female [55.7%]). The analytic series consisted of 309 patients with PHTS and genetically determined European ancestry. Patients were divided into 3 phenotypic groups, excluding family members within each group. These include 110 patients with ASD/developmental delay, 194 without ASD/developmental delay, and 121 with cancer (of whom 116 were in the no ASD/developmental delay group). Genome-wide evaluation of autosomal CNVs indicated an increased CNV burden, particularly duplications in genic regions, in patients with ASD/developmental delay compared with those without ASD/developmental delay (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4; <italic>P</italic> = .03) and those with cancer (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-4.6; <italic>P</italic> = .003). Eleven of the 110 patients (10.0%) with ASD/developmental delay carried pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, compared with 5 of 194 (2.6%) without ASD/developmental delay (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.4-13.7; <italic>P</italic> = .008) and 2 of 121 (1.7%) with cancer (OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 1.6-44.5; <italic>P</italic> = .007). Evidence of an association between pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic CNVs and PHTS with ASD/developmental delay was further supported in a validation series of 69 patients with PHTS of genetically determined non-European ancestry.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The triumph of using genetics in precision medicine is the ability to stratify individuals at very high risk of disease and thereby enact specific gene-informed medical management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r2">2</xref></sup> In the case of heritable disease, genetics also allow testing of family members to determine with 100% accuracy whether they are at risk of disease. However, for any single individual carrying a mutation, we can estimate risk by probabilities but not with certainty. For example, a germline mutation in gene X may give an 80% lifetime risk of disease Y, but for the single patient with that germline mutation, the risk of developing disease Y will be 100% or 0%. Searching for genomic modifiers of heritable disease risk at the individual level in humans has proven challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r3">3</xref></sup> This makes estimation of clinical outcomes difficult, especially for phenotypically variable disorders. As such, why a mutation in 1 particular gene predisposes to disparate clinical outcomes, including in patients with identical mutations, remains poorly understood.</p>
<p><italic>PTEN</italic> germline mutations are among the most common causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), accounting for approximately 2% to 5% of cases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r5">5</xref></sup> yet originally identified in a subset of relatively rare syndromes predisposing to breast, thyroid, and other cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r6">6</xref></sup> The <italic>PTEN</italic>-related ASD-cancer phenotypic dichotomy and inability to preemptively estimate disease outcomes pose a challenge for more timely and precise clinical management. The concept of <italic>PTEN</italic> hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS [OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.omim.org/entry/158350">158350</ext-link>]) was proposed to encompass any clinical disorder with germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation on molecular genetic testing, regardless of phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r8">8</xref></sup> Based on this broad clinical spectrum and unified genetic etiology, PHTS serves as a useful disease model to identify modifiers of variable heritable disease risk at the individual level.</p>
<p>Copy number variation (CNV), a common type of structural variation in the human genome, is considered an important contributor to nonsyndromic idiopathic ASD and sporadic cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r11">11</xref></sup> Copy number variations have also been associated with complex disorders, particularly those involving developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, and/or congenital anomalies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r14">14</xref></sup> As such, the purpose of this study was to address the hypothesis that specific CNV associations in patients carrying germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations are associated with development of specific clinical phenotypes at an individual level. Thus, we performed a genome-wide investigation of whether pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic CNVs may be associated with particular clinical outcomes in patients with germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>A total of 6782 patients were prospectively accrued from September 1, 2005, through January 3, 2018, and provided informed written consent to participate. This prospective cohort study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic institutional review board. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/">STROBE</ext-link>) reporting guideline for cohort studies.</p>
<p> Inclusion criteria for enrollment included meeting at least the relaxed International Cowden Consortium operational diagnostic criteria, meaning full diagnostic criteria minus 1 feature, termed <italic>Cowdenlike syndrome</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r15">15</xref></sup>; having macrocephaly plus neurodevelopmental disorders (eg, ASD, developmental delay [DD], mental retardation) and/or penile freckling; or the presence of a known pathogenic germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation (patients referred to the <italic>PTEN</italic> Multidisciplinary Clinic at the Cleveland Clinic).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r17">17</xref></sup> These patients were broadly recruited from community and academic medical centers throughout North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as noted by Tan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r17">17</xref></sup> After informed consent was obtained, checklists to document the presence or absence of specific features were completed by specialist genetic counselors or physicians concurrently with withdrawal of blood specimen (team led by C.E., medical director, PTEN/Cowden Multidisciplinary Clinic, Center for Personalized Genetic Healthcare, Genomic Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio). Specialist genetics staff reviewed all checklists and corresponded with the enrolling center if necessary to obtain further primary documentation of medical records and, for cancer, pathology reports, for phenotype confirmation with patient consent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r16">16</xref></sup> For each consenting patient, we reviewed medical records, including pedigrees, clinical genetic testing reports, and clinical notes associated with genetics evaluations, ASD <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) criteria, and/or genetic counseling visits, where applicable. We followed up this cohort prospectively for development of phenotypic features.</p>

<title><italic>PTEN</italic> Mutation and Deletion Analysis</title>
<p>All eligible patients underwent germline <italic>PTEN</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_000314.8">NM_000314.8</ext-link>) mutation and deletion analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples using standard protocols. Mutation analysis was standardly performed, with a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, high-resolution melting curve analysis (Idaho Technology), and direct Sanger sequencing (ABI 3730xl; Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r18">18</xref></sup> Deletion analysis using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay was performed with the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification kit (P158; MRC-Holland) according to manufacturer protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r18">18</xref></sup> All patients underwent polymerase chain reaction–based Sanger sequencing of the <italic>PTEN</italic> promoter region as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r18">18</xref></sup> Only cases with pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations were included in the analytic sample.

<title>Genotyping, CNV Calling, and Quality Control</title>
<p>We evaluated DNA quality (A260/A280) using spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantity using a double-stranded DNA high-sensitivity assay kit (Qubit; Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA samples were all genotyped on a commercially available genotyping array (Infinium Global Screening Array-24, version 1.0; Illumina) at the Broad Institute Genomic Services, Cambridge, Massachusetts. We used a total of 642 824 markers for quality control. To correct for population stratification, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype quality control was performed. We excluded samples with a call rate of less than 0.91 or with discordant sex. We focused on autosomal CNVs owing to higher fidelity of CNV calling compared with sex chromosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r22">22</xref></sup> To perform principal component analysis to assess population stratification, we filtered autosomal SNPs with low genotyping rates (&gt;0.98) and deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .001) before pruning SNPs for linkage disequilibrium using default parameters in PLINK, version 1.927 (--indep-pairwise 200 100 0.2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r23">23</xref></sup> We used the PennCNV algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r24">24</xref></sup> to generate GC DNA nucleotide wave-adjusted log R ratio intensity files and to call CNVs in all samples. A custom population B-allele frequency file was generated before CNV calling. We merged adjacent CNV calls if the number of intervening markers was less than 20% of the total number than when both segments were combined. Next, we performed intensity-based quality control to exclude samples with low quality based on waviness factor, log R ratio SD, and B-allele frequency drift. These thresholds were calculated by taking the median plus 3 SD to identify outliers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r25">25</xref></sup> After intensity-based quality control, all samples had a log R ratio SD of less than 0.25, an absolute waviness factor of less than 0.04, and a B-allele frequency drift of less than 0.007. We excluded samples with an excessively high CNV load (&gt;100) as determined empirically by visual inspection of CNV distribution across a combined set of samples. None of the PHTS samples had a CNV load above this threshold (with a maximum of 16 CNVs detected in 1 patient). Finally, we excluded CNVs spanning less than 20 markers, CNVs of less than 20 Kb in length, CNVs with SNP density (number of markers/CNV length) of less than 0.0001, and/or CNVs with greater than 50% of total length overlapping artifactual regions in SNP-based CNV calling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r27">27</xref></sup> The final data set consisted of 309 patients of genotype-determined European ancestry with at least 1 CNV call (eFigure 1 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190764-1-s">Supplement</xref>).</p>

<title>Genome-wide CNV Burden Analysis</title>
<p>We measured CNV burden among patients with PHTS and ASD and/or developmental delay (ASD/DD group), those without ASD or developmental delay (no ASD/DD group), and those with cancer. Genome-wide burden was also analyzed for only rare CNVs (excluding CNVs overlapping &gt;80% of regions known to be recurrent in the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r28">28</xref></sup>). Duplications and deletions were analyzed in combination as well as separately.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study evaluated the association of CNVs with clinical outcomes, specifically cancer vs ASD/DD, in individuals with germline pathogenic <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations. We found that patients with PHTS and ASD/DD have an overall increased genome-wide CNV burden per individual and an enrichment of clinically relevant CNVs when compared with the subset of patients with cancer and those without ASD/DD. These data appear to provide proof of principle that CNVs may act as genomic modifiers of disease risk in phenotypically heterogeneous hereditary disorders such as PHTS.</p>
<p>As many as 23% of patients with PHTS develop ASD/DD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r16">16</xref></sup> Conversely, 2% to 5% of unselected patients with ASD/DD and as many as 50% of children with ASD and macrocephaly have been found to carry germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r39">39</xref></sup> As such, <italic>PTEN</italic> itself is a syndromic autism gene with well-established roles in nervous system development and neuronal function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r40">40</xref></sup> However, why more than 75% of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation carriers do not develop ASD/DD remains a clinical conundrum. Our findings suggest pathogenic and likely pathogenic CNVs are associated with ASD/DD risk regardless of the particular coexisting germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation. Autism spectrum disorder is believed to be a highly heritable disorder, with complex genetic and biological bases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r43">43</xref></sup> Pathogenic CNVs have been identified in 8% to 21% of individuals with idiopathic ASD, with higher frequencies reported in more severe cases, including causing syndromic ASD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r45">45</xref></sup> Notably, particular pathogenic CNVs have also been identified in neurotypical control individuals, including unaffected family members, albeit with significantly lower frequencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r46">46</xref></sup> First, this observation corroborates the incomplete penetrance and extreme variability in expression of the associated CNVs, meaning that not all carriers will manifest the associated clinical features. Second, this observation supports the burgeoning hypothesis that ASD etiology and severity are modulated through additive effects of multiple genomic aberrations, the so-called 2-hit (or multiple-hit) model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r49">49</xref></sup> These characteristics are highly relevant in the context of modifiers within an inherently predisposed genetic background. In the case of PHTS, we found evidence for the association of pathogenic CNVs with the coexisting germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations to favor ASD/DD clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>For example, we identified CNVs involving <italic>CYFIP1</italic> (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.omim.org/entry/606322">606322</ext-link>) in 3 unrelated patients with PHTS in the ASD/DD group. <italic>CYFIP1</italic> encodes cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 1, a protein originally found to interact with fragile X mental retardation protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r50">50</xref></sup> Increased <italic>CYFIP1</italic> dosage has been shown to cause aberrant neuronal cellular and dendritic morphologic features and to be associated with ASD in humans and murine model organisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r52">52</xref></sup> Importantly, <italic>CYFIP1</italic> expression was inversely correlated with <italic>PTEN</italic> expression levels, with concomitant dysregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r51">51</xref></sup> suggesting that such CNVs may represent a second hit for patients with PHTS already harboring deleterious <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations that upregulate AKT-mTOR signaling. In cases of <italic>CYFIP1</italic> duplications, decreased PTEN protein levels could also affect wild-type <italic>PTEN</italic>. In the context of <italic>CYFIP1</italic> deletion, as was observed for 1 of the 3 patients with PHTS and CNVs involving <italic>CYFIP1</italic> in this study, increased levels of a mutant PTEN protein may result in dominant negative effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r53">53</xref></sup> inhibiting wild-type <italic>PTEN</italic> and hence exacerbating the condition.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the association of CNVs with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, CNVs have also been implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric diseases such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r55">55</xref></sup> A broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric phenotypes has been observed in patients with PHTS ranging from normal development and intelligence to severely debilitating neurocognitive and motor aberrations, including generalized anxiety, adult-onset movement disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r57">57</xref></sup> Whether particular CNVs affect the spectrum or severity of such motor and/or neurocognitive disease manifestations in PHTS warrants further scrutiny in larger independent prospective series.</p>
<sec id="H2-10-ZOI190764">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size of patients within each phenotype group, owing to the rarity of PHTS, despite our cohort being the largest globally to our knowledge. Cowden syndrome, the most common component disorder in PHTS, is estimated to have a prevalence of 1 per 200 000 individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r58">58</xref></sup> This precludes us from performing in-depth analyses, such as the association of particular CNVs with specific phenotypes or severity of manifestations within the ASD/DD group. Another limitation is the absence of a large independent replication sample to ascertain our findings. We therefore attempted a minivalidation by analyzing 69 genetically determined non-European patients with PHTS excluded from the above presented data to control for population stratification (eTable 3 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190764-1-s">Supplement</xref>). We similarly found that 3 of 28 patients in the ASD/DD group (10.7%) carried pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic CNVs compared with 1 of 41 patients in the no ASD/DD group (2.4%) (eTable 4 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190764-1-s">Supplement</xref>). The clinical relevance of increased duplications in genic regions in the ASD/DD group compared with the no ASD/DD group remains unanswered. Other loci may be implicated in the etiology of ASD/developmental delay in PHTS, and therefore the extent of CNVs in our study is likely an underestimate through the conservative inclusion of only pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic CNVs in this study.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The identification of testable clinically relevant genomic modifiers in PHTS is important for risk stratification and serves as proof of principle for other phenotypically variable disorders. Patients with PHTS and ASD/DD have an increased burden of pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Although CNV analysis is indicated as a first-tier clinical diagnostic test for patients with unexplained ASD/DD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="zoi190764r13">13</xref></sup> it is not standard to test for such genomic alterations in the setting of an established diagnosis with a syndromic high-penetrance mendelian gene such as <italic>PTEN</italic>. Copy number variation analysis on immediate identification of germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation in infants and children may be beneficial. The presence of pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic CNVs in PHTS would suggest high likelihood of ASD/neurodevelopmental delay, leading to timely referral to formal evaluation and, if the results are positive, subsequent therapy. The earlier such interventions are instituted, the better the outcomes.</p>
