<title>Significance</title>
<p>Thyroid hormone deficiencies are the most common preventable causes of intellectual disability. We report that mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α1 gene (<italic>THRA</italic>) that result in intellectual disability also reduce brain size. Using human <italic>THRA</italic> mutation stem cell models, we studied the impact of <italic>THRA</italic> mutations on human brain development by combining quantitative lineage analysis, gene expression analyses, and novel assays of neuroepithelium formation. We found that <italic>THRA</italic> regulates the balance between progenitor self-renewal and neurogenesis, and thus overall brain size. Importantly, these in vitro results are consistent with in vivo evidence from magnetic resonance imaging of people with these mutations, advancing our understanding of thyroid hormone action in human brain development.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α 1 gene (<italic>THRA</italic>) have recently been identified as a cause of intellectual deficit in humans. Patients present with structural abnormalities including microencephaly, reduced cerebellar volume and decreased axonal density. Here, we show that directed differentiation of <italic>THRA</italic> mutant patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells to forebrain neural progenitors is markedly reduced, but mutant progenitor cells can generate deep and upper cortical layer neurons and form functional neuronal networks. Quantitative lineage tracing shows that <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing progenitor cells exit the cell cycle prematurely, resulting in reduced clonal output. Using a micropatterned chip assay, we find that spatial self-organization of mutation-containing progenitor cells in vitro is impaired, consistent with down-regulated expression of cell–cell adhesion genes. These results reveal that thyroid hormone receptor α1 is required for normal neural progenitor cell proliferation in human cerebral cortical development. They also exemplify quantitative approaches for studying neurodevelopmental disorders using patient-derived cells in vitro.</p>

<p content-type="flushleft">The human cerebral cortex mediates higher cognitive and sensorimotor functions, with thyroid hormone (TH) deficiency during pregnancy or the neonatal period recognized as the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). Defects in progenitor cell proliferation, synaptogenesis, and dendritic arborization, neuronal migration, and cell survival have been observed in the cerebral cortex of the progeny of hypothyroid rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Aberrant behavior and cortical cytoarchitecture are observed even following transient TH deficiency during the first half of gestation, emphasizing the critical role of THs in early brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). However, in humans, the actions of THs on cells of the central nervous system (CNS) remain poorly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). In the absence of appropriate in vitro models, it has been difficult to study TH action in specific cells or tissues separate from its global effects, which are likely mediated by a range of tissues and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>During cerebral cortex development, THs (thyroxine, T4; triiodothyronine, T3) act via a nuclear receptor (TRα1) encoded by the <italic>THRA</italic> gene, to regulate transcription of target genes in a ligand-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Unliganded TH receptors (TRs) recruit a corepressor complex to inhibit target gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>); hormone (T3) occupancy promotes dissociation of the corepressor complex together with coactivator recruitment and transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>We reported the first human <italic>THRA</italic> mutation in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>), after which approximately 29 other patients have been identified with shared phenotypic features defining the disorder resistance to thyroid hormone α (RTHα) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). All the patients carry heterozygous missense or truncating mutations in the ligand- binding domain of TRα1 that disrupt its ability to bind T3, impairing corepressor dissociation and coactivator recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). When coexpressed, mutant TRα1 inhibits the function of its wild-type (WT) counterpart in a dominant-negative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). In addition to growth retardation and skeletal dysplasia, patients with RTHα exhibit mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, notably affecting nonverbal IQ and sensorimotor processing, and 1 adult woman has experienced epileptic seizures that began in infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). These findings suggest a crucial role for TRα1 in human cortical neurogenesis, consistent with previous studies reporting a range of CNS abnormalities in mice mutant for TRα1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying aberrant neural development in patients with RTHα remain unknown.</p>
<p>Here we have delineated the neurologic and neurocognitive phenotypes and undertaken structural (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], tractography) neuroimaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the first 4 RTHα patients reported, harboring frameshift/premature stop <italic>THRA</italic> mutations that are representative of the type of receptor defect found in 50% of the worldwide RTHα cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). We directed differentiation of <italic>THRA</italic> mutant patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to a cortical excitatory neuronal fate, using an established in vitro system that recapitulates development from early neuroepithelium to functional neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). Based on quantitative analysis of lineage tracing data, we found that <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cortical progenitor cells are biased toward early differentiation, leading to premature neurogenesis and depletion of the progenitor cell pool. They also exhibit impaired self-organization into cortical rosette-like structures in vitro. Defects in neural progenitor proliferation, cell polarity, and apical adhesion may thus contribute to the structural abnormalities and to the sensorimotor and neurocognitive phenotypes seen in patients with RTHα.</p>

<p>Neuropsychological examinations showed significantly reduced nonverbal IQ in all cases, with scores ranging from 2 (P1, P2, and P3) to 3.4 (P4) SDs below the population mean (<italic>X</italic> = 100; SD, 1.5). Furthermore, all patients showed severe impairments in motor coordination, visual motor integration, and finger dexterity of both the dominant and nondominant hands. P4 showed intellectual disability affecting verbal as well as nonverbal abilities, whereas verbal abilities were relatively preserved in P1, P2, and P3. Performance on a test of visual perception was within the low average to average range in P1-P3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908762116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S4</ext-link>).</p>

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) performed in P1 and P2 showed a global increase in the mean diffusivity of water in white matter tracts, denoting a reduction in their density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). On MRS, there was a reduced ratio of <italic>N</italic>-acetylaspartate to the creatine plus phosphocreatine ratio in the frontal white matter and thalamus in P2, P3, and P4, suggestive of neuronal loss or dysfunction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908762116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S5</ext-link>). These results suggest that the observed neurocognitive and sensorimotor deficits in the patients are related to structural abnormalities in several brain regions, including the cerebellum and cerebral cortex.</p>

<title>Reduced Differentiation of <italic>THRA</italic> Mutant iPSCs to Forebrain Neuroepithelial Cells.</title>
<p>To study the cellular developmental origin of cortical abnormalities in <italic>THRA</italic> mutant patients, iPSC lines were derived from P1, P2, and P4 by reprogramming with nonintegrating Sendai virus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908762116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2<italic>A</italic></ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). <italic>THRA</italic> mutant and control iPSCs were then differentiated to cerebral cortex neural progenitor cells using an established protocol based on dual SMAD inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). After 12 d of induction, a neuroepithelial sheet was formed in control cultures, and expression of PAX6 and FOXG1 mRNA confirmed cortical identity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908762116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2<italic>B</italic></ext-link>). Neural progenitor cells proceeded to generate neurons as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). In control cultures, TRα1 was expressed in stem cells before cortical induction, in cycling (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) progenitor cells, and in postmitotic (Tuj1<sup>+</sup>) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908762116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2<italic>C</italic></ext-link>), confirming that the receptor is present throughout the in vitro differentiation process.</p>

<title>Altered Expression of Neural Development and Cell–Cell Adhesion Genes during Neural Differentiation of <italic>THRA</italic> Mutant iPSCs.</title>
<p>To investigate differences in induction efficiency in an unbiased manner, we performed RNA sequencing of 3 independent neural inductions from each THRA mutation-containing iPSC line (TRα1-403X carrying the E403X mutation, TRα1-FS382 with the A382PfsX7 mutation, and TRα1-FS397 with the F397fs406X mutation) and 1 neural induction from each control line (H9, NAS6, and NDC), at day 12 of cortical induction. Out of 16,773 transcripts that were detected above negligible levels in all samples, we considered 478 transcripts whose expression differed significantly between <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing and control lines (false discovery rate &lt;0.25, independent of the sign of the fold change).</p>
<p>Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the expression profiles of replicate inductions from each <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing line clustered together, suggesting that the cortical induction process in vitro preserves mutation-specific differences in transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). The differentially expressed genes clustered into 4 distinct groups, with the largest subset representing genes whose expression is down-regulated in <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing vs. control cells, consistent with the known repressive function of TRα1 (209 genes in group C). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that many of these down-regulated genes relate to DNA-templated transcription, ectoderm and nervous system development, or cell–cell adhesion via membrane adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>), with substantial overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>).

<title>Compromised Cortical Progenitor Cell Dynamics in <italic>THRA</italic> Mutation-Containing Cells.</title>
<p>The microencephaly and reduced white matter tract density seen in patients with RTHα suggest that structural differences in the cerebral cortex might contribute to their neurocognitive phenotype. With human cortex comprising columns of clonally related excitatory neurons preferentially synapsing with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>), the clonal output of a cortical progenitor cell is a major contributor to cortical size, architecture, and function. To determine whether defects in early cortical development could contribute to the neurologic phenotypes of patients, we undertook single-cell clonal lineage analysis of cortical progenitors, comparing cell dynamics and clonal output of <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cells vs. control cells. A small proportion (≤1%) of <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing or control cortical progenitor cells, infected with a GFP-expressing replication-incompetent lentivirus, were mixed with unlabeled control cultures at day 30 and day 40 after cortical induction. Their progeny was then traced over time, enabling the delineation of cell-intrinsic differences between <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing and control progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p>

<p>The size and composition of clones (2 or more cells) derived from labeled progenitors were analyzed at 2, 6, and 10 d after mixing. The majority of labeled cells expressed either Ki67 or the neuron-specific marker βIII-tubulin, indicating that clones consisted of cycling progenitors and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Across the 3 <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing and 3 control cell lines (human iPSC lines NDC and NAS6 and human embryonic stem cell line H9), the average size of clones increased progressively over the 10-d period after labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). Average clone sizes were similar in control cortical progenitor cells labeled at either day 30 or day 40, whereas the size of <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing clones labeled at day 40 was markedly reduced.</p>
<p>Analyzing clone composition, the average number of progenitor cells per clone (as assessed by Ki67 expression) was increased in control cultures at day 30 and 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). In <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cultures, progenitor cell numbers increased only slightly at day 30 and decreased at day 40, suggesting a differing pattern of cell division with earlier cell cycle exit of <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing progenitors. Thus, depletion of the THRA mutation-containing progenitor pool leads to premature neuron production and a decrease in clonal output over time. By live imaging of cells over a 48-h period, we confirmed that these differences were not due to altered cell cycle kinetics or increased cell death (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908762116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4</ext-link>).

<p>To test this, we used a computational model of human cortical development in which self-renewing radial glia (RGs) produce intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), which generate neurons through asymmetric or terminal divisions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908762116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, <italic>Supplementary Methods</italic> and Fig. S5</ext-link>). Based on the findings of a recent in vivo genetic labeling study of cortical neurogenesis in mouse, we presumed that RGs transit from a phase of symmetrical proliferation to a neurogenic phase, in which they divide asymmetrically to give rise to IPCs with variable but limited neurogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). We found that this model could largely account for differences in the clonal behavior of <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing vs. control cells, including the distribution of clone size and composition, under the single assumption that <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing RGs differentiated into IPCs at a higher rate compared with control RGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6 <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). Therefore, the clonal lineage data and the computational model together demonstrate that <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing progenitor cells switch to neurogenesis earlier than control cells, which continue proliferating.</p>
<p>During human neurogenesis, the deepest neuronal layers of the cerebral cortex emerge first, whereas neurons of the upper layers appear subsequently and migrate away from the progenitor cell zone to their final positions. Therefore, expression of TBR1, which is high in layer VI neurons in the developing cortex, is thought to precede expression of CTIP2, which is low in layer VI neurons but high in layer V neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>).

<p>The mechanisms underlying neural rosette formation in vitro are largely enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>).

To test which factors are required for rosette formation, we developed a computational model in which cells move randomly and form attachments at their apical ends when in close proximity. Both the number of rosettes and the distribution of rosette centers observed in vitro were statistically reproduced in silico, indicating that migration and apical attachment are sufficient for rosette formation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908762116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7<italic>C</italic></ext-link>).

<p>In support of this notion, N-cadherin was highly localized to the apical end of progenitor cells in control rosettes but expressed along the cell membrane in <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cells, suggesting impaired adherens junction formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7 <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>), consistent with the down-regulation of protocadherins observed on RNA-seq. Apical expression of the polarity complex protein PKCζ and the centrosome-associated γ-tubulin was observed in control progenitor cells but not in <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908762116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7<italic>D</italic></ext-link>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p content-type="flushleft">Consistent with the known critical role of TH in brain development, we have documented neurocognitive deficits (e.g., reduced nonverbal IQ, motor incoordination, impaired visual motor integration) in patients with RTHα, with some deficits (e.g., motor incoordination, poor finger/hand dexterity) resembling consequences of untreated congenital hypothyroidism. Structural abnormalities include reduction in cerebellar volume, cortical microencephaly in adult cases, and decreased white matter tract density. The neurocognitive, structural, and functional deficits observed in patients with RTHα suggest abnormalities in several brain regions, including the axis from the cerebellum to the neostriatum and the cerebral cortex. Here we focused on the effects of mutant TRα1 on cerebral cortex development and function, using cortical neural progenitor cells derived from <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing iPSCs from these patients. While our experimental model effectively recapitulates defined aspects of corticogenesis in vitro, it does not capture other brain developmental processes, such as myelination and cerebellar development, that may also be impaired in patients and should be elucidated in future studies.</p>
<p>Our cortical differentiation protocol revealed that <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cortical progenitor cells differentiate prematurely in vitro, with attendant depletion of the progenitor cell pool reducing clonal output, which in vivo would result in microencephaly. Quantitative analysis of lineage tracing data confirmed that the fate choices of <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cortical progenitor cells are biased toward neuronal differentiation as opposed to the continued self-renewal observed in control cells. As single-labeled <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing progenitor cells were studied in WT background cultures, such alterations in clonal dynamics likely reflect distinct cell-autonomous fate behaviors.</p>
<p>RNA-seq of early cortical progenitor cells indicated down-regulated expression of genes involved in cell polarity or adherence in <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cells. These included several protocadherins whose cellular functions are not fully understood but may act as adhesion molecules on their own or in association with other cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cortical progenitor cells also showed disordered expression of N-cadherin, a well-described classical cadherin, and defective self-organization into rosettes on micropatterned chips, which may be explained by reduced apical cell–cell adhesion based on our computational model. Taken together, these results indicate that apical adherens junction formation is impaired in <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cortical progenitor cells. In rodent studies, ventricular attachment through adherens junctions is required for apical-basal polarity, spatial organization, and self-renewal of cortical RGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>), and there is emerging evidence indicating that protocadherins play a role in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>).</p>
<p>In the developing cerebral cortex, neural progenitor cell interactions through adherens junctions have been shown to constitute a self-supportive niche maintaining progenitor cell proliferation and inhibiting differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). Thus, defects in cell polarity and attachment to neighboring stem cells may mediate the premature cell cycle exit observed in <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cortical progenitor cells. Our findings also suggest that some cell-intrinsic consequences of mutant TRα1 dysfunction may become apparent only through interactions with the local niche. We note, however, that our in vitro cortical differentiation protocol generates a reduced model of the actual human cortex, lacking, for example, vasculature and surrounding supportive tissues, as well as nonneuronal cells, such as microglia. Neural progenitor cells in vivo reside in a distinct 3D architecture with axial patterning signals and neurophysiological activity not replicated in vitro. Thus, our in vitro results on the structure and organization of neural progenitor cell rosettes might not directly translate to the in vivo situation. Future studies may establish the functional hierarchy of determinants of cortical progenitor cell identity in vivo, to further delineate the mechanisms through which mutant TRα1 affects neurogenesis. It will also be important in future studies to validate the modeling presented here that predicts a change in intermediate progenitor cell dynamics.</p>
<p>Overall, we suggest that abnormal proliferation and adhesion of <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cortical neural progenitors forms the basis, at least in part, of structural and functional changes culminating in neurocognitive deficits seen in patients with RTHα. We note that our lineage-tracing experiments and RNA-seq data cannot resolve whether the observed differences in gene expression and cell fate behavior are due to transcriptional changes within a comparable population of neural progenitor cells, changes in the cellular composition of the progenitor cell populations, or a combination of these 2 possibilities. As our understanding of human corticogenesis is still evolving, with the cell states and cell types involved not yet definitively identified, this distinction is at present semantic and does not affect the conclusions of our study.</p>
<p>Reduced cortical progenitor output and impaired cortical architecture have been observed in human patients and mouse models of several other neurodevelopmental disorders, including Down syndrome, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>). A number of genes differentially expressed in <italic>THRA</italic> mutation-containing cells, including the cell surface dystroglycan receptor <italic>NRXN1</italic> (neurexin) and the transmembrane protein <italic>NPTN</italic> (neuroplastin), have also been implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). Since normal cortical progenitor self-renewal requires the orchestration of a range of cell-intrinsic and environmental factors, including transcription factors determining cortical stem cell identity and genes regulating cell attachment, proliferation, and movement, as well as cytoskeletal organization and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>), a range of gene defects may converge onto similar abnormal neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Specifically, our observations suggest that impaired cell adhesion, leading to defective cortical size and architecture, may ultimately result in neurocognitive deficits across a range of genetic disorders.</p>
<p>In addition to mouse models, novel human iPSC-derived in vitro systems are being increasingly used to study neurodevelopmental conditions, hitherto focusing on neuronal maturation and network function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>). Extending these approaches, this study describes a method of assessing the proliferative potential and fate of neural stem cells in vitro. Through quantitative analysis of lineage tracing data, even minor differences in clonal dynamics can be resolved. In addition, we have developed a quantitative assay for the self-organizing capacity of neural stem cells. Together, these approaches provide an experimental platform to investigate the function of cortical progenitor cells with differing genetic backgrounds, study neural progenitor cell dynamics during normal and pathological development, and ultimately screen for agents to ameliorate defective neurogenesis.</p>

<title>Neural Differentiation of iPSCs.</title>
<p>Neural induction of human control PSCs and <italic>THRA</italic> mutant iPSCs was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). For FACS sorting, 10<sup>6</sup> cells per sample were collected and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. Total RNA from cortical cultures was isolated using TRIzol (Sigma-Aldrich), and semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using primers against <italic>FOXG1</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic>, and <italic>GAPDH</italic>. For Western blot analysis, protein was extracted from overnight-frozen cell pellets, and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation. Band intensity was measured using Image Studio software (Li-COR) and normalized to β-actin. Immunofluorescence staining was performed following fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde.</p>
