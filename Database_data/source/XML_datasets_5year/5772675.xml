<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Cellular form and function – and thus normal development and physiology – are specified via proteins that control the organization and dynamic properties of the actin cytoskeleton. Using the Drosophila model, we have recently identified an unusual actin regulatory enzyme, Mical, which is directly activated by F-actin to selectively post-translationally oxidize and destabilize filaments – regulating numerous cellular behaviors. Mical proteins are also present in mammals, but their actin regulatory properties, including comparisons among different family members, remain poorly defined. We now find that each human MICAL family member, MICAL-1, MICAL-2, and MICAL-3, directly induces F-actin dismantling and controls F-actin-mediated cellular remodeling. Specifically, each human MICAL selectively associates with F-actin, which directly induces MICALs catalytic activity. We also find that each human MICAL uses an NADPH-dependent Redox activity to post-translationally oxidize actin’s methionine (M) M44/M47 residues, directly dismantling filaments and limiting new polymerization. Genetic experiments also demonstrate that each human MICAL drives F-actin disassembly <italic>in vivo</italic>, reshaping cells and their membranous extensions. Our results go on to reveal that MsrB/SelR reductase enzymes counteract each MICAL’s effect on F-actin <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Collectively, our results therefore define the MICALs as an important phylogenetically-conserved family of catalytically-acting F-actin disassembly factors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Single actin proteins have the ability to assemble together into long chains or filaments and it is this actin polymerization that underlies cellular structure and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. A critical goal therefore is to understand the factors that specify the organization and dynamic properties of actin. Over the years a number of proteins have been identified that directly promote actin filament (F-actin) assembly, stability, and generate branched actin networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These actin regulatory proteins include some of the best studied such as bundling proteins like fascin and alpha-actinin, nucleators like formins and Arp2/3, barbed-end/pointed-end capping proteins like CapZ and tropomodulin, and actin assembly proteins like profilin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">In contrast to these positive effectors of actin filament assembly, the actin cytoskeleton is also regulated by proteins that negatively influence its stability and organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Recently, while using genetic and biochemical assays in Drosophila we identified a new actin disassembly protein, Mical, that directly binds F-actin and disassembles actin filaments <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our work also identified that Mical is a flavoprotein monooxygenase/hydroxylase enzyme that associates with flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and uses the co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Further investigating this unusual enzyme revealed that Mical uses actin filaments as a direct substrate, selectively binding and stereospecifically oxidizing two conserved amino acids (methionine (Met) 44 and 47) within the pointed-end of actin to dismantle actin filaments and limit F-actin re-assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Likewise, investigations revealed that this Mical-mediated post-translational actin regulatory process is reversible by a specific methionine sulfoxide reductase enzyme called SelR/MsrB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> – and that this reversible redox actin regulatory system controls multiple behaviors in different tissues including cellular remodeling, motility, process elongation, axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and muscle morphology/function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Mical is therefore a new type of F-actin disassembly factor, one that works through the covalent modification of actin – and one that we have also recently linked to working with important non-covalent regulators of actin such as cofilin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and classical receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Mical is the sole Drosophila member of the MICAL family of proteins, which also includes three human protein family members coded for by three separate genes, <italic>MICAL-1</italic>, <italic>MICAL-2</italic>, and <italic>MICAL-3</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>). Each member of the MICAL family of proteins contains a similar protein organization, and includes a redox enzymatic domain, a calponin homology (CH) domain, a LIM domain, and a number of Src-homology 3 (SH3)-domain (PxxP) binding motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>). At the C-terminus, MICAL family proteins also contain a region that interacts with the Plexin transmembrane receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which is a receptor for one of the largest families of extracellular guidance cues, the Semaphorins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

Yet, Drosophila Mical remains the best-characterized MICAL family member, and the actin regulatory properties of three mammalian members of the MICAL family of proteins, including comparisons among the different family members, remain poorly defined.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Each human MICAL family member (MICAL-1, MICAL-2, and MICAL-3) is a flavoenzyme that consumes NADPH. (<bold>a</bold>) Although variable in length (depicted with the white dashed lines), each of the human (h) MICAL protein family members contains the same core domains as Drosophila (d) Mical including a flavoprotein monooxygenase (FM) domain (also called the redox or MO domain), a single calponin homology domain, and a single LIM domain. Multiple different splice forms of the MICALs have also been identified – some without the C terminus – as detailed in a recent review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.

Each MICAL contains an exact match with each of the 11 residues of the ADP binding region of FAD binding proteins (GxGxxG motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup>), where (+) indicates that MICALs match the consensus, (*) indicates that MICALs match the highly important conserved residues, and (.) indicates the conserved spacing of these residues within these motifs. The MICALs also have well-conserved FAD Fingerprint 2 (GD) and DG motifs, which are additional distinguishing features of flavoprotein monooxygenases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. Note, however, that MICAL-1 has a “naturally” occurring substitution of an alanine residue instead of the important aspartate residue in the DG motif. light blue = hydrophobic and cysteine residues, purple = acids, green = bases, yellow = proline, and orange = glycine. The proline (*) in the FAD fingerprint 2 is also likely to be conserved. (<bold>c</bold>–<bold>f</bold>) Each of the human MICALs binds FAD. The isoalloxazine ring system within flavins generates the yellow/orange color of FAD and FMN and is also responsible for light absorption in the UV and visible spectral range such that the oxidized form of FAD has two peaks at ~360 nm and ~450 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>. Likewise, each of the purified human MICAL proteins, similar to Drosophila Mical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>, has a UV-visible light absorption spectra with peaks at ~360 nm and ~450 nm (black lines) – and denaturation of the MICAL proteins releases FAD, which underlies this absorption spectra (green line). Note also that the flavin is shielded to some extent from absorbing light by the protein backbone of each of the MICAL proteins (e.g., compare the absorbance levels and wavelength of the black and green lines). [MICAL] = 20 μM. (<bold>g</bold>,<bold>h</bold>) Each of the human MICALs consumes the co-enzyme NADPH (<bold>g</bold>), preferring it over the related pyridine nucleotide coenzyme NADH (<bold>h</bold>), as observed by measuring the change in absorbance at 340 nm (NADPH and NADH absorb light at 340 nm, while the products of the conversion/consumption, NADP<sup>+</sup> and NAD<sup>+</sup>, do not).

<p id="Par5">Herein, we find that each of the human MICAL proteins is an F-actin disassembly enzyme. Our results reveal that human MICALs-1, 2, and 3 directly associate with actin filaments, which activate the MICALs to catalyze enzyme reactions that selectively oxidize actin. This MICAL-mediated oxidation of actin, dismantles filaments, inhibits polymerization, is counteracted by SelR/MsrB reductases, and regulates cellular remodeling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, differences among the catalytic and F-actin regulatory activities of the MICALs also exist, including that MICAL-1, which is the most divergent of the MICALs, has a single naturally-occurring amino acid substitution that allows it to have higher basal enzymatic activity and consume NADPH more robustly in the absence of its F-actin substrate than the other MICALs. Collectively, our results define the MICALs as an important new phylogenetically-conserved family of redox-acting actin filament disassembly factors.</p>

<title>MICAL Family Proteins are Redox Enzymes</title>
<p id="Par6">Both Drosophila Mical and mammalian MICALs form the MICAL family of large, multidomain cytosolic proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>), which direct multiple different cellular behaviors and physiological functions (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>). We have recently identified Drosophila Mical as an actin filament disassembly factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and work using purified mammalian MICAL proteins has determined that at least some of the mammalian MICALs also exhibit direct effects on actin stability (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>). However, since an in-depth characterization and comparison of the different MICAL family members and their mechanisms of action is lacking, we set out to define each MICAL family member and its effects on F-actin.</p>
<p id="Par7">Our previous results revealed that the oxidoreductase (redox) region of Drosophila Mical (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>) is sufficient to post-translationally oxidize and disassemble actin filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, but Mical’s calponin homology (CH) domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>) may also assist the redox region in its catalytic efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Therefore, so that we could compare and contrast the actin regulatory properties of each of the MICAL family members (and do it in the same species), we expressed and purified recombinant proteins containing the redox and CH portions of each of the three human MICALs, hMICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup>-1, hMICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup>-2, and hMICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup>-3 (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The redox regions of both invertebrate and vertebrate members of the MICAL family of proteins are highly conserved with as high as 63% identity between Drosophila and human family members (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). Likewise, primary sequence analysis of Drosophila and human family members revealed that each of them has within their redox enzymatic domain three well-conserved amino acid motifs that are found in proteins that bind and utilize the redox enzyme co-factor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a,b</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>). Experimental analysis also identified that purified human MICAL-1<sup>redoxCH</sup>, MICAL-2<sup>redoxCH</sup>, and MICAL-3<sup>redoxCH</sup> proteins, like Drosophila Mical<sup>redoxCH</sup>, are yellow in color, a distinguishing feature of flavin binding proteins (flavoproteins), and also exhibited an absorption spectra similar to flavoproteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c–f</xref>, Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Protein denaturation studies also supported these observations, and demonstrated that recombinant Drosophila Mical and all three human MICAL proteins bind the flavin FAD non-covalently in a 1:1 MICAL:FAD stoichiometry (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4b,c</xref>). Thus, each of the human MICALs, like Drosophila Mical, is an FAD binding protein.</p>
<p id="Par8">Proteins that bind FAD typically perform oxidation-reduction reactions, so we wondered if all members of the MICAL family of proteins do the same. Primary sequence analyses revealed that MICAL family proteins are similar to a class of redox enzymes called flavoprotein monooxygenases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and this similarity was also observed when the redox portion of mouse MICAL-1 was crystallized, examined structurally, and found to be most similar to the flavoprotein monooxygenase enzyme <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (pHBH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Flavoprotein monooxygenases such as pHBH utilize the pyridine nucleotide coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in their redox reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, so we compared the redox properties of each member of the human MICAL family. Our results revealed that each mammalian MICAL family member, like Drosophila Mical, consumes NADPH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>). Furthermore, we found that similar to Drosophila Mical, hMICAL-1, 2, and 3 are more active in the presence of NADPH than with the related pyridine nucleotide coenzyme NADH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>). However, we also noticed differences in the redox properties among the different MICAL family members. For example, hMICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup>-1 is substantially more active than the other members of the MICAL family in the absence of a substrate and consumes high levels of NADPH on its own (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>). In contrast, hMICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup>-2, hMICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup>-3, and Drosophila MICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup> are most similar to each other with regards to NADPH consumption (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>), and most similar to PHBH, in that they each have relatively weak NADPH consumption activity on their own (i.e., in the absence of a substrate). Collectively, these results indicate that all members of MICAL family of proteins exhibit redox activity – although there are notable differences between family members in their catalytic properties.</p>

<title>Each Human MICAL Family Member Directly Binds and Dismantles Actin Filaments</title>
<p id="Par9">Drosophila Mical directly binds and disassembles F-actin in an NADPH-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, so we wondered if each of the human MICAL proteins also functions in a similar way. We first looked at the ability of hMICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup>-1, hMICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup>-2, and hMICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup>-3 proteins to associate with actin filaments using actin co-sedimentation assays. Like Drosophila Mical, co-sedimentation assays revealed that all three human MICALs physically associate with F-actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Likewise, we found that these MICAL–F-actin interactions are specific, since similar to Drosophila Mical, human MICALs did not directly associate with microtubules (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>). Thus, we wondered if human MICALs affect F-actin stability. Using different actin polymerization and depolymerization assays including pyrene-actin and sedimentation analyses, we found that each of the human MICALs, similar to Drosophila Mical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, altered actin polymerization and induced the disassembly of F-actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b,c</xref>). Namely, when added prior to actin polymerization, each of the MICALs induces actin polymerization to slow-down over time, which is followed by a substantial decrease in the extent of polymerization, the rapid depolymerization of F-actin, and the inability of actin to reinitiate polymer formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>). In a similar way, when added to polymerized actin, each of the MICALs induces the disassembly of filaments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>). Moreover, like Drosophila Mical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, these effects on polymerization and depolymerization were specific to F-actin, as microtubule polymerization and depolymerization dynamics were not affected by human MICALs (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>). Further analysis revealed that each of the human MICALs effects on F-actin, like Drosophila Mical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, was more robust in the presence of NADPH versus NADH (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a,b</xref>). These results therefore reveal that each of the human MICALs directly associates with actin filaments – inducing both F-actin disassembly and preventing normal F-actin reassembly.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Each human MICAL family member directly binds and disassembles actin filaments.

Notice that after high-speed centrifugation, each of the purified MICALs is present in the soluble (S) fraction (left gel). In the presence of purified actin filaments, however, each of the MICALs is present in the pellet (P) fraction (right gel). The percentage (±the standard error of the mean (SEM)) of different MICAL proteins in the pelleted fraction following incubation with purified F-actin was quantified by densitometry (<italic>n</italic> = 3).

Notably, MICAL (NADPH) induces actin polymerization to slow-down over time, which is followed by a substantial decrease in the extent of polymerization, the rapid depolymerization of F-actin, and the inability of actin to reinitiate polymer formation. Thus, because each of the MICALs acts on F-actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> (and herein), our data in the polymerization assays are consistent with a model in which as the actin begins to polymerize, the MICALs oxidize individual subunits of the polymer, which disassembles the polymerizing actin. This slows polymerization – and also creates fewer and fewer unoxidized monomers that can be used for polymerization.

The addition of each of the human MICALs (in the presence of NADPH) induces actin depolymerization (decreasing fluorescence intensity that can be followed over time in the pyrene actin depolymerization assay (left)).

The extent of this MICAL (NADPH)-dependent actin depolymerization is also observed when MICAL-treated F-actin was subjected to high-speed centrifugation to differentiate F-actin (P) from G-actin (S).

<title>Actin Filaments Serve as a Direct Substrate for Each MICAL Family Member</title>
<p id="Par10">We next sought to examine the mechanism by which the human MICALs alter actin dynamics. Our previous results revealed that actin filaments exhibit the characteristics of a direct Mical substrate, robustly increasing the enzyme activity of Drosophila Mical (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>). Likewise, we found that the enzyme activity of each of the human MICALs, as judged by an increase in the consumption of the co-enzyme NADPH, increased in the presence of actin filaments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). We also had previously determined that the methionine (Met) 44 and 47 residues of actin are the sites of Drosophila Mical post-translational oxidation of actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and that mutations to those residues makes actin resistant to Drosophila Mical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Likewise, using an antibody that specifically recognizes the Mical-oxidized Met44 residue of actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, we found that Met44 is oxidized by human MICALs 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>) – and that mutating the Met44 and Met47 residues of actin prevents each of the human MICALs from disassembling F-actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). Moreover, we previously determined that the methionine sulfoxide reductase enzyme SelR/MsrB specifically reverses Drosophila Mical-mediated oxidation of actin through reduction of the oxidized Met44 and Met47 residues of actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> – and that this SelR/MsrB-mediated effect also restores the polymerization properties of Mical-treated actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, we wondered if each member of the MICAL family also works in a similar way to oxidize actin and if SelR/MsrB could reverse this modification and restore the polymerization properties of human MICAL-treated actin. Indeed, we found that the methionine sulfoxide reductase enzyme SelR/MsrB restored the polymerization properties of actin that had been treated with each of the human MICALs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). These results therefore reveal that actin serves as a direct substrate of mammalian MICALs and that the Met44 and 47 residues are essential for the ability of each of the human MICALs to disassemble F-actin. Likewise, since SelR/MsrB enzymes specifically catalyze the reduction of the <italic>R</italic> isomer of methionine sulfoxide (methionine-<italic>R</italic>-sulfoxide) to methionine (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>), these results also indicate that each MICAL family member oxidizes actin stereospecifically in the <italic>R</italic>-isomer to generate actin Met44,47-<italic>R</italic>-sulfoxide (actin<sup>Met(<italic>R</italic>)O–44,47</sup> ).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Each human MICAL family member is activated by actin filaments, oxidizing the Met44 residue of actin to induce F-actin disassembly.

<title>MICAL-1 exhibits notable differences in its activation and catalytic activity in comparison to other MICAL family members</title>
<p id="Par11">Our results herein reveal that each member of the MICAL family of proteins uses its enzyme activity to covalently modify and disassemble F-actin, but we also noticed that MICAL-1 exhibited pronounced differences in this catalytic activity when compared to other MICAL family members. In particular, in the absence of their F-actin substrate, Drosophila Mical and human MICALs 2 and 3 consumed relatively low amounts of their essential co-enzyme NADPH (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>). MICAL-1, in contrast, consumed high levels of NADPH in the absence of its F-actin substrate (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>), such that it basally (in the <italic>absence</italic> of F-actin) consumed close to 100 times more NADPH per second than hMICAL-2 and 60 times more NADPH per second than Drosophila Mical (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). Thus, MICAL-1, in contrast to other MICAL family members, is highly active in the absence of its substrate. In the class of enzymes that includes pHBH and MICALs, consumption of NADPH in the absence of a substrate leads to the production of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) – since no substrates are present to directly oxidize (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>). Likewise, using several different assays to monitor H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the absence of a substrate, we found that hMICAL-1 produced higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than other MICAL family members (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7b</xref>). Furthermore, using an assay to monitor the usage of oxygen, we found that MICAL-1 consumed much higher levels of oxygen in the absence of a substrate in comparison to other MICALs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). Thus, MICAL-1 shows marked differences in its catalytic properties from other MICALs, including a robust enzymatic activity in the <italic>absence</italic> of its F-actin substrate.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>MICAL-1 exhibits notable activation and catalytic activity differences in comparison to other MICALs. (<bold>a</bold>) The enzyme activity of human MICAL-1 (hM-1) in the absence of its substrate F-actin is substantially higher than that of the other MICALs, as judged by consumption of NADPH. In particular, basal (in the <italic>absence</italic> of F-actin) NADPH consumption by MICAL-1 is close to 100 times more NADPH consumption <italic>per second</italic> than hMICAL-2, 60 times more NADPH consumption <italic>per second</italic> than Drosophila Mical, and over 10 times more NADPH consumption <italic>per second</italic> than hMICAL-3.

These effects are consistent with hMICAL-1 exhibiting such rapid consumption of NADPH in the absence of its F-actin substrate that NADPH becomes limiting in allowing MICAL-1 to alter F-actin dynamics (see also main text). [Actin] = 1.15 μM, [NADPH] = 100 μM. (<bold>f</bold>–<bold>h</bold>) hMICAL-1 generates a high-level of basal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but does not use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to modify actin dynamics. (<bold>f</bold>) To test if MICALs use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to disassemble F-actin we made use of MICAL-1’s high level of basal activity to produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of NADPH, and added NADPH either before (pre) or after (post) the addition of F-actin. In short, we reasoned that if H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (or another stable oxidant) was being used by MICALs to modify actin, it would not matter in which order we added F-actin to the same tube. However, if H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (or another stable oxidant) was not being used to modify F-actin, MICAL-1 would exhaust its supply of NADPH generating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> prior to the addition of F-actin, and would therefore have decreased effects on F-actin dynamics. (<bold>g</bold>) MICAL-1 no longer disassembles F-actin when it is incubated with NADPH prior to the addition of F-actin (pink), revealing it does not use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or another stable/generally-released oxidant to disassemble F-actin. (<bold>h</bold>) As a control, Drosophila Mical, which has a low rate of basal NADPH consumption (and thus retains NADPH when its F-actin substrate is not present), exhibits similar disassembly of F-actin in both the Pre- and Post- incubation conditions.

<p id="Par12">To further investigate these differences among the MICALs we wondered what effect this MICAL-1-mediated large increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production might have on F-actin dynamics. It has been suggested that the MICALs use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to exert their effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. However, our previous results using multiple different approaches and those of others demonstrated that MICALs do not use the non-specific release of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or other diffusible oxidants to alter F-actin dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, but need to be in close proximity to F-actin, which directly activates Mical to oxidize the Met44 and Met47 residues of actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Likewise, our results presented herein also support these conclusions for each of the mammalian MICALs, since we observe an excessive difference in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production between human MICAL-1 and the other MICALs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7b</xref>), but not a corresponding increase in MICAL-1’s effects on F-actin dynamics (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b,c</xref>). Similarly, we found that raising the levels of MICAL-1 (from 300 nM to 900 nM) increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production but decreased F-actin alterations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7c</xref>), further arguing against a role for the diffusible release of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or other oxidants in MICAL-mediated F-actin alterations. Indeed, since hMICAL-2, hMICAL-3 and Drosophila Mical, which have a low basal NADPH consumption rate, increased their effects on F-actin dynamics in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7d</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>), our results argue that MICAL-1 exhibits such rapid consumption of NADPH in the absence of its F-actin substrate that NADPH (and not H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [which is present in high quantities in the MICAL-1 reaction; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7b</xref>]) becomes limiting in allowing MICAL-1 to modify F-actin. Thus, our results indicate that the release of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plays no role in MICAL-1 mediated F-actin disassembly.</p>
<p id="Par13">To further test the role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in MICAL-mediated F-actin disassembly, we made use of MICAL-1’s high level of basal activity and designed one additional experiment in which we incubated MICAL-1 with NADPH either before (pre) or after (post) the addition of F-actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref>). We reasoned that if H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the means by which MICAL-1 induces F-actin disassembly, there would be no difference in F-actin disassembly between these conditions. However, our results revealed that MICAL-1 no longer disassembles F-actin when it is incubated with NADPH prior to the addition of F-actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>) – supporting that even though MICAL-1 produces high levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in this pre-reaction condition (i.e., without its F-actin substrate [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref>]), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has no effect on F-actin disassembly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>). MICAL-1, therefore, because of its high-rate of basal activity uses-up NADPH prior to the addition of F-actin, such that it can no longer use NADPH in its reaction to modify actin. Drosophila Mical, in contrast, which has a low rate of basal NADPH consumption (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>), retains NADPH levels in the absence of its F-actin substrate, and exhibited similar effects on F-actin disassembly in each condition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4h</xref>). Indeed, when we added more NADPH into the MICAL-1 pre-reaction condition tube (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7e</xref>), MICAL-1 now proceeded to induce F-actin disassembly (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7f</xref>). Thus, the general release of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is not the means by which MICAL-1 or any of the MICALs post-translationally oxidize and regulate F-actin disassembly. These results therefore further support our previous results with Drosophila Mical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and those above that the MICALs need to be in close proximity to F-actin, which directly activates the MICALs to oxidize the Met44 and 47 residues of actin.</p>

<title>MICAL-1 exhibits a single amino acid alteration that produces high levels of catalytic activity in the absence of its F-actin substrate</title>
<p id="Par14">Since MICAL-1, unlike other MICAL family members (and MICAL-class enzymes like pHBH), has a high level of enzymatic activity in the absence of a substrate, we wondered what molecular variation(s) might be underlying this difference. Interestingly, comparing the sequences for the different MICALs revealed that the critical aspartate (D) amino acid residue in the DG motif of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding motif was instead an alanine (A) residue in MICAL-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). The DG motif (also called the Conserved Motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>;) is critical for binding the pyrophosphate moiety of FAD (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>), and so this “naturally-occurring” MICAL-1-specific substitution of a nonpolar alanine residue for the charged aspartate residue would be predicted to alter the positioning and flexibility of the FAD. This “naturally-occurring” MICAL-1-specific substitution might also enable MICAL-1 to be more catalytically active in the absence of its F-actin substrate than other MICALs. To test this hypothesis, we used site-directed mutagenesis to convert the alanine residue within the DG motif of MICAL-1 to an aspartate residue and thereby generated a MICAL-1 protein similar to the other MICAL family members (MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). Our initial analysis of this MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup> protein revealed that it was similar to wild-type MICAL-1 (and other MICAL family members) – yellow in color (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) and displaying the enzymatic features and absorption spectra of MICAL-class enzymes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4b,c</xref>). Yet, strikingly, we also found that making this DG substitution decreased MICAL-1’s basal consumption of NADPH by close to 12-fold (1200%) per second (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>) – enabling MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup> to consume much lower levels of oxygen and generate far less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than wild-type MICAL-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b,c</xref>). However, making this DG substitution did not decrease MICAL-1’s actin regulatory properties – since we observed that MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup> still bound actin filaments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>), was activated by F-actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>), oxidized actin’s Met44 residue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>), and had robust and specific effects on both actin polymerization and depolymerization (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a,b</xref>). Furthermore, these MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup> effects on F-actin dynamics were dependent on the Met44 and Met47 residues of actin and could be counteracted by SelR (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>). Therefore, despite the large differences in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production between MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup> and wild-type MICAL-1, we did not observe any widespread differences in their actin regulatory abilities (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). Indeed, our results revealed that MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup> became more efficient than MICAL-1 at altering actin dynamics (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>) – because it now had a lower basal level of NADPH consumption and generated less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Thus, these results further support that the MICALs do not use general H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production to exert their effects on actin dynamics. Furthermore, these results also indicate that the aspartate (D) to alanine (A) substitution that occurs “naturally” in MICAL-1 underlie differences in basal activity and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production between MICAL-1 and the other MICAL family members.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>MICAL-1 exhibits a single amino acid alteration in its DG motif that produces high levels of catalytic activity in the absence of its F-actin substrate. (<bold>a</bold>) MICAL-1 has a “naturally” occurring substitution of an alanine (A) residue instead of the important aspartate (D) residue in the DG (Conserved) motif that is present in the other MICAL family members. Using site-directed mutagenesis we converted the alanine residue within the DG motif of MICAL-1 to an aspartate residue and thereby generated a MICAL-1 protein similar to the other MICAL family members (MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup>). (<bold>b</bold>) Purified MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup> protein still exhibits the hallmarks of an FAD-binding protein. In particular, MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup> maintains its UV-visible light absorption spectra (with peaks at ~360 nm and ~450 nm, black lines), and denaturation of the MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup> releases FAD, which underlies this absorption spectra (green line).

[MICALs] = 600 nM, [NADPH] = 200 μM. (<bold>d</bold>) The enzymatic activity of MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup>, similar to other MICALs, is notably increased in the presence of F-actin.

(<bold>e</bold>) MICAL-1<sup>DG</sup>, similar to unaltered MICAL-1 and other MICAL family members, induces actin polymerization to slow-down over time, which is followed by a substantial decrease in the extent of polymerization, the rapid depolymerization of F-actin, and the inability of actin to reinitiate polymer formation.

<title>Mammalian MICALs Regulate F-actin Disassembly and Cellular Remodeling <bold><italic>In Vivo</italic></bold></title>
<p id="Par15">Our biochemical experiments reveal that each member of the MICAL family of proteins functions to directly induce actin disassembly. We conducted these experiments using purified proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> so we wondered if each MICAL family member could also exert similar effects on F-actin organization <italic>in vivo</italic>. Bristle cells in the model organism Drosophila have long-provided a high-resolution single cell system for characterizing F-actin alterations <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>) – and our previous results revealed that Drosophila Mical induces F-actin disassembly in a redox-dependent manner to remodel these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We therefore turned to this model system to determine if each member of the MICAL family has a similar ability – and tested this by generating transgenic flies expressing human MICALs corresponding to the exact protein construct we used <italic>in vitro</italic>, hMICAL-1<sup>redoxCH</sup>, hMICAL-2<sup>redoxCH</sup>, and hMICAL-3<sup>redoxCH</sup>. Notably, expressing each of the human MICALs in developing bristle cells using the bristle-specific driver (<italic>B11-GAL4</italic>) resulted in widespread and dramatic effects to actin organization and cellular morphology. The normally bundled and parallel-arranged F-actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>, left and middle) that gives rise to a long slightly-curved bristle process (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>, right) was significantly altered by expressing MICALs 1, 2 or 3 within them (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b–f</xref>). Specifically, MICALs-1, 2, and 3 were each sufficient to decrease the presence of actin filaments in extending bristle processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b–e</xref>, and compare to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>) and resulted in substantial remodeling of bristle cells to generate numerous abnormal bends and branches (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b–d</xref>). Furthermore, SelR, but not an enzyme dead version of SelR (SelR<sup>C124S</sup>), rescued the F-actin and morphological defects induced by MICALs-1, 2, and 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>), indicating that each of the human MICALs uses its redox activity to alter actin dynamics and cellular remodeling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, as we observed <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified proteins, each of the human MICALs exerts specific negative effects on F-actin organization <italic>in vivo</italic> – effects that significantly remodel cells.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Each human MICAL family member generates F-actin disassembly and cellular remodeling <italic>in vivo</italic>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par16">Dynamic assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton allows cells to perform the functions necessary for normal development and physiology. Yet, while we have a considerable understanding of how actin filaments are assembled in cells, our understanding of how such filaments are disassembled remains highly incomplete<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Here, we provide an instrumental piece in the understanding of how filaments are disassembled, by characterizing a family of actin disassembly enzymes conserved from invertebrates to humans. In particular, members of the MICAL family of proteins, which includes one family member in invertebrates and three members in vertebrates including humans, are broadly expressed and have recently emerged because of their crucial role in directing numerous actin-based cellular events <italic>in vivo</italic> (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>). Using the sole Drosophila member of the MICAL family as a model, we have uncovered that Mical is an F-actin dismantling protein that uses a new enzymatic oxygen-based signaling mechanism to both disassemble actin filaments and limit their reassembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Now, we have worked out conditions to purify each of the human MICALs and find that each member of the MICAL family of proteins directly associates with and dismantles actin filaments. These MICAL-mediated effects occur via the ability of actin filaments to directly activate the enzymatic activity of MICAL family members – such that each of the MICAL family enzymes then post-translationally oxidizes actin subunits to destabilize filaments and decrease actin polymerization. Our results also demonstrate that these effects occur both <italic>in vitro</italic> with purified proteins and in cellular contexts <italic>in vivo</italic> – and thereby identify the MICALs as a phylogenetically-conserved family of F-actin dismantling enzymes with important <italic>in vivo</italic> implications for actin regulation because of their broad expression in multiple different tissues.</p>
<p id="Par17">Our results also identify unique biochemical attributes that define the MICAL family of enzymes. In particular, we find that each MICAL family member binds FAD, is enzymatically active, and behaves catalytically in a generally similar manner – including using NADPH as a co-enzyme, which the MICALs prefer over the related (unphosphorylated) pyridine nucleotide co-enzyme NADH. Likewise, we find that actin filaments activate the catalytic activity of each member of the MICAL family of proteins and serve as a substrate for each MICAL. Furthermore, we find that each of the MICALs uses the same mechanism to accomplish its dismantling effects on actin filaments: the stereospecific oxidation of specific methionine residues within the D-loop portion of actin subunits – effects that are reversed by SelR/MsrB family methionine sulfoxide reductases. Thus, each MICAL family member is selective in its effects – such that it has a specific protein substrate that activates it, particular amino acid residues that it specifically modifies within that substrate, and a stereospecificity in how it modifies its amino acid substrate residues. These attributes, therefore, distinguish MICAL family enzymes from other physiologically-relevant redox enzymes characterized to date such as NADPH oxidases and nitric oxide synthases, which have different mechanisms of activation and action, as well as broader specificity both with regards to protein substrates and the amino acids that are modified within those substrates.</p>
<p id="Par18">Our results also elucidate that a characteristic feature of each of the MICALs is that actin is their oxygen-acceptor substrate – and that specific binding of the polymeric form of this substrate (i.e., actin filaments) triggers MICALs consumption of NADPH to oxidize individual actin subunits. Thus, from both a structural perspective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, and in the way that binding of the oxygen-acceptor substrate accelerates consumption of the NADPH co-enzyme, MICALs are most similar to flavoprotein monooxygenase enzymes. However, to the best of our knowledge MICAL enzymes are the first known class of flavoprotein monooxygenases for which a protein substrate has been identified. Our results therefore raise the possibility that other (or perhaps all) flavoprotein monooxygenases have protein substrates that are awaiting identification. Moreover, it is unknown if the MICALs have other substrates, but our results herein reveal that a substrate for the MICALs should be defined based solely on its ability to both 1) activate MICAL and 2) be modified by MICALs enzymatic activity (i.e., as we have found for actin filaments). Such a definition will thus serve to differentiate a <italic>bona fide</italic> substrate from a protein that is simply spuriously modified by the ability of MICALs and other flavoprotein monooxygenases to produce non-selective diffusible oxidants (i.e., hydrogen peroxide) in the course of their reaction <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p id="Par19">Our results also reveal that like other monooxygenases, the production of hydrogen peroxide (i.e., the loss of reducing equivalents in the absence of a substrate) is actively suppressed by MICAL family enzymes. However, there is some production of hydrogen peroxide, particularly in the case of MICAL-1, with its naturally-occurring single amino acid substitution that we have defined in the critical DG conserved motif of the MICAL enzymatic region. Thus, while our results herein, coupled with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide production and MICAL-mediated F-actin disassembly are not linked together (see also Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>), it is interesting to consider that MICAL may use hydrogen peroxide in physiological contexts to exert effects on other proteins. In any case, the effects that the MICALs may have using hydrogen peroxide are likely to be on cysteine residues, since hydrogen peroxide is a poor oxidizer of methionine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Indeed, the oxidation of cysteine residues via hydrogen peroxide has been reported as a means through which MICAL-1 modifies the CRMP protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It should also be considered that in contrast to our work herein using truncated/active forms of MICAL, full-length MICALs (including MICAL-1) are kept in an inactive state (i.e., without NADPH activity/hydrogen peroxide production)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Thus, any hydrogen peroxide production by MICALs is likely to be tightly controlled in the cell to modify proteins in the vicinity of F-actin. Future work will aim to further elucidate the mechanistic details of these unusual and important enzymes, including the means by which the MICALs gain access to and oxidize Met44 and Met47 within filaments (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par20">In summary, we have identified a family of actin regulatory proteins conserved from invertebrates to humans that use actin filaments as their enzymatic substrate – employing their unusual catalytic mechanism to covalently modify and induce the dismantling of actin filaments. These findings therefore uncover a new class of broadly-expressed negative regulators of actin stability and thereby elucidate new mechanisms underlying actin disassembly. In particular, the assembly of actin filaments is favored within cellular contexts, making it critical to understand how targeted and rapid F-actin disassembly is occurring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. In a similar way, specific cell-cell signaling ligands including repellents such as ephrins, slits, semaphorins, myelin-associated inhibitors, and Wnts trigger the rapid disassembly of F-actin networks in multiple tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, but their direct effectors are still poorly understood. Our results shed light on both of these phenomena, since MICALs are heavily alternatively spliced – with different forms being targeted to specific regions of cells and organelles, as well as working both together and independently from specific repellent cues (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>). Indeed, a model is emerging that the MICALs are maintained in an inactive conformation in the cell and are locally activated upon binding to other proteins such as the Semaphorin repellent receptor Plexin and small GTPases like Rab35 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>). Moreover, because of the MICALs ability to covalently modify actin, the MICALs differentiate themselves from other actin disassembly proteins characterized to date because they not only rapidly dismantle F-actin, but they also generate post-translationally modified actin that has aberrant assembly properties. Given that the MICALs are widely expressed in multiple different tissues, that they have the ability to synergize with ubiquitous actin regulatory proteins and signaling pathways, and that they (and their substrate residues on actin) have been tied to different pathologies, our results bring a new understanding to how targeted and rapid F-actin disassembly occurs in cells.</p>

This difference between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes makes it straightforward to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays. Thus, the enzymatic activity of Mical was monitored by the rate of NADPH or NADH oxidation, which is measured by the rate of decreasing light absorbance at 340 nm (extinction coefficient 340 = 6.2 mM<sup>−1</sup>*cm<sup>−1</sup>). 600 nM of the different MICALs to 100 µM NADPH in General Actin Buffer was used.

In brief, purified rabbit skeletal muscle actin (pyrene-labeled; Cytoskeleton, Inc) was used to monitor actin polymerization since the fluorescence intensity of the pyrene-labeled polymer is substantially higher than the pyrene-labeled monomer. G-actin (monomeric actin) was resuspended to 9.2 μM in a G-actin buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM ATP and 1 mM DTT) and incubated on ice for 1 hour.

<title>Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
<p id="Par35">In one method, we used the substrate luminol and the generation of a chemiluminescence signal that we visualized on either X-ray film or a phosphoimager. In particular, luminol, when it becomes oxidized by peroxide (peroxide can be formed through a reaction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with horseradish peroxidase [HRP]), results in creation of an excited state product, which then decays to a lower energy state by releasing photons of light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>. Therefore, to perform this reaction and to test for the ability of the different MICALs to form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we added a substrate (luminal [i.e., ECL substrate]), a catalyst (HRP), and the MICALs in the presence of NADPH (which will provide H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> if they generate it). To do this, we incubated 0.6 μM of each MICAL in the presence of 200 μM NADPH, HRP (the catalyst), and luminol, and then visualized the product of the reaction using either X-ray film or a phosphoimager.</p>
<p id="Par36">As another (different) means to detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we used the ROS-Glo H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Assay Kit developed by Promega (Catalog No: G8820<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup>), and followed the manufacturers recommended instructions. In particular, in the ROS-Glo H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Assay Kit, a derivatized luciferin substrate is incubated with a potential H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generating sample, and then the derivatized luciferin substrate reacts directly with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to generate a luciferin precursor. Addition of the ROS-Glo detection solution converts the precursor to luciferin and triggers the luciferase to produce a light signal that is proportional to the level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> present in the sample. Thus, the ROS-Glo H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> substrate reacts directly with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, eliminating the need for HRP as a coupling enzyme (and thus eliminating any false detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> associated with any unknown activation or inhibition of HRP by the MICALs). In particular, 60 pmol of each of the Drosophila and human MICAL<sup>redoxCH</sup> proteins was diluted by General Actin Buffer to a final volume of 79 µl and transferred into a 96-well plate (Corning). 25 µM of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was used as the standard. Following the manufacturer′s recommended protocol, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> substrate dilution buffer (SDB) was thawed and placed on ice. The SDB was then mixed with the manufacturer-provided H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> substrate (the derivatized luciferin substrate) just prior to use (generating the SDB-S). 20 µl of SDB-S was added into each well containing the MICALs or the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> standard to generate a final volume of 100 µl. A control SDB-S only well was also used. At time 0 min (reaction time: 10 min), 5 min (reaction time: 5 min), 8 min (reaction time: 2 min), 1 µl of 10 mM NADPH (final concentration: 100 µM) was added into each well. 100 µl of ROS-Glo detection solution (+1 µl D-Cys and 1 µl enhancer solution/100 µl Detection solution) was added to each well. After the 96-well plate was incubated for 5 min at room temperature, the relative luminescence unit was recorded by using a plate-reading luminometer (TriStar² LB 942 Multidetection Microplate Reader, Berthold Technologies, Germany). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration was calculated by the luminescence value of the samples, zero control and the standard sample (25 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).</p>

Lastly, the electrode was calibrated using dissolved oxygen in water (which provided a basal line as a sample) and then establishing a zero content of oxygen by adding an oxygen reducing agent to the water. The basal oxygen consumption was then determined by adding 200 µM of NADPH and 600 nM of each MICAL into F-actin buffer (no F-actin) (1:1 G-Buffer+2X Polymerization Buffer) in the chamber and measuring the change in the amount of oxygen dissolved in the buffer via the oxygen electrode.</p>

Differences between experimental and control animal conditions were large, with little variability and so the sample size was larger than needed to ensure adequate power to detect an effect. Animal studies were based on pre-established criteria to compare against age-matched animals. Animal experiments were not randomized. Animals of the correct genotype were determined and those collected of that genotype were included as data. For genetic experiments, in which the genotype needed to be determined on the basis of different Drosophila genetic/chromosome markers, blinding was not employed.
