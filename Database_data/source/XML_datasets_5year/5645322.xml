<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">The roles of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-alpha (CaMKIIα) in the expression of long-term synaptic plasticity in the adult brain have been extensively studied. However, how increased CaMKIIα activity controls the maturation of neuronal circuits remains incompletely understood. Herein, we show that pyramidal neurons without CaMKIIα activity upregulate the rate of spine addition, resulting in elevated spine density. Genetic elimination of CaMKIIα activity specifically eliminated the observed maturation-dependent suppression of spine formation. Enhanced spine formation was associated with the stabilization of actin in the spine and could be reversed by increasing the activity of the small GTPase Rap1. CaMKIIα activity was critical in the phosphorylation of synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein (synGAP), the dispersion of synGAP from postsynaptic sites, and the activation of postsynaptic Rap1. CaMKIIα is already known to be essential in learning and memory, but our findings suggest that CaMKIIα plays an important activity-dependent role in restricting spine density during postnatal development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a serine/threonine kinase that is highly expressed in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. CaMKIIα and β are the major isoforms expressed in the nervous system, and their expression is associated with distinct developmental profiles. Because α and β isoforms have unique biochemical properties, CaMKIIα and β have been proposed to play isoform-specific roles in specific developmental stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Synaptic accumulation of CaMKIIα in the late postnatal stage of forebrain development promotes the hypothesis that CaMKIIα selectively controls synaptic efficacy in the adult brain. However, no precise evaluation of neural circuit development based on imaging of individual synapses and dendritic spines has been conducted.</p>
<p id="Par3">The number of synapses in the rodent neocortex and hippocampus increases dramatically during the early postnatal stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of cortical pyramidal neurons revealed that extensive spine remodelling occurs in the early postnatal period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The total spine number peaks near postnatal week 3 and declines slowly thereafter. This developmental profile is regulated by the balance between spine addition and spine elimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Previous studies produced evidential support for the roles of plasticity-associated molecules in spine remodelling in the developing cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Of these plasticity-related signalling mechanisms, NMDA receptor-dependent signalling has been shown to be essential in long-term changes in synaptic functions and structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Genetic manipulation of NMDA receptor functions in the cortex dramatically affects the connectivity of thalamic afferents to cortical pyramidal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. CaMKIIα plays an important role in the phosphorylation of multiple target proteins, such as synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein (synGAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, in the signalling cascade downstream of NMDA receptor activation. CaMKIIα is involved in both synaptic efficacy and spine head enlargement during LTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, synGAP, a protein expressed in the postsynaptic density, may act downstream of CaMKIIα to regulate small GTPases Ras and Rap during LTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We previously generated knock-in mice lacking kinase activity but with physiological expression of a mutated CaMKIIα protein (K42R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This mouse model should be useful in detecting the regulatory functions of CaMKIIα-dependent signalling pathways in the development and maturation of synaptic connectivity in the mouse forebrain.</p>
<p id="Par4">The combination of the late onset of CaMKIIα accumulation, the important role of CaMKIIα in synaptic plasticity, and the involvement of NMDA receptor-dependent signalling in proper cortical neuron wiring led us to perform detailed structural analyses of dendritic spine development in hippocampal slice cultures from CaMKIIα (K42R) knock-in mice (CaMKIIα KI mice). We found that pyramidal neurons without CaMKIIα activity upregulated the rate of spine addition, which resulted in elevated spine density. This enhancement of spine formation was associated with the stabilization of actin in the spines and a reduction in the activity of the small GTPase Rap1. Our findings suggest that gradual increases in CaMKIIα activity in the postnatal forebrain may be effective in suppressing the rapid increase in spine synapse density via the activation of Rap1 signalling.</p>

<title>Enhancement of spine growth in CaMKIIα KI hippocampal slices</title>
<p id="Par5">Spine density increases until the third postnatal week in the rodent hippocampus and remains relatively constant thereafter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. To determine whether this developmental profile was preserved in a hippocampal slice culture, we expressed GFP in a small subset of neurons, performed high-resolution confocal imaging of multiple dendritic segments from CA1 pyramidal-shaped neurons, and measured spine density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). We confirmed similar profiles of spine density increases in these slice cultures. Specifically, spine densities in oblique, apical, and basal dendrites increased between 9 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) and 17 DIV, and plateaued after 17 DIV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b–d</xref>). Hippocampal slice cultures prepared from CaMKIIα KI and wild-type mice showed no differences in the survival of pyramidal neurons or the overall organization of the pyramidal cell layers. There were no significant differences in spine density, as measured at multiple dendritic subcompartments, in the early stage of maturation (9 DIV). However, CaMKIIα KI neurons continued to exhibit increased spine density even after 17 DIV, resulting in significant differences between the genotypes in all dendrite subcompartments (oblique, apical, and basal) at 24 DIV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b–d</xref>). To test whether the timing of arrest in spine increases correlated with the upregulation of CaMKIIα expression, we quantitated the level of CaMKIIα protein by western blot analysis of proteins extracted from hippocampal slice cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The expression profiles confirmed that CaMKIIα is upregulated from P10 to P16 and that its level stabilizes thereafter, irrespective of the genotype. Consistent with the result of a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, immunoblot analysis showed that phospho-CaMKIIα levels were decreased in CaMKIIα KI slices. However, the expression profiles of phospho-CaMKIIα levels showed trends similar to those of CaMKIIα in both genotypes (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). This expression profile of CaMKIIα was consistent with its role in the suppression of increased spine density in hippocampal slices after 17 DIV.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Spine densities of wild-type and CaMKIIα KI hippocampal neurons maintained in slice cultures.

<title>Dynamics and activity-dependent regulation of spines in CaMKIIα KI slices</title>
<p id="Par6">To investigate whether the increased spine density in CaMKIIα KI neurons resulted from increased spine addition or reduced spine elimination, we maintained slice cultures for approximately three weeks <italic>in vitro</italic> (19–22 DIV) and performed time-lapse imaging with an interval of 24 h. We then evaluated the turnover of dendritic spines on oblique dendritic branches (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a,b</xref>). The difference in spine density between CaMKIIα KI and wild-type mice was significant at this developmental stage. The rate of spine addition was slightly lower than the rate of spine elimination in wild-type mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>), a result that explains the stagnation of spine density after 17 DIV. Spine addition was significantly enhanced in CaMKIIα KI mice; however, spine elimination did not differ between the two genotypes. This specific enhancement of spine addition may be the mechanism underlying the observed sustained increase in spine density in CaMKIIα KI neurons.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Spine formation and elimination in CA1 pyramidal neurons in CaMKIIα KI and wild-type hippocampal slices. (<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>) Spines formed (arrows at Day2) and eliminated (arrows at Day1) in the oblique branches of CA1 pyramidal neurons in mature slices (19–23 DIV), as detected by time-lapse imaging of GFP-expressing cells over 24 h.

Data are presented as the mean ± SEM, n = 21 and 37 cells from 10 and 11 independent cultures of WT and KI control, n = 10 and 9 cells from 3 independent cultures of WT and KI APV treat ment, n = 13 and 23 cells from 4 independent cultures of WT and KI CNQX treat ment, ***p &lt; 0.001, t-test.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e550" xlink:href="41598_2017_13728_Fig2_HTML"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p id="Par7">Because ionotropic glutamate receptors are major upstream signalling molecules involved in CaMKII activation in neurons, we next tested whether the pharmacological blockade of either AMPA or NMDA receptors in slice cultures is involved in CaMKII-dependent spine regulation. Application of the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX or the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-V for 4 days (19 to 23 DIV) effectively eliminated the difference in spine density between CaMKIIα KI and wild-type neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). This observation is consistent with the idea that CaMKIIα activity negatively modulates spine formation via a pathway related to glutamate receptor signalling.</p>

<sec id="Sec5">
<title>CaMKII-dependent regulation of increased spine number and spine maintenance in dissociated neurons</title>
<p id="Par8">Analyses of hippocampal slice cultures provided strong evidence indicating that spine density regulation is CaMKIIα dependent. However, it could be argued that the spine phenotype is a result of prior effects of CaMKIIα on circuit formation and other non-synaptic functions. To evaluate this possibility, we next tested whether the acute blockade of CaMKII activity by specific inhibitors in dissociated hippocampal neurons can induce similar changes in spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). Previous studies have reported that CaMKIIα is upregulated in dissociated neurons maintained in culture for more than 2 weeks <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, we applied the CaMKII blocker KN93 to neurons and performed time-lapse imaging at 19 to 20 DIV. KN93 treatment induced the upregulation of spine turnover. The trends in spine gain and loss observed in these cultures were similar to those observed in slice cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). This result supports the idea that the effect of CaMKIIα suppression on late-stage spine turnover is not indirectly caused by developmental alterations in circuit formation. To test whether CaMKII activity can bidirectionally regulate spine development, we overexpressed either wild-type or kinase-dead K42R CaMKIIα in dissociated neurons at earlier time points (9–16 DIV), when CaMKIIα expression is still moderate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. We then monitored the increase in spine density from 14 to 16 DIV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c–f</xref>). For these experiments, we used K42R CaMKIIα as a control to compare the effects of the presence or absence of the enzymatic activity of exogenous CaMKIIα on spine density while keeping the level of overexpressed protein comparable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). As expected, overexpression of wild-type CaMKIIα specifically suppressed the increase in spine density; however, K42R CaMKIIα failed to suppress this increase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>). We did not attempt to evaluate the spine phenotype of CaMKIIα KI neurons in dissociated cultures because spine density and maturation-dependent regulation of spine turnover are sensitive to initial plating conditions. Nevertheless, the analyses of slices taken from CaMKIIα KI mice and dissociated neurons that were manipulated pharmacologically or with gene transfection revealed that spine turnover is regulated in a CaMKIIα-dependent manner in both slice and dissociated culture conditions.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Regulation of spine dynamics by CaMKII in dissociated neurons.

<title>Downregulation of the small GTPase Rap1 by CaMKII inactivation</title>
<p id="Par9">Ras and Rap are members of the Ras small GTPases and are involved in activity-dependent changes in synaptic function, spine morphology, and stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, these proteins are also known to be controlled by CaMKII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. To test whether Ras small GTPase activity is regulated by CaMKIIα, we quantitated the immunoreactivity of wild-type and CaMKIIα KI neurons in dissociated cultures, using antibodies that selectively recognize the active, GTP-bound conformation of Rap1 and Ras. Rap1 activity levels were specifically reduced in CaMKIIα KI neurons, whereas active Ras levels were not affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>).

<p id="Par10">This observation, as well as the observation that spine density is increased in CaMKIIα KI neurons, is consistent with a previous finding indigcating that the activation of Rap reduces spine size or density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. To further characterize the relationship between Rap1 activation and CaMKII activity in dendrites, we performed high-resolution imaging of synaptic Rap1 activation using the anti-active Rap1 antibody. The active Rap1 antibody recognized punctate structures along dendrites, and double-labelling with synaptic markers revealed that active-Rap1-positive punctae partially overlapped with presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1) or postsynaptic synGAP immunoreactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). This result suggests that Rap1 is activated in subsets of both presynaptic and postsynaptic components. Because the overlap between punctate structures that were immunopositive for presynaptic and postsynaptic markers was much lower than the overlap between two postsynaptic markers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>), we could judge whether active Rap1-positive puncta were presynaptic or postsynaptic. Using this criterion, we next tested whether the suppression of CaMKII activity by KN93 affects the level of active Rap1 at postsynaptic sites, as detected by synGAP immunoreactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). We observed that postsynaptic Rap1 activity is down-regulated in KN93-treated hippocampal neurons, suggesting that Rap1 is activated in a CaMKII-dependent manner even in the setting of basal neuronal activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>).</p>

Decay experiments involving actin tagged with photoactivatable GFP (PAGFP) in single spines have demonstrated the presence of fractions of stable and dynamic pools of actin and the decay time-constants of the dynamic pool (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The fraction of stable actin was significantly higher in CaMKIIα KI slice-cultured neurons than in wild-type neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>), suggesting that the spines in CaMKIIα KI neurons are more stable than those in wild-type neurons.

Both the increase in the size of the stable actin pool and the slower exchange of actin polymers are indicative of the stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in CaMKIIα KI neurons.

<title>Regulation of synGAP by CaMKII activity under basal conditions</title>
<p id="Par14">A recent study indicated that robust changes in the distribution of synGAP occur in response to CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation during LTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We next tested whether similar regulation of synGAP localization takes place even under basal conditions in dissociated hippocampal neurons. This culture preparation showed calcium transients at a frequency of &gt;0.2 Hz (data not shown), suggesting that the basal electrical activity was present within the neural network. We visualized the distribution of phosphorylated synGAP in neurons using an antibody specific to a phosphorylated serine residue S1123 of synGAP. This phosphorylation site was previously shown to be within a well-conserved CaMKII consensus sequence and can be phosphorylated by CaMKII <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We confirmed the specificity of this antibody by <italic>in situ</italic> dephosphorylation of fixed neurons in culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). S1123-phosphorylated synGAP showed a punctate distribution within dendrites and colocalized with PSD-95, suggesting that the proteins are localized at postsynaptic sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>). Neurons without suppression of endogenous firing activity showed variable levels of S1123-phosphorylation; however, TTX treatment eliminated this variability and greatly reduced the average intensity of the S1123-phosphorylation signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c,d</xref>). Suppression of CaMKII activity by KN93 induced a similar level of suppression of synGAP S1123 phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref>). Because synGAP phosphorylation by CaMKII triggered by LTP-inducing stimuli was shown to disperse synGAP from postsynaptic sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, we tested whether the blockade of endogenous CaMKII activity under basal conditions would change the synGAP distribution. The application of KN93 induced a higher level of synGAP clustering at the postsynaptic sites labelled by PSD-95 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7f and g</xref>). We found that the density of the synGAP clusters was not affected by KN93 treatment; however, the size of the clusters increased (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), suggesting that inhibiting CaMKII basal activity does not initiate the formation of new synGAP complexes at postsynaptic sites.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par15">In this study, we have provided evidence showing that CaMKIIα activity plays an indispensable role in restricting the density of spines on hippocampal pyramidal neurons during postnatal development. This CaMKIIα-dependent regulation is based on activity-driven suppression of increased spine development and is mediated by actin destabilization through the small GTPase Rap1, which may be functionally regulated by synGAP molecules. We propose that the postnatal increase in CaMKIIα expression in the hippocampus terminates the period of rapid increases in spine density by controlling actin stability through the small GTPase Rap1.</p>
<p id="Par16">LTP in the hippocampus is mediated by the opening of NMDA receptors and the subsequent activation of the CaMKII complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. We have shown previously that the enzymatic activity of CaMKIIα plays an essential role in the electrophysiological and structural changes associated with LTP by creating and analysing a kinase-dead CaMKIIα knock-in mouse strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In this work, we utilized this mouse strain and critically evaluated the role of CaMKIIα activity in the regulation of spine development and remodelling. In wild type mice, the upregulation of CaMKIIα protein expression was temporally correlated with the attenuation of spine development. In contrast, new spine addition exceeded spine elimination in CaMKIIα KI mice, resulting in the formation of mature pyramidal neurons with many more synaptic connections. Hence, CaMKIIα activity seems to be crucial for the negative control of spine density in the hippocampus. These findings indicate that CaMKIIα activity is not only important for LTP, as previously reported, but is also important for morphological plasticity during development. The contrast in the roles of CaMKIIα in spine development and plasticity regulation is remarkable. Future <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of spine dynamics by two-photon imaging of CaMKIIα KI mice will clarify the role of CaMKIIα activity in intact neural circuits during postnatal development.</p>
<p id="Par17">The relationship between CaMKII activity and synGAP-dependent signalling in synaptic plasticity is controversial. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of synGAP <italic>in vitro</italic> was reported to increase the RasGAP activity of synGAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, suggesting that CaMKII-dependent inhibition of Ras signalling occurs during LTP induction. However, this idea is inconsistent with the well-established model of LTP, in which CaMKII-dependent regulation of synGAP is thought to have positively affect Ras signalling. This conundrum was recently solved by elegant experiments showing that GFP-tagged synGAP is rapidly dispersed from spines during LTP induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In this study, we confirmed the localized phosphorylation of synGAP at postsynaptic sites in the setting of basal activity and the reduction of this phosphorylation by CaMKII inhibition. The phosphorylation state of synGAP was correlated with its dispersion from postsynaptic sites and may regulate local Rap1 activation. Our FRET imaging data for active Rap1 are consistent with the idea that Rap1 is activated locally within or near postsynaptic spines, where activated CaMKII phosphorylates synGAP and induces its dispersion. We propose that CaMKIIα activity positively regulates Rap1 by regulating the distribution of synGAP, resulting in the destabilization of F-actin and the suppression of increases in spine density.</p>
<p id="Par18">Questions remain regarding how synaptic activity and glutamate receptor activation regulate the CaMKIIα-dependent suppression of increased spine formation. Because the application of glutamate receptor antagonists rescued the spine phenotype in CaMKIIα KI slices, it can be concluded that basal synaptic activity is required for this phenomenon. The involvement of basal synaptic activity and associated CaMKII activation were confirmed by FRET imaging of Rap1 in the presence of the CaMKII antagonist KN93. Although a complex relationship exists among spine remodelling, CaMKIIα, glutamate receptors, and Rap1 GTPase, we propose a model of enhanced elimination of nascent spines by NMDA receptor activation and CaMKIIα (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>). This activity-dependent pruning does not operate in immature neural circuits, where CaMKIIα expression is low. At a later stage of neural circuit development, CaMKIIα-related signalling begins to operate and to eliminate nascent spines if no additional protective signals are provided. To maintain the appropriate balance between synaptic gain and loss, CaMKIIα-dependent pruning of immature spines may operate in parallel with LTP-like spine protective mechanisms, which are also dependent on CaMKIIα activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. A more thorough quantitative description of the temporal coding of calcium dynamics by the CaMKII complex may explain how multiple CaMKIIα-related signals operate on nascent spines and regulate their fate.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Model for the regulation of spine density by CaMKIIα activity. In the initial stage of spine formation, CaMKIIα has not yet been recruited to spines and Rap1 is not activated. In the subsequent step (arrow 1), glutamate receptors and CaMKIIα molecules begin to accumulate in spines, leading to the phosphorylation of synGAP, the dispersion of synGAP from postsynaptic sites, and the enhancement of local Rap1 activity. Increased Rap1 activity negatively regulates spine formation, possibly by destabilizing F-actin in spines (arrow 2). At a later stage, LTP-like spine-promoting mechanisms begin to operate (arrow 3).</p></caption><graphic id="d29e939" xlink:href="41598_2017_13728_Fig8_HTML"></graphic></fig>

The samples were extracted with 70 µl of SDS sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glucose, 1% (m/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 194 mM bromophenol blue) and boiled for 10 min at 94 °C. The extracts (corresponding to 10 to 30 µg of total protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane, washed with PBS and then blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies against CaMKIIα overnight at 4 °C. After being washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse ECL antibodies (Amersham) for 1 h, the signals were visualized using a Perkin Elmer ECL Chemiluminescence Imager. For the purpose of normalization, the membranes were stripped and incubated with antibodies against α-tubulin or β-actin. Several exposure times were used to obtain signals in the linear range.</p>

<title>Pull-down assay</title>
<p id="Par29">Wild-type and CaMKIIα KI littermate hippocampi were collected at P28 and homogenized with a Precellys homogenizer at 5000 RPM (2 × 5 s) in 250 µl of ice-cold lysis buffer (the pull-down kit lysis buffer was used, and Roche protease inhibitor complete EDTA-free and phosphatase inhibitors were added to the mixture). The P28 hippocampi corresponded to mature slice cultures that were prepared from P4 mice and maintained <italic>in vitro</italic> for an additional 24 days. We selected this stage of development for protein extraction based on the assumption that the speed of neuronal differentiation is similar between <italic>in vivo</italic> and in slice samples. The nuclei were pelleted at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined. The supernatant was used for the active GTPase assays, which were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The following amounts of protein were used for the pull-down assays: 650 µg of protein in the active Rap1 pull-down assay (Thermo Scientific) and 700 µg of protein in the active Ras pull-down assay (Thermo Scientific).</p>

<title>Intracellular injection</title>
<p id="Par30">For the intracellular injection of Alexa488 dye (Thermo Scientific), we fixed slice cultures with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30–40 min. Micropipettes filled with Alexa488 solution (5–10 mM) were inserted into the cell bodies or thick primary dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, after which a current (0.3–0.4 μA) was applied to the neurons for 3–5 min to deliver the fluorescent dye. The tip resistance of the micropipettes was 100–300 MΩ. The dye-loaded neurons were subsequently imaged, and the spine density was measured for the neurons treated with AP-V and CNQX (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>).</p>

<title>Imaging of organotypic slice cultures</title>
<p id="Par31">Live slice cultures were placed in a chamber containing Tyrode’s solution (in mM: 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 HEPES, 30 glucose, pH 7.4), and the chamber was maintained at 36 °C. Images were obtained on a BioRad Radiance (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a–c</xref>) or FV1000 confocal laser-scanning microscopes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a–e</xref>, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The EGFP was excited at 488 nm, and the emitted light was collected with a 500–550-nm band-pass filter. To analyse the spines, we captured a series of high-resolution images (512 × 128) using a 60× water immersion lens (NA 0.9–1.0) and collected images at an additional electric zoom factor of 2.5x–5x. Multiple optical sections (z-spacing of 0.5–0.7 µm) were collected. For each transfected neuron, several segments of apical oblique, apical main, and basal dendrites were imaged and used for spine analysis. The 3D image stacks were projected onto 2D images using an ImageJ maximum-brightness operation. We used the following spine addition and elimination criteria: spines identified on Day 1 that had completely disappeared or whose lengths were reduced (measured as a local increase in the dendrite contour) to &lt;3 pixels (corresponding to 0.15 μm in our imaging setup) were considered lost, and spines that clearly protruded from dendritic shafts at positions at which no spines had been detected on Day 1 and exhibited lengths &gt;3 pixels were considered formed. When the identity of a protrusion was unclear (that is, when it was unclear whether the protrusion was a single spine, two spines, or an axonal profile), the individual z images were re-examined. No effort was made to analyse spines emerging below or above the dendrite, as the resolution of the imaging system was lower in the z direction and insufficient for resolving spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Imaging of fixed slices with pyramidal neurons that were intracellularly injected with Alexa488 was performed with protocols similar to those described above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>).</p>

<title>Photoactivation of PAGFP-actin</title>
<p id="Par32">The expression of both DsRed2 and PAGFP-actin in the same neurons was achieved using a biolistic transfection method at 2 DIV. A mixed solution containing the expression plasmids for DsRed2 and PAGFP-actin was used to prepare DNA bullets. At 19–21 DIV, time-lapse images were obtained with a FV1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympu, Tokyo, Japan). A 60 × water immersion lens (NA 1.0) was used to acquire these images. PAGFP-actin and DsRed2 were excited by 473 and 559 nm lasers and detected by barrier filters of 490–540 and 575–675 nm, respectively. PAGFP-actin was activated by a 405-nm diode laser (~0.3 mW, 200-ms duration), and fluorescence decay was imaged every 15 s for 5 min. For data analysis, the regions of the spine heads were manually defined based on the DsRed2 signals. After subtraction of the background signals, the total fluorescence of PAGFP-actin on the spine head was measured at each frame. The stable fraction and time constant of PAGFP-actin were calculated by fitting the fluorescence decay to the following first order exponential decay equation using Origin 9.0 (Origin Lab):<disp-formula id="Equ1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

<title>FRET imaging of active Rap1</title>
<p id="Par33">Live cells were maintained at 37 °C in a chamber with a continuous flow of humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to maintain the pH of the medium. Images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus) with 60× or 100× oil immersion lenses (NA 1.1 or NA 1.3). The cells were excited by a 405 nm diode laser, and the fluorescence was detected by barrier filters of 465–495 nm (for CFP fluorescence) and 535–565 nm (for YFP fluorescence). The ratio images were created after subtraction of the fluorescence background value, as estimated from the fluorescence intensity of an imaged area with no discernible fluorescence. For presentation, we created a mask corresponding to the dendritic shape by automatic thresholding of CFP fluorescence. The ratio image was multiplied by the binary mask to produce the masked FRET image<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. New and persistent spines were classified by their life-time during FRET imaging sessions. Spines that appeared during 4-h imaging sessions and lasted for more than one image frame were classified as new spines, whereas spines that were present throughout the 4-h imaging sessions were classified as persistent spines. The data shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref> are from persistent spines, and the data shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref> compare the FRET signals in new spines at the first time point after their appearance with those in adjacent persistent spines.</p>
