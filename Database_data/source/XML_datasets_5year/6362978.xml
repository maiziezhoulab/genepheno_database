<sec id="S1">
<title>Purpose of review:</title>
<p id="P1">To provide an update of the most recent studies on Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) with a focus on the unique pattern of behavioral and sleep disturbances associated with the condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Recent findings:</title>
<p id="P2">The recent literature on SMS has focused on the characteristic severe behavioral and sleep disturbances. A better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and common clinical course has helped further characterize SMS, while much is left to be discovered in regard to effective treatment/management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Summary:</title>
<p id="P3">SMS is a difficult to manage genetic condition defined by pervasive and progressive behavioral and sleep disturbances with a unique pattern that can often be easily discerned from other neurodevelopmental disorders. Common behavioral features include maladaptive/self-injurious, aggressive, stereotypic, and the newly appreciated food seeking behaviors associated with SMS. In addition, there is a sleep disturbance defined by an altered circadian rhythm with frequent nighttime waking and daytime sleepiness, causing patients and families significant distress. Small studies have suggested some treatment/management approaches to the behavioral and sleep disturbances, however, a lot remains to be discovered.</p>
