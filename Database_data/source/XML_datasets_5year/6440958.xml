<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by dysfunction in social interactions, stereotypical behaviours and high co-morbidity with intellectual disability. A variety of syndromic and non-syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders have been connected to alterations in metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signalling. These receptors contribute to synaptic plasticity, spine maturation and circuit development. Here, we investigate the physiological role of <italic>Gprasp2</italic>, a gene linked to neurodevelopmental disabilities and involved in the postendocytic sorting of G-protein-coupled receptors. We show that <italic>Gprasp2</italic> deletion leads to ASD-like behaviour in mice and alterations in synaptic communication. Manipulating the levels of <italic>Gprasp2</italic> bidirectionally modulates the surface availability of mGluR<sub>5</sub> and produces alterations in dendritic complexity, spine density and synaptic maturation. Loss of <italic>Gprasp2</italic> leads to enhanced hippocampal long-term depression, consistent with facilitated mGluR-dependent activation. These findings demonstrate a role for <italic>Gprasp2</italic> in glutamatergic synapses and suggest a possible mechanism by which this gene is linked to neurodevelopmental diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">While genetic studies of ASD point to a complex and heterogeneous aetiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, common signalling pathways linked to this disorder include elements important for synapse formation and the regulation of synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. One of the most salient findings in animal models of ASD and intellectual disability (ID) is the presence of abnormal mGluR<sub>5</sub>-mediated synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These alterations are observed in animal models of Fragile X (FMRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, Phelan-McDermid (SHANK3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC1/TSC2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, Cowden (PTEN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, 16p11.2 microdeletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and Rett syndrome (MECP2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Type I mGluRs play an important role in synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> where their activation leads to internalization of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. In particular, mGluRs are essential in the removal and weakening of spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, circuit remodelling in the mouse somatosensory cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and in experience-dependent synaptic maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">At the synapse, mGluRs are anchored by SHANK and HOMER proteins in a complex that clusters together ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Deletion of <italic>Shank2</italic> or <italic>Shank3</italic> leads to autism-like behaviour and perturbations in synaptic comunication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, while altered mGluR<sub>5</sub>-HOMER scaffolds play a major contribution in the phenotype and synaptic deficits in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. At the same time, like most G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), mGluRs are highly regulated and desensitize following agonist binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, the role played by the endocytic sorting partners that determine the recycling or the degradation of these receptors remains underexplored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">The G-protein-coupled receptor associated sorting proteins (GPRASPs) comprise a large family of genes that interact and regulate trafficking of GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> such as delta opioid receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, D2 dopamine receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, muscarinic receptors, and mGluR<sub>1</sub> and mGluR<sub>5</sub> receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. GPRASP1-10 have been proposed to act in a cell type-specific manner to control the postendocytic fate of GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. From this large family of genes, <italic>GPRASP2</italic> is located within the Xq22.1 deletion syndrome region associated with severe ID in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, <italic>GPRASP2</italic> mutations have been found in autism and schizophrenia patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and the downregulation of this gene was observed in a large cohort of brain samples from autism patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that <italic>Gprasp2</italic> deletion could perturb key elements in synaptic maturation and induce alterations in synaptic activity in brain circuits relevant to ASD and ID by perturbing GPCR physiology. Using a combination of biochemical, electrophysiology, imaging and behavioural analysis, we show that GPRASP2 interacts and regulates mGluR<sub>5</sub>, that deletion of <italic>Gprasp2</italic> alters synaptic communication and enhances mGluR-long-term depression (LTD) in hippocampal circuits, and that <italic>Gprasp2</italic> knockout (KO) mice exhibit autism-like behaviours.</p>

<title><italic>Gprasp2</italic> knockout alters hippocampal neuronal morphology</title>
<p id="Par6">In order to understand the role of GPRASP2 in vivo we generated a novel conditional mouse line. For this, a germline deletion was created by crossing conditional <italic>Gprasp2</italic> F1 mice with a beta-Actin-Cre driver line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Confirmation of the null allele was performed using western blot, PCR, mRNA in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a–c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a–b</xref>). We were able to amplify <italic>Gprasp</italic> family members from the brain of P20 animals (with the exception of <italic>Gprasp5</italic>) and did not observe changes in their expression levels when comparing KO and littermate controls (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). <italic>Gprasp2</italic> KO mice backcrossed for at least five generations into C57/BL6 background were viable and did not display gross abnormalities with the exception of a significant increase in body weight starting from 12 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b–c</xref>). In this work, we studied male <italic>Gprasp2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> and <italic>Gprasp2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> littermates during the juvenile period (6- to 10-week-old), before significant physiological differences in body weight manifested (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). In wild-type (WT) mice, GPRASP2 protein levels peaked during postnatal days P15–P20 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>), which is an active period for synaptic contact refinement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In terms of regional expression, <italic>Gprasp2</italic> mRNA was enriched in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of young and adult mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e–g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a–i</xref>) and transiently high levels in the striatum of newborn (P5) mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2j–k</xref>). Regarding protein levels, GPRASP2 was found to be highly expressed in the hippocampus and hypothalamus (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2l</xref>). In humans, GPRASPs show wide tissue distribution (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), but GPRASP1-3 are the family members most expressed in the human brain.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><italic>Gprasp2</italic> knockout mice display structural alterations in hippocampal neurons. <bold>a</bold>

<p id="Par7">Since <italic>Gprasp2</italic> was enriched in the mouse hippocampus, we started by exploring if there were alterations in this region in the KO animals. We investigated the morphology of CA1 pyramidal neurons using an in vivo Golgi-like labelling, via peripheral injection of AAV9.hSyn.GFP (see Methods section). This procedure allowed for an unbiased labelling of neurons with well-separated dendritic branches (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>). Using Sholl analysis of reconstructed CA1 pyramidal neurons we found a reduction in dendritic arborisation and a decrease in total dendritic length in distal regions of mutant pyramidal neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1i</xref>). Analysis of basal and apical dendritic complexity also revealed a more striking effect on apical neuronal arborization (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a–b</xref>). Taking into account the expression of <italic>Gprasp2</italic> and the increase weight gain displayed by the KO mice, we analysed the hypothalamus for changes in neuronal complexity and dendritic spine density but found no alterations in either parameter (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a–c</xref>).</p>

<title>Functional alteration in synaptic transmission in <italic>Gprasp2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice</title>
<p id="Par8">Next, we investigated the hippocampus for functional alterations emerging from the deletion of <italic>Gprasp2</italic> and recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the CA1 area while stimulating Schaffer collateral fibres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). We found that <italic>Gprasp2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice presented significantly reduced fEPSP amplitudes when compared with WT littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, WT: 0.938 ± 0.104 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 7/3 slice/mice; KO: 0.615 ± 0.062 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 5/3 slice/mice; at 140 µA; values expressed as mean ± s.e.m.). To dissect this alteration and determine if presynaptic function was compromised, we measured the amplitude of negative peak 1 response (NP1; a measure of fibre depolarization) and assessed paired-pulse ratios (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>). No overt alterations in either parameter was identified, suggesting that field response deficits could arise from postsynaptic impairment in the CA3-CA1 circuit of <italic>Gprasp2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Deletion of <italic>Gprasp2</italic> impairs glutamatergic transmission. <bold>a</bold> Input–output curve shows fEPSPs are reduced in the hippocampus of <italic>Gprasp2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup>; WT <italic>n</italic> = 7/3 slice/mice, KO <italic>n</italic> = 5/3 slices/mice; two-way repeated measures ANOVA.

<title>GPRASP2 levels bidirectionally impact neuronal arborization and spine density</title>
<p id="Par13">Since compensation effects during brain development may occlude more striking synaptic alterations, we turned to dissociated primary cell cultures to further dissect the role of GPRASP2 in neuronal morphology and spine development. This way, we could perform acute manipulation to GPRASP2 and determine whether the alterations observed arise from a combination of cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous phenomena. We started by performing GPRASP2 knockdown studies using shRNA to determine the consequences of its decreased expression of in developing rat hippocampal neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). We found that neuronal complexity and total dendritic length were significantly reduced in neurons expressing a shRNA targeting the endogenous rat <italic>Gprasp2</italic>. These alterations could be rescued by co-expression of the murine form of GPRASP2 (which is not affected by the shRNA) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b, c</xref>). Acute knockdown of GPRASP2 very significantly reduced spine density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d, e</xref>), but did not induce changes to overall spine shape (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f–h</xref>). This experiment led to a modest significant increase in overall spine length and head diameter, suggesting a potential overshoot in terms of expression levels that could influence these spine parameters. To exclude other potential off-target effects of our knockdown system we also tested a second shRNA (shRNA II) targeting a different region of the GPRASP2 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Despite being less effective in reducing GPRASP2 expression (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a–c</xref>), shRNA II led to reduced neuronal complexity and spine density in rat hippocampal neuron cultures. These results highlight a considerable influence of GPRASP2 expression in neuronal morphology and spine maturation.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Cell-autonomous reduction in dendritic complexity and spine density in acute GPRASP2 knockdown. <bold>a</bold> Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with scramble shRNA (Scramble), shRNA against <italic>Gprasp2</italic> (shRNA) or GFP-GPRASP2 + shRNA (rescue) at DIV10 and analysed at DIV15. <bold>b</bold> Sholl analysis reveals reduced dendritic complexity in shRNA transfected neurons when compared with Scramble (effect of treatment **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and rescue (effect of treatment *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01); scramble <italic>n</italic> = 38, shRNA <italic>n</italic> = 30, rescue <italic>n</italic> = 37, from three independent preparations; two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. <bold>c</bold> GPRASP2 knockdown decreases total dendritic length when compared with scramble and rescue transfected neurons; scramble <italic>n</italic> = 38, shRNA <italic>n</italic> = 30, rescue <italic>n</italic> = 37, from three independent preparations; one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey multiple comparisons test. <bold>d</bold>–<bold>g</bold> GPRASP2 knockdown leads to decreased spine density (<bold>e</bold>), but no change in spine length (<bold>f</bold>) or head diameter (<bold>g</bold>) when comparing shRNA to scramble condition; scramble <italic>n</italic> = 24, shRNA <italic>n</italic> = 29, rescue <italic>n</italic> = 24, from three independent preparations; one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey multiple comparisons test. <bold>h</bold> When divided into spine types, dendritic spine density was decreased across most spine types following GPRASP2 overexpression, but no changes are observed when normalized to fractional counts; scramble <italic>n</italic> = 24, shRNA <italic>n</italic> = 29, rescue <italic>n</italic> = 24, from three independent preparations; one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey multiple comparisons test.

<p id="Par14">Next, we assessed if overexpression of GPRASP2 could also modulate spine and neuronal morphology. Interestingly, we found that increasing the expression levels of GPRASP2 promoted enhanced neuronal dendritic arborisation and increased dendritic length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a–c</xref>). Moreover, spine density, spine length and spine head diameter were significantly increased in GPRASP2-overexpressing neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d–g</xref>), consistent with a shift of spine morphology towards more mature spine types and reduction of filopodia-like spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>).

<title>GPRASP2 modulates mGluR<sub>5</sub> surface availability</title>
<p id="Par15">Since GPRASPs have been proposed to regulate mGluRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and since these receptors play a critical role in plasticity, spine morphology, synaptic communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and neurite elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, we decided to investigate if alterations in mGluR<sub>5</sub> could explain some of the changes we observed when manipulating <italic>Gprasp2</italic>. Considering the known role of GPRASPs in postendocytic sorting, we assessed if GPRASP2 and mGluR<sub>5</sub> interact and also, if the co-localization of GPRASP2 with markers of endocytic pathways is influenced by receptor activation. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we were able to pull-down mGluR<sub>5</sub> together with GPRASP2 in transfected HT-22 cells (a mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>). This biochemical interaction was not perturbed with receptor activation following 5- or 30-min of stimulation with 3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG, an mGluR<sub>5</sub> receptor agonist). We then tested if stimulation with DHPG would alter the co-localization of GPRASP2 with other endocytic proteins such as Clathrin light chain, Rab5, Rab7 and Lamp1. We found that a 5-min stimulation significantly increased the overlap between GPRASP2 and Lamp1, which is consistent with a role for GPRASP2 in lysosomal trafficking after agonist-mediated receptor internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6b</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par16">Next, to functionally test if the <italic>Gprasp2</italic> knockdown-induced alterations in neuronal morphology could be due to mGluR<sub>5</sub> activity, we repeated our in vitro experiments in the presence of MPEP (a selective antagonist for mGluR<sub>5</sub>) from DIV10 to DIV14. We found that MPEP treatment prevented <italic>Gprasp2</italic> knockdown-mediated reduction in neuronal arborization and recovered spine density to control conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a–f</xref>). Together, these results point to a mechanism whereby GPRASP2 leads to changes in mGluR-dependent activity by perturbing receptor trafficking.</p>
<p id="Par17">To better understand the consequences of bidirectionally altering the levels of GPRASP2 on mGluR physiology, we performed acute manipulations in vitro in the presence or absence of DHPG stimulation (100 µM for 30 min) and assessed changes to the endogenous levels of surface mGluR<sub>5</sub> and total mGluR<sub>1/5</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a–f</xref>). Our results showed that acute overexpression of GPRASP2 was sufficient to decrease surface mGluR<sub>5</sub> signal by 23 ± 4.57% compared with GFP expressing-control neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). Moreover, we found that upon overexpression of GPRASP2, the agonist-induced reduction in mGluR<sub>5</sub> surface expression could be partially occluded (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.053) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). Conversely, the knockdown of GPRASP2 increased surface mGluR<sub>5</sub> clusters by 28 ± 3.0% and effectively blocked DHPG-mediated changes in receptor levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d, f</xref>). This suggests that loss of GPRASP2 perturbs the normal mechanism of receptor internalization upon agonist-mediated activation.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Bidirectional regulation of mGluR<sub>5</sub> surface availability and enhanced mGluR-LTD in <italic>Gprasp2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Representative images from hippocampal neurons transfected with either GFP/GFP-GPRASP2 (<bold>a</bold>) or scramble/shRNA (<bold>b</bold>) in presence or absence of DHPG.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par23">Abnormal synaptic development and plasticity may underlie a common pathophysiology in various human cognitive disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Therefore, a better understanding of the cellular partners that regulate spine maturation, synaptic function, plasticity and mGluR physiology has the potential to provide valuable knowledge into disease mechanisms and contribute to the development of innovative therapies. We created a novel mouse model to study the role of GPRASP2 and found that its deletion leads to enhanced DHPG-mediated plasticity, weakened synaptic transmission, reduced number of mature spines in hippocampal neurons and altered PSD ultrastructure. In addition, the behavioural phenotype of the knockout mice is reminiscent of both ASD and ID, which supports the genetic data implicating <italic>GPRASP2</italic> in human neurodevelopmental disorders. Although our work is centred on the interaction and regulation of mGluR<sub>5</sub>, <italic>Gprasp2</italic> could also have an impact on additional GPCRs. Indeed, not only have GPRASPs been proposed to potentially regulate more than one type of receptor, the promiscuous interaction between mGluRs and other GPCRs implies that GPRASP2 could modulate other receptors directly or indirectly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Regardless, our experimental evidence clearly shows that the depletion of <italic>Gprasp2</italic> strongly impacts synaptic physiology and mGluR function.</p>
<p id="Par24">Interestingly, <italic>Gprasp1</italic> knockout mice display behavioural dysfunctions linked to striatal and dopamine function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, whereas the high expression levels of <italic>Gprasp2</italic> in the striatum is transient. Moreover, the physiological importance of <italic>Gprasp1</italic> and <italic>Gprasp2</italic> may be crucial in mammals, since a small genetic deletion containing both these genes produces neonatal lethality in homozygous animals and severe developmental complications in heterozygous progeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par25">At their core, behavioural and cognitive dysfunctions will most likely arise from multi-mode alterations across a combination of circuits. Hence, it is tempting to speculate on the severity of the behavioural phenotypes displayed by <italic>Gprasp2</italic> mutant mice and the brain regions where this gene is most highly expressed. Particularly, juvenile animals strongly express <italic>Gprasp2</italic> in the hippocampal formation but also across various hypothalamic nuclei. Future studies should aim at dissecting circuit-specific dysfunction arising from <italic>Gprasp2</italic> deletion.</p>
<p id="Par26">More broadly, our data adds to the evidence that mGluR activity is strongly implicated in neurodevelopmental disabilities and highlights the view that modulating neuronal endocytic partners may open new therapeutic avenues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Our work also provides mechanistic insight into the endogenous regulation of mGluRs by GPRASP2 and supports the role of pathological mutations in <italic>GPRASP2</italic> leading to ASD- and ID-linked behaviours.</p>

The assay consisted of three sessions: the first session began with a 20-min habituation period during which the subject mouse freely explored all three chambers; next, the mouse was confined to the centre chamber and an empty wire cage (Empty—‘E’) and a cage with an unfamiliar mouse (Stranger 1—‘S1’) were introduced to the side-chambers; in the second session, the subject mouse was then allowed to freely explore all three chambers for 10 min. Following the 10-min session, the animal remained in the chamber for an extra 10 min (post-test) to better acquire the identification cues from ‘S1’ animal. Before the third and last session, the subject mouse was gently guided to the centre chamber while the empty wire cage was replaced with a caged WT stimulus mouse (Stranger 2—‘S2’). In the last session, the subject mouse was then left explored all three chambers for 10 min. Stimulus mice were males of the same age and previously habituated to the wire cages. The positions of the empty cage and ‘S1’ were alternated between tests. No position bias was observed.

<title>Dyadic social interaction test</title>
<p id="Par33">Mice were tested for reciprocal social interaction, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Age-, sex- and weight-matched C57BL/6 males unfamiliar with the tested <italic>Gprasp2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice and WT littermates were used as stimulus partners and their paws marked one week prior to the experiment. The test was performed in an open arena (40 × 40 × 30 cm) filled with fresh bedding. Illumination on the arena floor was kept at 100 lx during the test and the chamber was cleaned with 70% ethanol in between trials. The target mouse was removed from the homecage and placed on one side of the chamber and separated by a solid partition from the matched partner. After the 10-min acclimatization period, the barrier was removed and social interactions were recorded for 30 min. Social interactions were divided into two different categories, First, reciprocated or bidirectional social interaction is when the target mouse (WT/KO) engaged with the stimulus and the latter reciprocate by allogrooming or sniffing. On the other hand, non-reciprocated interaction is considered when the target mouse (WT/KO) initiated the social approach, but the stimulus did not reciprocate by ignoring or turning away from the test mouse. Trials involving animals engaged in fighting for more than 30 s without interruption were terminated. Quantification of these behaviours were scored manually by observers blinded to the genotype of the animals using the Observer XT 9 software (Noldus, Netherland).</p>

Habituation was done by exposing the animal to the arena for 10 min. The following day, in the familiarization session, mice were placed in the arena in the presence of two identical objects for 10 min. After a retention interval of 6 h, mice were again introduced in the arena with one familiar and one novel object. Mice were allowed to explore for 10 min. The objects chosen for this experiment were a 25-mL tissue culture flask filled with sand and a plastic Lego, both approximately the same height and weight.

The mice were placed in the initial part of the stem and allowed to explore the maze. After the animal entered one of the arms, a sliding door was placed in the initial part of the arm chosen, allowing the mouse to explore the chosen arm. After a 30 s retention period, the animal was gently removed and returned to the homecage. Next, the animal was returned to the start arm and a second run was initiated. Directions of choice was recorded for each mouse and the percentage of alternation obtained. Five trials (two runs each) were conducted in the space of two consecutive days (three on the first day and two on the second). The floor in the maze was illuminated at 15–20 lux.</p>

Six weeks post-injection, animals were sacrificed, the brain collected and processed for neuronal imaging. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with PBS followed by 4% PFA in PBS, pH 7.4. Whole-brain was dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h, followed by transfer to a 30% sucrose solution in PBS. Serial coronal sections of 100 μm were collected using a vibratome (Leica VT1200s, Leica Microsystems, USA) and mounted in gelatinized slides using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) as mounting medium. Slides were stored at 4 °C protected from light until further analysis. Images of pyramidal neurons from the CA1 region of the hippocampus were acquired in a LSM 710 Confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with a Plan Apochromat 20x/0.8 DICII lens. Each image consisted of a stack of images taken through the z-plane of the section. Confocal microscope settings were kept the same for all scans in each experiment. Neurons expressing GFP were chosen randomly for quantification from at least four different sections containing the region of interest and at least six neurons were acquired per animal. Neuronal tracing reconstruction was performed using Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience). Spines on secondary dendrites of hippocampal neurons were acquired using a LSM 710 Confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with a Plan Apochromat 63x/1.4 NA oil objective. Spine density and size analysis was performed using Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience). Each spine was included in one of two categories: immature spines which included filopodia (spines without a defined head) and mature spines which included stubby (spines without a defined neck); thin spines (with a neck and head diameter smaller than double the width of the neck) and mushroom spines (with a neck and head diameter larger than double the width of the neck).

The hippocampus was visualized with an Axio Examiner.D1 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a Q-capture Pro7 camera (QImaging, Canada) and fEPSPs were recorded in CA1 stratum radiatum using a borosilicate glass (Science Products) recording electrode filled with aCSF (2–4  MΩ) and placed at the depth in the slice that gave the largest signal amplitude followed by a stable signal response for 10 min. Evoked responses were obtained by stimulating the Schaffer collaterals at 0.05 Hz with a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode (0.2 ms stimulus; Bowdoin, ME, USA) connected to a stimulator Digitimer model DS3 (Digitimer, UK). The current applied was calculated as 50% of the maximal response in an input–output curve starting at 20 µA with 10 µA increments. The LTD protocol consisted in attaining a stable baseline for 20 min followed by application of 50 µM (S)-3,5-DHPG (Tocris, Bristol, UK) for 5 min and performing continuous recording for an additional 55 min. Field potentials were filtered at 0.1 Hz–1 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Basal synaptic transmission was assessed with the input–output curve and via paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) according to protocols described in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes Amersham Hybond (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) blocked at room temperature (RT) for 1 h in ×TBS with 5% milk + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight before washing in TBS-T and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:10,000) of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey (anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 120 min at room temperature. Following three time washes in TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with ECL western blot substrate (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Signal was visualized on a Storm 860 Gel and Blot Imaging System (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Antibodies used in western blotting experiments were the following: anti-PSD-95 (6G6-1C9, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-PSD-93 (N18/275-284, 1:1000 NeuroMab), anti-CAMK2a (6G9, 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich), GluA1 (AB1504, 1:1000, Millipore), GluA2 (MAB397, 1:1000, Millipore) and anti-GPRASP2 (ab129417, 1:100; Abcam or 12159-1-AP, 1:1000; Proteintech).

<title>Hippocampal neuron primary cultures</title>
<p id="Par54">Low-density primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were prepared from the hippocampi of E18 Wistar rat embryos, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Briefly, after dissection the tissue was treated for 15 min at 37 °C with trypsin (0.06%, Gibco Invitrogen) in Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free Hank’s balanced salt solution [HBSS (in mM): KCl 5.36, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 0.44, NaCl 137, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 4.16, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O 0.34, glucose 5, sodium pyruvate 1, HEPES 10 and 0.001% phenol red]. Cells were then washed six times in HBSS and mechanically dissociated. Cells were plated in neuronal plating medium (MEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, 0.6% glucose and 1 mM pyruvic acid) onto poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips in 60 mm culture dishes, at a final density of 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/dish. After 2–4 h, coverslips were flipped over an astroglial feeder layer in Neurobasal medium [supplemented with SM1 neuronal supplement (StemCell Technologies, Grenoble, France), 25 μM glutamate, 0.5 mM glutamine and 0.12 mg/ml gentamycin]. Wax dots on the neuronal side of the coverslips allowed the physical separation of neurons from the glia, despite neurons growing face down over the feeder layer. To further prevent glia overgrowth, neuron cultures were treated with 5 µM cytosine arabinoside after 3 DIV. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% air. Neurons were transfected at (1) DIV7 and imaged at DIV15 for GPRASP2 overexpression experiments labelling PSD-95 and VGLUT1; (2) DIV11 and imaged at DIV17 (to attain more mature neurons) in spine and Sholl analysis and (3) DIV10 and imaged at DIV15 for GPRASP2 knockdown experiments, due to higher toxicity of the shRNA construct. The rescue construct used to express GPRASP2 coded the fusion protein GPRASP2-GFP and was cloned in-house (see below). The shRNA constructs targeting Rat GPRASP2 mRNA are described below. The experiments using MPEP incubation proceeded as described above, but MPEP at a concentration of 20 µM was added each day from DIV10 to DIV14.</p>

<title>Plasmid constructions</title>
<p id="Par55">The full-length mouse coding sequence for GPRASP2 (aa 584-919) was amplified by PCR from BAC DNA clones (RP23-160E, RP23-250G; Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, USA) and cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, USA) using restriction enzymes (XhoI, KpnI). The cloning was confirmed by restriction digestion analysis and sequencing. In order to knockdown GPRASP2, four unique short hairpin RNA (shRNA and shRNA II) sequences that target rat GPRASP2 and one non-targeting sequence (negative control) were tested (Catalogue# 336311 KR54520G; SureSilencing, Qiagen). Each plasmid vector expressed a shRNA under the control of a U1 promoter and contained a GFP reporter gene. The shRNA nucleotide sequences tested were (1) shRNA: 5′-AAGCCCAGGTCCAAACAAGAT-3′; shRNA II: 5′-ATTCGTGGGTCTCTTTAATAT-3′; Scramble sequence: 5′-GGAATCTCATTCGATGCATAC-3′. The full-length mGluR<sub>5b</sub> was amplified by PCR from a mouse brain cDNA library and cloned into pCerulean C1 with EcoRI/SalI restriction sites; in a next cloning step Cerulean was removed using PCR-mediated plasmid deletion to create Cerulean and Cerulean-free pmGluR<sub>5b</sub>. Cloning was confirmed by restriction digestion analysis and sequencing.</p>

Neurons were then incubated in 10% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C to block non-specific staining and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies diluted in 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS (overnight at 4 °C). The following primary antibodies and dilutions were used: anti-MAP2 (ab5392, 1:5000, Abcam), anti-PSD-95 (MA1-045, 1:750, Thermo Fischer), anti-mGluR<sub>1/5</sub> (75-116, 1:200, NeuroMab), anti-VGLUT1 (AB5905, 1:5000, Millipore). After washing six times in PBS, cells were incubated with the respective secondary antibodies diluted in 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS (45 min at 37 °C): Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse (A-11004, 1:500, Molecular Probes), Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit (A11008, 1:500, Molecular Probes), AMCA-conjugated anti-chicken (103-155-155, 1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Alexa 647-conjugated anti-guinea pig (A-21450, 1:500, Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted using fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, no. S3023). For quantification of surface mGluR<sub>5</sub>, neurons were incubated with 100 μM (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG; Tocris) or vehicle (dH<sub>2</sub>O) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following washing with PBS, cells were re-incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to allow receptor internalization. Neurons were fixed and incubated o.n. with the mGluR<sub>5</sub> intracellular N-terminus antibody (AGC-007, 1:100, Alomone Labs). Next, as indicated above and for further staining of neuronal proteins, each coverslip was washed, permeabilized and incubated in 10% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C to block non-specific staining. The remaining labelling procedure was performed as described above.</p>

<title>Imaging and quantitative analysis of hippocampal neuron cultures</title>
<p id="Par57">Imaging was performed on an Axio-observer Z1 microscope using a Plan Apochromat 63x/1.4 NA oil objective. For each experiment, images in each channel were captured using the same exposure time across all fixed cells. Images were quantified using image analysis software FIJI (FIJI Is Just ImageJ) with custom made macros. For each neuron, two to three dendrites were chosen for analysis from the dendritic marker image and their length was measured using MAP2 staining. The staining signals were analysed after thresholding and recognizable clusters under those conditions were included in the analysis, and measured for cluster signal intensity, number of clusters, and average area of clusters for the selected region. Measurements were performed in two to five independent preparations with at least five cells per condition analysed for each preparation.</p>
<p id="Par58">Neuron culture spine imaging was performed on an Axio-observer Z1 microscope using a Plan Apochromat 63x/1.4 NA oil objective.

Automated spine quantification was performed using NeuronStudio software (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). For Sholl analysis, transfected neurons were chosen randomly for quantification and at least six neurons were acquired per condition. Images were acquired as described before using a Plan Apochromat 20x/0.8 DICII lens and traced in Neurolucida (MBF Biosciences) and quantification was performed using Neuroexplorer (MBF Bioscience).</p>
