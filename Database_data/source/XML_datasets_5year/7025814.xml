<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p id="P1">The study of genetic factors associated with BD can be safely said to have entered a mature phase, with the appropriate capacity to begin to provide the long awaited insights into the pathophysiology of BD. These advances have been made possible by technological innovations such as large-scale microarray genotyping and next generation sequencing, which have been applied in a comprehensive genome-wide manner to large samples. Several genes have now been robustly associated with BD and in 2016 analyses by the PGC are expected to yield many more similar findings. The initial fruits of such efforts will be to identify molecular targets and pathways that provide insights into the underlying biology of BD and thereby facilitate novel drug development. Eventually, as the field progresses and a greater proportion of heritability is accounted for, more immediate clinical applications such as risk stratification and biologically informed drug selection may also become feasible. However, to keep pace with the technological advances, there is a pressing need now for clinical care to “partner” with research and provide both the samples sizes and the relevant phenotypes necessary to fulfill the promise of precision medicine.</p>
