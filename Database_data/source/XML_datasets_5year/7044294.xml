<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Pogo transposable element derived with ZNF domain (<italic>POGZ</italic>) has been identified as one of the most recurrently de novo mutated genes in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and White-Sutton syndrome; however, the neurobiological basis behind these disorders remains unknown. Here, we show that POGZ regulates neuronal development and that ASD-related de novo mutations impair neuronal development in the developing mouse brain and induced pluripotent cell lines from an ASD patient. We also develop the first mouse model heterozygous for a de novo <italic>POGZ</italic> mutation identified in a patient with ASD, and we identify ASD-like abnormalities in the mice. Importantly, social deficits can be treated by compensatory inhibition of elevated cell excitability in the mice. Our results provide insight into how de novo mutations on high-confidence ASD genes lead to impaired mature cortical network function, which underlies the cellular pathogenesis of NDDs, including ASD.</p>

<p id="Par2">De novo mutations significantly contribute to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here, the authors demonstrate that ASD-associated de novo mutations in the POGZ gene, one of a high-confidence ASD gene, lead to ASD-related impaired neuronal development and disrupted mature cortical network function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), are characterized by early life onset with aberrant brain development, leading to social and cognitive abnormalities that span a wide range of functions and are highly heterogeneous among individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Since the prevalence rate of NDDs has recently been increasing dramatically, NDDs are becoming a significant medical and social burden. Among NDDs, the prevalence rate of ASD is considerable, estimated to be ~1 in 40 children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Despite the high heritability of ASD, recent studies have suggested that the disease is highly genetically heterogeneous, with rare genetic variants as well as common variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and that the genetic cause is unidentified in ~90% of patients with the condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the molecular etiology of ASD remains largely unclear. There are no pharmacological medications to treat the core symptoms of ASD; mechanism-based drug development and therapeutic strategies are imperative.</p>
<p id="Par4">Genetic and epidemiological studies have suggested that de novo mutations, spontaneous rare mutations that appear in an affected child but not in the unaffected parents, significantly contribute to ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and that ~3–10% of ASD risk is explained by de novo mutations in exons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Importantly, a recent, comprehensive exome analysis has identified 65 high-confidence ASD genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Although, among these high-confidence ASD genes, recent studies have found that haploinsufficiency of <italic>ARID1B</italic> or <italic>CHD8</italic> causes ASD-related abnormalities in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, further direct assessments of the biological significance of ASD-associated de novo mutations are necessary to fully understand the contribution of de novo mutations to the core features of ASD.</p>
<p id="Par5">We and other groups have found that Pogo transposable element derived with ZNF domain (<italic>POGZ</italic>) is one of the most recurrently mutated genes in patients with NDDs, particularly ASD and ID; the number of reported mutations continues to increase (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>; we classified patients into ASD, ID, and White–Sutton syndrome according to the original diagnosis in each report)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. <italic>POGZ</italic> mutations are also recurrently found in patients with White–Sutton syndrome, characterized by ID and specific facial features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. POGZ interacts with the SP1 transcription factor, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), and chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, which suggests that POGZ functions as a chromatin regulator; however, the role of POGZ in brain development and the biological significance of ASD-associated de novo POGZ mutations in the etiology of ASD are largely unknown.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>ASD-related de novo mutations in POGZ impair the nuclear localization of the POGZ protein.</title><p><bold>a</bold> De novo mutations in POGZ identified in patients with NDDs (blue, ASD; green, ID; red, both ASD and ID; purple, unclassified NDDs). <bold>b</bold> De novo mutations in POGZ identified in unaffected controls. <bold>c</bold> The number of missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations identified in patients with NDDs and unaffected controls. <bold>d</bold> Distribution of POGZ mutations identified in patients with NDDs and unaffected controls (blue, missense mutations; red, nonsense mutations; green, frameshift mutations). <bold>e</bold>, <bold>g</bold> ASD-related nonsense <bold>e</bold> or missense <bold>g</bold> mutations disrupted the nuclear localization of Myc-tagged overexpressed mouse (m) POGZ in Neuro2a cells.

<p id="Par6">In this study, we developed the first mouse model that carried a pathogenic de novo mutation of <italic>POGZ</italic> identified in an ASD patient. From the same patient, we established induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with the same de novo POGZ mutated (Q1042R) as the model mouse. Comprehensively examining these human and mouse materials, we determined that the de novo mutation in <italic>POGZ</italic> impaired the cellular localization of the POGZ protein and hindered cortical neuronal development. We also determined that this de novo mutation in <italic>POGZ</italic> caused ASD-related behavioral abnormalities and that these abnormalities were pharmacologically treatable even in adulthood. Importantly, de novo <italic>POGZ</italic> mutations identified in unaffected controls had no damaging effect on POGZ function in neuronal development. Together, these observations provide the first in vivo evidence suggesting that ASD-associated de novo mutations in a high-confidence ASD gene are critical for a wide range of processes involved in ASD pathogenesis.</p>

<title>De novo mutations in POGZ impair its nuclear localization</title>
<p id="Par7"><italic>POGZ</italic> has been identified as one of the most recurrently de novo-mutated genes in patients with NDDs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, c, d</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>; the amino acid numbers are based on the human protein). The vast majority of de novo <italic>POGZ</italic> mutations identified in patients with NDDs are nonsense and frameshift mutations and distributed between the C2H2 Zn finger and centromere protein-B-like DNA-binding (CENP-DB) domains and in the CENP-DB domain itself (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, c</xref>). In contrast, all de novo <italic>POGZ</italic> mutations identified in unaffected controls (control de novo mutations) are missense mutations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Interestingly, while control de novo missense mutations are uniformly distributed in POGZ, many NDDs-related nonsense and frameshift mutations are positioned just upstream of the CENP-DB domain, implying that impaired CENP-DB domain function could contribute to the risk of NDDs, including ASD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). We examined the deleterious effect of sporadic-ASD-associated de novo missense mutations within the CENP-DB domain and nonsense mutations resulting in the elimination or truncation of the CENP-DB domain. Since the amino acid sequences of the human and mouse POGZ are very similar (93.9% identified in amino acid sequence) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), we think that each mouse mutation is likely to correspond to the respective human mutation. Previous studies have suggested that POGZ is localized to the nucleus and functions as a chromatin regulator, we therefore assume that the ASD-related de novo mutations may alter the nuclear localization of POGZ. To examine this possibility, we firstly conducted immuno-cytochemical experiments using ASD-related missense mutants, E1036K (E1040K in human POGZ)- and Q1038R (Q1042R in human POGZ)-mutated POGZ, as well as E1043X (E1047X in human POGZ)-mutated POGZ, the longest nonsense-mutated POGZ, and found that these mutations partially impaired the nuclear localization of POGZ (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). We next performed cellular fractionation experiments and determined that, in contrast to the nuclear localization of overexpressed wild-type (WT)-mouse (m) POGZ, R997X (R1001X in human POGZ)-, R1004X (R1008X in human POGZ)-, and E1043X (E1047X in human POGZ)-mPOGZ mutants, which entirely or partially lack the CENP-DB domain exhibited aberrant distribution in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e, f</xref>; the amino acid numbers are based on the mouse protein). We also observed that the E1036K (E1040K in human POGZ)- and Q1038R (Q1042R in human POGZ)-mPOGZ mutants also exhibited aberrant distribution in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g, h</xref>; the amino acid numbers are based on the mouse protein). Interestingly, in contrast to the ASD-related mutants, the de novo R1005H-, F1051L-, and H1084R-mPOGZ mutants, which harbor missense mutations within or adjacent to the CENP-DB domain identified in unaffected controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, d</xref>), showed similar protein expression patterns to WT-mPOGZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1i, j</xref>; the amino acid numbers are based on the mouse protein). Additionally, we performed cellular fractionation experiments using human SH-SY5Y cells and the human Q1042R-mutated POGZ and obtained essentially the same results as the results with the mouse Q1038R mutation in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g, h</xref> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). These results suggest that ASD-related de novo mutations but not control de novo mutations identified in unaffected controls impair the nuclear localization of POGZ in cells.</p>

<title>POGZ regulates the development of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs)</title>
<p id="Par8">To elucidate the function of POGZ in the brain, we first investigated the temporal, regional, and cell type-specific expression pattern of <italic>Pogz</italic> in the mouse brain. Temporally, expression of <italic>Pogz</italic> gradually increased during embryonic neurogenesis from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) to E18.5 and began to decrease after birth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). At E16.5, <italic>Pogz</italic> was highly expressed in the cortical NSCs and intermediate progenitor cells (IPs) in the ventricular and subventricular zones (VZ/SVZ) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>). These expression patterns suggest that POGZ plays an important role in cortical neuronal development. To determine the role of POGZ in cortical neuronal development, we knocked down the expression of <italic>Pogz</italic> using four distinct commercial shRNAs (MISSION TRC shRNA library SP1, SIGMA-Aldrich) and a miR30-based shRNA (shRNA<sup>miR30</sup>) targeting <italic>Pogz</italic> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>, Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Plasmids encoding each shRNA against <italic>Pogz</italic> and GFP were coelectroporated into the lateral ventricle of E14.5 mouse forebrains. The electroporated embryos were allowed to develop until E18.5 and histologically analyzed for migration of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the developing somatosensory cortex. We determined that the migration of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly inhibited by <italic>Pogz</italic> knockdown, which was roughly proportional to the knockdown efficiency of each construct (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4b–i</xref>). The impaired migration was rescued by forced expression of WT-mPOGZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d, e</xref>). Using antibodies against cortical layer markers, we then immunostained GFP<sup>+</sup> cells whose migration was delayed by <italic>Pogz</italic> knockdown, and we determined that <italic>Pogz</italic> knockdown had little effect on the proportion of SATB2<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> (layer II/III), CTIP2<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> (layer V) or TBR1<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> (layer VI) neurons and that the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells with delayed migration were mostly SATB2<sup>+</sup> neurons, representing neurons with young upper cortical characteristics (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f–k</xref>). Considering the high expression of <italic>Pogz</italic> in NSCs during cortical neuronal development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>), the delaying of migration by <italic>Pogz</italic> knockdown may be due to impaired neuronal differentiation. We analyzed the proportion of GFP<sup>+</sup> NSCs, IPs, and neurons at E16.5 (2 days after in utero electroporation) and determined that <italic>Pogz</italic> knockdown increased the proportion of PAX6<sup>+</sup> NSCs and decreased the proportion of TBR2<sup>+</sup> IPs and SATB2<sup>+</sup> young neurons without significantly affecting migration in the somatosensory cortex within 2 days (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a–h</xref>). These data suggest that POGZ regulates cortical neuronal development by promoting neuronal differentiation.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>POGZ regulates the mouse cortical neuronal development.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Temporal expression patterns of <italic>Pogz</italic> mRNA in the brain (each <italic>n</italic> = 3).

<title>POGZ mutations impair POGZ function in neuronal development</title>
<p id="Par9">We investigated the effect of ASD-related de novo mutations on embryonic cortical neuronal development using in utero electroporation gene delivery in E14.5 embryos. We determined that forced expression of the ASD-related mPOGZ mutants failed to rescue the <italic>Pogz</italic>-knockdown-mediated migration defect at E18.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>). In contrast to the ASD-related mPOGZ mutants, control mPOGZ mutants, including the R1005H-, F1051L- and H1084R-POGZ mutants, rescued the <italic>Pogz</italic>-knockdown-mediated migration defect to virtually the same level as WT-mPOGZ expression at E18.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c, d</xref>). Thus, the ASD-related de novo mutations, but not the control de novo mutations identified in unaffected controls, disrupt the function of POGZ in embryonic cortical neuronal development, implying the pathogenicity of the ASD-related de novo mutations in cortical neuronal development. We then performed overexpression experiments using ASD-related de novo mutated POGZ using WT embryos. We determined that the expression of R1004X-, E1036K-, Q1038R- and E1043X-mutated POGZ impaired the migration of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in WT neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>), suggesting that the de novo mutations show a dominant-negative effect upon cell migration. Considering that the de novo-mutated POGZ showed reduced nuclear localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), abnormally localized de novo-mutated POGZ in the cytoplasm might inhibit the function of endogenous POGZ (e.g., abnormally localized de novo-mutated POGZ may titrate the interaction partner of POGZ in the cytoplasm). Alternatively or in addition, WT and de novo-mutated POGZ might compete each other in the nucleus.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>ASD-related POGZ mutations impair neuronal development.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Forced expression of the ASD-related POGZ mutants failed to rescue the <italic>Pogz</italic>-knockdown-mediated migration defect in the developing mouse cortex.

<title>Neuronal differentiation is impaired in NSCs derived from a patient with sporadic ASD carrying a de novo Q1042R mutation of POGZ</title>
<p id="Par10">We investigated the effect of the ASD-related de novo mutation on NSCs derived from a patient with sporadic ASD. We previously recruited Japanese sporadic autism trios and identified an ASD patient carrying the Q1042R mutation of POGZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We established iPSC lines using immortalized B cells obtained from that patient and an unaffected healthy control (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>) and differentiated each iPSC lines into NSCs. ASD-patient-derived and control NSCs were seeded into neuronal differentiation medium on day 0 of neuronal differentiation. Then the number of MAP2<sup>+</sup> neurons was analyzed at day 2, when they were in an early stage of neuronal differentiation. The proportion of MAP2<sup>+</sup> neurons was significantly lower in the patient-derived NSCs than in the control NSCs, suggesting that neuronal differentiation is impaired in the patient-derived NSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e, f</xref>). We then analyzed the self-renewal activity of the patient-derived NSCs. We determined that the neurospheres from patient-derived NSCs were larger than those from control NSCs and that the patient-derived NSCs exhibited higher bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation than the control NSCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>). Furthermore, we performed an in vitro migration assay in which newborn neurons migrate outwards radially from neurospheres after adhesion, and we determined that the radial migration of young neurons was significantly attenuated in the patient-derived NSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4h, i</xref>). Taken together, these results show that, consistent with the impaired cortical neurogenesis induced by <italic>Pogz</italic> knockdown in mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>), the neuronal differentiation is impaired in patient-derived NSCs.</p>

<p id="Par14">Given that POGZ interacts with HP1 and CHD4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and is suggested to bind DNA, POGZ may modulate the neuronal differentiation of NSCs through regulation of gene expression. To examine this possibility, we performed RNA-sequencing on NSCs derived from the ASD patient carrying the de novo Q1042R mutation of POGZ and E16.5 embryonic cortex of <italic>POGZ</italic><sup>WT/Q1038R</sup> mice (significant results are shown in Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). We then analyzed gene ontology (GO) annotation of the differentially expressed genes between the unaffected healthy control and patient, and WT and <italic>POGZ</italic><sup>WT/Q1038R</sup> mice and found that the differentially expressed genes in human and mice were commonly enriched for GO annotations involving cellular and organismal development, particularly neuronal development (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">13a</xref>). In particular, 78 out of 913 and 251 genes annotated to neurogenesis (GO: 0022008) in human and mouse, respectively, showed commonly differential expression between human and mouse (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Considering that POGZ represses gene transcription in hematopoietic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, we focused on the upregulated genes in NSCs derived from the patient and <italic>POGZ</italic><sup>WT/Q1038R</sup> mice.

We observed that <italic>POGZ</italic><sup>WT/Q1038R</sup> mice showed slightly increased home-cage activity in the light phase and impaired cognitive function in the novel object recognition and fear conditioning tests (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">14a–g</xref>). In the open-field test, although the locomotion of WT and <italic>POGZ</italic><sup>WT/Q1038R</sup> mice was indistinguishable in quantity, <italic>POGZ</italic><sup>WT/Q1038R</sup> mice spent more time in the center zone than their WT littermates did (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a, b</xref>).

In the self-grooming test, <italic>POGZ</italic><sup>WT/Q1038R</sup> mice spent more time in repetitive self-grooming than their WT littermates did, suggesting aberrant repetitive behavior (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). These data collectively suggest that adult <italic>POGZ</italic><sup>WT/Q1038R</sup> mice show behavioral abnormalities associated with NDDs, including ASD.

Finally, we assessed the communication ability of <italic>POGZ</italic><sup>WT/Q1038R</sup> pups at postnatal day 4 (P4) by measuring isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalization (USV) responses emitted by mouse pups separated from their mothers.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par18">Analyzing functional mutations in individual putative causative genes for ASD is important for gaining mechanistic and pharmacological insights into ASD. Recent genetic and epidemiological studies suggest that the compromising of POGZ function by de novo mutations is likely to be involved in ASD; however, the contribution of de novo <italic>POGZ</italic> mutations to ASD onset remains largely unclear. In silico prediction shows that 17 out of 19 missense mutations identified in unaffected controls as well as 6 out of 7 NDD-related missense mutations are suggested to be damaging by at least one out of four predictive tools, namely, PROVEAN, SIFT, PolyPhen2, MutationTaster, CADD score, and The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>); in silico prediction of the pathogenicity of missense mutations is thus challenging and biologically assessing the pathogenicity of de novo mutations is important for understanding the etiology of ASD. Here, we assessed the pathogenicity of de novo <italic>POGZ</italic> missense mutations in vitro and in vivo and showed that the ASD-related de novo mutants, but not the control de novo mutants identified in unaffected controls, disrupt the nuclear localization of POGZ and embryonic cortical development. We also developed a new mouse model carrying a de novo <italic>POGZ</italic> mutation identified in an ASD patient. In addition to the model mouse, we established iPSC lines from the ASD patient with de novo-mutated POGZ. By comprehensively examining these human and mouse materials, we provide the first in vivo evidence suggesting that ASD-associated de novo mutations in a high-confidence ASD gene cause a wide range of

Importantly, we determined that the neuronal developmental gene expression, including <italic>Jag2</italic>, is suggested to be directly regulated by POGZ (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>).

<p id="Par20">We determined that the ASD-associated de novo mutations of POGZ decreased the nuclear localization of the POGZ protein, impairing its function and compromising cortical excitatory neuron development (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e–h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>). Post-mortem studies have found that developmental abnormalities associated with neuronal migration can occur in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>; several ASD-associated gene products, such as CHD8, RELN, CNTNAP2, AUTS2, WDFY3, and TBR1, are differentially involved in excitatory neuron development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.

During development, decreased number of excitatory neurons may induce a compensatory increase in the activity of excitatory neurons in the adult brain. Given that POGZ is expressed at high levels in the embryonic brain both in humans (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hbatlas.org/hbtd/images/wholeBrain/POGZ.pdf">http://hbatlas.org/hbtd/images/wholeBrain/POGZ.pdf</ext-link>

<p id="Par22">Consistent with the finding that the activity of excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex was increased, the social deficits were rescued by administration of NBQX, a selective AMPA receptor antagonist in <italic>POGZ</italic><sup>WT/Q1038R</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16b</xref>).

<p id="Par23">In summary, by comprehensively examining these human and mouse materials, we biologically demonstrated POGZ-mediated regulation of transcriptional networks controlling neuronal differentiation and the damaging effects of de novo POGZ mutations identified in ASD patients.

On day 2, in order to quantify contextual freezing, each mouse was placed back in box A for 6 min of measurement. On day 3, each mouse was placed in a white transparent chamber (Box B) for 120 s, and then the 30 s tone was presented four times at 90 s intervals. Freezing during the first 120 s was measured as pre-tone freezing, and freezing during the tone presentations was measured as cued freezing.</p>
<p id="Par55">Novel object recognition test: Prior to each session, mice were acclimatized to the test room for at least 30 min. After 10 min of habituation to the experimental box under dim lighting conditions (10–20 lx) for 3 consecutive days, the test mouse was allowed to freely explore two novel objects (A and B) in the box for 10 min. Twenty-four hours after the training session, the retention session was conducted. In the retention session, object B was replaced with novel object C, and the mouse was allowed to move freely for 10 min in the same box. The exploration time for each object was measured.
