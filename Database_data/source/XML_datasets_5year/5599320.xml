<p id="P1">Disruption of the laminar and columnar organization of the brain is implicated in several psychiatric disorders. Here, we show <italic>in utero</italic> gain-of-function of the psychiatric risk gene transcription factor 4 (TCF4) severely disrupts the columnar organization of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in a transcription- and activity-dependent manner. This morphological phenotype was rescued by co-expression of TCF4 plus calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner and by dampening neuronal excitability through co-expression of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir2.1). For the first time, we show that NMDA receptor-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are instructive to minicolumn organization because Crispr/Cas9-mediated mutation of NMDA receptors rescued TCF4-dependent morphological phenotypes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transcriptional regulation by the psychiatric risk gene TCF4 enhances NMDA receptor-dependent early network oscillations. Our novel findings indicate that TCF4-dependent transcription directs the proper formation of prefrontal cortical minicolumns by regulating the expression of genes involved in early spontaneous neuronal activity, and thus our results provides insights into potential pathophysiological mechanisms of TCF4 associated psychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P2">Abnormal structural development of the cerebral cortex is implicated in a variety of psychiatric disorders including autism, dyslexia, epilepsy, Alzheimer disease, dementias, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. These structural defects due to abnormal neuronal migration and/or morphological development can range from subtle, almost undetectable changes in the inter-neuronal spacing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, to large heterotopias and even double cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Structural defects have profound effects on the development and function of cortical circuits and can result in an imbalance of excitation and inhibition that is thought to underlie epilepsy and aspects of autism spectrum disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate cortical development is critical to identifying pathophysiology associated with these psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p id="P3">The mammalian cortex features arrays of radially oriented neuronal modules termed cortical minicolumns that are proposed to represent the smallest functional module of the neocortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Minicolumns arise from pyramidal cell migration along radial glia fibers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and cells within a column are preferentially connected to each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Various aspects of radial migration are regulated by neuronal activity from a variety of sources including GABA, glutamate, and growth factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and the rate of neuronal migration is shown to be regulated by voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and NMDARs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, early neuronal activity is also critical for regulating the morphology of developing neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, neuronal excitability appears to guide the formation of the cortex at every step, from neurogenesis to neurite outgrowth, however a role for neuronal activity regulating minicolumn structure has not been described.</p>
<p id="P4">Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4; also known as E2-2, SEF2 or ITF2) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (TF) that is associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Autosomal dominant mutation or deletion of TCF4 results in Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) and 18q deletion syndrome, two rare autism spectrum disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms within introns of TCF4 are genome-wide significantly associated with schizophrenia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, and some of these common genetic variants are associated with cognitive deficits in both schizophrenia patients and unaffected control carriers of the associated alleles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The direction of altered TCF4 expression in the brains of those with schizophrenia is unclear, although TCF4 expression was shown to be elevated in fibroblasts from schizophrenia patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, duplication of TCF4 is described in a patient with developmental delay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and partial duplication is observed in a patient with major depressive disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. A familial chromosomal translocation that disrupts expression of some TCF4 transcripts results in overexpression of the remaining isoforms and mild intellectual disability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and other familial mutations, resulting in deletion of some, but not all, TCF4 isoforms, cause mild intellectual disability with individuals being less severely affected than those with PTHS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In addition, TCF4 expression is upregulated in 2q23.1 deletion syndrome suggesting a common pathway with other genetic autism spectrum disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Taken together, it is clear that both gain and loss of TCF4 function results in abnormal brain development and increased risk of psychiatric disease.</p>
<p id="P5">TCF4 forms homo- or heterodimers with itself or other bHLH TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and dimerization allows for recognition of E-box binding sites (motif: CANNTG). <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription by TCF4 is inhibited by calmodulin in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner and therefore TCF4 is potentially an activity-regulated TF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, however evidence for activity-dependent regulation has never been observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Expression of TCF4 is elevated during cortical development in rodents and humans, and while expression decreases after birth, TCF4 is expressed throughout the lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Disruption of TCF4 expression in postnatal cortical neurons is shown to decrease neuronal excitability and, in mouse olfactory bulb granule cells, it restricts neurite branching and synapse formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. To begin to understand the biology of TCF4 during cortical development, when its expression is peaking in the cortex, we explored what effect TCF4 gain and loss of function would have on cortical formation <italic>in vivo. In utero</italic> electroporation (IUE) was used to deliver TCF4 constructs just prior to neurogenesis in the developing rat prefrontal cortex. We report here that TCF4 gain of function results in abnormal distribution of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. We show this phenotype requires transcriptional regulation and is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated neuronal activity through NMDA receptors. In addition, we demonstrate that TCF4 gain of function transcriptionally enhances spontaneous neuronal activity, thus providing the first evidence that the distribution of pyramidal cells into cortical minicolumns is activity-dependent. We propose these biological functions of TCF4 are critical for proper cortical development and likely underlie aspects of pathophysiology in TCF4-associated psychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Animals and <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation</title>
<p id="P6">Pregnant Wistar rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. and maintained by SoBran on a 12-hour light cycle and fed <italic>ad libitum. In utero</italic> electroporation was performed as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Electroporation was performed on embryonic day 16 (E16). The uterine horn was exposed via laparotomy under sterile conditions, and plasmid DNA (1.5 μg/μl) was injected into a single ventricle with a glass micropipette (Drummond). The head of each embryo was stabilized and three electrode pulses were delivered to target plasmid DNA to either the mPFC or somatosensory cortex (SCx) as noted (65V, 100ms). Following electroporation, the uterine horn was replaced in the abdominal cavity and the embryos were allowed to develop as normal. Pregnant dams were returned to the same housing conditions after recovery from surgery, and animals were euthanized as embryos or at postnatal ages as indicated. All the procedures were in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Histological Analysis</title>
<p id="P7">For embryonic age points, rat dams were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub>, embryos rapidly removed and their brains submerged in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for approximately 36 hours prior to coronal sectioning (50 μm) with a vibratome (Microm, HM650V). Neonatal animals (P1) and juvenile animals (p18-p24) were transcardially perfused under deep anesthesia with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed 24 hours in the same fixative solution, prior to coronal sectioning (50 μm) with a vibratome (Microm, HM650V). For all experiments, both male and female animals were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Microscopy and Column Analysis</title>
<p id="P8">Photomicrographs were taken with a Zeiss 700 confocal microscope equipped with a 20X Plan-Apochromat 0.8 NA objective at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution at a scan speed of 7s or a Zeiss AxioImager 2 with Zeiss ApoTome2 module equipped with a 20X Plan-Apochromat 0.8 NA objective at 1-μm intervals. Acquisition parameters were consistent for all images. To control for inherent variability in transfection efficiency due to <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation, control animals were interwoven with experimental animals during surgeries, with multiple conditions in each dam. Due to the profound phenotype produced by TCF4 gain of function, the investigator was not blind to experimental condition. However, care was taken to minimize investigator bias by application of the following criteria: at least four images were obtained from each animal, and images were obtained only from matching coronal slices with uniform transfection through the entire cortical region of interest (mPFC or SCx). Additionally, multiple independent investigators performed image acquisition and analysis and consistent results were obtained. Images were reconstructed in ImageJ and analyzed for cellular distribution by generating small regions of interest perpendicular to the medial surface and calculating the pixel intensity within each bin. The coefficient of variance of these values was calculated, giving us a measure of cellular distribution, such that a high CV value is indicative of cellular aggregation while a low CV indicates an uniform distribution of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Plasmid constructs</title>
<p id="P9">Plasmid constructs were obtained and cloned into the pCAG-GFP vector <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> at the EcoRI and either NotI or BglII sites. Epitope tags, where indicated, were added at the N-terminus of the protein via PCR subcloning. Plasmids were kind gifts from the following: TCF4B, TCF4A, ΔAD2, R582P - Tonis Timmusk; CaM, CaM1,2,3,4 - John Adelman; Kir2.1, Kir2.1M pCAG-Kir2.1-T2A-tdTomato - Massimo Scanziani (Addgene plasmid # 60598, 60644); GCaMP6s - Douglas Kim (Addgene plasmid # 40753).</p>

<title>Co-immunoprecipitation</title>
<p id="P12">Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. HEK 293 cells were grown in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS to 60% confluence in 6-well plates, and transfected pCAG-CaM or pCAG-CaM(1,2,3,4), pCAG-myc-TCF4, and pCAG-eGFP using the Lipofectamine 3000 reagent. After 48 hours, cells were washed, harvested in NP40 lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 137mM NaCl, 1% NP40) supplemented with Halt Protease/Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, measure by Pierce BCA kit, and boiled in LDS/PAGE sample buffer. Protein A Dynabeads (Life Technologies) were prepared with anti-myc (AbCam, catalog number: ab9106) antibody per the manufacturers instructions. The bead-antibody complex was incubated with transfected cellular lysates overnight at 4°C on a rotating wheel. Washing and elution steps were followed per the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunoprecipitated protein (50μg) or input control protein lysates (50 μg) were resolved with Novex 4–12% gradient SDS/PAGE gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Life Technologies), probed with appropriate antibodies (1:1000 anti-Myc (Abcam), 1:1000 anti-Calmodulin (Millipore, catalog number: 05-173)) and analyzed using 1:20000 LI-COR IR dye conjugated secondary antibodies.</p>

Male and female neonatal (P0-4) or juvenile (p18–24) rats were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with ice-cold oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) dissecting buffer containing (in mM): 83 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 26.2 NaHCO3, 22 glucose, 72 sucrose, 0.5 CaCl2, and 3.3 MgCl2. The animal was decapitated and the brain was rapidly removed and immersed in ice-cold oxygenated dissection buffer. Coronal slices (300 μm) were cut using a vibratome (Microm HM650V), incubated in dissection buffer for 30–45 min at 34°C, and then stored at room temperature.</p>

<title>Calcium Imaging</title>
<p id="P14">Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and contained (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3 KCl, 25 dextrose, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.3, unless otherwise noted. Slices were visualized using a CCD camera (QICAM, QImaging), and layer 2/3 pyramidal cells were visualized with epifluorescent illumination and a 20x Olympus XLUMPlanFl (0.95 numerical aperture) objective. Images were acquired at a frame rate of 2 frames per second with a resolution of 1392x1040 pixels for a total of 5 minutes. Time-lapse videos were stabilized with a python script using the Lucas-Kanade optical flow provided by OpenCV (2.4.13) to detect and correct for drift. Regions of interest (ROI) for each cell were detected from the mCherry fluorescence image using an adaptive thresholding with a 40 pixel square window then segmented with a watershed algorithm to differentiate adjacent cell bodies all with the R package EBImage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, and regions with fewer than 500 pixels were dropped. The final list of ROIs was visually curated to discount false cells. Traces were taken from mean pixel intensities of each ROI over time, and normalized to the image background. Peaks were called from running max over 9 frame windows of the first derivative values above a 1.96 threshold. Peak regions lasting fewer than 5 frames were dropped as false peaks. The first and last 20 frames were drop to account for edge artifacts of the sliding window peak detection. The code used to process calcium imaging experiments is available by request from authors.</p>
<p id="P15">We modeled differential calcium activity across age and IUE transfection condition with the Poisson regression model: <italic>log</italic>(<italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic>) ~ <italic>α</italic> + <italic>βCond<sub>i</sub></italic> + <italic>γAge<sub>i</sub></italic> + <italic>ε<sub>i</sub></italic> where <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic> is the number of calcium transients of sample <italic>i</italic>, <italic>β</italic> is the log effect ratio of activity by IUE transfection, and <italic>γ</italic> is the log effect ratio of activity by age. Differential activity by transfection condition (<italic>β</italic> ≠ 0) can formally be tested by constructing moderated T-statistics and corresponding p-values. We modeled the ages of the animals linearly (1 df). This Poisson modeling approach represents the standard ANOVA framework, but calculates the effects of the outcome and age directly as log incidence rates.</p>
<p id="P16">For some experiments, DL-AP5 (100μM) was added to the ACSF to block NMDA receptors. Baseline images were collected under control conditions and the manipulation was added to the bath after 200 frames had passed. Calcium peaks were counted in first and last 200 frames to allow for diffusion. We analyzed calcium activity effect due to pharmacological manipulation in each IUE condition using the Poisson regression model with a random intercept to account for repeated measures from each slice prep. We subsequently analyzed difference in activity due to pharmacology between IUE conditions using a regular regression model accounting for the same repeated measures.</p>

Electroporation of TCF4B, a full-length isoform, revealed a striking alteration in the distribution of transfected cells, resulting in the formation of compact cellular aggregates that were not observed following transfection with GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,d</xref>). The formation of these cellular aggregates became apparent on postnatal day 1 (PND 1), a developmental time point when the majority of neurons have completed migration, and cellular aggregates were not evident during neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). Furthermore, we show that TCF4 loss-of-function using a previously validated shRNA construct (shTCF4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>) has no effect on pyramidal cell distribution when compared to a control shRNA construct (shCon, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b,e</xref>). These results indicate TCF4 gain of function, but not loss of function, significantly disrupts the distribution of pyramidal cells in the developing neocortex.</p>
<p id="P20">The mammalian neocortex is regionalized such that subdivisions are distinguished by differences in architecture, axonal connections and function. This regionalization results from molecular gradients of morphogen expression across the embryonic ventricles that instruct specific gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The ability of TCF4 to form homo- and heterodimers with itself and other bHLH TFs and its developmental and cell-specific expression patterns indicate the function of TCF4 is context-dependent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.

To determine if TCF4 regulates cellular distribution in a context-dependent manner we targeted TCF4 gain of function to specific ventricle surfaces that give rise to either the mPFC or somatosensory cortex (SCx). TCF4B gain of function directed at the SCx cortex had no effect on pyramidal cell distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c,f</xref>). This result indicates TCF4 regulation of cortical development is context-dependent, such that the mPFC appears to be sensitive to TCF4 gain of function while the SCx is insensitive. This locational specificity further indicates TCF4-dependent disruption of cellular distribution is not the result of non-specific effects due to excessive overexpression, but rather indicates TCF4 gain of function is specifically exploiting the genetic program of mPFC but not SCx during development.</p>

<title>Altered pyramidal cell distribution requires transcriptional activation by TCF4</title>
<p id="P21">All TCF4 isoforms express common 3′ exons, which contain the bHLH domain and an activation domain (AD2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>), that are essential for transcriptional regulation. To determine if regulation of pyramidal cell distribution by TCF4 requires transcription we first electroporated a PTHS patient-derived TCF4B construct that contains a point mutation in the bHLH domain (R582P) that renders TCF4 incapable of binding to DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Expression of R582P was ineffective at altering pyramidal cell distribution in the either the mPFC or SCx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). Consistent with this result, expression of a TCF4B construct that lacks the AD2 domain (ΔAD2), which deletes the protein interaction domain necessary for binding of mediators of transcriptional activation to TCF4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, also had no effect on pyramidal cell distribution in mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). Together, these data indicate transcriptional regulation by TCF4B is required to disrupt the distribution of pyramidal cells.</p>
<p id="P22">Previous work has demonstrated that <italic>in vitro</italic> co-expression of R582P with full-length TCF4 significantly inhibits transcription of a luciferase reporter construct, lending support for a dominant-negative model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

<p id="P23">The TCF4 gene is transcribed using numerous 5′ exon and results in a large diversity of TCF4 isoforms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.

TCF4A and TCF4H differ between each other by only a single 5′ exon that is unique to each isoform and both isoforms were previously shown to be localized to both the nucleus and cytosol of transfected HEK293 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. IUE of TCF4A, but not TCF4H, resulted in significant aggregation of pyramidal cells in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b,c</xref>) and this result indicates that a NLS signal is not required, but suggests the amino acids encoded by the unique 5′ exons between TCF4A and TCF4H must confer some functional differences. When expressed in the SCx, both TCF4A and TCF4H do not alter pyramidal cell distribution, suggesting that regional specificity is consistent among these isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that altered pyramidal cell distribution due to TCF4 gain of function requires transcriptional control in a regional- and isoform-specific manner.</p>

<p id="P24">Neuronal migration is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to regulate chemotaxis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and transcriptional control by TCF4 is regulated by calmodulin (CaM), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, such that <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription is inhibited upon binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to TCF4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.

In agreement with CaM inhibiting TCF4 function, we failed to induce pyramidal cell aggregation when CaM was co-expressed with TCF4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). Remarkably, a mutant version of CaM (CaM1,2,3,4), that contains a single point mutations in each of the four E-F hands and prevents Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, was ineffective at preventing TCF4B-dependent pyramidal cell aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a,b</xref>).

To rule out the possibility that mutations in CaM1,2,3,4 preclude protein interactions with TCF4B, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We coexpressed myc-TCF4B with either CaM or CaM1,2,3,4 and determined that both CaM and CaM1,2,3,4 are immunoprecipitated by an anti-myc antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). To determine if Ca<sup>2+</sup> was necessary for binding of CaM or CaM1,2,3,4 to TCF4B <italic>in vitro</italic>, we altered the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in our protein lysates and performed additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments.

To determine if neuronal activity is required for TCF4B-induced neuronal aggregation, we altered activity by expressing a recombinant inward rectifying potassium channel (Kir2.1).

IUE of either Kir2.1 or Kir2.1M alone had no effect on cellular distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a,b</xref>).

<title>TCF4-dependent disruption of pyramidal cell distribution requires NMDA receptor activity</title>
<p id="P26">Once migrating neurons reach the cortical plate, functional NMDA receptors are expressed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> and their activation coincides with cessation of neuronal migration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. In addition, NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents are known to regulate dendrite outgrowth, dendrite complexity, and synapse formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Given our prior result that expression of CaM can prevent TC4B-dependent disruption of pyramidal cell distribution in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, we hypothesize that NMDAR-mediated glutamatergic transmission may be a source of neuronal activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is required for regulating pyramidal cell distribution. To test this hypothesis, we suppressed NMDA receptor function using Crispr/Cas9 mutation.

Co-expression of TCF4B plus a Crispr/Cas9 vector that lacks a guide RNA (crEmpty) resulted in cellular aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c,d</xref>) and this phenotype was rescued by co-expressing TCF4B plus a Crispr/Cas9 that targets <italic>Grin1</italic> (cr<italic>Grin1</italic>).

<title>Does TCF4B respond inappropriately to endogenous neuronal activity or does TCF4B gain of function transcriptionally enhance neuronal activity?</title>
<p id="P27">We have shown that pyramidal cell distribution is sensitive to TCF4 gain of function and this effect requires TCF4B-dependent transcription and spontaneous neuronal activity. From these results we reasoned that there are two potential mechanisms for how pyramidal cell distribution is regulated by TCF4B during corticogenesis. One hypothesis is that elevated TCF4B protein levels are inappropriately responding to spontaneous early network activity and this leads to aberrant transcription of genes that regulate pyramidal cell distribution. In this case, we would expect to observe a similar amount of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients between TCF4B and control conditions. Alternatively, TCF4B gain of function could be directly increasing network activity through aberrant transcription of genes that regulate neuronal activity and pyramidal cell distribution. In this case, we should observe increased activity in TCF4B condition compared to control. To differentiate between these two cellular mechanisms we performed calcium imaging in acute slices prepared from neonatal (P0-4) animals that were IUE transfected with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). This developmental time window coincides with the first significant appearance of pyramidal cell aggregation phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). Remarkably, we observed that TCF4B gain of function significantly increased the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients compared to control cells expressing GCaMP6s + mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b, c</xref>). At this developmental stage in the cerebral cortex, network oscillations are known to be partially due to NMDA receptor activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. We thus asked if the calcium transients we observed were due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through NMDAR channels. Consistent with rescue of pyramidal cell aggregation by co-expression of TCF4B + cr<italic>Grin1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c,d</xref>), spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were significantly reduced in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist DL-AP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>), thus confirming previous observations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> that these early spontaneous network oscillations are partially NMDA receptor-dependent. Furthermore, we compared the level of DL-AP5 inhibition between the TCF4B and control condition and observed a greater magnitude of inhibition was produced in the TCF4B condition, suggesting that TCF4 gain of function leads to a greater amount of NMDA receptor activity. These experiments indicate that TCF4B-dependent transcription regulates the level of spontaneous neuronal activity in the developing neocortex and potentially enhances NMDA receptor function.</p>
<p id="P28">We previously showed that reduced expression of TCF4 in this population of neurons results in decreased intrinsic excitability in the form of enhanced spike frequency adaptation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Given that TCF4B gain of function increased the frequency of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in developing neurons we reasoned it might also increase intrinsic excitability in more mature cortical neurons. Therefore, we prepared acute slices and recorded from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons at p18–24 expressing either TCF4B and GFP or GFP alone (control). We observed an increase in intrinsic excitability, such that TCF4B neurons fired more action potentials than control cells in response to a given current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e, f</xref>) and this effect was likely due to the significant increase in membrane resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5g–i</xref>), which results in neurons that are more sensitive to electrical and/or synaptic input thereby increasing their intrinsic excitability.</p>
<p id="P29">Overall, these results suggest TCF4 regulates expression of genes associated with neuronal excitability as TCF4 gain of function produces a general increase in neuronal excitability as measured by spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and whole-cell electrophysiology. When considering these data together with our morphological rescue due to reduction of spontaneous neuronal activity by Kir2.1 expression or Crispr-mediate mutation of NMDA receptors it suggests that spontaneous neuronal activity appears to be critical to the distribution of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mPFC. Importantly, these results further indicate that the psychiatric risk gene TCF4 is an upstream regulator of gene expression and neuronal activity that appears to be instructive to the columnar organization of the prefrontal cortex.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P30">We provide a series of experiments that identify a cellular function of TCF4 during cortical development that has implications for TCF4-associated psychiatric risk. Using IUE, we manipulated the expression of TCF4 during its developmental peak in expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and observed that TCF4 gain of function, but not loss of function, resulted in profound defects in the distribution of principal cells of the mPFC. The cortical minicolumn is considered to be the smallest processing unit in the brain and defects in its structure are linked to several psychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, dyslexia and dementia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Our results suggest TCF4 plays a role in the formation of cortical minicolumns in the mPFC and we show that this function is sensitive to both neuronal activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, two critical signals that are necessary for cortical development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we show that TCF4B gain of function significantly enhances early spontaneous neuronal activity and this increased activity regulates the distribution of pyramidal cells in the mPFC. Therefore, we suggest TCF4 is an activity-dependent transcription factor that links instructional activity signals and transcriptional regulation.</p>
<p id="P31">TCF4 can form homodimers with itself or heterodimers with other bHLH TFs and this confers specificity to transcriptional regulation in a context-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. We provide evidence that TCF4 gain of function is context-dependent as we show specific TCF4 isoforms (TCF4A and TCF4B, but not TCF4H) severely disrupt the distribution of pyramidal cells in the mPFC but show no effect on the cellular distribution in the SCx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). These results indicate TCF4’s effect on pyramidal cell distribution is context-dependent. Furthermore, both the isoform specificity and the regionalized effect of TCF4 indicates cellular aggregation due to TCF4 does not result from a non-specific effect of TCF4 overexpression, because if this were the case we would expect to observe a similar phenotypes across the entire cortex and by overexpression of every TCF4 isoform.</p>
<p id="P32">Exactly how this isoform- and regional-specificity is occurring is not clear from our data and therefore will require further experimentation. TCF4A and TCF4H both lack a NLS and only differ by a unique 5′ exon that encodes for 23 amino acids. In transfected HEK293 cells, both isoforms are localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus and TCF4H was shown to be relatively more effective at <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription compared to TCF4A <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, it appears that the differential effect on pyramidal cell aggregation between TCF4A and TCF4H is related to their unique N-terminal amino acid sequences. As for regional-specificity, TCF4 is relatively equally expressed across the entire cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, and therefore differences in regional expression of TCF4 is not a likely explanation. In general, regional specification of the cortex is dependent on morphogenetic gradients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and one potential explanation could be that TCF4 gain of function is inappropriately tapping into a morphogenetic gradient that is specific to the frontal cortex. One example is <italic>Id2</italic> (Inhibitor of DNA binding 2), which is specifically expressed at high levels in layer 2/3 cell of the frontal cortex and is thought to regulate regionalization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. ID2 functions to inhibit bHLH transcription factors, including TCF4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, in a dominant-negative manner by forming heterodimers and thus preventing DNA binding. TCF4 gain of function in the frontal cortex could result in excess binding of TCF4 with ID2 and consequently alter downstream transcription that leads to increased neuronal excitability and pyramidal cell aggregation.</p>
<p id="P33">The observed defects in cellular distribution required transcriptional regulation by TCF4 are supported by three independent experiments. First, we show that a PTHS patient-specific point mutation in the bHLH domain (R582P), that prevents TCF4 interaction with DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and produces a functional dominant-negative protein <italic>in vivo</italic>, was ineffective at altering cellular distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Secondly, deletion of the AD2 domain (ΔAD2), which is necessary for recruitment of transcriptional machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, also was ineffective at producing cellular aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Lastly, we show that CaM, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein known to inhibit TCF4 transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, was capable of preventing cellular aggregation when co-expressed with TCF4B. Together, these results clearly indicated TCF4 gain of function in the mPFC produces pyramidal cell aggregation by directly binding to the genome and regulating transcription.</p>
<p id="P34">The ability of CaM to prevent TCF4-dependent cellular aggregation appears to be Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent as co-expression of TCF4B with a mutant CaM (CaM1,2,3,4) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> was ineffective at rescue. We were able to biochemically separate Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM from CaM binding to TCF4, as both CaM and the EF-hand mutant CaM1,2,3,4 were immunoprecipitated by recombinant myc-TCF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). This result indicates that <italic>in vitro</italic>, CaM and CaM1,2,3,4 can bind to TCF4B without Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but that prevention of cellular aggregation <italic>in vivo</italic> by CaM requires the ability of CaM to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The current model suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM complexes regulate bHLH transcription by preventing dimerization or blocking contacts between bHLH dimers and nucleotide sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that blockade of TCF4-dependent transcription by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM complexes may require Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of additional unknown proteins or that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to TCF4/CaM complexes leads to a specific conformational change that is necessary for inhibition of transcription. Further biochemical analysis will be necessary to understand the exact mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM effects on TCF4-dependent transcription, but in general, our results taken together clearly indicate TCF4 transcriptional activity is regulating pyramidal cell distribution in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner.</p>
<p id="P35">The Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM dependence of our TCF4 phenotype led us to investigate whether neuronal activity in the form of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was involved in abnormal pyramidal cell distribution due to TCF4B-dependent transcription. We showed that dampening neuronal excitability by expression of Kir2.1 resulted in rescue of cellular aggregation. Previously, Kir2.1 expression was shown to hyperpolarize pyramidal neurons and reduce dendritic elaboration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. To further validate a causal role for neuronal activity converging on TCF4 gain of function to disrupt pyramidal cell distribution, we suppressed NMDA receptor function by expressing a Crispr/Cas9 construct that specifically targets <italic>Grin1,</italic> which encodes for GluN1, a constitutive subunit of NMDA receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref> 59</sup>. Consistent with a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to regulate TCF4 transcription, cr<italic>Grin1</italic> was effective at rescuing TCF4-dependent cellular aggregation. This effect was specific to glutamate transmission through NMDA receptors because Crispr/Cas9 mutation of <italic>Gria2</italic>, which encodes GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors, had no effect on TCF4B dependent aggregation of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). We predict these two molecular manipulations produce rescue by reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Expression of Kir2.1 will hyperpolarize the membrane and reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels while also favoring Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of NMDA receptors and cr<italic>Grin1</italic> will directly inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through NMDA receptors. Together, these experiments are the first to show that a convergence of TCF4 transcription and neuronal activity is regulating the distribution of pyramidal neurons, which is critically important for the proper formation of prefrontal circuitry.</p>
<p id="P36">The dosage of TCF4 expression appears to regulate the excitability of prefrontal neurons and suggests TCF4 may be an activity-dependent transcription factor. We previously reported that suppression of TCF4 decreases intrinsic excitability through direct transcriptional regulation of two ion channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and here we show TCF4 gain of function increases the frequency of early network oscillations and increases intrinsic excitability in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore it appears that TCF4B gain of function may directly regulate NMDA receptor activity because the NMDA receptor antagonist DL-AP5 lead to a greater amount of activity blockade in the TCF4B condition compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Together these results indicate TCF4 expression appears to be positively correlated with the level of neuronal activity and because TCF4 can be directly regulated by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein CaM, we speculate that it is a bone fide activity-dependent transcription factor that can both sense neuronal activity and modify neuronal activity through transcription.</p>
<p id="P37">Although TCF4 dosage is correlated well with neuronal activity we didn’t observe a perfect correlation with TCF4 expression and its effect on pyramidal cell distribution, as shRNA knockdown of TCF4 did not appear to alter pyramidal cell distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We think this lack of correlation likely reflects our inability to quantify widening of cortical minicolumns, as there is no known morphological marker of the boundary of each cortical minicolumn. Furthermore, the exact mechanism for how TCF4 gain of function leads to pyramidal cell aggregation is not completely understood. Our data clearly indicates that TCF4-dependent transcription leads to increased neuronal activity and that a convergence of TCF4-dependent transcription and neuronal activity is necessary to produce the phenotype, but exactly what genes are being regulated by TCF4 during this developmental time period is not fully understood. Our results suggest one potential candidate is <italic>Grin1</italic> and the NMDA receptors that are encoded by this gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), but clearly many other genes associated with other biological functions such as neurite motility, migration, cell adhesion, microtubule and actin biology are all likely involved. A candidate gene approach and validation by phenotype rescue can begin to decipher the underlying molecular mechanism for this TCF4-dependent phenotype.</p>
<p id="P38">TCF4 is a pleiotropic gene and has clinical association with many psychiatric disorders. For some of these disorders, such as PTHS, a clear deficit in TCF4 function is causal. However, examples exist where increased TCF4 expression is associated with psychiatric risk. For instance, duplication of TCF4 and increased expression of other specific TCF4 isoforms are associated with intellectual disability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, TCF4 expression is enhanced in the fibroblasts of patients diagnosed with Schizophrenia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Endogenous TCF4 expression is elevated during corticogenesis, suggesting that it plays an important role in regulating cortical development. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, both increase and decrease in gene expression of the <italic>TCF4</italic> homolog <italic>Daughterless</italic> affects the morphology of postmitotic neurons and synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, and similar morphological changes were observed when expression levels of TCF4 were altered in mature mouse olfactory bulb neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We previously showed that TCF4 regulates intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the mPFC by altering the expression of two ion channels in the central nervous system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and together with the results shown here, we suggest TCF4 is strongly associated with transcriptional regulation of neuronal activity and morphology during all phases of development. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the dosage of TCF4 is critical to proper neurodevelopment and understanding its effects in models of both deficiency and gain of function are relevant to gaining insights into etiology of psychiatric disorders. The convergence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and TCF4-dependent transcription implies TCF4 likely regulates a variety of cellular functions including neuronal and circuit development, and synaptic plasticity, all of which are critical to building the brain and implicated as pathophysiological in psychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>TCF4 gain-of-function results in abnormal columnar organization in the medial prefrontal cortex</title>
<p>TCF4 was expressed in the developing cortex via <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation. Brains of the resultant pups were fixed at p21 and imaged using confocal microscopy. TCF4 overexpression (<bold>A, A1</bold>) resulted in abnormal distribution of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) when compared to GFP controls (<bold>A2</bold>). Knockdown of TCF4 expression by shTCF4 did not alter neuronal distribution (<bold>B, B2</bold>) compared to shCon (<bold>B2</bold>). This morphological phenotype was specific to the mPFC because no cellular distribution defects were observed when TCF4B was expressed in somatosensory cortex (SCx; <bold>C, C1, C2</bold>). The distribution of cells was quantified by binning pixel intensity perpendicular to the surface and calculating the coefficient of variance (CV) across all bins, therefore a high CV value indicates a more clustered distribution. <bold>D)</bold> Expression of TCF4B resulted in a significant increase in the CV when compared to GFP-only controls in the mPFC (GFP n=4 0.30±0.036 vs. TCF4B n=5 0.57±0.036; p&lt;0.01). <bold>E.</bold> TCF4 loss-of-function by shRNA does not significantly alter pyramidal neuron distribution in mPFC (shCon n=4 0.29±0.035; shTCF4 n=5 0.34±0.012; p=0.18). <bold>F.</bold> In SCx, coefficient of variance is unchanged between GFP control and TCF4B (GFP n=5 0.295±0.014 vs. TCF4B n=4 0.27±0.017; p=0.18).

A disease-causing point mutant, R582P, does not alter pyramidal cell distribution. Co-expression of TCF4B + R582P rescues TCF4B-dependent formation of abnormal minicolumn structures. Expression of TCF4B that lacks an AD2 (ΔAD2) does not disrupt pyramidal cell distribution. Abnormal column formation is not observed when the TCF4H isoform is overexpressed.
