 ### Step3: Go through the cells of Jupyter Notebook 'Autism_genepheno_step3.ipynb'.
 
In the third step, we can extract one certain gene’s information using this script. 

 ##### The dir of the input file and output file is shown in the second cell of the script.

```
#============================================================================================
# input dir
json_path = './Autism_genepheno_results/Extraced_results'             # the output file of step1
np_dir = './Autism_genepheno_results/Sum_all/n_p.txt'                 # the output file of step1
ng_dir = './Autism_genepheno_results/Sum_all/n_g.txt'                 # the output file of step1
In_Summary_dir='./Autism_genepheno_results/Sum_all/In_Summary.txt'    # the output file of step1
NPMI_dir='./Autism_genepheno_results/NPMI_file/NPMI.json'             # the output file of step2

# output dir
one_information_dir = './Autism_genepheno_results/one_gene_information/'
#============================================================================================
```

The certain gene is defined in the third cell of the script.

```
# define the extracted gene
gene_extract = "SHANK3"
```

When finished, you will get:
```
Autism_genepheno_results
|-one_gene_information
    |-xxx_information.json
    |-xxx_summary.txt
```


In the ‘xxx_information.json’ file, the information of a certain gene is given. The format should be as follows:
